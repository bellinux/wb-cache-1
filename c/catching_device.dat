40|$|Bibliography: leaves 92 - 96. The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate mist interception by Mountain Fynbos under non-rainfall conditions. Quantitative measurements and qualitative observations of plant-drip and stem-flow from selected plant species were recorded at five experimental sites on the Back Table of Table Mountain, Cape Province. Plant-drip and stem-flow <b>catching</b> <b>devices</b> were designed and installed in order to collect the moisture intercepted by plants. The results indicated that mist interception by the vegetation was influenced by wind speed, density of mist and by the morphological characteristics of the plants. Greater interception occurred when dense mist was accompanied by high wind speeds. The interception ability was found to increase with plant size. Interception efficiency depended on the leaf morphology of the plants. Narrow-sclerophylls (e. g. Psoralea pinnata) were found to be more effective in intercepting mist droplets than broad-clerophylls (e. g. Leucadendron salignum). The portioning of intercepted water into plant-drip and stem-flow was largely influenced by the shape of the plant. The mean rate of water yield per plant observed during five periods of rainfree, misty conditions, was 71 ml hr- 1. Rainfall is, therefore, not the sole source of moisture contributing to the water balance. The additional moisture intercepted by vegetation should, therefore, be taken into consideration in studies of water balance and hydrology...|$|R

50|$|Broadcast 17 October 1990, {{the next}} {{instalment}} {{is devoted to}} the ways in which animals gather their sustenance. Attenborough begins in the South American rainforest, where the proliferation of animal and plant life does not necessarily make it easy to find food. Some leaves are poisonous, and so those that eat them have to be careful. Other plants use food (or nectar) as a bribe to get their pollen transported, and several species of hummingbird have developed exclusive relationships with certain of them. Fruit is also on offer, again as a means of reproduction, and creatures such as squirrel monkeys eat little else. Meanwhile, parrots and macaws take kaolin as an antidote to their diet of toxic seeds. Attenborough witnesses a 60,000 strong flock of knot and dunlin suddenly take advantage of a low tide to feed on tiny mud-dwelling molluscs. Barracuda hunt small fish, and drive shoals of them into bays to be eaten by pelicans, which are besieged by gulls that attempt to steal their catches. One species of gecko is able to differentiate between worker termites and the more dangerous soldiers. The web of the orb spider is hailed as one of the most elegant food <b>catching</b> <b>devices,</b> and the methods of two others, nephila and its kleptoparasite visitor, argyrodes, are explored in detail. Finally, tropicbirds, their crops full with food en route back to their nests, are ambushed in mid-air by a group of frigatebirds, whose aim is to make them surrender their cargo.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the hammer}} is pulled {{backwards}} the internal spring compresses, exerting exponential pressure against the hammer's continued backwards motion. As the hammer and spring mechanism reaches {{the far end}} of its backwards range of travel, it is caught and locked in place by a metal <b>catching</b> <b>device</b> known as the sear. The sear holds the hammer in place, allowing the kinetic energy of the bolt's forward motion to be released whenever the sear is depressed. As the trigger is pulled, the sear becomes depressed and allows the hammer to be propelled forward by the spring. The hammer collides with the valve releasing gas from the external pressurized tank into the internal bolt chamber. The ensuing burst of gas channels out {{the front end of the}} bolt, propelling the paintball down the barrel. The rest of the gas pushes backwards on the hammer, pushing both it and the bolt backwards until the mechanism is once again caught on the sear. Once caught, the hammer is ready to repeat the blowback process. In cases where the pressure from the storage vessel drops under the minimum required to complete the action's cycle, the marker may [...] "runaway" [...] firing rapidly without additional trigger pulls required.|$|E

40|$|Smart {{devices have}} unique {{security}} challenges and {{are becoming increasingly}} common. They {{have been used in}} the past to launch cyber attacks such as the Mirai attack. This work is focused on solving the threats posed to and by smart devices inside a network. The size of the problem is quantified; the initial compromise is prevented where possible, and compromised devices are identified. To gain insight into the size of the problem, campus Domain Name System (DNS) measurements were taken that allow for wireless traffic to be separated from wired traffic. Two-thirds of the DNS traffic measured came from wireless hosts, implying that mobile devices are playing a bigger role in networks. Also, port scans and service discovery protocols were used to identify Internet of Things (IoT) devices on the campus network and follow-up work was done to assess the state of the IoT devices. Motivated by these findings, three solutions were developed. To handle the scenario when compromised mobile devices are connected to the network, a new strategy for steppingstone detection was developed with both an application layer and a transport layer solution. The proposed solution is effective even when the mobile device cellular connection is used. Also, malicious or vulnerable applications make it through the mobile app store vetting process. A user space tool was developed that identifies apps contacting malicious domains in real time and collects data for research purposes. Malicious app behavior can then be identified on the user?s <b>device,</b> <b>catching</b> malicious apps that were overlooked by software vetting.

40|$|In 1899 a {{contribution}} {{which has been}} largely ignored to date by historians and authors specialising {{in the field of}} fishery appeared in the Mitteilungen aus dem Gebiete des Seewesens (reports on maritime affairs) : “Fischerei im Adriatischen Meere mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der österreichisch-ungarischen Küsten” (Fishery in the Adriatic Sea with Special Regard to the Austro- Hungarian Coasts). In a publication amply furnished with illustrations, the Austrian fishery biologist Anton Krisch provides a highly detailed account of the various methods of drag-net fishing with the bragozzo. Remarkably, the progressive catching technique used in trawl-net fishing in the Baltic Sea was also employed on traditional vessels in the Adriatic. In both cases, a sack-like <b>catching</b> <b>device</b> was pulled across {{the bottom of the sea}} by a sailing vessel drifting broadside to the wind. In order to achieve the largest possible span from one end of this net to the other, both the bragozzi and the zeesenboats were extended in length by means of beams protruding from the bow and the stern. This catching method was practised on the Adriatic as well as the Baltic Sea until the mid twentieth century. The trawl nets were referred to by the German fishermen as “Zeese” and by their Italian counterparts as “tartana” and “grippo. ” Because of the fact that the name “tartane” is generally used by maritime historians to refer to a historical Mediterranean ship type, the authors of literature on zeesenboats failed to take notice of the term. A monograph entitled Il Bragozzo, written by the Italian maritime historian Mario Marzari, appeared in 1982. This work contains an authentic description of the fishing method under consideration. The article on hand provides an interesting new perspective on the history of fishery in Europe...|$|E
40|$|Time {{series of}} {{scientific}} survey estimates of fisheries resources {{are used to}} measure changes in stock size and composition. Standardization of sampling equipment and design is regarded crucial for reliable trawl and acoustic survey estimates, {{but in spite of}} established routines the reliability of the survey estimates are reduced due to variations in fish behavior and changes in their spatial distribution. The main objectives of this thesis are to investigate the effects of spatial and temporal variation in fish distribution and behavior on acoustic and bottom trawl estimates, and the study presents methods to identify and correct for these sources of errors. A large variety of data are examined ranging from acoustic recordings from the spawning grounds of blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and Norwegian Spring Spawning herring (Clupea harengus) to bottom trawl survey data and commercial CPUE of Namibian hake (Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus) and the results are presented in six scientific papers. We show that blue whiting is distributed deeper and covers a narrower depth range at daytime than at night during its spawning west of the British Isles. As a consequence the tilt angle distribution changes and reduces the average acoustic target strength of the measured fish. This explains why we observed higher acoustic densities of blue whiting at daytime than at night. The effect of the diel variation on the survey estimates varies between years and therefore reduces the reliability of the survey time series (Paper I). Not surprisingly we observed that the diel oscillation in the sample values is closely related to rise and set for the sun. However, time-dependent variation in the catch rates and echo density also occur within daylight and the density measures increase from dawn to noon and then subsequently decrease to dusk (Papers I and IV). For the catch rates of Namibian hakes we found that the maximum is reached when the sun is about 20 degrees above the horizon, but the amplitude of the diel oscillation decreases with depth and increases with density of hake. Highest amplitude values are found in shallow waters which are dominated by the M. capensis species (Paper IV). The effect of weather and environmental conditions on the diel variation is not investigated in our studies due to lack of adequate data, but a in situ experiments we carried out in Namibia indicates a between-year difference in the escapement of hake under the fishing line due to annual differences in the oxygen levels near the seabed (Paper III). This type of escapement is likely to change with time of the day as hake lifts from the bottom at night and may also explain some of the differences in the diel oscillation we found in the different areas of the Namibian waters. It is often stressed that the assessment surveys should be repeated at the same time each year, as many fish stocks move in more or less repeating geographical migration patterns. However, the substantial geographical dynamic we identified in the Namibian trawler fleet (Paper V) suggests substantial annual variation in the spatial distribution of the hakes and changes in survey estimates may therefore be a sampling artifact due to variable environmental conditions and location of fish. Fish populations are usually patchily distributed and show gradient structures and the individuals within a shoal or a limited area tend to have more similar characteristics than those of the entire population. An example of small scale patchiness is found in the herring trawl samples with a significant relationship between depth distribution and maturity state of herring where the spawners dominated the trawl catches taken close to the sea-bed (Paper II). In Paper VI, the precision of the abundance estimates by length group of Namibian hake is increased by including the information of spatial autocorrelation. Using geo-statistic, the geographical structure of the distribution can be model and thus enhance the quality of the survey estimates. The overall result shows that the catch rates and acoustic density of fish are influenced by the fish’s location and its response to the approaching trawl which vary with time of the day. The swimming performance and reaction pattern to <b>catching</b> <b>device</b> are also affected by the density of fish, species and length dependent behavior, bottom depth, level of dissolved oxygen and temperatures. All these parameters can be included in the generic term “survey condition”, and any change in the survey condition tend to influence the relationship between measured and true fish density. The survey errors investigated in this thesis are not included in standard estimation procedures, and obviously it is a difficult task to correct for errors caused by variation in the survey condition. We have applied statistical modeling to identify systematic spatial and diel variability in large survey and commercial fishing data-sets, which can be used to correct for these errors. However, diel variation and geo-statistical models depend on the correct estimation of several parameters, which negatively affect the precision of the survey estimates. Therefore, a better approach is to integrate several sampling methodologies so the effect of variable survey conditions can be directly measured. Many places on the globe are also on the doorstep to a complex ecosystem management approach which demands scientific surveillance of several species and trophic levels. A simultaneous monitoring of inter-specific interaction is a fundament of this types of surveys and requires advanced survey strategies where many sources of data collected with trawls, CTD probes, echo-sounders, transducers and sonars are integrated and together form the basis for the concurrent measurement of the environment, survey condition and fish densities. Furthermore, the allocation of survey effort are occasionally sub-optimize due to variation in the spatial structure of the target stock between surveys. An adaptive sampling strategy which utilizes for instance satellite tracking data of the commercial fishing fleet to map the stock distribution in advance of the surveys may improve the effort allocation and hence increase the reliability of the survey estimates...|$|E
