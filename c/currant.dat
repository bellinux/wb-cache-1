5|$|First {{appearing}} in Dead 'Ard and Warrior, The Black <b>Currant</b> returned {{in a series}} of White Dwarf Thrud strips titled Thrud the Destroyer. In this story, The Black <b>Currant</b> is the leader of a horde of warriors who attack a small village, looting the homes, burning the women, raping the livestock and eating the babies. The Black <b>Currant</b> returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow's self-published Thrud the Barbarian comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town. The Black <b>Currant</b> is depicted in heavy black armour, wearing a helmet provided with a pair of exceedingly long, horizontally extending horns.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{were once}} {{popular in the}} United States as well, but became less common in the 20th century after <b>currant</b> farming was banned in the early 1900s, when blackcurrants, as a vector of white pine blister rust, were {{considered}} {{a threat to the}} U.S. logging industry. The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to jurisdiction of individual states in 1966, and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn. As a result, <b>currant</b> growing is making a comeback in New York, Vermont, Connecticut and Oregon. However, several statewide bans still exist including Maine, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Since the American federal ban curtailed <b>currant</b> production nationally for nearly a century, the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States, and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in Europe or New Zealand. Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols, dietary fibre and essential nutrients, awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing, with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market.|$|E
5|$|In Thrud the Destroyer, To-Me Ku-Pa is {{revealed}} {{as being in}} service to The Black <b>Currant</b> and is providing him with an army of warriors drawn from throughout time, including daleks and Imperial stormtroopers. To-Me Ku-Pa also appears as the villain in issue 1 of the full-length Thrud the Barbarian comic.|$|E

40|$|Red <b>currants</b> (Ribes rubrum L.), black <b>currants</b> (Ribes nigrum L.), red {{and green}} {{gooseberries}} (Ribes uva-crispa) were evaluated for the total phenolics, antioxidant capacity based on 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay and functionality such as in vitro inhibition of alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) relevant for potential management of hyperglycemia and hypertension. The total phenolics content ranged from 3. 2 (green gooseberries) to 13. 5 (black <b>currants)</b> mg/g fruit fresh weight. No correlation was found between total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The major phenolic compounds were quercetin derivatives (black <b>currants</b> and green gooseberries) and chlorogenic acid (red <b>currants</b> and red gooseberries). Red <b>currants</b> had the highest alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase and ACE inhibitory activities. Therefore red <b>currants</b> could be good dietary sources with potential antidiabetes and antihypertension functionality to compliment overall dietary management of early stages of type 2 diabetes.

40|$|This diploma´s thesis {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of total antioxidant activity of red and white gooseberries and red, white and black <b>currants.</b> There are available information about small fruits, an overview of natural and synthetic antioxidants and {{a summary of the}} methods to determine the total antioxidant activity in the theoretical part. Frozen fruit samples were provided by Research and Breeding Institute of Pomology Holovousy Ltd. in the project QI 111 A 141 – Research of new technologies in the cultivation of gooseberries and <b>currants</b> with a focus on quality and use of fetuses (Ministry of Agriculture). The total antioxidant activity of red and white gooseberries and <b>currants</b> was measured by spectrophotometric methods using free radicals ABTS•+ and DPPH and was expressed as a Trolox equivalent. The total antioxidant activity of black <b>currants</b> was measured by electron paramagnetic resonance using free radicals ABTS•+ and DPPH and expressed as a TEACABTS and a TEACDPPH. There were measured 8 species of red gooseberries, 6 species of white gooseberries, 12 species of red <b>currants,</b> 6 species of white <b>currants</b> and 8 species of black <b>currants</b> in this thesis. The highest values of total antioxidant activity showed species of red and white gooseberries Alan, Karmen, Pax and Invicta and species of red and white <b>currants</b> Rovada, Orion and Olin. Among black <b>currants,</b> species Ometa and Ruben had the highest values of total antioxidant activity...|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} of Thrud {{was created by}} the then 18-year-old Critchlow in 1981 while he was at foundation art college. His graphic design tutor, Bryan Talbot, gave him the project of producing a comic strip. At the time, Critchlow was reading the Conan books by Robert E. Howard, and this inspired him to produce Thrud. The initial five-page strip was published in comics fanzine Arken Sword. When Critchlow moved on to art college in Liverpool, Thrud made a further appearance in the comic Dead 'Ard, which Critchlow co-authored with artist Euan Smith. Dead 'Ard also featured a strip titled The Black <b>Currant,</b> subsequently re-published in the 26th and final issue of the Warrior comic anthology. The Black <b>Currant</b> would later appear as one of Thrud's many enemies.|$|E
5|$|American {{gooseberry}} mildew and {{powdery mildew}} can infect {{the leaves and}} shoot tips, and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season. <b>Currant</b> and gooseberry leaf spot (Drepanopeziza ribis) is another disease of blackcurrants, {{but it is not}} usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, raisin exports {{were the}} most {{important}} export of the islands during the Venetian rule. By the early 18th century Zante, Cephalonia, and part of Ithaca had become a major centre of the <b>currant</b> trade. Because of the fierce competition in the raisin trade between Venice and the United Kingdom, Venice prohibited the free export of raisins from the islands. Another measure was the , a heavy export tax for foreign ships.|$|E
25|$|Today native wild <b>currants</b> are {{relatively}} rare plants in New England, and planting wild <b>currants</b> or wild gooseberries is strongly discouraged, or even illegal in some jurisdictions. As an alternative, new strains of commercial <b>currants</b> {{have been developed}} which are highly resistant to white pine blister rust. Mortality in white pines from rust is only about 3% today.|$|R
50|$|The {{cultivar}} 'White Grape' {{has gained}} the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. There are also cultivars with yellow and pink fruit, called respectively yellow <b>currants</b> and pink <b>currants.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bar-le-duc jelly (...) is {{a highly}} {{regarded}} preparation of jelly originally composed of select whole seeded <b>currants,</b> typically white <b>currants</b> or alternatively red <b>currants.</b> The name Bar-le-duc refers to the geographical origin of the preparation in the French town of Bar-le-duc. Since the jelly's first documented reference in 1344, the culinary name [...] "Lorraine Jelly" [...] is occasionally used, as the city of Bar-le-duc lies {{within the boundaries of}} the former province of Lorraine.|$|R
5|$|Croneman {{claims to}} be the mightiest barbarian of the {{northern}} tribes and honorary chief of the savage bezerkers of Nid. Known also as Amoron, the Wombat, he is a slayer, a reaver, a corsair, a usurper, and a conqueror. Depicted as resembling Schwarzenegger, he is also a bodybuilder with a very silly accent. On first meeting Croneman, Thrud slices him in half with a sword. When Croneman returns to join a group of mercenaries fighting The Black <b>Currant</b> in Thrud the Destroyer, he is depicted with a line of sutures running down the middle of his face and chest.|$|E
5|$|Game hunting was a {{familiar}} beneficial skill to the colonists when they immigrated to the New World. Most northern colonists depended upon hunting, whether they hunted themselves or purchased game from others. As a method of obtaining protein for consumption, hunting was preferred over animal husbandry as domestic animals were expensive and more work was required to defend domestic animals against natural predators, Native Americans, or the French. Commonly hunted game included deer, bear, buffalo, and turkey. The larger parts of the animals were roasted and served with <b>currant</b> and other sauces, while smaller portions went into soups, stews, sausages, pies, and pasties.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the <b>currant</b> borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E
5000|$|Zante <b>currants,</b> Corinth raisins, or Corinthian raisins, {{also called}} simply <b>currants,</b> are dried berries of the small, sweet, {{seedless}} grape cultivar ''''Black Corinth'''' (Vitis vinifera). The {{name comes from}} the Anglo-French phrase [...] "raisins de Corinthe" [...] (grapes of Corinth) and the Ionian island of Zakynthos (Zante), which was once the major producer and exporter. It {{is not related to}} black, red or white <b>currants,</b> which are berries of shrubs in the Ribes genus and not usually prepared in dried form.|$|R

50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the village was renowned for its Black Corinth grapes, which are dried into Zante <b>currants.</b> The <b>currants</b> from Panariti were {{introduced}} to California in 1901 by botanist David Fairchild, and are still grown in California, Arizona and Nevada.|$|R
25|$|A <b>currant</b> is a dried Zante Black Corinth grape, {{the name}} being a {{corruption}} of the French raisin de Corinthe (Corinth grape). <b>Currant</b> has also come {{to refer to the}} blackcurrant and redcurrant, two berries unrelated to grapes.|$|E

40|$|The genus Ribes L., {{known as}} <b>currants</b> and gooseberries, {{contains}} more than 150 diverse species indigenous throughout the northern hemisphere and along the Rocky Mountain, Sierra Nevada and Sierra Madres in North America through mountain ranges of Central America to the Andes in South America. Beginning in the 1400 s, four main crop types, black <b>currants</b> (Ribes, subgenus: Ribes, section: Botrycarpum), red and white <b>currants</b> (Ribes, subgenus: Ribes, section: Ribes) and gooseberries (Ribes, subgenus: Grossularia) were domesticated from European species. American and Eurasian species were selected and combined into the germplasm base of European and American breeding programmes in the 1900 s. Black <b>currants</b> (R. nigrum and hybrids) are a major economic crop in many European countries but are minor in North America, although they can be produced successfully in the northern states and southern portion of the Canadian provinces. Ribes plants can be hosts for white pine blister rust, caused by Cronartium ribicola. This disease was introduced from Asia through Europe into North America ca. 1900. Restrictions were imposed on <b>currants</b> and gooseberries in the United State...|$|R

25|$|Mortality {{from white}} pine blister rust in mature pine groves was often 50–80% {{during the early}} 20th century. The fungus must spend part of its life cycle on {{alternate}} hosts of the Ribes genus, the native gooseberry or wild <b>currant.</b> Foresters proposed that if all the alternate host plants were removed that {{white pine blister rust}} might be eliminated. A very determined campaign was mounted and all land owners in commercial pine growing regions were encouraged to uproot and kill all native gooseberry and wild <b>currant</b> plants. The ramifications for wildlife and habitat ecology were of less concern at the time than timber industry protection.|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{plants such}} as maidenhair ferns, wild rhododendrons, and vanilla leaf are {{abundant}} in the area. Wildflowers such as Columbia lilies, trilliums, and bleeding hearts grow in the spring. <b>Currant,</b> elderberries, blackberries, thimbleberries, huckleberries, and salmonberries {{are some of the}} many berries that grow on the mountain.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the white}} grapes, Chardonnay {{is the most}} common. Another grape found in the region, Aligoté, tends to produce cheaper wines which are higher in acidity. Aligoté from Burgundy is the wine {{traditionally}} used for the Kir drink, where it is mixed with black <b>currant</b> liqueur. Sauvignon blanc is also grown in the Saint Bris appellation. Chablis, Mâcon wines and the Côte d'Or whites are mostly produced from 100% Chardonnay grapes.|$|E

25|$|Wines {{made from}} Sangiovese tend to exhibit the grape's {{naturally}} high acidity {{as well as}} moderate to high tannin content and light color. Blending can have a pronounced effect on enhancing or tempering the wine's quality. The dominant nature of Cabernet can sometimes have a disproportionate influence on the wine, even overwhelming Sangiovese character with black cherry, black <b>currant,</b> mulberry and plum fruit. Even percentages as low as 4 to 5% of Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm the Sangiovese if the fruit quality is not high. As the wine ages, some of these Cabernet dominant flavours can soften and reveal more Sangiovese character.|$|E
25|$|The Salmon Falls Creek {{watershed}} {{varies widely}} {{in terms of}} different habitats. Along the lower section of the creek, plentiful water flow and numerous springs create a rich riparian environment compared to an oasis, lined with coyote willow, dogwood, golden <b>currant,</b> cattail, mint and poison ivy. The upper section is a slow-moving waterway that supports a small wetland and extensive meadows. In contrast, {{the vast majority of}} the upper undeveloped watershed is a shrub-steppe sagebrush grassland, much of which is used for grazing. Many bird species use the Salmon Falls Creek canyon, including white-throated swift, canyon and rock wrens, cliff swallow, violet-green swallow, barn swallow, screech owl, long-eared owl, great horned owl, kestrel, red-tailed hawk, golden eagles and prairie falcon. Mule deer also inhabit areas of the middle and upper Salmon Falls Creek basin.|$|E
