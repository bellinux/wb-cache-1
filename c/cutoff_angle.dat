Both precise positioning and the derivation of atmospheric parameters can benefit from multi-GNSS observations. In this contribution, extensive evaluations are conducted with multi-GNSS datasets collected from 134 globally-distributed ground stations of the International GNSS Service (IGS) Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) network in July 2016. The datasets are processed in six different constellation combinations, i. e., GPS-, GLONASS-, BDS-only, GPS + GLONASS, GPS + BDS, and GPS + GLONASS + BDS + Galileo precise point positioning (PPP). Tropospheric gradients are estimated with eight different temporal resolutions, from 1 h to 24 h, to investigate the impact of estimating high-resolution gradients on position estimates. The standard deviation (STD) is used as an indicator of positioning repeatability. The results show that estimating tropospheric gradients with high temporal resolution can achieve better positioning performance than the traditional strategy in which tropospheric gradients are estimated on a daily basis. Moreover, the impact of estimating tropospheric gradients with different temporal resolutions at various elevation <b>cutoff</b> <b>angles</b> (from 3 ° to 20 °) is investigated.

During a 43 -month period, the iliac wing angle was prospectively measured in 695 fetuses at genetic ultrasonography performed before amniocentesis. The iliac wing angle measurements were performed in a true axial section of the fetal pelvis and the relative position of the fetal spine was recorded (decubitus, lateral). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratio (LR) were computed for multiple cutoff angles. The prevalence of trisomy 21 was 1. 4 %; 447 fetuses were in lateral position, 240 fetuses were in decubitus position, including, respectively, 2 and 8 fetuses with trisomy 21 (8 fetuses with other chromosomal anomalies were excluded). In euploid fetuses, the mean iliac wing angle was 83. 7 ° in decubitus and 68. 7 ° in lateral position; in fetuses with trisomy 21 the respective mean angles were 104. 9 ° and 102. 5 °.

We used the Jet Propulsion Laboratory final products (known as flinnR) for the precise ephemerides and clock information of the GNSS satellites. We used the absolute antenna calibration table provided by the International GNSS Service to correct the phase center variations of ground stations and GNSS satellites. Carrier phase ambiguities were resolved using the single-receiver ambiguity resolution technique (Bertiger et al. 2010). We estimated the daily station coordinates and the wet zenith tropospheric delay (WZTD) and its gradient at all processing epochs (every 30  s), under the assumption of a random walk stochastic model with an assumed process noise (5.0 [*]×[*] 10 − 8  km s- 1 / 2 for WZTD and 5.0 [*]×[*] 10 − 9  km s- 1 / 2 for its gradient). We used the GPT 2 model (Lagler et al. 2013) as a mapping function for the tropospheric parameter estimation. We also applied a second-order ionosphere correction (Kedar et al. 2003) deduced from the total electron content {{information provided by the}} International GNSS Service as IONEX files. Finally, we calculated the PPR of the ionosphere-free linear combination (LC) between each station and the GNSS satellites, for every 30  s, based on the estimated daily coordinate value for each station. To avoid disturbance of the PPR by multipaths for satellites with low elevation angles, we defined an elevation <b>cutoff</b> <b>angle</b> of 5 ° as part of the processing.

Thus, sidereal filtering is useful for increasing the SNR of the PPR time series. However, to simplify the interpretation of the PPR time series, we did not apply sidereal filtering to the PPR time series in this study.|$|E

We tested this hypothesis by placing microwave absorbing material between the antenna and the pillar in a number of configurations and analyzed the changes in apparent position of the antenna. The results indicate that (1) the horizontal surface of the pillar is indeed the main reflector, (2) both the concrete and the metal plate embedded in the pillar are significant reflectors, and (3) the reflection can be reduced to a great degree by the use of microwave absorbing materials.

In this research presented here, the approach for the production of zenith wet delays from GPS observations is demonstrated. Slant wet delays are recovered for each epoch to all satellites in view assuming that the atmosphere is inhomogeneous. The RMS errors in slant wet delay recovery are found to be about 2 - 3 cm, through validation of wet delays estimates compared with water vapor radiometer (WVR) “truth ” data. Experiments are conducted to determine the optimal processing parameters for estimation of tropospheric delay parameters such as elevation <b>cutoff</b> <b>angle,</b> batch processing interval, and baseline length...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{results from}} a global {{positioning}} system (GPS) experiment carried out in Brittany, France, in October 1999, aimed at measuring crustal displacements caused by ocean loading and quantifying their effects on GPS-derived tropospheric delay estimates, are presented. The loading effect in the vertical and horizontal position time series is identified, however with significant disagreement in amplitude compared to ocean loading model predictions. It is shown that these amplitude misfits result from spatial tropospheric heterogeneities not accounted for in the data processing. The effect of ocean loading on GPS-derived zenith total delay (ZTD) estimates is investigated and a scaling factor of 4. 4 between ZTD and station height for a 10 ° elevation <b>cutoff</b> <b>angle</b> is found (i. e. a 4. 4 -cm station height error would map into a 1 -cm ZTD error). Consequently, unmodeled ocean loading effects map into significant errors in ZTD estimates and ocean loading modeling must be properly implemented when estimating ZTD parameters from GPS data for meteorological applications. Ocean loading effects must be known with an accuracy of better than 3 cm {{in order to meet}} the accuracy requirements of meteorological and climatological applications of GPS-derived precipitable water vapor...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} first direct hard (25 [...] 60 keV) X-ray imaging {{observation}} of the Crab Nebula that resolves structure to approximately 0. 25 pc. The observation was performed over a 1. 4 hour period during a balloon flight from Ft. Sumner, NM, on 2007 May 27. The source was detected in the energy band above the atmospheric cutoff at approx. 25 keV and below the mirror graze <b>angle</b> <b>cutoff</b> at approx. 60 keV. The image shows elongation about 25 degrees E of N in the direction along {{the plane of the}} torus (and perpendicular to the jet axis) with a slight surface-brightness enhancement NE of the pulsar. The spectrum within a 1. 7 arcminute radius region centered on the Crab pulsar can be fitted with a Gamma= 2 power law absorbed by an atmospheric column consistent with the balloon altitude at the time of observation...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of gently inclined faults with large stratigraphic separation {{has long been}} enigmatic in the corridor of southeastern Idaho. Recent interpretations have culled examples from across the Basin and Range to suggest that these faults originated at a low dip and represent a regional scale low-angle normal fault system. In contrast, others cite extensive studies from fault mechanics and seismological data that cast doubt on whether these extensional structures could have formed at low inclination in the upper crust. This dissertation reviews the evidence and timing of the proposed Bannock detachment system in the Bannock Range of southeastern Idaho and puts forth a re-evaluation of the styles of extension {{in the region and}} a regional framework in which to place them. Chapter 1 re-evaluates gently dipping normal faults in the southern Bannock Range of southeastern Idaho that have previously been interpreted as evidence for a regional detachment system originating and slipping at a low inclination. Previous work was based on geometrical relations between faults and bedding in lacustrine sediments of the upper Miocene to lower Pliocene Salt Lake Formation. The detachment argument was underpinned by three locations on the Oxford Mountain at which Salt Lake Formation was inferred to have been cut by low-angle normal faults. These locations have been re-evaluated. Two of the locations were found to preserve bedding-to-fault geometries that are well explained by offset from a fault of moderately dipping inclination. The third example is re-interpreted as an unconformable contact, not a fault, an observation that by itself precludes the existence of a detachment at that location. Chapter 2 presents a test of tephronchronology by the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar isotopic method. This study compares ages obtained by the geochronologic method of tephrochronology to ages obtained by 40 Ar/ 39 Ar single grain laser fusion of feldspars. The {{results of this study suggest}} certain considerations must be made when employing the method of tephrochronology for chronological work. Chapter 3 presents a regional synthesis for the tectonics of southeastern Idaho expanding on the new data presented in chapters 1 and 2. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages obtained from the Salt Lake Formation show evidence that extension in this region was underway > 15 Ma. Bedding-to-fault <b>cutoff</b> <b>angles</b> for the low-angle faults with the largest stratigraphic separations in the region suggest that the now gently inclined normal faults developed with moderate to steep dips, then tilted to lower inclination during continued extension. A splay of the Paris thrust is interpreted to account for both geometric relations between Paleozoic age rocks and the Neoproterozoic Pocatello Formation, as well as an unconformable contact between Pocatello Formation and late Miocene to Pliocene lake deposits of the Salt Lake Formation. This dissertation focuses on one example of a detachment system. However, it has implications for low-angle faults in general – particularly in regions like the Basin and Range that have had a protracted deformation history. The examples we have studied are important because they involve strata as young as Pliocene and they provide strong support for the role of tilting in accounting for the present-day attitude of large-offset normal faults, eliminating the need for the well-known mechanical paradox of low-angle normal fault formation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Phase angle {{measured}} by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) {{may be a}} marker of health state. OBJECTIVE This historical cohort study of prospectively collected BIA measurements aims to investigate the link between phase angle and mortality in older people and evaluate whether a phase <b>angle</b> <b>cutoff</b> can be defined. DESIGN We included all adults aged ≥ 65 years who underwent a BIA measurement by the Nutriguard(®) device at the Geneva University Hospitals. We retrieved retrospectively the phase angle and comorbidities at the last BIA measurement and mortality until December 2012. We calculated phase angle standardized for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI), using reference values determined with the same brand of BIA device. Sex-specific and standardized phase angle were categorized into quartiles. The association of mortality with sex-specific or standardized phase angle was evaluated through univariate and multivariate Cox regression models, Kaplan-Meier curves, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS We included 1307 (38...|$|R
