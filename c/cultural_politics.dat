5|$|In the mid-twentieth century, {{there were}} {{divisions}} in the Melbourne art scene, which became intertwined with the complex <b>cultural</b> <b>politics</b> of the Cold War era. In the late 1940s, there was a move against modernism in art, and tonalism came into favour. Partly {{as a reaction to}} this development, artist George Bell established an exhibiting group called the Melbourne Contemporary Artists in 1940. Bell was a former war artist and influential member of the Victorian artistic establishment, who after World War II was appointed to teach at the National Gallery of Victoria's painting school. Influenced by Bell, Stokes was among the artists for whom modernism was a strong influence, and who exhibited with the Melbourne Contemporary Artists. Other members of the group included Russell Drysdale and Sali Herman.|$|E

25|$|The Beaux-Arts style heavily {{influenced}} {{the architecture of}} the United States in the period from 1880 to 1920. In contrast, many European architects of the period 1860–1914 outside France gravitated away from Beaux-Arts and towards their own national academic centers. Owing to the <b>cultural</b> <b>politics</b> of the late 19th century, British architects of Imperial classicism followed a somewhat more independent course, a development culminating in Sir Edwin Lutyens's New Delhi government buildings.|$|E
25|$|In {{analyzing}} nationalist {{successes in}} early 20th century Romania (<b>Cultural</b> <b>Politics</b> in Greater Romania), Irina Livezeanu {{builds on the}} theories of American social anthropologist Ernest Gellner, specifically on his definition of nationalism {{as a product of}} industrial society and the emphasis he places on academics having promoted and imposed nationalist theses. She applied Gellner's ideas and concepts to a particular case, that of the predominantly rural Romanian society, and, in this context, linked them to the conclusions of Liah Greenfeld. According to Greenfeld and Livezeanu, although nationalism was generated by economic and social development in England, it grew independently from that point on, and was equally able to impose itself in less underdeveloped regions.|$|E

[...] The 2008 book Tamil Cinema: The <b>Cultural</b> <b>Politics</b> of India's Other Film Industry by Selvaraj Velayutham and Aesthetic Formations by Birgit Meyer stipulate that the nationalistic songs featured in the film {{had nothing to do}} with the main plot, while Randor Guy states during that period, [...] "Historical accuracy wasn't as important as the music.

500|$|Scholars {{have noted}} that the Klingons, not humans, {{are the ones who}} quote Shakespeare; Gorkon claims {{at one point in the}} film that [...] "You have not {{experienced}} Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon." [...] Translating Shakespeare into Klingon proved problematic because Marc Okrand had not created a verb for [...] "to be" [...] when he developed the language. Shakespeare scholar Paul A. Cantor argues that this association is appropriate—the warlike Klingons find their literary matches in the characters Othello, Mark Antony, and Macbeth—but that it also reinforces a claim that the end of the Cold War means the end of heroic literature such as Shakespeare's. Meyer said the idea for having the Klingons claim Shakespeare as their own was based on Nazi Germany's attempt to claim the Bard as German before World War II. According to Kay Smith, the use of Shakespeare has meaning in itself and also derives new meaning (underscoring <b>cultural</b> <b>politics</b> in the film) by its rearticulation in a new form.|$|E

When black artists cross over into pop success they cease to be black in the industry sense of the word. They get promoted from racialized black music to universal pop music in an economically driven process of racial transcendence." [...] Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge (2000) documented that Jackson, along with other prominent African-American women, had achieved financial breakthroughs in mainstream popular music, receiving [...] "superstar status" [...] in the process. She, alongside her contemporaries [...] "offered viable creative, intellectual, and business paths for establishing and maintaining agency, lyrical potency, marketing and ownership." [...] Her business savvy has been compared to that of Madonna, gaining a level of autonomy which enables [...] "creative latitude and access to financial resources and mass-market distribution." [...] A model of reinvention, author Jessie Carney Smith wrote that [...] "Janet has continued to test the limits of her transformative power", receiving accolades in music, film and concert tours throughout the course of her career.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, Senegal saw the {{emergence}} of new representations of migration and success. These contrast with earlier representations of success, notably the “myth of the intellectual”, and focus on individual effort as expressed by the “bul faale ” movement in the late 1990 s. This article describes these new representations and shows how they are taken up by two strands of cultural production, namely rap and theatre. Finally, the article discusses how cultural production is linked to politics.
