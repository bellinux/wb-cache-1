40|$|The lethal {{doses of}} <b>convallatoxin</b> in cats and guinea pigs were {{determined}} by the injection method. 1) The lethal dose of <b>convallatoxin</b> in cats was in accordance with data obtained by European scholars using Hatcher-Magnus infusion method. In guinea pigs, however, the results obtained by the injection method did not coincide with that as reported by European scholars using Knaffl-Lenz infusion method. The discrepancy is suggested {{to be caused by}} the difference in strains of guinea pig. 2) When the liver was blockaded from the portal circulation, the lethal dose of <b>convallatoxin</b> decreased markedly. The lethal dose decreased with the increase of the excluded portion of the liver. It is therefore surmised that the lethal dose of <b>convallatoxin</b> is considerably affected by the alteration of circulation in liver...|$|E
40|$|Digitalis-like {{compounds}} (DLCs), such as digoxin and digitoxin {{that are}} derived from digitalis species, are currently used to treat heart failure and atrial fibrillation, but have a narrow therapeutic index. Drug-drug interactions at the transporter level are frequent causes of DLCs toxicity. P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB 1) is the primary transporter of digoxin and its inhibitors influence pharmacokinetics and disposition of digoxin in the human body; however, the involvement of P-gp in the disposition of other DLCs is currently unknown. In present study, the transport of fourteen DLCs by human P-gp was studied using membrane vesicles originating from human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells overexpressing P-gp. DLCs were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The Lily of the Valley toxin, <b>convallatoxin,</b> {{was identified as a}} P-gp substrate (Km: 1. 1 +/- 0. 2 mM) in the vesicular assay. Transport of <b>convallatoxin</b> by P-gp was confirmed in rat in vivo, in which co-administration with the P-gp inhibitor elacridar, resulted in increased concentrations in brain and kidney cortex. To address the interaction of <b>convallatoxin</b> with P-gp on a molecular level, the effect of nine alanine mutations was compared with the substrate N-methyl quinidine (NMQ). Phe 343 appeared to be more important for transport of NMQ than <b>convallatoxin,</b> while Val 982 was particularly relevant for <b>convallatoxin</b> transport. We identified <b>convallatoxin</b> as a new P-gp substrate and recognized Val 982 as an important amino acid involved in its transport. These results contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the interaction of DLCs with P-gp...|$|E
40|$|A {{definite}} dose of digitoxin, g-strophanthin or <b>convallatoxin</b> was injected {{every five}} minutes into vein of cat till heart standstill occurred. Cholinesterase activity was determined by manometric techniques on serial samples of cat serum obtained every ten minutes. Digitoxin produced an acceleration of cholinesterase activity in small doses and an inhibition in large doses. G-strophanthin and <b>convallatoxin</b> accelerated the cholinesterase activity parallel {{with the increase of}} doses administered, without producing an inhibition of cholinesterase until heart standstill occurred. It is, therefore, concluded that digitoxin exerts a differnt effect on serum cholinesterase as compared to g-strophanthin or <b>convallatoxin.</b> But, it is unknown whether the effect of cardiac glycosides on nonspecific serum cholinesterase is related with the heart action or not...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac glycosides are plant-derived {{molecules}} that have shown antiproliferative properties against cancer cells, though {{the mechanism of}} action is not completely understood. We show that one cardiac glycoside, <b>convallatoxin,</b> presents antiproliferative effects against colorectal cancer cells in culture and that the resulting cell death is independent of the p 53 tumor suppressor. Our data suggest that <b>convallatoxin</b> {{may be useful in}} the treatment of cancers that harbor inactivating mutations in the p 53 signaling pathway...|$|E
40|$|A {{definite}} dose of digitoxin, g-strophanthin, <b>convallatoxin</b> or lanatoside C was {{injected into}} vein of cats successively {{every five minutes}} until heart standstill occurred. Sodium, potassium and calcium in tissues obtained form heart muscles, liver and skeletal muscles were measured by flame photometry. The results led to the following conclusions :- 1) In heart muscles, sodium increased markedly and potassium showed a tendency to decrease by digitoxin, g-strophanthin or <b>convallatoxin,</b> {{with the exception of}} lanatoside C which produced a marked increase in sodium and potassium concentrations. 2) In liver, sodium concentration was decreased by digitoxin, g-strophanthin, <b>convallatoxin</b> and lanatoside C, while an increase in potassium concentration was produced by the glycosides other than g-strophanthin. 3) In skeletal muscles, the glycosides such as digitoxin, g-strophanthin and <b>convallatoxin</b> produced an increase in sodium concentration and a decrease in potassium concentration. But a reversed correlation was observed in lanatoside C. 4) Discussions led to the conclusions that the changes in electrolytes in heart and skeletal muscles are associated with changes in electrolytes in the liver and that the liver plays a special role in the change in sodium metabolism produced by the cardiac glycosides...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the cardiac action of <b>convallatoxin,</b> a {{definite}} quantity of <b>convallatoxin</b> was injected intravenously and the resulting elctrocardiogram was traced at five minute intervals until the heart was brought to a standstill. Electrocardiographic changes which commenced to appear when approximately 10 - 20 LD were administered, imcreased in intensity {{with the increase of}} doses of <b>convallatoxin.</b> Typical changes in ECG were, a prolongation of PQ intervals and a depression of T waves as well as a downward displacement of ST segment. RR intervals were prolonged and QT constant decreased in a slight degree. After more than 60 % LD were injected, the rate of increase of PQ intervals reached its maximum and an atrioventricular block followed. T waves disappeared completely at 40 - 60 % LD and in some cases appeared as biphasic. These changes in ECG do not differ from changes caused by digitoxin...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on effects of digitoxin, g-strophanthin and <b>convallatoxin</b> on specific cholinesterase with manometric techniques, by using cat erythrocytes. It was demonstrated that the three glycosides in small doses accelerate the activity of specific cholinesterase, but inhibit it {{in the cases of}} large doses. And it was observed that digitoxin produces a slower and slighter degree of action on cholinesterase, as compared to g-strophanthin and <b>convallatoxin.</b> From these results, it is suggested that cardiac action of the glycosides is connected with the action on specific cholinesterase to a certain extent...|$|E

40|$|Digitalis-like {{compounds}} (DLCs), {{the ancient}} medication {{of heart failure}} and Na,K-ATPase inhibitors, are characterized by their toxicity. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) at absorption and excretion levels {{play a key role}} in their toxicity, hence, knowledge about the transporters involved might prevent these unwanted interactions. In the present study, the transport of fourteen DLCs with human P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB 1) was studied using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) quantification method. DLC transport by P-gp overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and immortalized human renal cells (ciPTEC) was compared to vesicular DLC transport. Previously, we identified <b>convallatoxin</b> as a substrate using membrane vesicles overexpressing P-gp; however, we could not measure transport of other DLCs in this assay (Gozalpour et al., 2014 a). Here, we showed that lipophilic digitoxin, digoxigenin, strophanthidin and proscillaridin A are P-gp substrates in cellular accumulation assays, whereas the less lipophilic <b>convallatoxin</b> was not. P-gp function in the cellular accumulation assays depends on the entrance of lipophilic compounds by passive diffusion, whereas the vesicular transport assay is more appropriate for hydrophilic substrates. In conclusion, we identified digitoxin, digoxigenin, strophanthidin and proscillaridin A as P-gp substrates using cellular accumulation assays and recognized lipophilicity as an important factor in selecting a suitable transport assay...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPalytoxin (PTX), {{a highly}} toxic and sugar-containing {{substance}} isolated from Palythoa tuberculosa, caused K+ release from rabbit red blood cells. Cardiac glycosides, such as ouabain, <b>convallatoxin,</b> cymarin, digoxin and digitoxin, inhibited the PTX-induced K+ release. Their corresponding aglycones did not inhibit the K+ release, but antagonized the inhibitory {{effect of the}} glycosides. All these cardiotonic steroids equally inhibited the activity of (Na+ + K+-ATPase prepared from hog cerebral cortex. These {{results suggest that the}} sugar moiety of the cardiac glycosides is important for the inhibitory effect on the K+ release induced by PTX and that the inhibition is not related to their inhibitory potency on the (Na+ + K+) -ATPase activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} cardiac glycosides on the {{function}} of kidneys was studied in the cat. Digitoxin produced a water diuresis without causing alterations in renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in most cases. Some cases indicated {{a slight increase in}} RPF as well as in GFR after injection of digitoxin. G-strophanthin produced the same changes in renal hemodynamics as induced by digitoxin. Thus, it was concluded that the diuresis produced by digitoxin and g-strophanthin is mainly due to a depression of tubular reabsorption, which is sometimes enhanced by an increase in RPF. <b>Convallatoxin</b> produced an increase in GFR which was brought about by an increase in RPF, hence involving a somewhat more marked diuresis than digitoxin and g-strophanthin...|$|E
40|$|Autophagy and {{apoptosis}} {{are important}} processes that control cellular homeostasis {{and have been}} highlighted as promising targets for novel cancer therapies. Here, we identified <b>convallatoxin</b> (CNT), isolated from Antiaris toxicaria, as a dual inducer of autophagy and apoptosis. CNT exerts cytotoxic effects {{on a number of}} cancer and normal cell lines and induces apoptosis by increasing caspase- 3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Moreover, dose- and time-dependent autophagic activity was detected in CNT-treated cells, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) /p 70 S 6 K signal pathway inhibition was observed. Notably, CNT inhibits human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) growth and exerts anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the naturally occurring compound, CNT, is a novel anti-angiogenic compound via dual inducing of autophagy and apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|Digitalis-like {{compounds}} (DLCs) such as digoxin, digitoxin, and ouabain, {{also known}} as cardiac glycosides, are among the oldest pharmacological treatments for heart failure. The compounds have a narrow therapeutic window, {{while at the same}} time, DLC pharmacokinetics is prone to drug-drug interactions at the transport level. Hepatic transporters organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1 B 1, OATP 1 B 3, and Na(+) -dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) influence the disposition of a variety of drugs by mediating their uptake from blood into hepatocytes. The interaction of digoxin, digitoxin, and ouabain with hepatic uptake transporters has been studied before. However, here, we systematically investigated a much wider range of structurally related DLCs for their capability to inhibit or to be transported by these transporters in order to better understand the relation between the activity and chemical structure of this compound type. We studied the uptake and inhibitory potency of a series of 14 structurally related DLCs in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing NTCP (CHO-NTCP) and human embryonic kidney cells expressing OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 3 (HEK-OATP 1 B 1 and HEK-OATP 1 B 3). The inhibitory effect of the DLCs was measured against taurocholic acid (TCA) uptake in CHO-NTCP cells and against uptake of beta-estradiol 17 -beta-d-glucuronide (E 217 betaG) in HEK-OATP 1 B 1 and HEK-OATP 1 B 3 cells. Proscillaridin A was the most effective inhibitor of NTCP-mediated TCA transport (IC 50 = 22 muM), whereas digitoxin and digitoxigenin were the most potent inhibitors of OATP 1 B 1 and OAPTP 1 B 3, with IC 50 values of 14. 2 and 36 muM, respectively. Additionally, we found that the sugar moiety and hydroxyl groups of the DLCs play different roles in their interaction with NTCP, OATP 1 B 1, and OATP 1 B 3. The sugar moiety decreases the inhibition of NTCP and OATP 1 B 3 transport activity, whereas it enhances the inhibitory potency against OATP 1 B 1. Moreover, the hydroxyl group at position 12 reinforces the inhibition of NTCP but decreases the inhibition of OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 3. To investigate whether DLCs can be translocated, we quantified their uptake in transporter-expressing cells by LC-MS. We demonstrated that <b>convallatoxin,</b> ouabain, dihydroouabain, and ouabagenin are substrates of OATP 1 B 3. No transport was observed for the other compounds in any of the studied transporters. In summary, this work provides a step toward an improved understanding of the interaction of DLCs with three major hepatic uptake transporters. Ultimately, this can be of use in the development of DLCs that are less prone to transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions...|$|E
