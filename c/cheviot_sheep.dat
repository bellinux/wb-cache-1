60|$|This was the New Place of Ellangowan, {{in which}} we left our hero, better amused perhaps than our readers, and to this Lewis Bertram retreated, full of {{projects}} for re-establishing the prosperity of his family. He took some land into his own hand, rented some from neighbouring proprietors, bought and sold Highland cattle and <b>Cheviot</b> <b>sheep,</b> rode to fairs and trysts, fought hard bargains, and held necessity at the staff's end {{as well as he}} might. But what he gained in purse he lost in honour, for such agricultural and commercial negotiations were very ill looked upon by his brother lairds, who minded nothing but cock-fighting, hunting, coursing, and horse-racing, with now and then the alternative of a desperate duel. The occupations which he followed encroached, in their opinion, upon the article of Ellangowan's gentry, and he found it necessary gradually to estrange himself from their society, and sink into what was then a very ambiguous character, a gentleman farmer. In the midst of his schemes death claimed his tribute, and the scanty remains of a large property descended upon Godfrey Bertram, the present possessor, his only son.|$|E

50|$|The {{highest bidder}} was John Knight of Lea Castle, Wolverley, Worcestershire, whose bid was £50,122.

Knight set about converting the Royal Forest, covering land now within the Exmoor National Park, into a huge industrial mining complex with canals and railways together with an agricultural estate. He had previously bought and reclaimed uncultivated land in Worcestershire and used similar techniques including burning rough grass, applying lime to change the pH, and ploughing to increase the productivity of the land.

However, by the twentieth century, the long horns and dual purpose nature of the Welsh Black made it less popular, with farm specialisation meaning that the breed was substituted for specialised beef or milk breeds. Instead, Hereford (cattle) became popular for beef production while Friesian cattle became popular for milk production.

40|$|The {{incubation}} period of scrapie in sheep {{is controlled by}} the Sip gene which has two alleles (sA and pA). Following experimental challenge with SSBP/ 1 scrapie, a short {{incubation period}} is conferred by the partially dominant sA allele. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the scrapie-associated fibril protein (PrP) gene are associated with the Sip alleles. By sequencing the protein coding region of the PrP gene in <b>Cheviot</b> <b>sheep</b> selected for differing Sip genotypes, we have found four PrP protein variants which differ at three positions: amino acid 112 (Ala/Val), amino acid 130 (Arg/His) and amino acid 147 (Arg/Gln).
