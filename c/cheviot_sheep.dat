60|$|This was the New Place of Ellangowan, {{in which}} we left our hero, better amused perhaps than our readers, and to this Lewis Bertram retreated, full of {{projects}} for re-establishing the prosperity of his family. He took some land into his own hand, rented some from neighbouring proprietors, bought and sold Highland cattle and <b>Cheviot</b> <b>sheep,</b> rode to fairs and trysts, fought hard bargains, and held necessity at the staff's end {{as well as he}} might. But what he gained in purse he lost in honour, for such agricultural and commercial negotiations were very ill looked upon by his brother lairds, who minded nothing but cock-fighting, hunting, coursing, and horse-racing, with now and then the alternative of a desperate duel. The occupations which he followed encroached, in their opinion, upon the article of Ellangowan's gentry, and he found it necessary gradually to estrange himself from their society, and sink into what was then a very ambiguous character, a gentleman farmer. In the midst of his schemes death claimed his tribute, and the scanty remains of a large property descended upon Godfrey Bertram, the present possessor, his only son.|$|E

40|$|The {{incubation}} period of scrapie in sheep {{is controlled by}} the Sip gene which has two alleles (sA and pA). Following experimental challenge with SSBP/ 1 scrapie, a short {{incubation period}} is conferred by the partially dominant sA allele. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the scrapie-associated fibril protein (PrP) gene are associated with the Sip alleles.
