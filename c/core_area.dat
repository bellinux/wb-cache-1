5|$|The corn crake winters {{mainly in}} Africa, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and central Tanzania south to eastern South Africa. North of this area, it is mainly seen on migration, but {{occasionally}} winters in North Africa {{and to the}} west and north of its <b>core</b> <b>area</b> in southeast Africa. Most of the South African population of about 2,000 birds occurs in KwaZulu-Natal and the former Transvaal Province, and numbers elsewhere in Africa are uncertain. There are several nineteenth-century records, when populations were much higher than now, of birds being seen in western Europe, mainly Britain and Ireland, between December and February.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} setting {{holds potential}} {{for renewable energy}} production from geothermal power. However, this conflicts with the national park's vocation of preserving the natural and cultural landscape. , pilot {{studies were carried out}} for two 5MW geothermal power plants, {{at the foot of the}} Piton des neiges and on the , on which a project had already been considered and later abandoned. Both sites fall in the aire d'adhésion outside the park's <b>core</b> <b>area,</b> but proposals have also been made for sites within the World Heritage Site boundary.|$|E
5|$|During {{the crisis}} of the Utah War in 1857, Brigham Young {{recalled}} Mormon colonists from the western areas of the proposed State of Deseret to the <b>core</b> <b>area</b> of Mormon settlement south of the Great Salt Lake. Alexander heeded the call, leaving his wife and son in Western Utah. With Alexander gone, Bowers and Robert left the abandoned settlement of Franktown for a small mining camp called Johntown in Gold Canyon near present-day Virginia City, Nevada. Bowers opened a boardinghouse and began taking care of the miners. When the threat of war passed, Alexander returned to Western Utah and settled in Johntown, but he did not wish to pursue the life of a Washoe miner. In the fall of 1858 he returned to Salt Lake City where he remained a prominent member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Bowers and Robert remained in Johntown.|$|E

5|$|Ocute was {{a sizable}} {{paramount}} chiefdom, a political organization in which multiple chiefdoms are subsumed under one political order. The <b>core</b> <b>area</b> comprised three chiefdoms {{located in the}} Oconee River valley in the Georgia Piedmont: Ocute, Altamaha, and Cofaqui. Each included a main town and mounds along with various associated settlements, with the chief of Ocute being paramount. Charles M. Hudson and his colleagues locate the main town of Ocute at the Shoulderbone mound site, northwest of Sparta, Georgia. Subsequent archaeological research has weakened this identification, as the site's population had declined by the mid-16th century, but it remains the best fit of the currently known sites. Altamaha was located downstream to the south at the Shinholser site. Cofaqui was to the north, evidently at the Dyar site near Greensboro. Ocute spoke a language later known as Yamasee, apparently a Muskogean tongue {{that may have been}} similar to Hitchiti.|$|E
5|$|An earlier {{administrative}} and political {{function of the}} area was {{to serve as a}} <b>core</b> <b>area</b> for one of the three provincial things that together elected the king of Denmark. The first Danish administrative sub-divisioning occurred as part of the centralization process, when the area became divided into administrative units called hundreds (herreder in Danish). The hundreds were possibly based on older, already existing units, but the establishment of the new form of hundreds was prompted by an increase in royal power during the High Middle Ages. These differed from the provincial thing areas in that they were not local communities joined under a governing assembly but top-down regional divisions established to ensure royal authority. These medieval Danish hundreds were used to implement military obligations and to expedite the collection of renders due to the king in the provinces. They were first established in Jutland, where they replaced previous administrative units called syssel. According to some scholars, they were introduced in Skåneland possibly as early as the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of {{organization}} were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities are individuals that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core groups, within the community. Core groups are individuals that shared the same <b>core</b> <b>area</b> within a community territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, {{ranging in size from}} two individuals to nine. Females within the groups are cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations of core groups in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.|$|E

25|$|Study and <b>Core</b> <b>Area</b> {{boundaries}} {{delineate the}} historical extents of a battlefield. POTNR boundaries delineate areas within the Study and Core Area(s) that still retain integrity and {{remain to be}} preserved. The Study and <b>Core</b> <b>Area</b> boundaries define the historic landscape of the battlefield while areas that retain integrity define the modern landscape. For example, if a particular farm field was important during the battle but now is covered by a housing development, {{it would still be}} included in a Core or Study Area boundary because the farm field informs the history of the battle. That same farm field, however, would not be considered for inclusion in an POTNR boundary because it no longer has integrity (i.e. conveys a sense of the historic scene) and there is nothing left of the original farm field to preserve.|$|E
