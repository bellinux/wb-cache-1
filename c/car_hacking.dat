25|$|There {{have been}} several {{projects}} aiming to develop a car {{on the principles of}} open design, an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared, often without monetary compensation. The projects include OScar, Riversimple (through 40fires.org) and c,mm,n. None of the projects have reached significant success in terms of developing a car as a whole both from hardware and software perspective and no mass production ready open-source based design have been introduced as of late 2009. Some <b>car</b> <b>hacking</b> through on-board diagnostics (OBD) has been done so far.|$|E

5000|$|In 2016, a PwC survey, in the United States, {{showing the}} opinion of 1,584 people, {{highlights}} that [...] "66 {{percent of respondents said}} they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver". People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the <b>car</b> <b>hacked.</b> Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars.|$|R
50|$|Clutched publishes daily {{content in}} the form of articles, videos, and features. Since its website launch in January 2016, Clutched has {{published}} nostalgic content, car reviews, guides, <b>car</b> <b>hacks,</b> think-pieces, news, and humorous entertainment articles. Popular formats utilized in their articles include lists, videos, memes and gifs. Usage of local slangs and laymen terms are common in the company’s published pieces such as “buy, don’t buy or I don’t know”. Its YouTube channel of the same name, is currently in its fourth season.|$|R
30|$|With {{the advent}} of the Internet of Everything, the {{possibility}} of malware taking control of ‘smart’ appliances such as television, air-conditioners, refrigerators, etc. will not be limited to theory. In fact, there have been recent reports of ‘smart’ refrigerators and <b>cars</b> being <b>hacked,</b> and wi-fi-enabled LED bulbs having security weaknesses [16]. As the creators of botnets continue to adopt innovative means in creating botnets, detection of stealthy botnets continues to be a challenging paradigm.|$|R

40|$|Modern {{vehicles}} {{may contain}} {{a considerable number}} of ECUs (Electronic Control Units) which are connected through various means of communication, with the CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol being the most widely used. However, several vulnerabilities such as the lack of authentication and the lack of data encryption have been pointed out by several authors, which ultimately render vehicles unsafe to their users and surroundings. Moreover, the lack of security in modern automobiles has been studied and analyzed by other researchers as well as several reports about modern <b>car</b> <b>hacking</b> have (already) been published. The contribution of this work aimed to analyze and test the level of security and how resilient is the CAN protocol by taking a BMW E 90 (3 -series) instrument cluster as a sample for a proof of concept study. This investigation was carried out by building and developing a rogue device using cheap commercially available components while being connected to the same CAN-Bus as a man in the middle device in order to send spoofed messages to the instrument cluster.

From thence he travelled, by Bianconi's car, as far as Tuam, and when there he went at once to the hotel, to get a <b>hack</b> <b>car</b> to take him home to Dunmore.|$|R
40|$|Algorithms {{are aimed}} at {{optimizing}} everything. They can save lives, make things easier and conquer chaos. Still, experts worry they can also put too much control {{in the hands of}} corporations and governments, perpetuate bias, create filter bubbles, cut choices, creativity and serendipity, and could result in greater unemployment. Algorithms are instructions for solving a problem or completing a task. Recipes are algorithms, as are math equations. Computer code is algorithmic. The internet runs on algorithms and all online searching is accomplished through them. Email knows where to go thanks to algorithms. Smartphone apps are nothing but algorithms. Computer and video games are algorithmic storytelling. Online dating and book-recommendation and travel websites would not function without algorithms. GPS mapping systems get people from point A to point B via algorithms. Artificial intelligence (AI) is naught but algorithms. The material people see on social media is brought to them by algorithms. In fact, everything people see and do on the web is a product of algorithms. Every time someone sorts a column in a spreadsheet, algorithms are at play, and most financial transactions today are accomplished by algorithms. Algorithms help gadgets respond to voice commands, recognize faces, sort photos and build and drive <b>cars.</b> <b>Hacking,</b> cyberattacks and cryptographic code-breaking exploit algorithms. Self-learning and self-programming algorithms are now emerging, so it is possible that in the future algorithms will write many if not most algorithms...|$|R
5000|$|Original PC Card memory cards used an {{internal}} battery to maintain data when power was removed. The rated {{life of the}} battery was the only reliability issue. CompactFlash cards that use flash memory, like other flash-memory devices, are rated for {{a limited number of}} erase/write cycles for any [...] "block." [...] While NOR flash has higher endurance, ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000, they haven't been adapted for memory card usage. Most mass storage usage flash are NAND based. At the time of this update (2015), NAND flash are being scaled down to 16 nm. They are usually rated for 500 to 3,000 write/erase cycles per block before hard failure. [...] This is less reliable than magnetic media. <b>Car</b> PC <b>Hacks</b> suggests disabling the Windows swap file and using its Enhanced Write Filter (EWF) to eliminate unnecessary writes to flash memory. [...] Additionally, when formatting a flash-memory drive, the Quick Format method should be used, to write as little as possible to the device.|$|R
60|$|Mr Armstrong was, happily, {{possessed of}} a {{considerable}} stock of self-confidence, and during his first day's journey, felt no want of it {{with regard to the}} delicate mission with which he was entrusted. But when he had deposited his carpet-bag at the little hotel at Kilcullen bridge, and found himself seated on a <b>hack</b> <b>car,</b> and proceeding to Grey Abbey, he began to feel that he had rather a difficult part to play; and by the time that the house was in sight, he felt himself completely puzzled as to the manner in which he should open his negotiation.|$|R
5000|$|A {{programmer}} for the NSA {{is supposedly}} {{killed in a}} car crash, but further inspection has revealed that his <b>car</b> was <b>hacked.</b> When investigating the programmer's death, the task force learns that the NSA was working on a prototype device called the [...] "Skeleton Key", capable of hacking into the entire American electronics infrastructure. Reddington initially believes an elusive Russian hacker named Ivan (Mark Ivanir) was responsible for the theft, but a personal meeting with him reveals that Ivan never had any problems with the United States, and instead is solely focused on the Russian government. Ivan claims that someone else has been masquerading as him. Further investigation into Ivan's claims leads the task force to high school student Harrison Lee, who was responsible for the theft of the Skeleton Key. Lee stole the key and used it for his own ends in order to enter a romantic relationship with the daughter of one of the Skeleton Key scientists. Elizabeth investigates the disappearance of Jolene/Lucy after being approached by Lucy's former parole officer. Elizabeth discovers Tom's makeshift headquarters after Aram is able to trace the origin of Lucy's last voice message, but Tom has just torn down and burned all photos of Red and Elizabeth. He performs a sneak attack on Liz at the hideout, and flees before she can recognize him. During the aftermath of the Skeleton Key crisis, Elizabeth receives an email containing gathered evidence from the parole officer. In a photo of some trash taken in Tom's hideout, she sees an educational toy that she had given Tom the morning of the investigation. Finally understanding Red's repeated warnings about Tom and upset by the recent revelation, Elizabeth turns to Red for emotional support. Red refurbishes an old music box whose song Elizabeth knows from her childhood, and gives it to her as a gift.|$|R
500|$|Marcus can hack {{into various}} {{electronic}} devices {{connected to the}} ctOS system with his in-game smartphone. For example, Marcus can modify the personal information of non-player characters to have them arrested, hack and manipulate every mobile phone featured in the game, disrupt traffic by <b>hacking</b> <b>cars</b> and traffic lights, hack into monitoring cameras, and carry out [...] "mass hacking", which hacks the electrical equipment of {{a large group of}} people. Players also gain multiple options while hacking the same object. For instance, if the player attempts to <b>hack</b> a <b>car,</b> they can gain direct control over them, or have the car lose control and crash in a random direction. If the player hacks a junction box, they can choose whether they should deactivate it or turn it into a proximity mine. Unlike Aiden, the protagonist of the first game, Marcus has an arsenal of advanced equipment, including a quadcopter and a remote-controlled car, both of which can be used for remote hacking and scouting. Marcus' apparel can be customized with over 700 articles of clothing, available for purchase in stores that maintain fashion styles unique to what is worn by the denizens in each area. The game features several main story missions, and side-missions known as [...] "operations". Once completed, Marcus' follower count will increase, which {{is an important part of}} the narrative.|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't {{you ever}} hear of Paddy Rea?--Michael French of Glare Abbey--he's dead now, but he was alive enough at the time I'm telling you of, and kept the best house in county Clare--well, he was coming down on the Limerick coach, and met a deuced pleasant, good-looking, talkative sort of a fellow a-top of it. They dined and got a tumbler of punch {{together}} at Roscrea; and when French got down at Bird Hill, he told his acquaintance that if he ever found himself anywhere near Ennis, he'd be {{glad to see him}} at Glare Abbey. He was a hospitable sort of a fellow, and had got into a kind of way of saying the same thing to everybody, without meaning anything except to be civil--just as I'd wish a man good morning. Well, French thought no more about the man, whose name he didn't even know; but about a fortnight afterwards, a <b>hack</b> <b>car</b> from Ennis made its appearance at Glare Abbey, and the talkative traveller, and a small portmanteau, had soon found their way into the hail. French was a good deal annoyed, for he had some fashionables in the house, but he couldn't turn the man out; so he asked his name, and introduced Paddy Rea to the company. How long do you think he stayed at Glare Abbey?" ...|$|R
