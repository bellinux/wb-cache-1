5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{opposition}} to slavery, Garrard did not take a particularly {{active role in the}} convention's proceedings. His most notable action not related to slavery occurred on April 13, 1792, when he reported twenty-two resolutions from the <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> that provided the framework for the new constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Campus Ministry Association, {{representing}} 17religious denominations, unanimously {{approved a}} resolution asking {{the university to}} change Bonfire {{because of concerns about}} safety, participant academic performance, humanitarian considerations, and the environment. Shortly afterwards, the Faculty Senate's <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> approved a resolution asking for a panel to explore alternatives to Bonfire.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Judiciary Act of 1789 took effect, Attorney General Edmund Randolph proposed, {{in a report}} to the House of Representatives, a {{criminal}} appeal similar to that in England: a writ of error as of right in non-capital cases, and no writs of error in capital cases. Randolph's report was referred to the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole,</b> which took no action.|$|E

5|$|Congress tabled {{the draft}} of the {{declaration}} on Monday, July 1 and resolved itself into a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> with Benjamin Harrison of Virginia presiding, and they resumed debate on Lee's resolution of independence. John Dickinson made one last effort to delay the decision, arguing that Congress should not declare independence without first securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the Articles of Confederation. John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson, restating the case for an immediate declaration.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{issued a}} formal apology, {{on behalf of}} the sitting Cabinet, in front of an {{audience}} of Indigenous delegates, and in an address that was broadcast nationally on the CBC, for the past governments' policies of assimilation. The Prime Minister apologized not only for the known excesses of the residential school system, but for the creation of the system itself. Harper delivered the speech in the House of Commons; the procedural device of a <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> was used, so that Indigenous leaders, who were not Members of Parliament, could be allowed to respond to the apology on the floor of the House.|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} taken {{after a long}} day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole.</b> The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E

5|$|Desha entered {{politics}} in 1797, {{when he was}} elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Kentucky House of Representatives. When the House debated the Kentucky Resolutions in 1798, he chaired the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole.</b> He again served in the House from 1799 to 1802, and was elected to the Kentucky Senate from 1802 to 1807. Concurrent with his legislative career, he continued to serve in the state militia. On January 23, 1798, he was appointed as a major in the 29th Regiment. He was promoted to colonel on March 23, 1799, and on September 5, 1805, he was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 7th Brigade of the Kentucky Militia. On December 24, 1806, he was made a major general, remaining with the 7th Brigade.|$|E
5|$|If the Council {{does make}} an adverse report, Parliament may amend {{the bill to}} rid it of any {{differentiating}} measures before sending {{it back to the}} Council for inspection. The MP having charge of the bill may give two clear days' notice of the amendments he or she proposes to move in Parliament to the provisions of the bill that were adversely reported upon by the Council. The bill then stands recommitted to a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Parliament on those provisions, and the proposed amendments are considered. Parliament then resumes, and the MP having charge of the bill reports whether the amendments were agreed to by the committee. If so, the MP moves that the amended bill should be resubmitted to the Council. There is uncertainty as to whether the Council will have to make another report within any time limit, or if the bill will then be directly presented to the President for assent.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter's {{political}} career {{began in earnest}} with his 1797 election to the Kentucky House of Representatives representing Mercer County. He {{was named to the}} Committee on Enrollments, and probably served as chair, since he delivered the committee's reports to the Assembly. It is unclear whether he did not seek re-election in 1798, or whether he was defeated in that year's canvass. Whatever the case, he filled the space of his legislative hiatus by serving as trustee of the newly incorporated Harrodsburg Academy. He was re-elected to the state House in 1799. In addition to the Committee on Enrollments, he served on the Committee on Privileges and Elections and a joint committee that reported {{on the state of the}} Auditor's, Treasurer's, and Registrar's offices. Records show that he also served as chairman when the House sat as a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> on November 25, 1799.|$|E

5|$|Assistant Deputy Chair <b>of</b> <b>Committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> — Andrew Scheer (the Conservative Member for Regina—Qu'Appelle). As one of Canada's {{youngest}} MPs, is a vocal {{advocate of}} western concerns.|$|R
5|$|Deputy Chair <b>of</b> <b>Committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> — Royal Galipeau (the Conservative Member for Ottawa—Orléans). He is <b>the</b> first member <b>of</b> Parliament to {{hold this}} {{position}} without previous parliamentary experience.|$|R
5|$|The bill then {{proceeds}} {{to the committee}} stage, where {{the details of the}} drafting of the proposed law are examined. Where a bill is relatively uncontroversial, it is referred to a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Parliament; in other words, all the MPs attending the sitting form a committee and discuss the bill clause by clause. Bills that are more controversial, or that require the views of interested groups or the public, are often referred to a select committee. This is a committee of selected MPs who invite interested people to make representations to the committee. Public hearings to hear submissions on the bill may be held. The select committee then reports its findings, together with any suggested amendments to the bill, to Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The bill imposed fines {{on anyone}} who {{imported}} or traded in unlicensed or foreign books, required every book for which copyright protection was sought to be {{entered into the}} Stationers' Register, provided a legal deposit system centred around the King's Library, the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, but said nothing about limiting the term of copyright. It also specified that books were property; {{an emphasis on the}} idea that authors deserved copyright simply due to their efforts. The Stationers were enthusiastic, urging Parliament to pass the bill, and it received its second reading on 9 February. A <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> met to amend it on 21 February, with further alterations made when it was passed back to the House of Commons on 25 February. Alterations during this period included minor changes, such as extending the legal deposit system to cover Sion College and the Faculty of Advocates, but also major ones, including the introduction of a limit on the length of time for which copyright would be granted.|$|E
5|$|These {{reforms were}} also {{significant}} {{in that they}} gave to Senate committees the role of examining the budget (what {{is referred to as}} the estimates process or estimates hearings), which had hitherto been confined to the Senate and its <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole.</b> The role of the committees was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all delegated legislation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral of bills to committees, increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates hearings. These second hearings are referred to as supplementary budget estimates. Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> House <b>of</b> Commons elects a {{presiding}} officer, {{known as}} the Speaker, at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> each new parliamentary term, and also whenever a vacancy arises.

Since 1986, however, the House has elected Speakers by secret ballot. The Speaker is assisted by a Deputy Speaker, who also holds <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> Chair <b>of</b> <b>Committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole.</b> Two other deputies—the Deputy Chair <b>of</b> <b>Committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> and <b>the</b> Assistant Deputy Chair <b>of</b> <b>Committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Whole—also preside. <b>The</b> duties <b>of</b> presiding over <b>the</b> House are divided between the four officers aforementioned; however, the Speaker usually presides over Question Period and over the most important debates.|$|R
