40|$|There are {{currently}} two main types of active contours: 1) parametric active <b>contours,</b> which represent <b>contours</b> explicitly as parameterized curves; and 2) geometric active <b>contours,</b> which represent <b>contours</b> implicitly as level sets of two-dimensional scalar functions. In this paper, we derive an explicit mathematical {{relationship between the}} general formulations of parametric and geometric active <b>contours.</b> Based on this relationship {{and the results of}} two recent parametric active <b>contours,</b> we propose two new geometric active <b>contours.</b> Using both simulated and real images, we show that the proposed algorithms have an improved performance over both existing parametric and geometric active <b>contours.</b> 1 Introduction Active <b>contours</b> [9], a physically-motivated model that can deform itself to recover object shape from digital images, have been extensively researched in the past decade (see [14] for a recent survey on this topic).

50|$|The neon color {{spreading}} effect {{works in}} a similar way to another illusion: illusory <b>contours.</b> Illusory <b>contours</b> are characterized by the appearance of <b>contours</b> due to the implication that they are there.

They can both create the perception of <b>contours</b> where there are none.|$|R
50|$|Illusory <b>contours</b> or {{subjective}} <b>contours</b> are visual illusions that {{evoke the}} perception of an edge without a luminance or color change across that edge. Illusory brightness and depth ordering frequently accompany illusory <b>contours.</b> Friedrich Schumann is often credited {{with the discovery of}} illusory <b>contours</b> around {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century, however illusory <b>contours</b> are present in art dating to the Middle Ages.

5|$|The {{feathers}} are outgrowths of the epidermis and {{are found}} in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin.

The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near {{the base of the}} tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.|$|E
5|$|A. H. A. Hogg {{identified}} {{four types}} of hillfort: <b>contour</b> forts, promontory forts, cliff forts and ridge forts. <b>Contour</b> forts, where banks and ditches are moulded {{to the shape of}} the hill, are the dominant form in Scotland. Less significant are promontory forts, usually employing coastal features, such as the largest one in Scotland at the Mull of Galloway. Different types of defensive style occurred throughout the Iron Age period, some of which may have been a response to Roman siege warfare. There were different combinations in the use of earth, stone or timber. Timber was frequently in-filled with stone or other materials. In continental Europe the timber is often arranged vertically, but in Scotland horizontal timbers were more common. The function of hillforts has been much debated. It was traditionally assumed that they were primarily defensive in nature, but {{in the late twentieth century}} this view began to be questioned and social, ritual and religious functions were emphasised.|$|E

5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the <b>contour</b> of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the <b>contour</b> of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E

A {{set of the}} equal-loudness <b>contours</b> based on British data measured in mid- 1950 was standardized as ISO 226.

40|$|We {{present an}} object {{recognition}} system that locates an object, identifies its parts, and segments out its <b>contours.</b> A key distinction of our {{approach is that}} we use long, salient, bottom-up image <b>contours</b> to learn object shape, and to achieve object detection with the learned shape. Most learning methods rely on one-to-one matching of <b>contours</b> to a model. However, bottom-up image <b>contours</b> often fragment unpredictably. We resolve this difficulty by using many-to-one matching of image <b>contours</b> to a model. To learn a descriptive object shape model, we combine bottom-up <b>contours</b> from a few representative images. The goal is to allow most of the <b>contours</b> in the training images to be many-to-one matched to the model. For detection, our challenges are inferring the object <b>contours</b> and part locations, in addition to object location. Because the locations of object parts and matches of <b>contours</b> are not annotated, they appear as latent variables during training. We use the latent SVM learning formulation to discriminatively tune the many-to-one matching score using the max-margin criterion. We evaluate on the challenging ETHZ shape categories dataset and outperform all existing method...|$|R
5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser speckle was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between <b>contour</b> lines indicating a peak versus <b>contour</b> lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.|$|E

It has been reported that <b>contour</b> tourniquet cuffs occlude blood flow at lower inflation pressures than standard rectangular cuffs of equal width, which may be attributable to better cuff fit and more efficient transmission of pressure to deep tissues. There are two types of <b>contour</b> cuff designs; fixed-contour and variable-contour.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOrientation {{discrimination}} and tilt aftereffects (TAEs) were measured {{to determine if}} the orientation of luminance and illusory <b>contours</b> are processed by separate mechanisms. The assumption was made that if a single mechanism supports the perception of both types of <b>contours,</b> then illusory and luminance <b>contours</b> that support the same level of orientation discrimination will be equally effective adapting patterns. Experiment I found that orientation discrimination psychometric functions for illusory and luminance <b>contours</b> are similar, confirming that performance could be matched. Experiment II measured orientation discrimination for a range of intensities for both <b>contours.</b> Experiment III measured TAEs following adaptation to illusory and luminance <b>contours</b> that supported a similar range of orientation discrimination. Similar TAEs were not observed, thus rejecting the single mechanism hypothesis. Experiments IV and V sought to validate the assumption that equivalent orientation discrimination predicts equivalent TAEs by using stimuli that seemed likely to be represented by the same visual mechanism. Luminance <b>contours</b> masked by randomly placed dots and unmasked luminance <b>contours</b> were used with the same procedures as experiments II and III. Equal TAEs were not observed for masked and unmasked <b>contours</b> matched on orientation discrimination, suggesting the assumption relating discriminability to adaptation was incorrect...|$|R
