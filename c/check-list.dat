5|$|The {{cockatoos}} {{were first}} {{defined as a}} subfamily Cacatuinae within the parrot family Psittacidae by the English naturalist George Robert Gray in 1840, with Cacatua the first listed and type genus. This group has alternately been considered as either a full or subfamily by different authorities. The American ornithologist James Lee Peters in his 1937 <b>Check-list</b> of Birds of the World, Sibley and Monroe in 1990 maintained it as a subfamily, while parrot expert Joseph Forshaw classified it as a family in 1973. Subsequent molecular studies indicate that the earliest offshoot from the original parrot ancestors were the New Zealand parrots of the superfamily Strigopoidea, and following this the cockatoos, now a well-defined group or clade, split off from the remaining parrots, which then radiated across the Southern Hemisphere and diversified into the many species of parrots, parakeets, macaws, lories, lorikeets, lovebirds and other true parrots of the superfamily Psittacoidea.|$|E
5|$|Within its genus, the Iago sparrow {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the African 'rufous sparrows', a group which also includes species such as the great sparrow (Passer motitensis). These birds were usually treated as distinct species until Reginald Ernest Moreau, writing in the 1962 <b>Check-list</b> of the Birds of the World, lumped the Iago sparrow and the mainland rufous sparrows as the single species Passer motitensis. This taxonomy was followed frequently until J. Denis Summers-Smith, a world authority on sparrows, argued in the 1980s that the Iago sparrow's many differences in morphology and behaviour, and separation from the other rufous sparrows by about , are sufficient grounds for species status. Studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA have since suggested it may be a close relative of the house sparrow and the Spanish sparrow and not the rufous sparrows.|$|E

25|$|Research {{advanced}} {{so quickly}} {{that the need for}} an up-to-date checklist became apparent. Mary Parke (1902–1981), who was a founder member of the British Phycological Society, produced a preliminary checklist of British marine algae in 1953, corrections and additions of this were published in 1956, 1957 and 1959. In 1964 M.Parke and Peter Stanley Dixon (1929–1993) published a revised <b>check-list,</b> a second revision of this was produced in 1968 and a third revision in 1976. Distribution was added to the checklist in 1986 with G.R.South and I.Tittley's A Checklist and Distributional Index of the Benthic Marine Algae of the North Atlantic Ocean. In 2003 A <b>Check-list</b> and Atlas of the Seaweeds of Britain and Ireland was published by Gavin Hardy and Michael Guiry with a revised edition in 2006. This shows how rapidly knowledge of algae, at least in the British Isles, advanced. First efforts had been made by interested biologists and people capable of identifying the algae, this required books using the botanical names. Botanical keys to identify the plants then developed, followed by checklists. As more information was brought to light by interested workers, some volunteers, the checklists were improved and eventually a mapping scheme brought together all this information. The same pattern of knowledge developed with birds, mammals and flowering plants, though to a different time-scale and knowledge {{in other parts of the}} world has developed to this degree.|$|E

40|$|Ratings are {{any kind}} of coding (qualitative or quantitative) made {{concerning}} attitudes, behaviours, or cognitions. Here, I am concerned with those kinds of ratings made by third-parties of a particular individual’s attitudes, behaviour, or cognitions. These might be from rating scales, observational <b>check-lists,</b> or symptom <b>check-lists</b> etc. The principle aim of reliability analysis {{is to determine the}} degree of agreement between raters when using a particular rating scheme. If the reliability is low, then the scheme itself may be at fault, or the raters, or both! I am not going to try and describe all possible kinds of designs and analyses, but only those that might be most common within the mental health setting. As always, the quantitative properties of the ratings must be considered first. Then, an appropriate statistic might be chosen to summarise the degree of agreement between raters. First – an important distinction between inter-rater and intra-class correlations. Interrater correlation (interrater r). This is where the similarity between ratings is expressed as a correlation coefficient – generally using a Pearson r product-moment type coefficient. In 2 x 2 tables (for comparison of just 2 raters), it is possible to use a range of measures of agreement, ranging from the phi coefficient through to say Jaccard’s coefficient that excludes all non-occurrences from th...|$|R

500|$|As {{scientific}} knowledge expanded {{quickly in the}} second half of the nineteenth century, the need for reorganizing the system of names used to describe North American birds grew commensurately. [...] For example, certain names assigned by William Bartram in his catalog of 1791 were now deemed unusable. [...] Robert Ridgway addressed this need with two publications in 1880 and 1881, while Elliott Coues published a competing checklist in 1882. [...] Ridgway and Coues, along with Joel Asaph Allen, William Brewster, and Henry W. Henshaw, came together as a committee on nomenclature and classification, serving the newly founded AOU, to reconcile the various systems and catalogs. [...] In 1886, the committee released The Code of Nomenclature and <b>Check-List</b> of North American Birds, both a consistent checklist and a set of rules for the naming of birds to be described in the future. [...] The Code settled the disagreement about capitalization of species names and established today's order of presentation, with waterbirds first and passerines last.

Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis evaluates the effect of the use of Activity Diary <b>check-lists,</b> in small community homes, on the frequency of participation in activities of people with learning difficulties. A number of Health Authorities across the country are introducing activity <b>check-lists</b> into their services as a means of monitoring one aspect of quality of life of their service users. None of the services have evaluated the value and reliability of such recording systems. Two studies were undertaken to carry out such an evaluation. Study I introduced an Activity Diary, designed by the researcher, into two small community homes for people with learning difficulties. Baseline measures were taken prior to the introduction of the diaries and then continued through the duration of the intervention which involved the use of Activity Diaries by the homes with weekly graphical feedback produced by the researcher. The results of the study showed a slight but statistically insignificant increase in the frequency of panicipation in activities by the residents. A comparison study with the general public was undertaken during Study I. Almost identical Activity Diaries as those used in the homes were completed by members of the general public for one week. The diaries were compared to those of the residents in Study I. The people with learning difficulties were found to have participated in significantly fewer activities than the general public. Study IT built upon Study I and introduced Activity Diaries with additional interventions into a number of homes. The additional interventions were; staff recording their own activities, individualisation of the diaries to each homes needs, daily and weekly goal planning and weekly graphical feedback of both staff and residents activities. The results showed no change in the frequency of participation in activities of the residents over the six months duration of the study. Issues relating to the monitoring of residents activities using Activity Diary <b>check-lists</b> are discussed...|$|R
