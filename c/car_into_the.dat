Stella cracks the safe, and they load up the Coopers with the gold. They race from the subway to the Los Angeles River and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with Napster helping to create a green wave to evade traffic.

5|$|Franchitti led {{the field}} to the restart on lap eight, ahead of Tagliani, Hunter-Reay (up from fourth), Kanaan (up from sixth), and Matos, who {{advanced}} seven positions while avoiding the mêlée at turn one. Franchitti became only the third driver in series history to lead the final lap of one season and the first lap of the next, having won the championship by winning the 2009 Firestone Indy 300 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. The top five remained the same until lap 15 when Dan Wheldon passed the De Ferran Luczo Dragon Racing car of Matos for fifth place. Hunter-Reay took second place from Tagliani into the final hairpin on lap 19, before Milka Duno brought out the second caution of the afternoon on lap 22 by nudging her Dale Coyne Racing <b>car</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wall at turn four. The entire field except for Simona de Silvestro headed to pit road {{for the first of}} two scheduled pit stops. De Silvestro became the first rookie driver since Graham Rahal in 2008 to lead at least one lap on début.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{maintained}} his pole position advantage {{heading into the}} first turn. Lieb passed Tandy to take over second position, while Fässler moved to third, after passing Tandy at the Bus Stop chicane at the first lap's conclusion. Tandy reclaimed third from Fässler shortly afterward. Team SARD Morand held the LMP2 lead before its car was overtaken by Tincknell and Bird on lap two. Duval moved in front of Wurz for fifth and the Toyota driver dropped to seventh. Jota Sport was issued with a drive-through penalty after its car was adjudged to have jumped the start and rejoined in sixth in LMP2, allowing Bird {{to the front of}} the category. Tandy drove to the inside of Estre to lap him, but made head-on contact with his car and went straight into the Pif Paf corner barrier. Both drivers continued, but Tandy drove into the pit lane for repairs, falling to the rear of the field. Fässler battled with Lieb for second as the two moved through slower traffic, but the Audi driver spun at the Bus Stop chicane allowing Lieb to take over second. Ryan Dalziel brought the No. 30 Extreme Speed Motorsports <b>car</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> team's garage to allow his mechanics to replace a broken boost line falling to the rear of the LMP2 field.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Aldermach Maggotbone {{is ready}} to hand over his title {{as the leader of}} Hell to his daughter, Callie. However, Callie does not want to take over his job. A {{competition}} is held to choose which one will overtake the title and Callie tries to lose every challenge, but Twayne makes sure that she wins each time. At the studio where Dishonorable Discharge was filmed, Grimes forces some bystanders to act in his ending of the series, which reveals the memory Grimes had repressed: While trying to take down Aldermach when he became the new leader of Hell, Grimes accidentally killed a disguised Jimmy. In present time, Mark, Grimes and Randall head back to New York to sabotage the new ceremony. At the ceremony, Aldermach unexpectedly chooses to give the Slitherix (a big snake one has to swallow to become the leader of Hell) to his secretary, Cathy, to spare Callie from getting the job. Just as Cathy is about to receive the snake, Grimes crashes the <b>car</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> church and shoots her. It is then revealed that she is really Grimes' old partner Jimmy, who had worked undercover in Hell for 35 years. Embarrassed, Grimes begins to repress his memories again, which Mark believes is for the best. The episode ends with an angel waking up, suggesting that the episode was her dream.|$|E

5|$|Mulder's own {{problems}} arise when {{his cell phone}} rings and Krycek disappears from his car. Mulder, after learning what Doggett has witnessed, believes that Crane gave Krycek access to the FBI. Suddenly, Krycek smashes through the car window with his prosthetic hand and crushes Mulder's cell phone. Krycek aims his gun at Mulder and tells him to get out. Krycek is about {{to pull the trigger}} when a bullet administered by Skinner pierces his arm. Krycek tries to pick his gun up again, but Skinner shoots his hand, rendering it useless. Krycek pushes his gun over and tells Skinner to shoot Mulder, telling him Mulder's life will grant him a thousand lives. Instead, Skinner raises his gun and shoots Krycek in the head. Doggett attempts to apprehend Rohrer and Crane but ends up being chased by the two. The pursuit ends up in the FBI garage and ends violently with Crane being run over and Rohrer crashing his <b>car</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garage wall, going up in flames. Both men are presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|Another virtual safety car period ensued on lap 34, {{caused by}} Verstappen who crashed his <b>car</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> barrier after locking up his tyres. As the VSC ended on lap 37, Ricciardo once more failed {{in an attempt}} to regain the lead. At the chicane coming out of the tunnel, Hamilton misjudged the corner and backed Ricciardo off at the exit of the chicane, causing the latter to {{complain}} about the move on team radio. While the incident was investigated by the stewards, the decision was not to take action against Hamilton. At that point, the order stood as follows: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Pérez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutiérrez. The top four drivers pulled away cleanly {{from the rest of the}} field behind them. On lap 50, the two Sauber cars collided at Rascasse corner, after Felipe Nasr had ignored instructions from the pit lane to let his teammate Ericsson behind him pass. Another VSC period was called while both Sauber drivers made pit stops to repair damages, only for both to retire some laps later. In front, the race carried on in the same order. On lap 68, the fourth virtual safety car period occurred when a large plastic sheet fell onto the start–finish straight. Hamilton was able to extend his lead over Ricciardo at that point, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 71. Three laps from the finish, rain started to fall again, although no driver changed tyres before the chequered flag fell. Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory ahead of Ricciardo and Pérez. This win for Hamilton marked his second at Monaco, the other being in 2008. These two races featured many similarities, such as the Hamilton starting third on the grid, the race starting in wet conditions and finishing in the dry, as well as Hamilton taking the lead on lap 33. Vettel hung on to fourth, followed by Alonso in fifth. Rosberg however lost his sixth place to Nico Hülkenberg on the very last lap.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass is {{rescued by}} a group of elderly people living in a scrap yard. At the hospital, the doctors are shocked when Isabel levitates off her bed and explodes in a cloud of dust. Elsewhere, the devastated Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people are joining the Planet People, {{including}} the gangs that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep them away from the Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their <b>car</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed.
