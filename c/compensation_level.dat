40|$|A well-known, if underappreciated, {{finding in}} the {{mobility}} literature is that turnover is much lower in jobs covered by pensions than in other jobs. This could result from capital losses for job changes created by most benefit formulas, the tendency of turnover-prone individuals to avoid jobs covered by pensions, or higher overall <b>compensation</b> <b>levels</b> in such jobs. A switching bivariate probit model of pension coverage and turnover is developed to estimate the effect {{of each of these}} factors.

We document no correlation between CEO compensation and firm performance for a sample of Swedish companies listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange (SSE) over the sample period 1999 to 2008. However, the Industry firms might pay the CEO for performance. Also, stock ownership influence compensation levels; when the five largest shareholders increase their holdings, CEO <b>compensation</b> <b>levels</b> decrease.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the impact of}} {{replacement}} on the IGE depends on the <b>compensation</b> <b>level.</b> When the <b>compensation</b> <b>level</b> is high and the system is excited to lose its stability, the DFIG-based wind farm makes the oscillation even worse.

40|$|Congress has {{enacted a}} number of tax {{provisions}} that aim to penalize companies and their executives when the executive is paid more than Congress thinks is desirable. Congress was motivated to enact these provisions by intense public sentiments regarding executive <b>compensation</b> <b>levels</b> during times of economic turmoil. This article demonstrates, however, that not only are these provisions ineffective at reducing executive <b>compensation</b> <b>levels,</b> but they penalize the wrong people. This article reveals that the penalties do not significantly fall on the executives that Congress was targeting with enactment of the penalties. Instead, these penalties impose costs {{on a variety of}} constituencies who are, generally speaking, ordinary Americans. Thus, the actual effect of the tax penalties is to harm the people who were the catalyst for enactment of the tax penalties in the first place. Who bears the financial burden and is penalized by tax penalties on executive compensation has received almost no attention in the legal literature. Consideration of this issue, however, is of contemporary relevance as Congress has been considering expanding the use of tax penalties in an effort to not only curtail executive compensation but also to raise federal revenue. The article concludes with suggestions for dealing with the underlying problems regarding executive <b>compensation</b> <b>levels</b> in place of enacting tax penalties aimed at the symptoms of these problems...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study is}} devoted to the {{variations}} of the carrier lifetime and minority carrier diffusion length with the <b>compensation</b> <b>level</b> in solar-grade crystalline silicon.

These theoretical results are confirmed by the chemical and electrical characterizations of strongly compensated multicrystalline silicon wafers and solar cells, from silicon purified by the metallurgical route. These results are of paramount importance since an accurate control of the <b>compensation</b> <b>level</b> can lead to strong improvements in silicon solar cells efficiencies. Nevertheless, possible limits of too high compensation levels are also evoked...|$|E

In two different data sets, we find that the capital loss is strongly associated with lower turnover rates, whereas vesting and the <b>compensation</b> <b>level</b> have relatively little impact. Large capital losses are mainly associated with lower layoff rates rather than lower quit rates. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT) A {{bifurcation}} {{analysis is}} used to investigate the complex dynamics of two heavily loaded single-machine-infinite-busbar power systems modeling {{the characteristics of the}} BOARD-MAN generator with respect {{to the rest of the}} North-Western American Power System and the CHOLLA # generator with respect to the SOWARO station. In the BOARDMAN system, we show that there are three Hopf bifurcations at practical compensation values, while in the CHOLLA# 4 system, we show that there is only one Hopf bifurcation. The results show that as the <b>compensation</b> <b>level</b> increases, the operating condition loses stability with a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix crossing trans-versely from the left- to the right-half of the complex plane, signifying a Hopf bifurcation. As a result, the power system oscillates subsynchronously with a small limit-cycle attrac-tor. As the <b>compensation</b> <b>level</b> increases, the limit cycle grows and then loses stability via a secondary Hopf bifurcation, resulting in the creation of a two-period quasiperiodic subsyn-chronous oscillation, a two-torus attractor. On further increases of the <b>compensation</b> <b>level,</b> the quasiperiodic attractor collides with its basin boundary, resulting in the destruction o...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Post-silicon tuning is {{attracting}} {{a lot of}} attention for coping with increasing process variation. However, its tuning cost via testing is still a crucial problem. In this paper, we propose tuning-friendly body bias clustering with multiple bias voltages. The proposed method provides a small set of <b>compensation</b> <b>levels</b> so that the speed and leakage current vary monotonically according to the level. Thanks to this monotonic leveling and limitation of the number of levels, the test-cost of post-silicon tuning is significantly reduced. During the body bias clustering, the proposed method explicitly estimates and minimizes the average leakage after the post-silicon tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the average leakage by 25. 3 to 51. 9 % compared to non clustering case. We reveal that two bias voltages are sufficient when {{only a small number of}} <b>compensation</b> <b>levels</b> are allowed for test-cost reduction. We also give an implication on how to synthesize a circuit to which post-silicon tuning will be applied. I...|$|R

These raises are not only larger in percentage terms, but are also larger in absolute dollar terms and remain even after controlling for economic factors that have previously been documented to affect <b>compensation</b> <b>levels</b> (e. g., performance, size, industry, and firm governance characteristics).
