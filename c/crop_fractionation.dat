Multipurpose land management seems particularly promising for an introduction of biosystems in European agricultural and natural systems. The most promising components of this land-management form are identified and investigated according to a global approach. Multipurpose and arid land plants, agroforestry, new crop rotations, <b>crop</b> <b>fractionation,</b> wetlands vegetation management, residue utilization and various small-scale systems have good prospects for application in the European Community. © 1987...|$|E

The treatments were: recommended inorganic fertilizer (NPK) with crop residues (T 1), recommended inorganic fertilizer without crop residues (T 2), and half dose of the recommended inorganic fertilizer with crop residues and combined with 10 t ha 21 chicken manure (T 3). Soil organic matter size fractionation was carried out for samples collected after harvest of the second (1998) and fourth (1999) <b>crop</b> whereas density <b>fractionation</b> was carried out for samples collected after harvest of the fourth crop. Results showed that dry matter content of the POM, organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) relative to total soil dry weight, total soil C and total soil N in T 1 and t 3 plots were statistically similar to T 2 plots. For all treatments, these values {{were found to be}} 1. 8 – 3. 3 %, 8. 5 – 18. 1 % and 4. 1 – 7. 8 % for total dry matter, content of C and N, respectively. After two years, 67 % of the POM dry matter weight was recovered in the small size (0. 125 – 0. 053 mm) compared to 13 % in the 2. 0 – 0. 25 mm size particles. Also for all treatments, C and N in the light fractions (LF) were 0. 5 – 0. 7 %, 0. 6 – 2. 1 %, 0. 4 – 1. 0 % (in the free LF) and 0. 03 – 0. 08 %, 0. 02 – 0. 09 %, 0. 04 – 0. 09 % (in the occluded LF). Dry matter content of the occluded organic matter was significantly ðP # 0 : 05 Þ lower in T 3 plots (0. 93 %) compared to T 1 and T 2 (0. 13 – 0. 2 %). It was concluded that during application of organic inputs in the humid tropics, two years study was not sufficient for positive accumulation of labile SOMThis paper had been presented for promotion at the university of Khartoum.
