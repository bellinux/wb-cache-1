500|$|Phoronis australis bores {{into the}} wall of the tube of a <b>cerianthid</b> <b>anemone,</b> Ceriantheomorphe brasiliensis, and uses this as a {{foundation}} for building its own tube. One cerianthid can house up to 100 phoronids. In this unequal relationship, the anemone experiences no significant benefits nor harm, while the phoronid benefits from: a foundation for its tube; food (both animals are filter-feeders); and protection, as the cerianthid [...] withdraws into its tube when danger threatens, and this alerts the phoronid to retract into its own tube.|$|E
50|$|Pachycerianthus fimbriatus is a <b>cerianthid</b> <b>anemone</b> that burrows in {{substrate}} {{and lives}} in a semi-rigid tube made of felted nematocysts. The anemone is often seen in bright orange to red.|$|E

50|$|Dendronotus patricki {{was found}} {{crawling}} on a muddy seabed. Its stomach contents included structures {{thought to be}} nematocysts. It is possible that it feeds on burrowing <b>cerianthid</b> <b>anemones</b> as does Dendronotus iris.|$|R
40|$|Baseline data on nearshore benthic {{macrofauna}} and flora assemblages {{are necessary}} for successful environ­mental monitoring in the Arctic, where major climate and industrial changes are underway, yet to date these environments remain understudied. This study used bottom video and benthic grab samples to compare shallow benthic marine (1 – 40 m) floral and faunal distribution and composition in two nearshore locations in the Canadian Arctic with different geomorphic settings. Sachs Harbour, located on southwestern Banks Island, has a submergent soft-sediment shoreline with locally rapid coastal erosion, while Gjoa Haven, located on southeastern King William Island, has an emergent shoreline dominated by coarse ice-contact Quaternary sediments with little to no coastal erosion. Gjoa Haven’s sediment-starved, heterogeneous nearshore area contributes to a more diverse macroalgal flora than is found at Sachs Harbour, where a continuous supply of sand and mud from thermally driven coastal erosion and muddy runoff produces a more homogeneous nearshore environment. Seventy-four species (10 macroalgae, 64 macrofauna) were recorded from southwestern Banks Island and 65 species (26 macroalgae, 39 macrofauna) from southeastern King William Island. Species composition differed greatly among locations and varied significantly among substrate and depth classes for grab- and video-sampled biota at Gjoa Haven and among depth classes for bottom video biota at Sachs Harbour. Faunally barren, shallow, mobile sand sheets were the dominant habitat sampled in Sachs Harbour. Gjoa Haven’s habitats differed significantly along a depth gradient, with sand and gravel substrates covered by Fucus sp. at depths shallower than 10 m and muddy substrates with filamentous green algae, Coccotylus truncatus, and <b>cerianthid</b> <b>anemones</b> inhabiting water down to 40 m...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel biotope at 633 to 762 m depth on a vertical {{wall in the}} Whittard Canyon, an extensive canyon system reaching from the shelf to the deep sea on Ireland's continental margin. We explored this wall with an ROV and compiled a photomosaic of the habitat. The assemblage contributing to the biotope was dominated by large limid bivalves, Acesta excavata (mean shell height 10. 4 cm), and deep-sea oysters, Neopycnodonte zibrowii, at high densities, particularly at overhangs. Mean density of N. zibrowii increased with depth, with densities of the most closely packed areas of A. excavata also increasing with depth. Other taxa associated with the assemblage included the solitary coral Desmophyllum dianthus, <b>cerianthid</b> <b>anemones,</b> comatulid crinoids, the trochid gastropod Margarites sp., the portunid crab Bathynectes longispina and small fish of the family Bythitidae. The scleractinian coral Madrepora oculata, the pencil urchin Cidaris cidaris and a species of Epizoanthus were also common. Prominent but less abundant species included the flytrap anemone Actinoscyphia saginata, the carrier crab Paramola cuvieri, and the fishes Lepidion eques and Conger conger. Observations of the hydrography of the canyon system identified that the upper 500 m was dominated by Eastern North Atlantic Water, with Mediterranean Outflow Water beneath it. The permanent thermocline is found between 600 and 1000 m depth, i. e., in the depth range of the vertical wall and the dense assemblage of filter feeders. Beam attenuation indicated nepheloid layers present in the canyon system with the greatest amounts of suspended material at the ROV dive site between 500 and 750 m. A cross-canyon CTD transect indicated {{the presence of internal}} waves between these depths. We hypothesise that internal waves concentrate suspended sediment at high concentrations {{at the foot of the}} vertical wall, possibly explaining the large size and high density of filter-feeding molluscs...|$|R
50|$|The {{catshark}} {{spends the}} daytime resting at the bottom, usually {{in contact with}} certain structures. It has been observed with large burrowing <b>cerianthid</b> <b>anemone</b> tubes and boulders. The bottom rubble {{is thought to be}} used as a camouflage with the shark’s spotted surface. Adult sharks tend to prefer rough bottoms, creating a difficulty for trawl sampling, while the immature forms are found near smoother regions. The chain catshark has been known to feed on squid, bony fish, polychaetes and crustaceans. In aquaria, they are relatively motionless, only swimming occasionally.|$|E
40|$|RRS Charles Darwin cruise 123 C 3 - 4 formed {{part of the}} Atlantic Margin Environmental Survey (AMES) {{and also}} carried out commercially funded deep-water seabed surveys. This {{contribution}} details those activities and comprises four sections: Part A. Report of seagoing operations and seabed observations undertaken in Tranche 4 (West of Shetland) on behalf of Enterprise. This report addresses {{a survey of the}} deep (1030 - 1275 m) Faroe- Shetland Channel (61 ° 36 ´N 001 ° 55 ´W) encompassing a range of habitats (open slope; lineated slope, contourite band; basin floor). These habitats are readily distinguished in terms of their megabenthic communities; example photographs of the seafloor and its associated fauna are provided. Part B. Report of seagoing operations and seabed observations undertaken in Tranches 65 - 67 (North of Shetland) on behalf of Statoil and BP. This report addresses a survey of the deep (900 - 1000 m) slope North of Shetland (62 ° 20 ´N 000 ° 10 ´E) in a region of silty sand contourite deposit. The megabenthic communities are dominated by <b>cerianthid</b> <b>anemones</b> and stalked sponges and also notable for the occurrence of ‘giant’ seapens (Umbellula sp.). An intriguing observation is made of two occurrences (at separate sites some 7 km apart) of fabric bags on the seafloor that appear to have attracted (scavenging) gastropods and prompted the deposition of numerous egg masses. Example photographs of the seafloor and its associated fauna are provided. Part C. Report of seabed observations made in the vicinity of Texaco site TX 1 : observation of a “tubeworm” patch. This report addresses a survey of the deep (1550 m) Faroe-Shetland Channel floor (61 ° 55 ´N 003 ° 00 ´W). The survey is notable for recording what appeared to be small (c. 20 m across) discrete patch of what appeared to be tubeworms (Siboglinidae). Example photographs of the seafloor and its associated fauna are provided. Part D. Assessment of Texaco site TX 1 environmental data. This report addresses a survey of the deep (1550 m) Faroe-Shetland Channel floor (61 ° 55 ´N 003 ° 00 ´W) and provides an analysis of physicochemical (hydrocarbons, heavy metals, sediments) and biological parameters (macrobenthos) at the survey site compared with 35 other sites in the deep Faroe-Shetland Channel obtained during the Atlantic Frontier Environmental Network surveys of 1996 and 1998.
