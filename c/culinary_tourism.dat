40|$|Abstract: Beer {{tourism is}} a growing {{dimension}} of <b>culinary</b> or food <b>tourism.</b> Although South Africa is traditionally associated with wine tourism the country is enjoying the development of beer tourism, in particular associated with the expansion of craft beer micro-breweries.

An analysis is presented of key trends in research on beer tourism, including of policy-related issues. It is argued that whilst lessons may be learned from the experience of wine tourism {{that there is a need}} for expanding the amount of beer tourism specific scholarship. In particular, there is a significant agenda for tourism scholars around the relationships between the burgeoning of craft beer and of incipient forms of craft beer tourism. This agenda includes the need to profile beer tourists, understand the participation of breweries in beer tourism, the importance of neo-localism for the craft beer industry in South Africa, and evaluate the impacts of beer tourism initiatives for local economic development...|$|R

40|$|Food tourism, {{also known}} as <b>culinary</b> and gastronomic <b>tourism,</b> refers to travel {{activities}} that are motivated by, and focused on, food production and consumption (Ignatov & Smith, 2006). It results from the confluence of three forces - demand from tourists for food-related experiences, preparedness {{on the part of}} food producers to offer food, and the organisation of supply by tourism and hospitality businesses. Together these forces create a wide variety of opportunities for food tourism experiences ranging from food and wine tasting food-themed tours of regions cooking classes, themed restaurants food festivals and haute cuisine dining. Food tourism is seen as both meeting market demands for more specialised and experiential forms of tourism (Kim et al., 2010), and offering a way for regions to use tourism to support local industries and develop competitive advantage (du Rand & Heath 2006). Many destinations see food tourism as a way to generate more sustainable tourism benefits for local producers and businesses (Green & Dougherty, 2008). But the rapid development of food tourism has meant that a confusing array of tourist opportunities have emerged with limited research evidence to guide practice or predict future developments...|$|R
