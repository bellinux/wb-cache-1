50|$|Teller assist units (TAU), {{also known}} as {{automatic}} teller safes (ATS) or teller <b>cash</b> <b>dispensers</b> (TCD), are devices used in retail banking for the disbursement of money at a bank teller wicket or a centralized area.

5000|$|With a scrip <b>cash</b> <b>dispenser,</b> the {{customer}} identifies themselves by inserting a plastic {{card with a}} magnetic stripe or a plastic smartcard with a chip, that contains his or her account number.

50|$|A scrip <b>cash</b> <b>dispenser</b> {{may have}} many {{components}} {{in common with}} an ATM, but it lacks the ability to dispense physical cash and consequently requires no vault. Instead, the customer requests a withdrawal transaction from the machine, which prints a receipt. The customer then takes this receipt to a nearby sales clerk, who then exchanges it for cash from the till.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their {{networks}}, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilises the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment, which allows {{for the use of}} a scrip <b>cash</b> <b>dispenser.</b>|$|R

Credit cards connected to Brown were used there in September and October 2008 in Antigua and Barbuda, according to reports by a team of private detectives working for two of Brown's creditors.

50|$|The Bank {{opened its}} 100th branch office in 1979 and {{commenced}} {{work on a}} new computer and operations centre, designed to accommodate 900 staff, enabling the centralisation of many of its support functions. In {{order to meet the}} need of the local market, drive-up cashier tills were long incorporated into the design of many of its offices. This service was available at more than 50 per cent of branches, many of which had multiple lanes, with up to 40 per cent of the business at a branch conducted at a drive-up window. In 1979, Lloyds Bank California also installed its first online <b>cash</b> <b>dispensers</b> at branches in the San Francisco area.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their {{networks}}, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilizes the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment.

50|$|An unfortunate design {{characteristic}} of the 3624 was that the vault that contained the <b>cash</b> <b>dispenser</b> was located in the upper area of the unit, making it top-heavy. This made the 3624 an extremely awkward machine to transport up and down stairs. Another complaint against the 3624 was the relatively small size of the cash cartridges (used to give money to customers) in comparison to other vendors' equipment at the time.|$|R
40|$|Brain injury {{rehabilitation}} is a {{long and}} difficult process that includes training of so-called instrumental {{activities of daily living}} (IADL). This type of training involves activities like preparing meals, doing housework, grocery shopping etc. and it is often used by occupational therapists when they teach brain injury patients how to manage their daily life. A computer-generated Virtual Environment (VE) that is {{to be used as a}} tool in IADL training has been designed. The VE has the shape of a <b>cash</b> <b>dispenser</b> and it can be used by a brain injury patient that wants to practice the activity of withdrawing money. The aim was to design a VE interface that puts as little cognitive load as possible on the brain injury patient, so that he or she can focus completely on the task of withdrawing money. A low-fidelity paper prototype was built and evaluated in order to generate ideas regarding object behaviour, navigation of the viewpoint, interaction with objects and other features. The result of the project so far is a computer prototype built with a Virtual Reality (VR) development kit called WorldUp, a personal computer based VR system. The computer prototype behaves exactly like a real <b>cash</b> <b>dispenser</b> and it has a function that allows the patient to learn his or her banking code. Feedback and clues will be provided by the occupational therapist that sits next to the patient during the training sessions. At present tests are in progress with voluntary brain injury patients in a usability laboratory. These tests aim to evaluate the virtual <b>cash</b> <b>dispenser</b> in order to get ideas on how to increase its usability. The tests also aim to collect ideas on future functions and features and also to get clues on how VE training can be integrated into the rehabilitation process...|$|R
