40|$|Ullman, et al. 1 In this paper, {{researchers}} {{present the}} results of a Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) driving simulator study of the ability of motorists to capture and process information on two portable changeable message signs (PCMSs) used in sequence (i. e., one PCMS following another {{along the edge of the}} roadway such that each PCMS contains part of a single message) to convey information about upcoming traffic situations. The study results indicate the need to keep overall messages at or below the four-unit maximum recommended in existing guidelines. Researchers found that presenting five units of information on sequential PCMSs resulted in low <b>comprehension</b> <b>rates,</b> below what would be acceptable for highway applications. However, by keeping the message length to four units, it does appear that the use of sequential PCMSs will result in <b>comprehension</b> <b>rates</b> comparable to those obtained by presenting the same information at a single location on a large dynamic message sign (DMS).

5000|$|Skimming is {{a process}} of speed reading that {{involves}} visually searching the sentences of a page for clues to meaning. Or when reading an essay, it can mean reading the beginning and ending for summary information, then optionally the first sentence of each paragraph to quickly determine whether to seek still more detail, as determined by the questions or purpose of the reading. [...] For some people, this comes naturally, but is usually acquired by practice. Skimming is usually seen more in adults than in children. It is conducted at a higher rate (700 words per minute and above) than normal reading for comprehension (around 200-230 wpm), and results in lower <b>comprehension</b> <b>rates,</b> especially with information-rich reading material.

This study {{examined}} {{a method of}} studying the unique contributions to comprehension from different oral reading behaviors determined in the reading {{of a group of}} learning disabled children compared with that of a group of normal readers. Seventy-six (36 LD; 40 non-LD) elementary children participated in the task which re-quired them to read orally a story and then retell all recalled information. Reading level was controlled, and, using a proportion of story propositions retold as the dependent variable, regression analyses were computed.

With the LD group, however, two oral reading behaviors were found to provide unique contributions to the variance in <b>comprehension.</b> Higher <b>rates</b> of meaning-change errors predicted lowered <b>comprehension,</b> and higher <b>rates</b> of high phonic cue use predicted higher comprehension in the LD group.

This paper {{reports on the}} {{formative}} research process {{in the development of}} a series of tuberculosis prevention and treatment display cards, aimed at a community with a low level of literacy. The aim of the project was to evaluate existing posters and to develop a new series of display cards that health workers could use to discuss tuberculosis symptoms and treatment with their patients. Fifty two patients from eight tuberculosis clinics participated in the evaluative process of existing posters and the formative design process of display cards during a structured interview with a qualitative approach. The results indicated that the subjects had difficulty in understanding some of the Western-oriented graphic conventions, and the symbolic and latent messages in the existing posters. Only one of the existing posters obtained an acceptable comprehension level. The <b>comprehension</b> <b>rating</b> of the twelve new display cards improved when they were developed during a formative process with tuberculosis patients.
