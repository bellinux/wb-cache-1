40|$|Practical and {{validated}} {{methods to}} measure anisotropy of saturated, Ks, or field-saturated, Kfs, soil hydraulic conductivity {{on a single}} soil sample are still lacking. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to test factors affecting anisotropy measured in a sandy-loam soil by the constant-head laboratory permeameter and the modified cube method. The ratio, RK, between the conductivity results obtained with a long (6 h) and a short (0. 5 h) duration run varied from a minimum of 0. 29 to a maximum of 0. 88 with the considered experimental procedure, differing by both the employed constant-head device (Mariotte bottle, siphon) and the initial soil water content (unsaturated, saturated). Maximum time stability was detected with a siphon and an initially saturated soil sample, suggesting that soil alteration at the surface may influence the measured conductivity, and more reliable anisotropy measurements have to be expected for Ks than Kfs. A short-duration run carried out with a siphon and a calcium solution was also suggested for laboratory determination of Ks anisotropy since more representative results were obtained for a single <b>cube</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> (i. e., horizontal, Kh, to vertical, Kv, conductivity ratio varying from 1. 78 to 1. 82 with the measurement sequence) as compared with the ones associated with using tap water (ratio varying from 1. 24 to 2. 09). The Kh/Kv ratio varied between 1. 80 and 2. 81 on two dates (April and July 2009) differing by the soil water content at the time of sampling (close to field capacity; lower than the permanent wilting point, respectively), and a significant temporal variability was only detected for Kv. Therefore, temporal variability of Ks anisotropy cannot be predicted by measuring one-dimensional Ks...|$|E
40|$|Anisotropy, a (the log of {{the ratio}} of {{horizontal}} to vertical conductivity, log 10 (Kh/Kv)), of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, Ks, affects transport processes in soil but is not routinely measured, probably because practical and validated methods are lacking. The objective {{of this investigation was}} {{to determine the effects of}} different constant-head laboratory and sampling procedures on anisotropy of saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements. The sequence of Ks measurements was varied (vertical conductivity, Kv, first, then horizontal, Kh, second and vice versa) for an experimental set-up considering five variables: 1) water ponding type (Mariotte or siphon); 2) saturation state prior to experiment start (unsaturated or saturated); 3) experiment duration (long or short); 4) sample geometry or extraction (cube or core); and 5) sample volume. The Mariotte, unsaturated/saturated, long experiment for a single soil cube resulted in unreliable mean anisotropy results, where a differed in sign. Generally, the sequence of measurements had a negligible impact on a for a siphon, saturated, short experiment for a soil cube. Furthermore, different a were obtained by varying the undisturbed soil sample collection procedure (cube vs. core). The conclusion of this investigation was that using a siphon and a short-duration run on an initially saturated <b>cube</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> encased in foam is generally expected to yield reliable bi-directional Ks results. However, a check of the independence of the estimated anisotropy on the order of measurements for the sampled soil is recommended. An alternative procedure to determine a mean anisotropy for an area of interest would be to measure Kv and Kh on different soil cubes. Finally, the ratio between the mean Kh and Kv results varied from a not statistically significant factor of 1. 02 to a statistically significant factor of 1. 95 during the one-year investigation period (five sampling dates). Therefore, anisotropy of this sandy–loam soil varied with time but it was always low or negligible...|$|E
40|$|The Cube Method (CM) and the Modified Cube Method (MCM) were {{developed}} for measuring vertical (Kv) and horizontal (Kh) {{saturated hydraulic conductivity}} of a single soil sample. By these methods, a <b>cube</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> is carved out in situ and a suitable material is applied to enclose the cube in a tightly fitting casing before moving the sample to the laboratory. Problems {{may be associated with}} the use of gypsum, originally used to encase soil. The suitability of molten wax and expandable polyurethane foam to encase a soil cube was tested for a sandy-loam soil. Wax-treated samples yielded lower conductivity results than untreated samples by a maximum factor of 3. 7. The observed discrepancies were attributed, at least in part, to soil pore obstruction phenomena caused by wax. Using foam to fill a gap 60 % full and partially preventing leakage of expanded foam from the gap was found to be appropriate to reach the following objectives: i) filling completely the gap after foam expansion, ii) preventing flow at the boundary between the foam cast and a smooth surface, iii) minimizing both dry and wet soil compaction phenomena during foam expansion, iv) minimizing foam intrusion into exposed pores of 1. 0 x 10 - 3 to 3. 0 x 10 - 3 m (intrusion depth < 2. 0 x 10 - 3 m), and v) allowing removal of any intrusion by the detachment of the set foam from the treated surface. Applying foam to collect undisturbed soil samples yielded Kv results (7. 41 x 10 - 5 – 1. 67 x 10 - 4 m s- 1) falling in the range of a larger number of previously measured conductivities (2. 06 x 10 - 5 – 2. 03 x 10 - 4 m s- 1), and it showed that Kv was 2. 3 times larger than Kh. In conclusion, using wax is not recommended to obtain fully representative soil samples. Foam was a promising encasing material for the investigated soil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Using the HURDAT best track {{analysis}} of track {{and intensity of}} tropical cyclones that made landfall over the continental United States during the satellite era (1980 – 2005), we analyze the role of land surface variables on the cyclone decay process. The land surface variables considered {{in the present study}} included soil parameters (soil heat capacity and its surrogate soil bulk density), roughness, topography and local gradients of topography. The sensitivity analysis was carried out using a data-adaptive genetic algorithm approach that automatically selects the most suitable variables by fitting optimum empirical functions that estimates cyclone intensity decay in terms of given observed variables. Analysis indicates that soil bulk density (soil heat capacity) has a dominant influence on cyclone decay process. The decayed inland cyclone intensities were found to be positively correlated with the <b>cube</b> <b>of</b> the <b>soil</b> bulk density (heat capacity). The impact of the changes in soil bulk density (heat capacity) on the decayed cyclone intensity is higher for higher intensity cyclones. Since soil bulk density is closely related to the soil heat capacity and inversely proportional to the thermal diffusivity, the observed relationship can also be viewed as the influence of cooling rate of the land surface, as well as the transfer of heat and moisture underneath a land-fallin...|$|R
