5|$|At this point, both armies {{began to}} draw apart; {{although}} sporadic fighting continued as night fell, by midnight both forces had disengaged completely. Both army councils met; Essex's plan to force {{his way past}} the Royalists seemed feasible, and many Parliamentarians, loathe {{to give up the}} ground they had taken, fully expected the battle to <b>continue.</b> The Royalists, on the other hand, were plagued by poor morale, heavy losses and a lack of supplies, having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder. Although Rupert argued for the battle to <b>continue,</b> he was out-voted, and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force without issue and <b>continue</b> his retreat towards London.|$|E

40|$|<b>Continued</b> {{fractions}} {{in mathematics}} are mainly known {{due to the}} need for a more detailed presentation of rational and irrational numbers. <b>Continued</b> fractions of rational numbers are finite, while for presentation of irrational numbers, it is necessary to introduce infinite <b>continued</b> fractions. The theoretical part of the master's thesis will, in addition to the presentation of the basic concepts of <b>continued</b> fractions, convergence, and irrationality of a <b>continued</b> fraction, also include a more detailed discussion of the number e, which can be easily expanded into an infinite <b>continued</b> fraction in order to demonstrate its irrationality. We are able to represent irrational numbers in a unique way with an infinite <b>continued</b> fraction, with its finite approximations representing an excellent rational approximation of the number, also called convergents. Hereinafter, we will address periodic <b>continued</b> fractions, and show that an infinite simple <b>continued</b> fraction is a quadratic irrational, if and only if it is periodic. This theoretical content, together with the presentation of the basic algorithm of the computation of <b>continued</b> fractions, will be an introduction to the empirical part. The empirical part will represent the project by means of which we will present <b>continued</b> fractions as an enrichment of the content for teaching mathematics in elementary and secondary schools.
