2500|$|Lee's physician, Donald Langford, and Peter Wu, {{a doctor}} who had treated Lee for another edema ten weeks earlier, {{believed}} that the fatal edema could {{have been caused by}} a rare allergic reaction to an alkaloid in cannabis, as a large quantity of hashish was removed from his stomach during the earlier edema, and he had been warned not to use it again. Wu told the coroner he believed the death was due to hypersensitivity to either cannabis or equagesic. However, Ronald D. Teare, a professor of forensic medicine at the University of London who was flown in to be the chief expert in the coroner's report, said that it was both [...] "irresponsible and irrational" [...] to attribute either edema to cannabis, and concluded the fatal edema was due to a rare reaction to equagesic. Teare, who had supervised nearly 100,000 autopsies and provided evidence for nearly 20,000 inquests in his 35 years of experience, was echoed by R. R. Lycette, the <b>clinical</b> <b>pathologist</b> at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Lycette told the hearing that his death could not have been caused by cannabis, and that Lee had died from an edema caused by a reaction to {{one or both of the}} ingredients in equagesic.|$|E

5000|$|About 2000 {{isolated}} {{human genes}} had been patented in the United States before this case started.
