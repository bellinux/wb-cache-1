40|$|Background: Public {{interest}} in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) has re-mained high since {{the birth of}} the world’s first in vitro fertilization baby, Louise Brown, in the United Kingdom. ART allows scientists to manipulate the fertilization process in order to bypass some pathological obstacles such as blocked fallopian tubes and non-functioning ovaries in the females, and blocked vas deferens and low sperm count in the males. The purpose was to provide a historical outline and identi-fy the researches that most contributed to ART. Methods: A review of published experimental and clinical studies of assisted repro-duction carried out at the University of Bristol library website (MetaLib). A <b>cross-search</b> of seven different medical databases (AMED-Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, BIOSIS Previews on Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Library, Embase, and the Medline on Web of Knowledge, OvidSP and PubMed) was com-pleted by using the key words to explore the major milestones and progress in {{the development and implementation of}} ART. Results: A speedy advancement in the development of different assisted reproduc-tive techniques makes infertility problem more treatable than it ever had been. Conclusion: Although no other field in the medicine has integrated new knowledge into the daily practice more quickly than ART yet, there is a need for social research to counterbalance the dominance of biomedical one, in particular the people’s actual experiences and expectations of ART...|$|E
