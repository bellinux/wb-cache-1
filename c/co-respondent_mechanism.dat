The first part discusses the effects which accession {{will have on the}} system of human rights protection under the ECHR focusing on the most relevant features of the accession agreement, such as the <b>co-respondent</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the prior involvement of the ECJ.

40|$|After the European Union’s {{accession}} to the European Convention on Human Rights the EU will become subject to legally binding judicial {{decisions of the}} European Court of Human Rights and participate in statutory bodies of the Council of Europe when they act under the Convention. The accession negotiations {{have led to the}} establishment of a new <b>co-respondent</b> <b>mechanism,</b> including the possibility to refer a case pending before the ECtHR to the Court of Justice for a ‘preliminary assessment’. Many questions surround the EU’s {{accession to}} the ECHR. In what way is the EU’s position different from the other Contracting Parties? What are the reasons for and consequences of the EU’s primus inter pares position under the Convention and within the Council of Europe? How will the relationship change between the Court of Justice and the ECtHR? What does the EU’s accession mean for its Member States...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOn December 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union adopted one of {{the most}} {{controversial}} decisions in recent decades—the famous Opinion 2 / 13 that precluded the European Union from acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights. This article engages in the analysis of the co-respondent mechanism—{{one of the}} most significant features of the Draft Agreement for the accession of the European Union to the Convention. The <b>co-respondent</b> <b>mechanism</b> was intentionally designed to preserve the specific characteristics of the European Union law by precluding the European Court of Human Rights from solving the complex questions of the internal competence division of the European Union. However, notwithstanding that the European Commission and most of the Member States had not seen any significant threats caused by the mechanism, the Luxembourg court rejected the mechanism due to the European Union’s motives for the protection of autonomy. This article analyzes and assesses the objections presented by the Court...|$|E

The foreseeable accession of the European Union (EU) to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) [as per art 6 (2) of the Treaty on the European Union, TEU] raises important questions regarding {{the extent to which}} amendments to the current EU competition law enforcement system are required. In view of the future (clearer) possibility to bring challenges against judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) —not least, in view of the envisaged <b>co-respondent</b> <b>mechanisms</b> discussed in detail in other contributions of this book—or, at least, the (clearer) mandate for the CJEU to apply the ECHR in full in all its jurisdictional activities; an analysis of the current enforcement mechanisms in that light seems particularly relevant and has triggered substantial attention from academics and practitioners alike.

40|$|The idea of {{accession}} of the European Union to the European Convention on Human rights {{dates back}} to more than 40 years. The aspirations {{to make that happen}} are embodied in a complex process that has been underway for a long period. While all EU member states have already acceded to the Convention (individually), for many reasons it is considered useful for the EU itself to approach it. After numerous and lengthy negotiations, the last step on this path seems to have been made with the adoption of the draft agreement on the accession of the EU to the European Convention. However, only then did the real obstacle emerge. Namely, in December 2014, the Court of Justice adopted a negative advisory opinion concerning the compliance of the aforementioned draft with the Treaty of Lisbon. The Court of Justice has pointed out several key problems on incompatibility of these two acts. In the Opinion of the Court of Justice, the non-compliance is related to: 1) the specificity and autonomy of EU law; 2) the monopoly of jurisdiction of the Court of Justice in the settlement of disputes, in accordance with Art. 344 TFEU; 3) the recently established <b>co-respondent</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights; 4) the procedure for prior involvement of the Court of Justice; and 5) the specificity of the EU law on issues concerning the common foreign and security policy. The question remains how to overcome the deadlock in the process of EU accession to the European Convention of Human Rights, caused by the too rigid and inflexible Opinion of the Court of Justice, and whether the process will be continued at all...|$|E
40|$|Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) {{provides}} that the EU will accede {{to the system}} of human rights protection of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Protocol No 9 in the Treaty of Lisbon opens the way for accession. This represents {{a major change in}} the relationship between two organisations that have co-operated closely in the past, though the ECHR has hitherto exercised only an indirect constitutional control over the EU legal order through scrutiny of EU Member States. The accession of the EU to the ECHR is expected {{to put an end to}} the informal dialogue, and allegedly also competition between the two regimes in Europe and to establish formal (both normative and institutional) hierarchies. In this new era, some old problems will be solved and new ones will appear. Questions of autonomy and independence, of attribution and allocation of responsibility, of co-operation, and legal pluralism will all arise, with consequences for the protection of human rights in Europe. This book seeks to understand how relations between the two organisations are likely to evolve after accession, and whether this new model will bring more coherence in European human rights protection. The book analyses from several different, yet interconnected, points of view and relevant practice the draft Accession Agreement, shedding light on future developments in the ECHR and beyond. Contributions in the book span classic public international law, EU law and the law of the ECHR, and are written by a mix of legal and non-legal experts from academia and practice. [...] 1.
