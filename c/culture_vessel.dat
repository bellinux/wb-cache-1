40|$|Air {{temperature}} within <b>culture</b> <b>vessels</b> is {{a dominant}} factor influencing {{the growth of}} plantlets. A heat transfer model for tissue <b>culture</b> <b>vessels</b> was developed in this study. The heat source for vessels was irradiance from fluorescent tubes. The energy transfer included convective and radiative heat exchanges. In order to validate the model, two types of <b>culture</b> <b>vessels</b> were studied at various light radiation levels. Type-T thermocouples connected to a data logger were used to measure temperatures. The discrepancies between the values predicted by the model and actual measurement values were less than 0. 6 degreesC, and the average absolute error was lower than 0. 4 degreesC. Increasing the surface convection coefficient by increasing ventilation velocity could effectively reduce the greenhouse effect in these small size <b>culture</b> <b>vessels.</b> (C) 2003 Silsoe Research Institute.

40|$|Plant tissue <b>culture</b> <b>vessels</b> {{with their}} caps or {{closures}} made {{the boundaries between}} the internal microenvironment and the external environment of outside air. The physical properties of the vessels and caps or closures affected the growth microenvironment of plantlets by the interface between inside and outside environments. The most important specifications for vessels are to provide uniform and adequate light quality, to isolate contaminating of microorganisms and to allow gas exchange. Seven types of <b>culture</b> <b>vessels</b> were selected in this study. Some physical properties are determined including air exchange rate, transmittance distribution, and spectral irradiance. The results indicated that air exchange rates of <b>culture</b> <b>vessels</b> ranged between 0. 0145 and 0. 0811 h(- 1). The transmittance distribution of vessels with round bases was more uniform than that of vessels with rectangular bases.

40|$|The cloning {{of plants}} can be {{produced}} in <b>culture</b> <b>vessels</b> by a micropropagation technique. It is popular to produce genetically uniform plantlets for the plant production industry to enhance profitability. Many <b>culture</b> <b>vessels</b> {{were placed on the}} shelves and many sets of successive horizontal shelves were arranged in the culture room. The fluorescent tubes installed above the vessels provided the light source for the <b>culture</b> <b>vessels.</b> The distribution uniformity of the lighting systems was very important for maintaining the quantity of plantlets. The model of lighting distribution for plant micropropagation was developed in this study. The photon flux density at different locations under various mounting heights and positions for the luminaries were measured at a full scale of the micropropagation shelf. The fitting agreements of three models were evaluated, including the line model, ribbon model, and empirical regression models. The ribbon model had the best fitting ability. The effect of height and spacing of fluorescent tubes on the distribution uniformity of light photon flux density was evaluated by the sensitivity analysis. (c) 2004 Silsoe Research Institute.

50|$|Environmental aspects for {{single-use}} bioreactors {{are important}} to consider due {{to the amount of}} disposable material used compared with conventional bioreactors. A complete life cycle assessment comparing single-use bioreactors and conventional bioreactors does not exist, but many ecological reasons are supporting the concept of single-use bioreactors. For a complete life cycle assessment not only the manufacturing, but also the repeated use need to be considered. Even the main part of a single-use bioreactor is not a disposable, but will be continuously reused. The plastic bag that is used instead of a <b>culture</b> <b>vessel</b> is a disposable, as well as all the integrated sub-assemblies like sensors, tubing, and stirrers. The bag and all its parts are mainly made from plastics that are derived from petroleum. Current recycling concepts are mainly focused on incineration, to recover the energy originated from the petroleum as heat and electricity. Most of the petroleum would be burned anyway in power plants or automobiles (citation required). Burning of the single use components of bioreactors creates a detour through biochemical engineering during their life cycle that does not have a big influence. The making of conventional culture vessels form stainless steel or glass requires more energy than making plastic bags. Using conventional bioreactors the <b>culture</b> <b>vessel</b> need to be cleaned and sterilized after each fermentation. Cleaning requires large amounts of water, in addition to acids, alkali and detergents. Sterilization with steam at 121 degrees C and 1 bar pressure requires large quantities of energy and large amounts of distilled water. Distilled water in terms of the pharmaceutical grad is called water for injection that must be prepared by spending lots or energy as well.A comparison of the life cycle assessment of conventional and single-use bioreactors looks much more favorable for the single-use bioreactors as expected before. According to a report of A. Sinclair et al. Single-use bioreactors will help to save 30% of electrical energy for operation, 62% of the energy input for the production of the system, 87% of water and finally 95% of detergents, all compared to conventional bioreactors.|$|E

5000|$|A {{turbidostat}} is {{a continuous}} microbiological culture device, {{similar to a}} chemostat or an auxostat, which has feedback between the turbidity of the <b>culture</b> <b>vessel</b> and the dilution rate. [...] The theoretical relationship between growth in a chemostat and growth in a turbidostat is somewhat complex, {{in part because they}} are similar. A chemostat has a fixed volume and flow rate, and thus a fixed dilution rate. A turbidostat dynamically adjusts the flow rate (and therefore the dilution rate) to make the turbidity constant. At equilibrium, operation of both the chemostat and turbidostat are identical. It is only when classical chemostat assumptions are violated (for instance, out of equilibrium; or the cells are mutating) that a turbidostat is functionally different. One case may be while cells are growing at their maximum growth rate, in which case it is difficult to set a chemostat to the appropriate constant dilution rate.|$|E

Discrepancies occur, however, concerning the agents and the concentrations that are optimal.

Sulfhydryl oxidation varied according to the type of culture medium, the size of the <b>culture</b> <b>vessels,</b> the volume of the culture medium, and the gaseous environment within the <b>culture</b> <b>vessels,</b> as well as the method of extracting treponmes from infected testicular tissue.

50|$|As culture growth occurs, {{carbon dioxide}} is {{produced}} and released through a vent {{at the top of}} the loop. A heat exchanger, located in the union between the towers at their base, allows excess heat generated by the culture to be removed. One tower within the pair contains a sparge bar, also located towards the tower's base. Air and ammonia are injected through the sparge bar to provide the oxygen and nitrogen required for respiration and protein production. This sparging action causes the pair of towers to function as an air lift <b>culture</b> <b>vessel.</b> The broth continually circulates between the two towers; as it is driven upwards by the sparge bar in one tower, it falls in the opposing tower. Such a stirring (or circulating) method can be more preferable for biological cultures as it is less likely to cause damage to cell membranes by mechanical compression or abrasion. The denser Fusarium venenatum culture falls to the base of the loop, where it is removed and heated to 64 °C for 20 minutes. Filtration is used to harvest the Fusarium venenatum, with this then being dried prior to blending with a binder. The majority of Quorn products are bound by rehydrated egg white, which makes them unsuitable for a vegan diet. However, Quorn has been reducing its egg white usage and now offers an egg-free alternative.|$|E
