His experiments soon led to remarkable results. In 1836, he invented a primary cell in which hydrogen was eliminated in the generation of the electricity. Daniell had solved the problem of polarization. In his laboratory he had learned to alloy the amalgamated zinc of Sturgeon with mercury.

2500|$|The short dipole, with a {{feedpoint}} {{current of}} I0, has an average <b>current</b> <b>over</b> each conductor of only I0/2. The above field equations for the Hertzian dipole of length δℓ would then predict the actual fields {{for a short}} dipole using that effective current I = I0/2. This {{would result in a}} power measured in the far field of one quarter that given by the above equation for the Poynting vector [...] if we had assumed an element current of I0. Consequently, {{it can be seen that}} the radiation resistance computed for the short dipole is one quarter of that computed above for the Hertzian dipole. But their radiation patterns (and gains) are identical.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the case}} in which sand {{fraction}} is transported by the <b>current</b> <b>over</b> and through an immobile gravel bed, Kuhnle et al.(2013), following the theoretical analysis done by Pellachini (2011), provides a new relationship for the bed load transport of the sand fraction when gravel particles remain at rest. It is worth mentioning that Kuhnle et al. (2013) applied the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002) formula to their experimental data {{and found out that}} predicted bed load rates of sand fraction were about 10 times greater than measured and approached 1 as the sand elevation became {{near the top of the}} gravel layer. They, also, hypothesized that the mismatch between predicted and measured sand bed load rates is due to the fact that the bed shear stress used for the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002) formula [...] was larger than that available for transport within the gravel bed because of the sheltering effect of the gravel particles.|$|E

It is, in some sort, younger brother of another great and often-used word, Nature, whose history also waits unwritten.

At <b>currents</b> <b>over</b> 300 amperes, {{the surface of the}} weld pool becomes markedly depressed and the assumption of a flat surface is no longer valid. In order to predict the weld pool geometry, the shape of the surface depression under the action of the arc pressure has been calculated. At currents of 300 amperes, it is found that the arc pressure cannot account for either the depth or the shape of the experirl) entally observed surface depres-sion.

But {{the result}} which {{is found to}} be so {{striking}} in the instances quoted is not at all borne out by reference to other cases where a similar consequence might have been expected. It may be said, that my own theory of electro-chemical decomposition would lead to the expectation that all compound bodies should give way {{under the influence of the}} electric current with a facility proportionate to the strength of the affinity by which their elements, either proximate or ultimate, are combined. I am not sure that that follows as a consequence of the theory; but if the objection is supposed to be one presented by the facts, I have no doubt it will be removed when we obtain a more intimate acquaintance with, and precise idea of, the nature of chemical affinity and the mode of action of an electric <b>current</b> <b>over</b> it (518. 524.): besides which, it is just as directly opposed to any other theory of electro-chemical decomposition as the one I have propounded; for if it be admitted, as is generally the case, that the more directly bodies are opposed to each other in their attractive forces, the more powerfully do they combine, then the objection applies with equal force to any of the theories of electrolyzation which have been considered, and is an addition to those which I have taken against them.|$|E
