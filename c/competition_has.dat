5|$|The <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> {{had several}} {{different}} formats over its lifetime. Initially, the {{champions of the}} Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Libertadores contested it. In 1998, the Supercopa Libertadores was discontinued and the Recopa went into a hiatus. The <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> been disputed with either a presently-used two-legged series or a single match-up at a neutral venue. Together with the aforementioned tournaments, a club has the {{chance to win the}} CONMEBOL Treble all in one year or season.|$|E
5|$|However, the <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> {{had many}} {{secondary}} sponsors {{that invest in}} the tournament as well. Many of these sponsors are nationally based but have expanded to other nations. Nike supplies the official match ball, as they do for all other CONMEBOL competitions. Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising, even if such sponsors conflict {{with those of the}} Recopa Sudamericana.|$|E
5|$|Generally for {{usage of}} 12-6 elbows, {{the fight is}} stopped and fighters are given a warning. However, there have been {{occasions}} where points have been deducted or the fighter using that strike in <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> been disqualified due to the move incapacitating fighters. In 2009, Matt Hamill defeated Jon Jones by disqualification due to Jones using 12-6 elbows. Hamill {{said that he was}} unable to defend against the elbows.|$|E

5|$|Homer and Burns are {{beset by}} cabin fever {{and attempt to}} kill each other. After a vicious struggle, Burns ignites the cabin's propane tank, {{launching}} the building out of the snow and propelling it toward the horrified onlookers. Once {{it comes to a}} halt, Burns reminds everyone of the contest, and all the workers hurry inside. Lenny is the last person in the cabin, and is fired. Burns is informed that the completion time of the <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> set a new record, and decides that no one will be fired after all.|$|E
5|$|Like the FIFA World Cup, {{nowadays}} the Copa Libertadores {{is sponsored}} {{by a group of}} multinational corporations. However, unlike the World Cup, the <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> a single, main sponsor for naming rights; it is currently primarily sponsored by Bridgestone Corporation. This sponsorship deal for naming rights is for a period of 5 years and began with the 2012 edition. Thus, the competition is known officially as the '"Copa Bridgestone Libertadores'".|$|E
5|$|Netball's {{important}} {{competition is}} the World Netball Championships (also {{known as the}} Netball World Cup), held every four years. It was first held in 1963 at the Chelsea College of Physical Education at Eastbourne, England, with 11 nations competing. Since its inception the <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> been dominated primarily by the Australian and New Zealand teams, which hold ten and four titles, respectively. Trinidad and Tobago is the only other team {{to win a championship}} title. That title, won in 1979, was shared with New Zealand and Australia; all three teams finished with equal points {{at the end of the}} round robin, and there were no finals.|$|E

Other top-flight Spanish clubs have also occasionally been invited, including Tenerife and Valencia, who were winners in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Since 1997, the <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> only featured a one-off game, the tournament being shortened {{due to an}} increased fixture list and a shorter close season. If the match is tied after 90 minutes, no extra-time is played {{and the winner is}} decided by a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|The Carl Nielsen International Competition {{commenced}} in the 1970s {{under the}} auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra. A four-yearly violin <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued. An international Organ Competition, founded by the city of Odense, became associated with the Nielsen competition in 2009, but from 2015 will be organized separately, based in Odense Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> had an {{official}} website since 1999. Webcasts {{have been provided}} since 2005.

5|$|The {{competition}} {{was established in}} 1978 by Humphrey Burton, Walter Todds and Roy Tipping, {{former members of the}} BBC Television Music Department. Michael Hext, a trombonist, was the inaugural winner. In 1994, the usage of percussion instruments was first permitted, alongside the existing keyboard, string, brass and woodwind categories.

5|$|In 1909 the {{newspaper}} La Gazzetta dello Sport established the Giro d'Italia, {{inspired by the}} success of the Tour de France, which started in 1903. The first Giro was won by Luigi Ganna, while Carlo Galetti won the two following Giros. In 1912, there was no individual classification, instead there was only a team classification, which was won by Team Atala. The 1912 Giro is the only time the <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> not had an individual classification. From 1914 onwards the scoring format was changed from a points-based system to a time-based system, in which the cyclist who had the lowest aggregate time {{at the end of the}} race would win. The Giro was suspended for four years from 1915 to 1918, due to the First World War. Costante Girardengo was the winner of the first Giro after the war in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The Ryder Cup is contested in a {{match play}} format, which {{involves}} different {{methods of the}} format. A foursomes match is contested with two members from each team playing alternate shots. A fourball match consists of two players from either team, who each play their own shot throughout the round. The player that completes {{the hole in the}} lowest number of shots wins the hole. Singles matches are also played, with players from each team contesting a one-on-one match. The winner of each match scores a point for their team, if a match is tied after 18 holes then each team is awarded a ½ point. The format of the <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> changed throughout its history. Originally, foursome matches were played one day, with singles matches over 36 holes the next. Since 1979, the format has consisted of 28 matches held over three days, with each match worth a point. The first two days consist of eight matches; four foursomes and four fourball matches. The final day sees all 12 members of each team competing in singles matches.|$|E
5|$|The Tri Nations {{was created}} between the SANZAR {{partners}} (along with the provincial Super 12 competition, now, Super Rugby). The tournament involves three southern hemisphere nations; Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

It has subsequently been held annually. The <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> largely been dominated by New Zealand, who have won 10 championships, whereas Australia and South Africa have each won the series three times.

5|$|The first {{continental}} competition organised by UEFA was the European Cup in 1955. Conceived by Gabriel Hanot, {{the editor}} of L'Équipe, as a competition for winners of the European national football leagues, it is considered the most prestigious European football competition. That year, Benfica had won the Primeira Divisão, but the competition organizers selected Sporting CP {{to take part in}} the first edition. Another club competition, the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, was established in 1955 and contested in parallel with the European Cup. It eventually came under the auspices of UEFA in 1971, which rebranded it to UEFA Cup. Since the 2009–10 season, the <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> been known as the UEFA Europa League.|$|E
5|$|The first {{continental}} competition organised by UEFA was the European Cup in 1955. Conceived by Gabriel Hanot, {{the editor}} of L'Équipe, as a competition for winners of the European national football leagues, it is considered the most prestigious European football competition. When the European Cup was first played, Liverpool were in the Second Division, following relegation from the First Division after the 1953–54 season, and thus were ineligible for the competition. During {{their time in the}} Second Division, two further competitions were created: the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. Established in 1955, the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was later re-branded as the UEFA Cup when it came under the auspices of UEFA in 1971. Since the 2009–10 season, the <b>competition</b> <b>has</b> been known as the UEFA Europa League. The UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was inaugurated in 1960 for the winners of domestic cup competitions.|$|E
