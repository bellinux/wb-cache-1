5000|$|The suicide clutch is {{sometimes}} incorrectly called a suicide shifter. The suicide clutch is a foot-operated clutch that {{is mounted on}} the left side of the motorcycle's forward foot controls. The suicide-clutch moniker has derived from difficulties in operating this form of clutch and shifter. On a motorcycle equipped with a conventional hand clutch and foot shifter, the rider places the left foot on the ground when stopped and holds the motorcycle in place with pressure on the rear brake pedal with the right foot, while engaging the clutch with the left hand. On a motorcycle equipped with a suicide clutch, the clutch is held in with the left foot, requiring the right foot to hold the bike in place, with the right hand applying pressure to the front brake. Early Harley Davidson foot clutches used an over-center spring to hold the clutch pedal in the disengaged position and used a friction disc to allow the rider to adjust the sensitivity of the return. Often riders removed the spring to keep the clutch pedal from returning to the disengaged position while riding. While this spring removal allowed for the clutch to stay engaged better, it also removed the safety feature of the clutch pedal holding itself in the disengaged position. With the pedal not returning to its natural disengaged position, the rider must either shift into neutral or hold the clutch pedal with the left foot when coming to a stop. Early Harley Davidson racers removed the <b>clutch</b> <b>return</b> spring to ensure the clutch stayed in the engaged position throughout the race. This practice soon caught on with other riders. The term [...] "suicide clutch" [...] was coined by those who could not operate the foot clutch proficiently enough to ride a tank shift (or hand shift) motorcycle in normal traffic.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the propagation of their offspring, female scissortail sergeant must also actively select for good fathers. Female fish utilize multiple strategies in order to select for male parental quality: important factors include mate size, courtship rates, and male cannibalism. Some females will monitor a male's parental quality by laying small clutches of “test eggs” in a male's territory. This unusual tactic is a direct way for females to confirm the parenting ability of males who {{do not yet have}} any eggs in their brood. Females only lay one test <b>clutch</b> and <b>return</b> shortly after laying it. Capable males prove their parental quality by defending the brood and not cannibalizing the eggs.

40|$|Abstract: A typical {{clutch system}} for {{automotive}} manual transmissions transfers hydraulic pressure generated by driver's pedal manipulation to the clutch diaphragm spring. The foot effort history {{during the period}} of push is different than the period of the <b>clutch</b> pedal’s <b>return.</b> The effort or load difference is called clutch foot effort hysteresis. It is known that the hysteresis is caused by friction. The frictional force and moment are produced between various component contact points such as between the rubber seal and the inner wall inside the hydraulic cylinder and between the diaphragm spring and the pressure plate, etc. Understanding the clutch pedal foot effort hysteresis is essential for a clutch release system design and analysis. The dynamic model for a clutch release system is developed for the foot effort hysteresis prediction and a simulation analysis is performed to propose a tool for analysing a clutch system...|$|R

40|$|Because the {{maintenance}} of proper developmental temperatures during avian incubation is costly to parents, embryos of many species experience pronounced variation in incubation temperature. However, the effects of such temperature variation on nestling development remain relatively unexplored. To investigate this, we artificially incubated wild blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus L.) clutches at 35. 0 °, 36. 5 °, or 38. 0 °C for two-thirds of the incubation period. We <b>returned</b> <b>clutches</b> to their original nests before hatching and subsequently recorded nestling growth and resting metabolic rate. The length of the incubation period decreased with temperature, whereas hatching success increased. Nestlings from the lowest incubation temperature group had shorter tarsus lengths at 2 weeks of age, but body mass and wing length were not affected by temperature. In addition, nestlings from the lowest temperature group had a significantly higher resting metabolic rate compared with mid- and high-temperature nestlings, which may partly explain observed size differences between the groups. These findings suggest that nest microclimate can influence nestling phenotype, but whether observed differences carry over to later life-history stages remains unknown...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBreeding at {{the right}} time is {{important}} for successful reproduction. In birds, stressful environmental conditions are known to delay the timing of breeding but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The stress hormone corticosterone appears to be a good candidate for mediating egg-laying date according to early environmental conditions and physiological state. By experimentally reducing the release of corticosterone in black-legged kittiwakes during the pre-laying period, we tested whether egg-laying date was mechanistically linked to corticosterone levels. Male and female kittiwakes were implanted with a low dose of exogenous corticosterone to inhibit endogenous corticosterone production. According to our predictions, the experimental reduction of corticosterone release was paralleled by a significant advancement of egg laying in females (around 4 days earlier). In addition, females with experimentally reduced corticosterone release gained mass during the pre-laying period compared with controls. Ultimately, the advancement of egg laying in females with experimentally reduced corticosterone levels was associated with an enhanced breeding success. This effect was strongly sex specific. In corticosterone-treated male kittiwakes, egg-laying date and reproductive success were not affected, but breeding probability was lower than in controls. This corticosterone treatment did not influence immediate <b>clutch</b> size, or <b>return</b> rate and breeding decision the following year. Our results support the hypothesis that corticosterone secretion during the pre-laying period mediates the timing of breeding in this long-lived seabird, possibly through the dynamics of energy reserves...|$|R

The definitive version is available at [URL] monitoring {{is an essential part}} of evaluating the effectiveness of management interventions for conservation. Coastal breeding aggregations of marine vertebrate species that come ashore to pup or nest provide an opportunistic window of observation into otherwise widely dispersed populations. Green turtle (Chelonia mydas) nesting on the north and west coasts of northern Cyprus has been monitored consistently and exhaustively since 1993, with an intensive saturation tagging programme running at one key site for the same duration. This historically depleted nesting population is showing signs of recovery, possibly in response to nest protection approaching two decades, with increasing nest numbers and rising levels of recruitment. Strong correlation between year to year magnitude of nesting and the proportion of new breeders in the nesting cohort implies that recruitment of new individuals to the breeding population is an important driver of this recovery trend. Recent changes in fishing activities may be impacting the local juvenile neritic stage, however, which may hinder this potential recovery. Individuals returning to breed after 2 years laid fewer <b>clutches</b> than those <b>returning</b> after 3 or 4 years, demonstrating a trade-off between remigration interval and breeding output. Average clutch frequencies have remained stable around a median of three clutches a year per female despite the demographic shift towards new nesters, which typically lay fewer clutches in their first season. We show that where local fecundity has been adequately assessed, the use of average clutch frequencies can be a reliable method for deriving nester abundance from nest counts.

40|$|Current theory {{concerning}} {{the evolution of}} parental care posits that {{one or both of}} the sexes may reduce parental care when the fitness gained from alternative reproductive opportunities exceeds that from continuing with parental care. If this situation leads to a difference between the sexes in potential rate of reproduction, intra-sexual competition for mates will occur in the sex with the higher potential reproductive rate, and the other sex will display mate choice (called inter-sexual selection). In the majority of avian species biparental care is the most common form of parental care. Polygyny is the most common consequence of polygamy; males compete for access to females and females exercise mate choice. Sex-role reversal is rare (ca. 3 % of species in the world) but presents an opportunity to test the basis of theories of the evolution of parental care and sexual selection. This thesis presents the results of a three-year study of sexual selection and sex-role reversal in a breeding population of the Eurasian dotterel, Charadrius morinellus, in the Cairngorm region of Scotland. In this species, the female is the competitive sex and the male usually provides all of the parental care; females are sequentially polyandrous. Dotterel are dependent on a widely dispersed breeding habitat. Rather than defending territories, females compete for access to males on mating arenas (Chapter 2). After producing a <b>clutch,</b> females <b>return</b> to the arenas in order to compete for further males, this leads to a female-biased skew in the operational sex ratio (Chapter 3). The proximate factors which produces the skew in the sex ratio predict the temporal variation in the potential for sexual selection (Chapter 3). There is considerable intra-sexual plumage variation which is correlated with behavioural variability (Chapter 4). Bright females are more aggressive than dull females and thus initiate and win more fights (Chapter 4). Bright females also perform more courtship than do dull females and therefore get mates earlier in the season, as, via assortative mating, do bright males (Chapter 4). Females are, however, also the more choosy sex; females prefer to court bright males which are, in turn, likely to be in better physical condition than duller males (Chapter 4). Bright males are less likely to desert the clutch in bad weather conditions (Chapter 5). Females therefore appear to choose males on the basis of their ability to incubate their clutch. Male dotterel, because of their high level of parental care and relatively low potential rate of reproduction, are expected to exhibit behaviour which has been selected to protect their paternity. This prediction is upheld; male dotterel assure paternity of the brood for which they care through a combined strategy of prolonged, close mate-guarding and strategically timing copulations to the few days immediately before egg-laying (Chapter 6). Active female choice for male quality related to phenotypic traits which are also influenced by the environment is contrary to the predictions of the conventional theory of mate choice. In sex-role reversed species, because the potential reproductive rate of the male is lower, male choice is expected. A new model of mate choice is introduced and used to study the effects of differences between the sexes in both the relative potential reproductive rate and relative variation in mate quality (Chapter 7). This model is successful in predicting the form of mate choice observed for all permutations of variation in potential reproductive rate and mate quality. Finally, sex-role reversed mating arenas are compared with polygynous lekking (Chapters 3, 4, 7). Constraints on the potential reproductive rate of females determine that the direction of mate choice will only rarely be reversed in non-territorial sex-role reversed species (Chapter 7). Therefore, although the mating arenas of dotterel resemble leks, an important component of true lekking, active mate choice by the non-competitive sex, is absent...|$|R
