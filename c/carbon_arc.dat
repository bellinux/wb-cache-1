5|$|Thorium was {{discovered}} in 1828; its first application came in 1885, when Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle, a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels.

5|$|Lanthanum {{has a low}} to {{moderate}} level of toxicity and should be handled with care. The injection of lanthanum solutions produces hyperglycemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in <b>carbon</b> <b>arc</b> light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to pneumoconiosis. As the La3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies. Lanthanum, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, it acts as a painkiller, similarly to morphine and other opiates, though the mechanism behind this is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{principles}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding began to be understood in the early 19th century, after Humphry Davy discovered the short pulsed electric arcs in 1800. Vasily Petrov independently produced the continuous electric arc in 1802 (followed by Davy after 1808). It was not until the 1880s that the technology became developed with the aim of industrial usage. At first, carbon electrodes were used in <b>carbon</b> <b>arc</b> welding. By 1890, metal electrodes had been invented by Nikolay Slavyanov and C. L. Coffin. In 1920, an early predecessor of GMAW was invented by P. O. Nobel of General Electric. It used a bare electrode wire and direct current, and used arc voltage to regulate the feed rate. It did not use a shielding gas to protect the weld, as developments in welding atmospheres did not take place until later that decade. In 1926 another forerunner of GMAW was released, but it was not suitable for practical use.|$|E

Prior {{to the use of}} antibiotics, the primary treatment for tuberculosis was fresh air and sunshine. There was some evidence that sun tanning did help in the remission of the disease, but Perrysburgâ40 miles south of Buffaloâhad very little sunshine in the winter. Therefore, O'Brien, as a physicist on staff, developed a <b>carbon</b> <b>arcs</b> with cored <b>carbons</b> that very closely matched the solar spectrum. With this development the patients could have sun therapy year-round. Due to a general interest in biological effects of solar radiation, he published some of the early work on the ozone layer and erythema caused by the sun.|$|R

In 1956 he moved to Oak Ridge TN to become a research scientist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. MacPherson became deputy director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1965, a position he held until 1970. From 1970 to 1976 he held the position of Professor of Nuclear Engineering at the University of Tennessee.

25|$|In 1800 Sir Humphry Davy {{discovered}} the short pulsed electric arcs. Independently a Russian physicist Vasily Petrov {{discovered the}} continuous electric arc in 1802 and subsequently proposed its possible practical applications, including welding. Arc welding was first developed when Nikolai Benardos presented arc welding of metals using a carbon electrode at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris in 1881, which was patented together with StanisÅaw Olszewski in 1887. In the same year, French electrical inventor Auguste de MÃ©ritens also invented a <b>carbon</b> <b>arc</b> welding method, patented in 1881, which was successfully used for welding {{lead in the}} manufacture of lead-acid batteries. The advances in arc welding continued with the invention of metal electrodes in the late 19th century by a Russian, Nikolai Slavyanov (1888), and an American, C. L. Coffin. Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger released in Britain a coated metal electrode which gave a more stable arc. In 1905 Russian scientist Vladimir Mitkevich proposed the usage of three-phase electric arc for welding. In 1919, alternating current welding was invented by C.J. Holslag but did not become popular for another decade.|$|E
25|$|For {{industrial}} areas, {{fires and}} lighting were simulated. It {{was decided to}} recreate normal residential street lighting, and in non-essential areas, lighting to recreate heavy industrial targets. In those sites, <b>carbon</b> <b>arc</b> lamps were used to simulate the flash of tram cables. Red lamps were used to simulate blast furnaces and locomotive fireboxes. Reflections made by factory skylights were created by placing lights under angled wooden panels. The use of diversionary techniques such as fires {{had to be made}} carefully. The fake fires could only begin when the bombing started over an adjacent target and its effects were brought under control. Too early and the chances of success receded; too late and the real conflagration at the target would exceed the diversionary fires. Another innovation was the boiler fire. These units were fed from two adjacent tanks containing oil and water. The oil-fed fires were then injected with water from time to time; the flashes produced were {{similar to those of the}} German C-250 and C-500 Flammbomben. The hope was that, if it could deceive German bombardiers, it would draw more bombers away from the real target.|$|E

However, common traits of the investigated equilibrium descriptions lead to useful conclusions...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{trend in}} thin film {{deposition}} {{is to prepare}} ceramic films capable of enduring violent environments, such as corrosive pollutant gases with high temperatures. Different kinds of plasma species existing in the same space are advantageous {{in order to facilitate}} a reactive deposition between the gaseous and metallic species. In this paper, we study a <b>carbon</b> shunting <b>arc</b> that triggers a gas discharge using a positively biased electrode. An electrode with a positive voltage of up to 500 V was set nearby the <b>carbon</b> shunting <b>arc</b> source. Nitrogen, methane, or argon was used as an ambient gas. The induced plasma was generated with a time delay from the moment of the generation of the shunting arc. The electrical and optical characteristics of the discharge were studied. The onset time of the induced plasma {{as a function of the}} ambient gas pressure has a Paschen-like V-shaped characteristic. The generated plasma includes both carbon and gaseous species. At the surface of the positively biased electrode, both spectrum emissions of carbon and gaseous species are observed, by which the plasma is confirmed to be mixed. This is based on the spectrum observation in addition to the change in the color of the plasma. A shunting arc is an easy method used in generating a hybrid plasma consisting of metallic (including carbon) and gaseous species. This method promises to efficiently prepare ceramic films by reactive deposition. This method is simple, and both plasma species, i. e., those of metal and gas particles, are easily mixed. The <b>carbon</b> shunting <b>arc</b> plasma plays both the roles of supplying the carbon species and triggering a gaseous plasma as an induced plasma...|$|R
