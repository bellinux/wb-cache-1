40|$|This article {{examines}} {{some of the}} institutional conditions that facilitated the development of equity markets in Brazil. A critical factor was the addition to corporate bylaws of protections for investors, which enabled relatively large corporations in Brazil to attract investors in large numbers. By availing themselves of this strategy, the firms generated a relatively low concentration of ownership before 1910. Archival evidence, such as <b>company</b> <b>statutes</b> and shareholder lists, reveals that the addition of voting rights to their bylaws, particularly maximum-vote provisions and graduated voting scales (which stipulated that less-than-proportional votes increase in parallel with shareholdings), allowed many Brazilian corporations to balance the relative voting power of their small and large investors. In companies that made such arrangements, the concentration of ownership and control was sharply lower than in the average company. Judging by the Brazilian companies examined for this article, it also appears that the concentration of control was significantly lower before 1910 than it is today. ...|$|E
40|$|In summary, a new {{business}} form combining corporate limited liability and partnership pass-through taxation is {{well on its way}} to becoming the preferred form for conducting business. The new limited liability company possesses many advantages, with few disadvantages, over alternative forms of ownership. With this {{new business}} form also comes questions concerning ethical behavior and public relations problems. Over time, these issues will be encountered and further approached by upholding professional and ethical standards and by helping third parties understand the benefits of this new business form. While still growing in recognition and adoption, new limited liability companies have the ability to expand the options of business formations, add a new perspective in accounting for this issue, while also providing benefits for all parties involved with this preferred form of business. A limited liability company is a hybrid business form where the corporate characteristic of owner�s limited liability and the partnership characteristic of pass-through taxation are combined. The number of states permitting this new legal form for conducting business is rapidly expanding. From the beginning of 1993 to the end of 1993, the number of states that have passed legislation permitting the limited liability company legal form has risen from 18 to 36 states. Simply passing a state law providing limited liability company status does not ensure that partnership taxation will exist. According to section 7701 (a) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations, a business entity will be considered an association and taxed as a corporation if it possesses a majority of the following four characteristics: 1) Continuity of Life 2) Centralized Management 3) Limited Liability 4) Free Transferability of Interests A limited liability company always possesses the characteristic of limited liability and must therefore avoid at least two of the remaining three characteristics. In most limited liability company cases it was found that the two characteristics avoided the most were continuity of life and free transferability of interests. Limited liability company cases are usually determined on an individual basis because of the different tax treatment existing from state to state. Some states have adopted rigid limited liability <b>company</b> <b>statutes</b> while other state have adopted flexible statutes. States allowing centralized management, but not continuity of life or transferability of interests have adopted rigid limited liability rules. The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that the limited liability companies formed in these states are to be treated as partnerships. In contrast, states allowing the adoption of any or all of the corporate characteristics of centralized management, continuity of life, or transferability of interests have adopted flexible limited liability company rules. The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that the limited liability companies formed in these states are to be treated as corporations or partnerships based on individual cases. As most new developments and changes in the business world are encountered for the first time, the issue of ethical considerations also become apparent. What are the effects of changes in business forms, either to limited liability companies or from limited liability companies to another business form? What is an accountant�s responsibility, professionally and ethically, to obtain information discovered, but not voluntarily given, concerning such a change in business form? The following case, taken from West�s Federal Taxation, demonstrates the issue of an accountant�s responsibility to inquire of structure changes. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Labour Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{purpose of}} this mini-dissertation is to explore the labour law {{consequences}} when a director of a company is dismissed. The underlying questions that come forward are: What legislation protects the director in his various roles? What remedies are available? Is a director an employee and can his office as director be distinguished from his post as employee? A company as a separate entity is compelled to perform its corporate functions by means of its directors, officials and employees. The mere fact {{that a person is}} the director of a company does not mean that he is a representative or an employee. A director will be an employee once he enters into a contract of employment. A director that performs personal services and is responsible to the board 1 s held to be an employee. The <b>company</b> <b>statutes</b> regulate the appointment and removal of a director, thus the shareholders are responsible for the decision. In terms of the common law the appointment of a company director is complete when a person with the competence to appoint a director makes the appointment and the appointee accepts the offer. The removal of a director must be substantively fair, the true and valid reasons for the removal must thus be given. The removal must also be procedurally fair, this entails that certain steps must be taken. Failure to comply with this makes the dismissal unfair. The dismissal of a senior employee is not an exception to the rule; that a fair hearing procedure must still be complied with. I shall briefly discuss several cases on the courts' view of a director as an employee of the company. In PG Group (Pty) Ltd v Mbambo NO & others 2005 1 BLLR 71 (LC) the labour court found that section 213 of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 is formulated wide enough to encompass most directors. In Oak Industries (SA) (Pty) Ltd v John NO & Another 1987 8 ILJ 756 the court ruled that there is no absolute rule stating that a director cannot be an employee; notwithstanding any definition of the word employee in legislature. In Sage v Fourwinds Transporl CO (Pty) Ltd 1994 8 BLLR 114 (IC) the Industrial court ruled that an employee is an employee in spite of his status in the organisation. Lastly in Pearson v Sheerbonnet South Africa (Pty) Ltd 1999 7 BLLR 703 (LC) was the director held to be an employee on the grounds that he had an employment contract with the company. The entity towards which the director owes fiduciary duties is the company. There is no standard of competence, rights or duties attached to the office of director. These are determined by the companies' statutes. memorandum of association, the common law and the applicable contract. The common law requires the director to exercise his duties in good faith and to the advantage of the company and he also has a duty to take reasonable care. The director's common law and statutory duties exist as one. There is no prescript in the statute or clause in a contract that can free a director of responsibility towards the company that develops out of his negligence, failure or dereliction of duty. Section 248 of the Company Act 61 of 1973 frees a director where it appears that he acted honestly and reasonably. The mere fact that the court disagrees with the director is not a ground for responsibility. The director is responsible for the company damages when he does not use the necessary skill and care. Any legal competent person can be a company director. Section 218 (l) (d) (iii) of the Company Act 61 of 1973 compels the court to refuse to grant permission to a person to act as a company director if the person was found guilty of theft, fraud, perjury or any crime that includes dishonesty in terms of the founding or management of a company and is sent to jail with or without the option of a fine or is fined more than R 100.
