25|$|In 2006, {{after the}} {{controversial}} 2004 BCCI election scandal involving Sharad Pawar's defeat to {{election to the}} office of president of the board at the hands of Agashe, the bank business started having financial troubles. Many sources claimed Agashe's actions may have been deliberate. Some sources also claimed that Agashe's business supposedly failed as backlash for thwarting Pawar's ambitions for presidency. In September of that same year, the <b>cooperative</b> <b>bank</b> was put under moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India. The board of directors for the bank was superseded soon after. In 2007, following the order of moratorium, the State Department of Cooperation appointed Mukund Ghaisas as administrator at the bank. Many of the bank's depositors held demonstrations at Agashe's Aundh residence and threatened criminal actions against the Agashe family, after which a speedy merger was promised by Agashe. Initial NPAs totaled Rs. 125 crore, 13% against the seven per cent maximum allowable under the RBI norms. After the non-performing assets of the bank grew to more than 43%, account holders and depositors held a day long token fast to protest against the misinformation provided in regards to the alleged duped loans. In 2008, the RBI gave the bank permission to pay interest on deposits made from January to June 2008; Agashe mortgaged personal property worth Rs. 200 crore in lieu of the recovery of the deposits worth Rs. 725 crore. Hotel Ranjeet, a hotel owned by Agashe was auctioned off for the same reasons. Cosmos Bank planned to acquire the bank after it hit this roadblock with the RBI and the subsequent announcement of the proposed merger with Cosmos led to large-scale panic withdrawals by Suvarna customers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cooperative</b> <b>banks,</b> as {{a social}} economy institution, have a special {{relationship}} with sustainability. Given the lack of previous studies, we aim to develop an exploratory analysis on sustainability reporting in European <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks.</b> On one hand, we studied the sustainability reporting evolution {{to know whether the}} crisis influenced on this practice. On the other hand, we compared cooperative reports with banks' reports. Moreover, we analysed the sustainability reports content to know what information is disclosed by <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks.</b> The results show that although the number of cooperative banks' reports is low, it responds to the weight in the European market. They also illustrate the late incorporation of <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> into sustainability reporting (consequence of their conservative nature). We cannot conclude that differences between <b>banks</b> and <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> were significant, but -in relation to private banks- cooperatives stand out in the use of latest standards, integrated reporting and best application levels. Regarding to the content of sustainability reports, <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> provide more social issues than economic or environmental issues. In the current situation, disclosing information about sustainability would help to reinforce the stakeholders' trust...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to empirically {{investigate}} the performance of different types of Italian banks before and during the recent credit crisis with an emphasis on the behaviour of <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks.</b> It is well established in theory that <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> follow more conservative business strategies and care more for stakeholders in comparison to commercial banks. On this background, the paper tries to show the empirical effects of those characteristics on the <b>cooperative</b> <b>bank’s</b> performance during financial distress compared to commercial banks. In fact, the paper can prove that Italian <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> were less exposed to the shocks of the crisis and showed a better performance...|$|R
