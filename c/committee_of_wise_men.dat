25|$|On 7 November 1951, Johannes Henricus van Maarseveen, Minister of the Interior, {{suddenly}} died. Prime Minister Drees {{appealed to}} Beel {{to return to}} office. Again reluctantly, Beel accepted Prime Minister Drees' offer. He also held the function of Minister of the Interior in the next Drees-cabinet after the elections of 1952. In July 1956 Beel asked that he be allowed to resign from government to become, as a private citizen, chairman <b>of</b> a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> three <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> that was requested by Queen Juliana and the Consort Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld to help solve problems pertaining to the Royal Family. The problems were related to faith healer Greet Hofmans, whom the Queen had invited to the royal palace in order to cure her youngest daughter, who had been born half blind in 1947. The renowned German magazine Der Spiegel had accused Mrs. Hofmans of playing a 'Rasputin' role in the Royal Family. Within a month the committee had fulfilled its task by writing a secret report, which banished the sensitive affair from publicity. Three months later Beel was appointed Minister of State, a prestigious title of honour.|$|R
25|$|In spring 1417 he {{was sent}} as an envoy to Milan to {{complain}} about the occupation of Lodi, Como, and other places whose autonomy had been guaranteed by Venice. Then he was appointed rector at Zara, where he remained until late 1418. Upon completion of his term there, he was again selected as Avogador de Comùn. In September 1419, he was elected as one <b>of</b> the <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> five <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> (Savi di Terraferma) charged with overseeing the final phase of the Venetian conquest of Dalmatia and Friuli. As Sigismund was preoccupied with dealing with the Hussite Rebellion, the Venetians moved in to secure their claims on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea. Loredan was again named captain of the Gulf on 8 February 1420, and set sail from Venice on 12 May. By the end of June, he had secured the surrender of Trogir and Split, and between September and October he brought the islands of Brač, Korčula, and Hvar under Venetian control. In February 1421 {{he was sent}} to the Levant to counter the Genoese Giovanni Ambrogio Spinola, who was raiding Venetian commercial shipping in the area. On is return in summer, he was sent to Friuli as its luogotenente ("Lieutenant", i.e., governor). His selection for the post was probably influenced {{by the fact that the}} area had been conquered by his nephew, Francesco Loredan, the previous year.|$|R

At the core of these concerns lie the difficulties of implementing reforms through state regulators who, given their inherent risk aversion reinforced by their accountability to national policy makers, {{have a tendency to}} exploit any ambiguities in EU Directives in favor of national exchanges and constituencies.|$|E

5000|$|In 1881, 1885 and 1894, the Church of England {{published}} a Revised Version of the Bible, {{the first new}} English version in over two centuries. Stanton was dissatisfied with the Revised Version's failure to include recent scholarship from Bible expert Julia Smith. She wrote: [...] Whatever the Bible may be made to do in Hebrew or Greek, in plain English it does not exalt and dignify woman. My standpoint for criticism is the revised edition of 1888. I will so far honor the revising <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>wise</b> <b>men</b> who have given us the best exegesis they can according to their ability, although Disraeli said the last one before he died, contained 150,000 blunders in the Hebrew, and 7,000 in the Greek. Stanton assembled a [...] "Revising Committee" [...] to draft commentary on the new Bible version. Many of those she approached in person and by letter refused to take part, especially scholars who would be risking their professional reputations. Some 26 people agreed to help. Sharing Stanton's determination, the committee wished to correct biblical interpretation which they viewed as being biased against women, and to bring attention to the {{small fraction of the}} Bible which discussed women. They intended to demonstrate that it was not divine will that humiliated women, but human desire for domination. The committee was made up of women who were not Bible scholars, but who were interested in biblical interpretation and were active in women's rights. Among the notable members of the international committee were Augusta Jane Chapin, Lillie Devereux Blake, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Olympia Brown, Alexandra Gripenberg, Ursula Mellor Bright, Phebe Ann Coffin Hanaford, Clara Bewick Colby, and Irma von Troll-Borostyáni.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{progress}} made in the process of European integration from two points of view: regulation and supervision. We first briefly outline the main steps in the development of the Financial Services Action Plan - FSAP and the process of Comitology, defined by the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wise</b> <b>Men</b> (Lamfalussy Committee). We then provide an initial evaluation of the new regulatory system, with its merits and flaws: while the definition and completion of the FSAP has been an undoubted success, some aspects still have to be dealt with, several of them with problematical connotations, considered in the Financial Services Agenda 2005 - 2010 The transposition into national regulations of a complex body of wide-ranging standards is a difficult process in terms of both times and procedures, although the functioning of the Comitology structure has been met with general approval. There is also the problem of a supervisory structure which retains its national basis, but onto which the output generated by the Committees envisaged by the Lamfalussy process is gradually being grafted, possibly leading towards a new framework of controls at a European level. ...|$|E

40|$|In 2000 a <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wise</b> <b>Men</b> {{chaired by}} Alexandre Lamfalussy, former {{president}} of the European Monetary Institute was appointed by the Economics and Finance Ministers Council to make recommendations on the regulation of the European securities markets. It proposed a four-level system to improve the legislative process while ensuring what it called a democratic and institutional balance. Our paper questions to what extent the concepts of two basic modes of delegation - agency and trust relationships - are appropriate tools to interpret the new structure set up by the Committee. It formulates hypotheses about its policy effectiveness and the balance of power between Community institutions. Evidence supports the agency hypothesis: the Lamfalussy process has reduced the average time taken to negotiate and adopt the first framework directives at level 1 and it has facilitated the removal of bottlenecks in the process through parallel working at levels 1 and 2. In this sense, delegation has enhanced policy effectiveness in the securities sector. But it is much more difficult to assess the trustee hypothesis: that is, whether the Commission and the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) in fact act as trustees of the member states for the benefit of market actors. For the time being, whether CESR might evolve into a European securities regulator remains an open questio...|$|E
40|$|The Lamfalussy {{process was}} {{implemented}} from early 2001, following {{the report of}} the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wise</b> <b>Men</b> on the Regulation of European Securities Markets, chaired by Alexandre Lamfalussy. Four years on, this paper concludes that, while {{it is too early to}} assess progress in areas such as implementation and enforcement (Levels 3 and 4 of the Lamfalussy process), significant progress has been made in implementing the proposals contained in the original Lamfalussy Report. Preparation of EU legislation affecting securities markets is now more transparent, with better involvement of external stakeholders and enhanced political cooperation between all the institutions (Commission, Council and European Parliament). This has resulted in an improvement in the quality of legislation and an acceleration of the legislative process. The use of implementing measures will make it easier and faster to adapt Community legislation in the future. The process is also encouraging regulatory and supervisory convergence. Nevertheless, this paper suggests further improvements that could be made in areas such as consultation, including better involvement of consumers; timetables for transposing measures into national law; focusing more on general rules and principles in framework legislation (Level 1) and avoiding over-prescription in implementing measures (Level 2); achieving more consistent implementation across member states (Level 3); further strengthening political accountability; and strengthening efforts to foster greater understanding of the Lamfalussy process.

40|$|In March 2000, European leaders met in Lisbon, Portugal, to {{consider}} {{the state of the}} European economy. While there had been economic growth in Europe in the 1990 s, it had been consistently lower than that of the European Union 2 ̆ 7 s (“EU” or “Union”) main competitors, with unemployment levels remaining stubbornly high. Determined to blaze a new course in Europe, Heads of State and Government announced that “the Union has [today] set itself a new strategic goal for the next decade: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. ” These conclusions on economic reform contained a range of policies to stimulate key sectors of the European economy. Delivering this major goal would mean that the EU needed to equip itself with efficient, transparent, and above all, integrated European financial markets. To achieve this, European leaders called for the implementation of the European Commission 2 ̆ 7 s 1999 Financial Services Action Plan by 2005. This target was as ambitious as it was essential, recognizing the fundamental strategic importance of integrated European financial markets for the whole European economy. The economic benefits of improving companies 2 ̆ 7 access to investment capital and encouraging investors in such an integrated market were seen as central to its achievement. Attention has focused on the importance of achieving higher levels of harmonization of regulations in securities markets. Although turnover on European stock exchanges reached record levels {{at the end of the}} 1990 s, capital markets remained regulated by essentially outmoded EU legislation, some of which dates back two decades. This is one of the main reasons why levels of capitalization of European stock exchanges have remained considerably below those of the U. S. markets. And despite the 1992 deadline for completion of the EU 2 ̆ 7 s internal market and the fact that many Member States had modernized their market regulations in the 1990 s, little had changed at the European level to create a true level playing field. Against this background, and in order to achieve the ambitious goal set at the Lisbon summit, in July 2000, the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers established a high level group of independent figures, the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wise</b> <b>Men,</b> chaired by Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, to develop fresh thinking on the reform of the regulatory process for securities. The European Institutions in the course of 2001 endorsed their proposals, and their application is now being extended from securities to all financial services sectors in the Union...|$|E
