To add those technologies into existing e-learning services, a service architecture model is needed to transform the existing e-learning environment, which is situation-aware, into the environment that understands context as well. The context-awareness in e-learning may include the awareness of user profile and terminal context. In this paper, we propose a new notion of service that provides context-awareness to smart learning content in a cloud computing environment. We suggest the elastic four smarts (E 4 S) —smart pull, smart prospect, smart content, and smart push—concept to the cloud services so smart learning services are possible. The E 4 S focuses on meeting the users’ needs by collecting and analyzing users’ behavior, prospecting future services, building <b>corresponding</b> <b>contents,</b> and delivering the contents through cloud computing environment.
