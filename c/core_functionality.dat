25|$|The final {{specification}} proved {{far less}} revolutionary than the Longs Peak proposal. Instead of removing all immediate mode and fixed functionality (non-shader mode), the spec included them as deprecated features. The proposed object model was not included, and no {{plans have been}} announced to include it in any future revisions. As a result, the API remained largely the same with a few existing extensions being promoted to <b>core</b> <b>functionality.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>core</b> <b>functionality</b> of {{the site}} relies on {{standard}} HTML and HTTP features, allowing for wide compatibility among platforms and browsers; Flickr's functionality includes RSS and Atom feeds and an API that enables independent programmers to expand its services. This includes {{a large number of}} third-party Greasemonkey scripts that enhance and extend the functionality of Flickr. In 2006, Flickr was the second most extended site on userscripts.org. Organizr and most of Flickr's other text-editing and tagging interfaces use Ajax, with which most modern browsers are compliant. Images can be posted to the user's photostream via email attachments, which enables direct uploads from many cameraphones and applications. Flickr uses the Geo microformat on over 3 million geotagged images.|$|E

30|$|Criterion 2 for frugal {{innovation}} is concentration on <b>core</b> <b>functionalities.</b> In the literature, frugal {{innovation is}} {{often associated with}} core benefits, essential functions, and reduced complexity (see Table  2 and Table 3 in the Appendix). Thus, the meaning of frugal innovation implies a focus on the <b>core</b> <b>functionalities</b> with the highest customer benefits, and it directly targets user requirements, as we will discuss in some detail: Wooldridge (2010, p. 3) notes that, “[i]nstead of adding ever more bells and whistles, they strip the products down to their bare essentials”. Cunha et al. (2014, p. 202) point out that “frugal innovation aims to respond with extreme efficiency to some essential need”. According to all the interviewees, frugal innovations are “functional and focussed on essentials”, and most interviewees confirmed that frugal innovations “minimising the use of material and financial resources” and are “user-friendly and easy to use” (see Fig.  2). The criterion concentration on <b>core</b> <b>functionalities</b> is not only a way to reduce costs. Concentrating on <b>core</b> <b>functionalities</b> can also have the purpose of making a product or service easy to use (Andel 2013; Wooldridge 2010), of saving resources (Barclay 2014; Rao 2014; Tiwari and Herstatt 2012), of having a lower impact on the environment (Basu et al. 2013; Jänicke 2014; Sharma and Iyer 2012), or of meeting a specific lifestyle or consumer behaviour (Flatters and Willmott 2009). Thus, the criterion concentration on <b>core</b> <b>functionalities</b> encompasses all the aforementioned characterisations and is a discrete criterion.|$|R
50|$|The CPU {{supplementary}} instruction capability {{does not}} as a rule apply to 8 or 16 bit CPUs, {{as many of these}} CPUs are used mostly as microcontrollers. On modern 32 and 64 bit CPUs the processor supplementary capability does not extend to Floating Point Units (FPUs) or Memory Management Units (MMUs) as these are considered to be fundamental <b>core</b> <b>functionalities.</b> Extensions to the <b>core</b> <b>functionalities</b> of the MMU and FPU may be considered CPU extensions however.|$|R
500|$|Prior to 2013, {{industry}} analysts believed that Valve was developing hardware and tuning features of Steam with apparent use {{on its own}} hardware. These computers were pre-emptively dubbed as [...] "Steam Boxes" [...] by the gaming community and {{expected to be a}} dedicated machine focused upon Steam functionality and maintaining the <b>core</b> <b>functionality</b> of a traditional video game console. In September 2013, Valve unveiled SteamOS, a custom Linux-based operating system they had developed specifically aimed for running Steam and games, a console input device called the Steam Controller, and the final concept of the Steam Machine hardware. Unlike other consoles, the Steam Machine does not have set hardware; its technology is implemented at the discretion of the manufacturer and is fully customizable, much like a personal computer.|$|E
500|$|Deus Ex {{was built}} on the Unreal Engine, in which {{previous}} games on the engine saw active community involvement in modding. On September 20, 2000, Eidos Interactive and Ion Storm announced in a press release that they would be releasing the software development kit (SDK), which included all the tools used to create the original game. Several team members, as well as project director Warren Spector, stated that they were [...] "really looking forward to seeing what [...] does with our tools". The kit was released on September 22, 2000, and soon gathered community interest, followed by the release of tutorials, small mods, up to announcements of large mods and conversions. While ION Storm did not hugely alter the engine's rendering and <b>core</b> <b>functionality,</b> they introduced role-playing elements.|$|E
500|$|On April 3, 2000, a {{judgment}} was handed {{down in the}} case of United States v. Microsoft Corp., calling the company an [...] "abusive monopoly" [...] and forcing the company to split into two separate units. Part of this ruling was later overturned by a federal appeals court, and eventually settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2001. On June 15, 2000, the company released a new version of its hand-held operating system, Windows CE 3.0. The main change was the new programming APIs of the software. Previous versions of Windows CE supported only a small subset of the WinAPI, the main development library for Windows, and with Version 3 of Windows CE, the operating system now supported nearly all of the <b>core</b> <b>functionality</b> of the WinAPI. The next update to the consumer line, Windows ME (or Windows Millennium Edition), was released on September 14, 2000. It sported several new features such as enhanced multimedia abilities and consumer-oriented PC maintenance options, but is often {{regarded as one of the}} worst versions of Windows due to stability problems, restricted real mode DOS support and other issues.|$|E

2500|$|The {{game has}} crossed {{over into the}} {{scientific}} community with scientists {{and members of the}} space industry displaying an interest in the game, including NASA, SpaceX's Elon Musk, and ESA. Squad has added a NASA-based Asteroid Redirect Mission pack to the game, allowing players to track and capture asteroids for mining and study. Squad has also developed an official mod for the game centered around observing and tracking threatening asteroids, named [...] "Asteroid Day". The mod was developed in partnership with the B612 Foundation. Some parts from this mod outside of <b>core</b> <b>functionality</b> were added as part of the release of the 1.1 update.|$|E

The advent of the Mobile Web has ushered in a new wave of mobile devices - with multi-touch facilities and thus there has been a shift from Web access to Mobile Web access. This has brought about the need to make web applications accessible via mobile devices. This study investigated the usability of the <b>core</b> <b>functionalities</b> of an Institutional Repository on various mobile devices. The work did not try to create a mobile version of the repository but rather test the existing web application on various mobile platforms. To achieve this, the <b>core</b> <b>functionalities</b> of the repository were modelled using Unified Modelling Language (UML). In addition, an Institutional Repository was built and deployed for Covenant University by leveraging on open source repository software – EPrints. Furthermore, the <b>core</b> <b>functionalities</b> of the Institutional Repository were tested on five different mobile devices. Finally, the usability of the Institutional Repository on the various mobile devices used was evaluated by identifying the usability attributes; designing a questionnaire based on those attributes and then analyzing the results with SPSS software.
