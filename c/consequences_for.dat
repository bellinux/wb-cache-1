5|$|All {{actions have}} the above four factor present in them. When {{different}} permutations of the sub-elements {{of the four}} factors are calculated, the Jain teachers speak of 108 {{ways in which the}} karmic matter can be attracted to the soul. Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> the soul. Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as means to avoid the burden of karma.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{collapse}} of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Armenian, Georgian, and Muslim leaders of the Caucasus united to create the Transcaucasian Federation in the winter of 1918. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had drastic <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> the Armenians: Turkish forces reoccupied Western Armenia. The federation lasted for only three months, eventually leading to the proclamation of the Republics of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The negotiators for Armenia were from the ARF.|$|E
5|$|If a Severn Barrage {{were ever}} to be {{constructed}} it could have <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> Flat Holm, depending on the design and the route.

5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have serious <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E
5|$|In the Constitution of 2007, Malagasy {{remained}} the national language while official languages were reintroduced: Malagasy, French, and English. English was removed {{as an official}} language from the constitution approved by voters in the November 2010 referendum. The outcome of the referendum, and its <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> official and national language policy, are not recognized by the political opposition, who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness {{in the way the}} election was organized by the High Transitional Authority.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{that affect}} water {{supply in the}} United States include {{droughts}} in the West, water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall {{as a result of}} climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.|$|E

5|$|Nature {{photography}} {{is a common}} activity in the park due to the large variety of flora and fauna, as well as landscape photography due to the mountainous terrain and views. There are several forest trails and high-elevation ventures used by hikers and mountaineers respectively. There are numerous other activities available for visitors, {{as well as some}} prohibited activities. For example, although recreational fishing is allowed, there are severe <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> anyone found hunting within the jurisdiction of the park.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{had decided}} on a mixed {{transport}} strategy, relying on contributions from dogs, motor sledges and ponies. He appointed Cecil Meares {{to take charge of}} the dog teams, and recruited Shackleton's former motor specialist, Bernard Day, to run the motor sledges. Oates would {{be in charge of the}} ponies, but as he could not join the expedition until May 1910, Scott instructed Meares, who knew nothing of horses, to buy them—with unfortunate <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> their quality and performance.|$|E
5|$|Season 4, set 18 months later, {{begins at}} 7:00a.m. Jack must {{save the lives}} of his new boss, Secretary of Defense James Heller, and Heller's {{daughter}} Audrey Raines (with whom Jack is romantically involved) when they are kidnapped by terrorists. However, Habib Marwan uses this as a disguise to launch further attacks against America, and Jack is forced to use unorthodox methods to stop him, which results in long-term <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> both Jack and the United States.|$|E

5|$|Specialized export {{proteins}} {{exist for}} translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' {{central role in}} protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.|$|E
5|$|The Bates {{method has}} been criticized not only {{because there is no}} good {{evidence}} it works, but also because it can have negative <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{accounts}} of foreigners visiting Hawaii {{before the arrival}} of James Cook, in 1778. However, the earliest Western depictions of the isle, including Mauna Kea, were created by explorers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Contact with Europe and America had major <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> island residents. Native Hawaiians were devastated by introduced diseases; port cities including Hilo, Kealakekua, and Kailua grew with the establishment of trade; and the adze quarries on Mauna Kea were abandoned after the introduction of metal tools.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a method of}} semi-quantitative risk assessment for urban gas pipelines, by modifying Kent analysis method. The influence factors of fault frequency and <b>consequence</b> <b>for</b> urban gas pipelines are analyzed, and the grade rules are studied on. The grade rules of fault frequency and <b>consequence</b> <b>for</b> urban natural gas pipelines are provided. Using semi-quantitative risk matrix, the risk grade of the urban gas pipelines is obtained, and the risk primary sort for gas pipelines can be accomplished, so as {{to find out the}} high risk pipeline unit...|$|R
