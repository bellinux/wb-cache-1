40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a mixed model research that, as the first of its kind, aimed to determine the nature of, and underlying factors influencing, Croatian elementary pupils’ attitudes towards <b>confessional</b> Catholic <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> (RE). Analyses of the questionnaire responses of the eighth-grade pupils from the stratified sample of schools revealed generally positive attitudes towards confessional RE as well as homogeneity with respect to academic achievement and higher estimations of girls. Qualitative analyses offered more critical pupil perspectives on RE and its delivery. From the triangulation of the data, three separate elements emerged as the foundation of the attitudes towards RE. The first and primary influence is the exposure to religious sentiment and values from their families. Secondly, pupil attitudes are affected by their own personal development and a growing ability to critically observe the world around them. Finally, the methods through which RE is delivered and assessed also serve as a strong contributor to pupils’ attitudes. The voices of pupils demand an adoption of a more dialectical approach to teaching and learning, and lesser reliance on catechesis which could reflect positively on the attitudes of all pupils, and especially of those who are most critical of the subject...|$|R

There have been debates {{in regard to the}} teaching and learning of <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> (R. E.) in Zimbabwe where the approach has exclusively favoured Christianity {{at the expense of other}} religions. The major problem arises from mistaking religious educationfor Christian education; <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> teachers for pastors; <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> pupils for Christians, hence the dominance of the confessional approach in the teaching and learning of <b>religious</b> <b>education.</b> Advocacy callsfrom different religious groupings have been heard lobbyingfora change of the <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> syllabus so as to broadly incorporate other religions hence the Zimbabwean religio- cultural diversity. What is paradoxically interesting is that, the aims of the <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> syllabi are multi-faith in orientation but with exclusivist content. It is then not surprising that most religjious education teachers and stakeholders erroneously take the subject as meant to evangelisticalty extend the territories of Christianity against other religions.

Professor Van der Walt’s recent discussion and critique of secularism and of religious tolerance enables the author to analyse the educational situation in South Africa and elsewhere with particular emphasis on policies about religion in/and education. These investigations lead him to conclude that most education systems seem to resort to secular public-private and worldly-sacral dualistic policies for addressing the problem of potential religious conflict in schools. After considering the Dutch policy of (increasing) pillarisation and the South African policy of banning <b>confessional</b> aspects of <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> to the private spheres of citizens’ lives, he proposes a solution based on the concept of institutional religious and life-conceptual identity.

In theoretical terms this review draws on sociocultural and dialogic educational research, particularly Rupert Wegerif’s notion of “dialogic space” (Wegerif 2007, 4), and a “Global Education: World Religions” -course recently run as part of the Summer School for Human Sciences at the University of Jyväskylä. The review opens by introducing the pedagogic orientation for the course and a simple cultural model developed within the course.

40|$|This paper {{analysis}} {{data about}} religious changes amongst youth at three historical time points {{that cover the}} communist and post-communist periods (1986, 1999 and 2004) in Croatia. According to indicators of religious affiliation, religious self-identification, religious beliefs and religious practice, {{a significant increase in}} religiosity was observed in the post-communist period amongst youth. However, there is a discrepancy between the high level of declared religiosity and the level of acceptance of Catholic moral norms, particularly norms concerning marriage and sexuality. Although convinced believers accept these attitudes, the majority of respondents deviated from Church moral norms. On the other hand, young people (both religious and non-religious ones) express more conservative attitudes towards homosexuality, thus reflecting general conservative position towards this sexual orientation in society. Comparative analysis of three age cohorts indicates that the youngest respondents are the most religious and least liberal in their attitudes towards marriage, reproduction and sexuality.

40|$|When the {{government}} of the Republic of Serbia decided to introduce religious education into state schools in 2001, Serbia came into line with the neighbouring countries, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where {{at the request of the}} dominant religious communities <b>confessional</b> <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> had been part of state school curricula ever since the dis-integration of the former Yugoslavia in 1991. 2 In Serbia, religious education was introduced under chaotic circumstances, shortly after the democratic changes following 5 October 2000, to which it was directly linked.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{complications}} raised in teaching a <b>confessional</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Education</b> in a multi-religious context pertaining in Ugandan religiously founded public schools, {{government and private}} founded schools. The thesis contends that the introduction of Islam, Anglican and Roman Catholic Christian religious traditions in Uganda not only presented alternative religious systems to the existing African traditional religion but ushered {{in an era of}} competition for converts that subsequently led to religious conflict. The thesis also submits the view that the missionary aim of formal education in Uganda led to the creation, not only of a denominational, but a divisive educational system. While the study commends the colonial government and the first independent government's efforts towards establishing a nondenominational educational system, it suggests that their failure to address the controversial questions raised by the nature of RE at the time was a missed opportunity. The study probes the current syllabuses, aims and content of CRE and IRE for secondary and primary schools and suggests that their main intention of promoting spiritual growth of students is inappropriate for implementation in the multi-religious schools. The thesis questions the government's proposed exclusion of RE from the education curriculum and its replacement with Moral Education. It suggests that while Moral Education could be a subject on its own, Religious Education needs to be maintained but re-designed to address the multi-religious context. It presents a multi-faith RE as the ideal format of teaching about religion. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{religious}} education {{program of the}} Integrated school system has experienced unprecedented growth since 1869. The purpose of this historical analysis {{was to examine the}} factors, through an examination of primary and secondary sources, that influenced this development. [...] Prior to Integration, very little {{religious education}} was taught in the Anglican, Salvation Army, and United Church school systems. With Integration came an increased interest {{in the development of a}} viable religious education curriculum. The first major challenge faced by the Integrated Education Council centered on approaches to the teaching of religious education. Experiences in the amalgamated schools had indicated that <b>confessional</b> <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> was not practical in a multidenominational setting. In 1969 however, there were few people in Newfoundland who had the expertise in religious education to articulate a suitable approach for Integrated schools. In 1970, the Integrated Educational Council was fortunate in enlisting the support of Edwin Cox and was able to articulate a list of aim based on an emerging idea of the open, child-centered approach to religious education. As the Council became more aware of the direction it wanted to take in its program, it was able to embark on a more meaningful process of curriculum development. This process has resulted in the implementation of an effective program of religious education that is constantly being evaluated and revised. Since 1969, there have been an ongoing discussion between officials at Memorial University and the Denominational Education Councils regarding teacher education in religious education. At the undergraduate level this issue has been complicated, in part, by the different denominational aims and philosophies for religious education and by the fact that different degree programs are needed to prepare secondary school teachers and primary/elementary teachers...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} introducing roblem-Based Learning (PBL) into the Islamic Education (IE) curriculum at Year 11 level (students aged 17) in the Kingdom of Bahrain (KB). The research was motivated by recent recommendations (2011) by the Ministry of Education (MoE) in KB that secondary education should develop students’ independent and critical thinking skills, and by my own professional and academic interest in pedagogy. This study is pragmatic and it uses a mixed methods approach to enhance the validity and reliability of the findings. In view of the examining nature and the context specificity, the casestudy strategy of a secondary girls’ school in KB was adopted. The core of the research is the implementation of an IE module (Islam organises marital life), designed using PBL methods, into four IE classrooms in a girls’ school in KB. The intervention took place {{over a period of}} seven weeks. Qualitative data takes the form of classroom observations before and during the PBL intervention and interviews with students, teachers and curriculum specialists employed by the MoE. Quantitative data was collected via questionnaires distributed to students before and after the PBL intervention and through student self-evaluation forms. This data was used to generate statistical results. The thesis provides a detailed explanation and critical analysis of PBL, and examines its relationship with constructivist learning theories specifically within the context of curriculum IE in KB. It presents a refined model of PBL that is workable for secondary IE in KB, and which might be transferable to similar contexts. This model is new to the education system in Bahrain and is being trialled to test its effectiveness and hopefully integrate it into the country’s current secondary teaching methods. The outcomes of this study revealed that teachers deliver knowledge through the use of conventional methods which in turn minimized the role of students in the learning process as passive receivers. Therefore, this study suggests PBL as an appropriate teaching approach to be employed in IE in KB, because it has offered advantages to Islamic Education learning by encouraging students to take a more independent proactive role and communicate more freely. Nevertheless, the implementation of PBL had its difficulties, particularly with regards to getting used to a new learning style, but it was noted that teachers provided sufficient support. The thesis also argues that constructivist learning approaches, albeit within certain boundaries, can be beneficially implemented to <b>confessional</b> <b>religious</b> <b>education,</b> such as curriculum IE in KB. The implementation of PBL under the umbrella of constructivism enhances the independent thinking and knowledge creation by Bahraini learners which in turn helps them comprehend religious resources, and boost their faith. The research discussed in the thesis is an original contribution to knowledge because it is the only research about PBL in IE in Bahrain as this is a completely novel pedagogy in this particular context...|$|E

40|$|Cilj ovoga rada je stjecanje novih znanstvenih spoznaja o fenomenima nereligioznosti i ateizma u Hrvatskoj i to kroz istraživanje njihovih organiziranih oblika. Temeljna teorijska perspektiva iz koje rad polazi je sociologija nereligioznosti koju razvija Colin Campbell (1971 a; 1971 b), a koja nereligioznost promatra kao reaktivnu, dinamičnu i relacijsku pojavu u odnosu na (kulturalno relevantnu) religiju. Campbellov pristup se nadopunjava identitetskim pristupom nereligioznoti koji u svojem radu razvijaju Cimino i Smith (2007; 2010; 2014) i Smith (2010; 2013). Osnovna je pretpostavka rada da društveno reguliranje religije utječe na društveni položaj nereligioznih građana i ateista. Istraživanoj se pojavi nastojalo prići iz nekoliko različitih perspektiva, stoga je u empirijskom dijelu rada korišten pristup mješovite metodologije. Metoda analize sadržaja korištena je u analizi dokumentacije i mrežnih stranica organiziranih oblika nereligioznosti i ateizma. U drugoj fazi istraživanja provedena je anketa među članovima organizacija (N= 292), nakon koje su slijedili polustrukturirani dubinski intervjui (N= 22). Dobiveni podaci pokazuju da temeljno neslaganje proizlazi iz sukoba vrijednosti pri čemu se članovi nereligioznih/ateističkih organizacija pozivaju na vrijednosti osobnih sloboda, jednakosti i kritičkog mišljenja, koje svoje utemeljenje imaju u znanosti. Nereligiozne osobe i ateisti percipiraju svoj identitet kao stigmatiziran, nejednak i u nekim slučajevima diskriminiran. Ova percepcija proizlazi iz društvene regulacije religije (osobito pitanja nastave vjeronauka u osnovnim školama), sveprisutnosti religije u javnom prostoru i politizacije nereligioznosti/ateizma u javnom diskursu, a očituje se na grupnoj razini kao pojava organiziranja na temelju zajedničkog identiteta i na individualnoj razini kao selektivnost i oprez u iznošenju vlastitog nereligioznog/ateističkog identiteta. Identitetski pristup organiziranim oblicima nereligioznosti i ateizma u hrvatskom javnom prostoru omogućuje da se na temelju njihovih ciljeva, aktivnosti, strategija, strukture, unutargrupne dinamike i sl. utvrde oblici kolektivnog identiteta, kao i različiti tipovi organizacija, odnosno različiti tipovi nereligioznih/ateista ovisno o (ne) postojanju i vrsti kolektivnog identiteta koji razvijaju. S obzirom na to razlikuju se dva tipa organizacija, institucionalni i kulturalni te, ovisno o (ne) postojanju i obliku kolektivnog identiteta tri tipa ateista, institucionalni, kulturalni i distancirani. The main {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to acquire}} new scientific knowledge on the phenomenon of non-religiosity and atheism in Croatia through the research of their organized forms. The basic theoretical perspective from which the work proceeds is Campbell's (1971 a, 1971 b) sociology of non-religiosity that considers non-religiosity as a reactive, relational and dynamic phenomenon in relation to (culturally relevant) religion. Campbell's theoretical frame is complemented by an identity-based approach to the non-religiosity found {{in the work of}} Cimino and Smith (2007; 2010; 2014) and Smith (2010; 2013). Comprehensive overview of the literature on non-religosity and atheism which is presented {{in the first part of}} this study served as a base for construction of a theoretical and methodological model for the analysis of non-religiosity in the Croatian socio-historical context. Studied phenomenon was approached from several different perspectives, so mixed methodology approach was used in the empirical part of the work. The content analysis method was used for the analysis of documentation and web pages of organized forms of non-religiosity and atheism. In the second phase of the research, a survey was conducted among the members of the organizations (N = 292) followed by a semi-structured in-depth interview (N = 22). In this way, the survey data was used as an incentive for interview questions, and interviews provided inductive validation, contextualization and additional interpretation for survey data. The basic premise is that social regulation of religion affects the social position of nonreligious citizens and atheists. Religious regulation at the state (institutional) level is implemented by the Constitution, laws (the Law on the Legal Status of Religious Communities) and individual contracts with religious communities (Croatian Treaties with the Holy See also known as Vatican Contracts and Contracts on Issues of Common Interest between Croatia and other religious communities). Considering the legal framework and its implementation, there is the possibility for the non-religious persons and atheists to percive their own identity as unequal, stigmatized and discriminated against. So, organizing and constructing collective nonreligious/atheist identity is the answer to the wider socio-political context in which it is formed. Special problem stemming from the legislative regulation of religion is the implementation of the <b>confessional</b> <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> in public schools, which encourages legal responses and protests at the organization level. At the individual level, members of organized forms of non-religiosity and atheism, however, although generally opposed to religious education in public schools, are practically reacting out of conformism or because of their own values of free upbringing and leaving children to make their own decisions about religious beliefs. In doing so, persons who have been attending the religious education themself tend to enroll their children in religious education at statistically significant level. On the other hand, for some parents the issue of religious education in public schools provokes stronger engagement within organizations and greater commitment to separating religion and the education system. Beside the problem of religious education in public schools, important issues stemming out of social regulation of religion (which gives the perception of Catholic Church as priviledged), are politicization of (non) religiosity and atheism, and the omnipresence of religion and religious symbols (in public space, media, education system). In this way, non-religious people and atheists believe that Catholic religious values are "imposed" as universal to the society as a whole. Accordingly, one of the most important causes of perception of their identity as unequal, stigmatized and discriminated against (significantly worse than of a person with a religious worldview) derives from the perception of their own value system as an endangered one. Organizing of non-religios persons and atheists is therefore largely motivated by the effort to defend and promote "secular sacred" values. Regarding the way this should be done, there is a difference between non-religious and atheist organizations which includes different basic goals, activities, strategies, group dynamics, form of organization, etc. According to these differences they can be divided on institutional and cultural type (see also Cimino and Smith, 2014; LeDrew, 2015 b). By using specific strategies and emphasizing specific goals institutional type of organizations generates collective identity more like subculture or community within the dominant one. Hence, it seeks to strengthen the internal solidarity by using minority discourse and referring to its endangered status, but also acting with the goal of incorporating it into a wider society by emphasizing positive values and beliefs. Contrary, cultural type of organizations builds its collective identity on strategies aimed at gaining broader social support in order to induce the changes of the society itself, hence as a new social movement (or beggining of it). At the same time, at the individual level, depending on the affirmation of their own nonreligious/atheist identity, individuals tend to involve in the organizations but that doesn't mean necessarily that they will develop collective identity. Although members of nonreligious/ateheist organizations perceive their identity in society as unequal, discriminated and stigmatized, in their own lives, at the everyday level, they do not experience this stigmatization and discrimination, partly because their non-religious/atheist identity is expressed strategically in order to avoid it. Consequently, (larger) part of the members of organizations lacks some of the key components of collective identity (non-adherence to goals, activities and strategies or lack of common cognitive definitions and absence of network of active relationships) so they are not developing it. Based on (not) development of collective identity members of the nonreligious/atheist organizations could be divided on institutional and cultural type (who accept institutional or cultural type of collective identity, respectively) and distanced type who doesn't develop collective identity due to various causes...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis investigated perceptions {{about the nature and}} purpose of <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> of parents and teachers in a study of one Catholic secondary school in regional Victoria, Australia. In the research project data were collected using questionnaires and interviews from parents and teachers of <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> associated with the particular secondary school. These data were analysed and interpreted against a spectrum of purposes for <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> that were drawn from the literature. The literature reviewed included documents relevant to <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> from the Catholic Church since the Second Vatican Council (1962 - 1965) and also from theorists in the field of <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> both from Australia and beyond. The theories about <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> generated by the literature review provided a framework within which to compare and contrast how the parents and the teachers understood <b>religious</b> <b>education.</b> While all of the <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> teachers took part in the research, the parents self-selected.

40|$|This thesis {{analysed}} <b>Religious</b> <b>Education</b> Coordinators 2 ̆ 7 {{perceptions of}} their role in Catholic secondary schools of the Archdiocese of Melbourne from 1970 - 2000. The theoretical framework for the study, which was reported on in this thesis, was drawn from Catholic Church documents on <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> at both international and national levels, and {{from the work of}} researchers within the field of <b>religious</b> <b>education.</b> In particular the study investigated the diversity of language used to describe <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> and <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> theory and analysed the significance that this has had in the development of an understanding {{of the role of the}} <b>Religious</b> <b>Education</b> Coordinator. It was argued that there were significant factors in the development of the role of the <b>Religious</b> <b>Education</b> Coordinator that included changes in the understanding of the nature and purpose of <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> during the second half of the twentieth century. In addition there were historical factors peculiar to the Archdiocese of Melbourne that played an important part in the understanding of the RECs role. Quantitative data in the form of annual survey material (1988 - 1999) from the Catholic Education Office Melbourne provided a framework for the empirical component of the research. The empirical component involved the interviewing of <b>Religious</b> <b>Education</b> Coordinators from a deliberately selected sample that covered the range of skills and experiences deemed necessary in the research. The purpose was to ascertain from the perspective of the <b>Religious</b> <b>Education</b> Coordinators themselves how they analysed their role. Grounded theory methodology was used as the basis for the inductive analysis of the data that emerged from the in-depth interviews. Theory that was generated on the role of the <b>Religious</b> <b>Education</b> Coordinator includes: the importance of an understanding of the theoretical dimensions of <b>religious</b> <b>education</b> and the role of the <b>Religious</b> <b>Education</b> Coordinator; an elaboration of the role of the <b>Religious</b> <b>Education</b> Coordinator in the school context and the necessary skills and attributes that are required to meet the challenges in the role; and the complexity of the challenges that are faced by the <b>Religious</b> <b>Education</b> Coordinator...|$|R
