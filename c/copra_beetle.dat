40|$|The specie Necrobia rufipes is {{commonly}} known as the <b>copra</b> <b>beetle</b> in tropical countries and red-legged ham beetle in the United States. According to Nwana, 1993 and Simmons and Ellington (1925) the red-legged ham beetle is a cosmopolitan pest, causing considerable dam-age to stored commodities such as copra (dried coconut), cheese, dried fish, ham and other products rich in protein content. In India, it is also recorded as a serious pest of cashew nuts (Sengupta et al., 1984). These beetles can subsist on a diet of copra alone but their development is slow; their diet is almost cer-tainly a supplement by predation on other insects and can promote cannibalism when there is a superpopulation (Ashman 1963). N. rupifes was identified by Carvalho et al. (2000) in a checklist of artropods associated wit...|$|E

The plant materials were pulverized into powders and also processed into extracts and were applied at 2. 50, 5. 00, 7. 50 and 10. 00 g per 100 g fish and 5 mL of 2. 50, 5. 00, 7. 50 and 10. 00 % per 100 g fish respectively. Each of the powdered smoked fish significantly (p 99. 77 and > 99. 55 % respectively.

40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{efficacy}} of the separate mixing of four tropical spicy and medicinal plant products: Dennettia tripetala Baker (pepper fruit), Eugenia aromatica Hook (clove), Piper guineense (Schum and Thonn) (black pepper) and Monodora myristica (Dunal) (African nut-meg) with a household vegetable oil was evaluated under tropical storage conditions for the control and reproductive performance of Dermestes maculatus (De Geer) (hide beetle) and Necroba rufipes (De Geer) (<b>copra</b> <b>beetle)</b> on African catfish, Clarias gariepinus (Burchell). Each of the plant materials was pulverized into powder and applied as a mix of 1 ml of oil and plant powder at 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10. 0 g per 100 g of dried fish, and allowed to dry for 6 h. Each of the four oil-mixed powder treatments evoked significant (P < 05) mortalities of the two insects compared with the control (oil only) at 1, 3 and 7 days post treatment. The oil-powder mixture dosages did not prevent insect egg hatchability but while the emergent larvae on the treated samples died, the emergent larvae in the control survived into adults. The application of oil-mixed powders effectively suppressed {{the emergence of the}} larvae of the beetles. Similarly, each of the oil-powder mixtures significantly reduced weight loss in smoked fish that were exposed to D. maculatus and N. rufipes when compared to the control (P < 05). The {{results of this study suggest}} that the plant powders rather than the domestic oil demonstrated protective ability against the fish beetles and confirm the {{efficacy of}} the plant products as pest control agents...|$|E
