5|$|Meanwhile, in {{an attempt}} to avoid losing large {{quantities}} of circulating nickels to melting, the United States Mint introduced new interim rules on December 14, 2006, that criminalized the melting and export of pennies (which as of 2013 cost 1.83 cents to produce) and nickels. Violators of these rules can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000, five years imprisonment, or both. The rules were finalized on April 17, 2007. The melt value of a nickel for some time was more than five cents, including nearing over one-and-a-half times its face value in May 2007. Since then, the supply and demand of the coin's composition metals have stabilized. A nickel's melt value fell below its face value from late 2008 through mid-2010, and more recently again from late mid-2012 through the present. In February 2014, it was reported that the Mint was conducting experiments to use <b>copper-plated</b> zinc (the same composition used for the United States 1 cent coin) for the nickel.|$|E
25|$|The coins {{that are}} {{currently}} in circulation are one ban, made of <b>copper-plated</b> steel; five bani, made of <b>copper-plated</b> steel; ten bani in nickel-plated steel; and fifty bani in aluminum-bronze. These were first introduced into circulation in 2005 with the fourth revaluation and are all currently valid.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, {{both the}} bronze and <b>copper-plated</b> zinc planchets {{were used for}} 1¢ coins.|$|E

25|$|<b>Copper-plated</b> zinc, 1982–present. In mid-1982, the coin's {{composition}} {{was changed}} again, {{this time to}} <b>copper-plated</b> zinc. The last mostly-copper cents (95% copper metal composition) were produced by the Denver Mint on October 22, 1982. The <b>copper-plated</b> zinc cent coins are still being produced today. They are composed of an inner core alloy of 99.2% zinc and 0.8% copper with an outer plating of pure copper, for an overall composition of 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper, and are minted on blanks produced for the Mint by an outside manufacturer (Jarden Zinc Products). Except for the new lighter total coin weight of 2.5grams each, these newer coins are identical in diameter and thickness, and nearly in appearance, to the mostly copper (95%) cents issued before mid-1982, which weighed 3.11grams each. A few pennies were struck by error in brass dated 1983 and are extremely rare.|$|E
25|$|A more {{economical}} alternative was {{made available to}} the handloader in the 1980s, the <b>copper-plated</b> bullet. <b>Copper-plated</b> bullets are lead bullets that are electroplated with a copper jacket. While thinner than a swaged bullet jacket, the plated jacket is far thicker than normal electroplate, and provides significant structural integrity to the bullet. Since the jacket provides the strength, soft lead can be used, which allows bullets to be swaged or cast into shape before plating. While not strong enough for most rifle cartridges, plated bullets work well in many handgun rounds, with a recommended maximum velocity of 1250ft/s (375m/s). Plated bullets fall between cast and traditional jacketed bullets in price.|$|E
25|$|A {{new round}} one-cent coin is introduced. The previous, 12-sided one-cent coin {{contained}} 98% copper but its composition was modified. Because the new coin {{was composed of}} <b>copper-plated</b> zinc, the twelve-sided one-cent coin became difficult to produce. Therefore, the round design was introduced to complement the new technology.|$|E
25|$|The largest fieldstone {{building}} {{to be built}} by Sullivan was a building for the local Presbyterian congregation which is known as “The Casa Grande Stone Church”. He accomplished this feat {{with the help of}} Los Angeles architect Robert Orr. The first service held in the church, with its glittering <b>copper-plated</b> dome, was in January 1928. The Casa Grande Historical Society acquired the Stone Church in June 1977.|$|E
25|$|When copper {{reached a}} record high in February 2011, the melt value of a 95% copper penny was {{more than three times}} its face value. As of January 21, 2014, a pre-1982 penny {{contained}} 2.20325 cents' worth of copper and zinc, making it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals for profit. In comparison, post-1982 <b>copper-plated</b> zinc cents have a metallurgical value of only 0.55152 cents.|$|E
25|$|While {{originally}} {{sold only}} to handloaders as an inexpensive substitute for jacketed bullets, the plated bullet has come far. The ammunition manufacturer Speer now offers the Gold Dot line, commercially loaded premium handgun ammunition using <b>copper-plated</b> hollow point bullets. The strong bond between jacket and core {{created by the}} electroplating process makes expanding bullets hold together very well, and the Gold Dot line is now in use by many police departments.|$|E
25|$|Australia and New Zealand adopted 5¢ and 10¢, respectively, {{as their}} lowest denomination, {{followed}} by Canada, which adopted 5¢ as its lowest denomination in 2012. Several nations have stopped minting equivalent value coins, and {{efforts have been}} made to end the routine use of pennies in several countries, including the United States. In the UK, since 1992, one- and two-penny coins have been made from <b>copper-plated</b> steel (making them magnetic) instead of bronze.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, {{the mint}} {{patented}} an improved, money-saving production method called multi-ply plating technology. Since that year, this technique {{has been used}} to produce 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, and 50¢ pieces of Canadian circulation coinage, all of which were previously minted from nearly pure nickel alloys. Similarly, a <b>copper-plated</b> steel blank was used to produce the 1¢ coin until production ceased in 2012. Also in 2012, multi-ply plating was introduced for the $1 and $2 coins.|$|E
25|$|Slovakia {{has offered}} to mint the coins, and has {{provided}} prototypes. The coins of up to 5 kopeks are struck in <b>copper-plated</b> steel; the 10, 20, 50 kopeks coins are struck in brass-plated steel; the 1 ruble coin in a nickel-plated steel composition and 2 rubles coin in a bi-metallic format (with a brass-plated steel ring and a nickel-plated steel center plug). All coins show the National emblem of Belarus, the inscription 'БЕЛАРУСЬ' (Belarus) and the year of minting on their obverse. The reverse shows {{the value of the}} coin accompanied by different ornaments with their own meanings.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50 cents, 1 and 2 dollars. The 1 cent was struck in nickel-brass, the 5, 10, and 15 cent in cupronickel, the 25 cent in nickel, and the 50 cent and 1 dollar in silver. The 10 cent was scallop shaped, whilst the 15 cent was square. Silver coins were not issued for circulation after 1966. Bronze replaced nickel-brass in the 1 cent in 1970, followed by brass in 1974 and <b>copper-plated</b> zinc in 1985. In 1989, cupro-nickel 50 cent and 1 dollar coins were issued for circulation, although they did not replace the corresponding banknotes.|$|E
500|$|The round cella is the easternmost {{and most}} {{important}} part of the church, as it was where the liturgy was performed. The diameter of the rotunda is [...] It is accessed through three gates, all from the narthex. It was entirely covered by a dome. Twelve vaults, semicircular as seen from the inside and pentagonal on the outer wall, were constructed north and south of the rotunda's eastern part, the apse, which itself fits into one of the vaults. Large buttresses reinforce the structure both inside and outside. A circle of ten or twelve white marble columns was inscribed inside the rotunda, [...] from the interior buttresses. The capitals of the columns are similar to those of the royal palace in Preslav. A <b>copper-plated</b> wooden coffin lay in a burial chamber by one of the vaults near the apse.|$|E
500|$|During the searches, {{the pirates}} stole a [...] "sturdy, <b>copper-plated</b> boat" [...] from Cabo Rojo and escaped. The ship was {{originally}} stolen in San Juan by Gregorio Pereza and Francisco Pérez (both arrested during {{the search for}} Caballo Blanco) and given to Cofresí. When the news became public, mayor José María Hurtado asked local residents for help. On August 5, 1824, Antonio de Irizarry found the boat at Punta Arenas, a cape in the Joyuda barrio. The mayor quickly organized his troops, reaching the location on horseback. Aboard the ship they found three rifles, three guns, a carbine, a cannon, ammunition and supplies. After an unsuccessful search of nearby woods, the mayor sailed the craft to Pedernales and {{turned it over to}} Mendoza. A group left behind continued the search, but did not find anyone. Assuming that the pirates had fled inland, Hurtado alerted his colleagues in the region about the find. The mayor resumed the search, but abandoned it due to a rainstorm and poor directions. Peraza, Pérez, José Rivas del Mar, José María Correa and José Antonio Martinez were later arrested, but Cofresí remained free.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, {{a second}} series of coins was introduced. [...] It {{featured}} <b>copper-plated</b> steel coins of 1 and 5 centavos, brass-plated steel coins of 10 and 25 centavos, a cupronickel 50 centavos coin, and a bi-coloured brass and cupronickel coin of 1 real. However, from 2002 onwards, steel {{was used for}} the 50 centavos coin and {{the central part of the}} 1 real coin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{printed circuit}} board [...] {{industry}} defines heavy copper as layers exceeding three ounces of copper, or approximately 0.0042inches (4.2mils, 105μm) thick. [...] PCB designers and fabricators often use heavy copper when design and manufacturing circuit boards {{in order to increase}} current-carrying capacity as well as resistance to thermal strains. Heavy <b>copper-plated</b> vias transfer heat to external heat sinks. IPC 2152 is a standard for determining current-carrying capacity of {{printed circuit board}} traces.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, the 1¢ coin {{was changed}} to dodecagonal, and the 5¢ was further debased to a {{cupro-nickel}} alloy. In 1987, [...] a $1 coin struck in aureate-plated nickel was introduced. A bimetallic $2 coin followed in 1996. In 1997, <b>copper-plated</b> zinc replaced bronze in the 1¢, and it returned to a round shape. This was followed, in 2000, {{by the introduction of}} even cheaper plated-steel 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ coins, with the 1¢ plated in copper and the others plated in cupro-nickel. [...] In 2012, the multi-ply plated-steel technology was introduced for $1 and $2 coins as well. [...] Also in that year mintage of the 1¢ coin ceased and its withdrawal from circulation began in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Harriet Lane, {{built for}} the Treasury Department by William H. Webb, was {{launched}} in New York City, November 1857. She was a <b>copper-plated</b> steamer that could make speeds of up to eleven knots. Her battery consisted of three thirty-two-pounders and four twenty-four-pound howitzers. She served as a revenue cutter until temporarily transferred to the Navy late in 1858. Her new assignment took her to Paraguay with a squadron ordered to support the discussions of U.S. Special Commissioner James B. Bowlin with Dictator Carlos Antonio López concerning reparations for damages incurred during an unprovoked attack on [...] by the Paraguayan forces, February 1, 1855. This display of sea power quickly won the United States a prompt and respectful hearing which four years of diplomacy had failed to obtain. Paraguay apologized, paid an indemnity to compensate the family of an American seaman killed during the fight, and signed a new commercial treaty containing provisions highly advantageous to the United States. In his report, Flag Officer William B. Shubrick singled out Harriet Lane for special commendation on the invaluable service she rendered in extricating his other ships that repeatedly ran aground in the treacherous waters of the Paraná River.|$|E
2500|$|The first decimal coins were {{circulated}} in 1968. These were the five pence (5p) and ten pence (10p), and had values of one shilling (1/-) and two shillings (2/-), respectively, under the pre-decimal £sd system. The decimal coins are minted in <b>copper-plated</b> steel (previously bronze), nickel-plated steel, cupronickel and nickel-brass. The two-pound coins, and, as from 28 March 2017 the new one-pound coins, are bimetallic. The coins are discs, {{except for the}} twenty pence and fifty pence pieces, {{both of which have}} faces that are heptagonal curves of constant width, and the new one-pound coins, which have faces with 12 sides. All the circulating coins have an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse, and various national and regional designs, and the denomination, on the reverse. The circulating coins, excepting the two-pound coin, were redesigned in 2008, keeping the sizes and compositions unchanged, but introducing reverse designs that each depict a part of the Royal Shield of Arms and form (most of) the whole shield when they are placed together in the appropriate arrangement (see photo). The exception, the 2008 one-pound coin, depicts the entire shield of arms on the reverse. All current coins carry a Latin inscription whose full form is ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA FIDEI DEFENSATRIX, meaning [...] "Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen and Defender of the Faith".|$|E
