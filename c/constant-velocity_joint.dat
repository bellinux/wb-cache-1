50|$|In the {{following}} year, NTN Toyo {{changed its name}} to NTN Corporation while creating a new <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> factory and research and development center for NTN Driveshaft in Columbus, Indiana.|$|E
5000|$|Alfred Hans Rzeppa (January 23, 1885, Gliwice [...] - [...] January 1965) was an American {{engineer}} of Silesian descent {{working at}} Ford Motor Company who invented {{a version of}} <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> in 1926. He proposed an improved design in 1936.|$|E
50|$|Quadrasteer was {{an option}} in 2002-2005 GM full size, single rear wheel trucks. <b>Constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> were {{used instead of}} {{universal}} joints.|$|R
50|$|Both {{front and}} rear axles were of the Timken {{split-type}} with a ratio of 6.6:1. The front axle had ball-type <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> while the two at the rear were full-floating.|$|R
50|$|<b>Constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> are {{protected}} by a rubber boot, a CV gaiter, usually filled with molybdenum disulfide grease. Cracks and splits in the boot will allow contaminants in, which would cause the joint to wear quickly.|$|R
50|$|The company then in 2002, {{took part}} in three {{separate}} joint ventures. First, they set up Shanghai NTN Corporation {{for the purpose of}} producing <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> cassettes. Second, working with Nidec Corporation, created NTN-NIDEC Corporation in Zhejiang, China. Then, in their final joint venture that year, the company, in conjunction with Taiwan Yulon Group Corporation, created Guangzhou NTN-Yulon Drivetrain to fabricate additional constant velocity joints. The year after this, three new companies were formed, two in the United States and one in China. The two American companies, named NTK Precision Axle Corporation and Asahi Forge of America Corporation provided heat treatment and forging services, respectively. The company in China was called Beijing NTN-Seohan Driveshaft, and served as an additional manufacturing facility for their <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> platform.|$|E
50|$|Suspension was {{independent}} {{front and}} rear with coil-over shock absorbers. Brakes were disk front and drum rear. An unusual feature of the rear suspension {{was that it was}} electrically adjustable. Extensive work was done on the type of <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> used to provide predictable behaviour but even then Busso felt it was a temporary solution.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to North America, NTN established in 2000 a <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> and bearing manufacturing facility in Thailand called NTN Manufacturing Company Limited. To manage {{the explosion of}} the company's portfolio, colloquially known as the [...] "Four Base Production and Sales System", NTN reorganized its operations. As a result, NTN Sales Corporation was made a part of the conglomerate.|$|E
50|$|GKN Driveline is the world's largest {{producer}} of <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints,</b> which it pioneered {{for use in}} automobiles. Its other products include sideshafts, propshafts, power transfer units, differentials, AWD couplings, disconnects, electric rear axles, and electric drive transmissions.|$|R
50|$|NTN Corporation (NTN Kabushiki-gaisha) (a.k.a. Niwa, Tomoe, Nishizono) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} manufacturers of bearings in Japan, second domestically only to NSK Limited. The company {{is one of the}} largest exporters worldwide of friction-reducing products such as <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
5000|$|MY 1984-1996: Dana 30, high pinion, reverse cut, 27-spline axleshafts (1989 - 1995 : with ABS used 5-297x {{universal}} joints, non-ABS had 5-260x universal joints. NP228/229 [...] "Selec-Trac" [...] equipped XJ {{models were}} also produced with <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> instead of universal joints.) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{universal}} joint (universal coupling, U-joint, Cardan joint, Spicer or Hardy Spicer joint, or Hooke's joint) {{is a joint}} or coupling in a rigid rod whose axis are inclined to each other, and is commonly used in shafts that transmit rotary motion. It consists {{of a pair of}} hinges located close together, oriented at 90° to each other, connected by a cross shaft. The {{universal joint}} is not a <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{was later}} described in Technica curiosa sive mirabilia artis (1664) by Gaspar Schott, who mistakenly claimed {{that it was}} a <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint.</b> Shortly afterwards, between 1667 and 1675, Robert Hooke analysed the joint and found that its speed of rotation was nonuniform, but that this property could be used to track the motion of the shadow on the face of a sundial. In fact, the component of the equation of time which accounts for the tilt of the equatorial plane relative to the ecliptic is entirely analogous to the mathematical description of the universal joint. The first recorded use of the term universal joint for this device was by Hooke in 1676, in his book Helioscopes. He published a description in 1678, resulting {{in the use of the}} term Hooke's joint in the English-speaking world. In 1683, Hooke proposed a solution to the nonuniform rotary speed of the universal joint: a pair of Hooke's joints 90° out of phase at either end of an intermediate shaft, an arrangement that is now known as a type of <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint.</b> Christopher Polhem of Sweden later re-invented the universal joint, giving rise to the name Polhemsknut in Swedish.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cars were}} {{initially}} built in small numbers for competition use, {{but they were}} exhibited and offered for road use at the 1927 Paris Motor Show. [...] They used a front-wheel-drive system featuring Grégoire's patented Tracta <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> and sliding pillar independent front suspension and a live axle with quarter-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. 1100, 1200, 1500 and 1600 cc engines made by S.C.A.P. were available with optional Cozette supercharger. The 1500 cc car was claimed to reach 80 mph.|$|E
50|$|In 1951, a new {{subsidiary}} Blade Research & Development (BRD) {{was formed}} at Aldridge, Staffordshire, to produce aero-engine turbine blades. Following a fall {{in demand for}} turbine blades in the late 1950s, the BRD factory switched to producing <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> and driveshafts for vehicles.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, NTN Toyo {{established}} {{its first}} technical center in Michigan, added a bearing-hub factory in Elgin, and partnered with GKN Transmission and Borg-Warner to produce <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> in Australia {{under the name}} Unidrive. Borg-Warner owned 50% of the company, GKN owned 30% and NTN Toyo owned 20%.|$|R
50|$|<b>Constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> (AKA homokinetic or CV joints) allow a {{drive shaft}} to {{transmit}} power through a variable angle, at constant rotational speed, without an appreciable increase in friction or play. They are mainly used in {{front wheel drive}} vehicles, and many modern rear wheel drive cars with independent rear suspension typically use CV joints {{at the ends of}} the rear axle halfshafts and increasingly use them on the drive shafts.|$|R
50|$|After NTN Toyo {{recovered}} from its downturn, the company looked {{to expand its}} <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> business in the United States. By expanding on all of their product lines {{in this part of}} the world, NTN Toyo was able to reduce the number of goods exported from Japan. In 1982, the company built an addition onto its Okayama plant for the purpose of building automotive joints. In addition, a joint venture with Hyundai Motors had this business partner manufacturing joints via a license from NTN Toyo. The following year, NTN Toyo also licensed Lepco Company and Taiway to produce additional constant-velocity joints.|$|E
50|$|The {{transmission}} is attached behind the engine, with a driveshaft that sends {{power to the}} front of the car to an asymmetrically installed limited-slip differential which then supplies power to the front wheels using half shafts; this allowed the powertrain to remain slightly behind the front wheels. This also gave the car a 60:40 front to rear weight distribution. The turning radius of the Inspire also was not as tight as its competitors due to the use of <b>Constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> installed on the front axle half shafts, but the Inspire did have an advantage in adverse traction conditions.|$|E
50|$|In 1959 Austin Mini was {{launched}} by the British Motor Corporation, designed by Alec Issigonis {{as a response to}} the first 'oil crisis', the 1956 Suez Crisis, and the boom in bubble cars that followed. It was the first production front-wheel-drive car with a watercooled inline four-cylinder engine mounted transversely. This allowed eighty percent of the floor plan for the use of passengers and luggage. The majority of modern cars use this configuration. Its progressive rate rubber sprung independent suspension, low centre of gravity, and wheel at each corner with radial tyres, gave a massive increase in grip and handling over all but the most expensive cars on the market. It used GKN designed <b>Constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> drive shaft universal joints.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, SEAT and 'Citroën-Hispania' jointly contributed {{equal shares}} in {{founding}} the Vigo-located factory of 'Industrias Mecánicas de Galicia, SA' (Indugasa) producing <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints,</b> essential components used in front-wheel drive cars i.e. in a transmission layout {{the use of}} which was {{becoming more and more}} common at the time. This plant — which in the next years would supply parts not only to SEAT and 'Citroën-Hispania' but also to 'Ford España' — was meant to be transferred later in 1986 to the multinational company GKN.|$|R
5000|$|The {{universal}} joint, one of {{the earliest}} means of transmitting power between two angled shafts, was invented by Gerolamo Cardano in the 16th century. The fact that it failed to maintain constant velocity during rotation was recognized by Robert Hooke in the 17th century, who proposed the first constant velocity joint, consisting of two Cardan joints offset by 90 degrees, so as to cancel out the velocity variations. This is the [...] "double Cardan", shown below. Many different types of <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> have been invented since then.|$|R
50|$|Like the Daimler scout car the Ferret {{suspension}} {{consisted of}} pairs of transverse links and single coil springs, the wheels driven by Tracta <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints,</b> but the Ferret benefited from epicyclic reduction gears that reduced transmission torque loads, essential given {{the more powerful}} six cylinder 4.26 litre water-cooled Rolls Royce B.60 petrol engine. Connected by a fluid coupling to a pre-selector five speed epicyclic gearbox, all gears being available in reverse, in its original form the Ferret this installation produced 116 bhp at 3,300 rpm and 129 bhp at 3,750 in its final form.|$|R
50|$|In November 1934, despite {{not having}} solved the weight problem which the {{designer}} feared {{would make his}} suspension unable to cope, Bendix and Kliesrath decided to send the SWC on a European tour of automobile manufacturers. After demonstrations in England for Alvis and Bentley Motors Limited, the car was shipped to France, where the SWC was demonstrated at Citroën, Peugeot, Renault and Bugatti. The trip was cut short in Genoa, Italy when a <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> broke. Due to the strain of the heavy body and frame, the universal joints had a limited {{ability to cope with}} the engine's torque at full left or full right lock, resulting in drivers having to fight the wheel in turns. The heavy SWC also wore out the rubber blocks. The damaged SWC was shipped by rail to Le Havre, France, and loaded on the German liner, SS Bremen, for return to the United States.|$|E
40|$|An {{on-board}} {{centralized system}} for regulating {{the pressure of}} the tyres of a motor-vehicle. Tue system comprises a source of pressurized air (lOl), two toroidal pneumatic rotary joints (T) each associated to a driving wheel (W) ofthe motor-vehicle, and a circuit that sets in communication the source of pressurized air (I O l) with an inlet fitting of each pneumatic rotary joint (T). Tue output member of the <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joint</b> (J) and the wheel spindle (7) have an internal duct (65) for passage of air, connected on one side to the respective pneumatic rotary joint (T) {{and on the other side}} to a plenum (P) of the respective driving wheel (W). Each non-driving wheel (WR) has its wheel spindle (46) traversed by an axial bare for the passage of air, connected on one side to the air-supply circuit via a pneumatic rotary joint (TR) and on the other side to a plenum (PR) of the non-driving wheel (WR), which is in turn connected to the inner chamber (C) of the tyre. Each driving wheel or non-driving wheel has its plenum (P, PR) connected to the inner chamber (C) of the tyre via two parallel lines (L 2, L 3), for deflating and inflating, respectively, the tyre interposed in which are respective one-way valves (28, 32). Tue one-way valve (28) on the deflation line is provided with a return spring (30), which guarantees a pre-set minimum value of he pressure of the inner chamber (C) of the tyre...|$|E
50|$|The Corcel GT was {{moderately}} {{successful in}} Brazilian Tarumã, Interlagos and beach rally street car championships during the 1970s, {{thanks to its}} front-wheel-drive stability and low weight (920 kg), which allowed a high power-to-weight ratio. It would not be faster than the V-8 Maverick and Chevrolet Opala, but it would beat everything else, including four- and six-cylinder Mavericks and some Dodge Chargers that partook of the events. These competitions uncovered that the front drive universal joint was prone to break under heavy stress, so in 1976 the Corcel line switched to <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Type 53 was {{notoriously}} {{difficult to}} steer. At the Type 53's {{debut in the}} 1932 Monaco Grand Prix, Albert Divo, noted for his size and strength, was chosen to drive the car, but he gave up during practice after exhausting himself. [...] In June 1932, Jean Bugatti rolled a Type 53 at the Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb. The hard steering was attributed to not having <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> for the front halfshafts and to unequal-length halfshafts without matching torsional characteristics. [...] Modern tests, however, have shown the car to be quite tractable at speed.|$|R
50|$|A version {{utilizing}} the VWB Variant II's more modern chassis (albeit {{still with the}} Brasilia's front suspension) called the P 018 appeared for the 1982 model year. This had slightly wider tracks front and rear, and a rear suspension featuring semi-axles with <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints,</b> sprung by transverse torsion bars, rather than the Brasilia's simpler semi-trailing rear. As with other Pumas, an air-cooled 1.6-litre Volkswagen boxer-four was standard equipment, with larger 1,7, 1,8, and 2.0-litre versions available at extra cost. An annual production of 1,000 was planned, {{but in the end}} only about 55 of the P 018s were completed.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of globalization, with {{bearings}} being further governed by international guidelines, NTN consolidated its foreign operations while trying to expand further into cutting edge markets. In order to expand North American operations, the company formed NTN USA Corporation, which was slated to become a holding company for their existing US divisions. They also established an office to oversee the fabrication activities of their existing operations. One of NTN's objectives was to begin production of <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> in North America. One of their first steps in doing so was the 1996 purchase of Federal-Mogul's ball bearings sector.|$|R
5000|$|A five-speed, all-indirect manual {{transmission}} using a [...] "dog-leg" [...] selector pattern {{was the only}} transmission offered. Instead of the conventional [...] "H" [...] shift pattern, this arrangement (also known as a [...] "reverse h-gate") has 1st gear situated to the far left and back, behind reverse. This pattern has been popular with racing gearboxes, as it allows quicker, more direct shifts between 2nd and 3rd, and 4th and 5th, gears. Output from the final drive to the rear wheels is via a pair of short, solid drive shafts fitted with <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> at each end to allow for suspension articulation.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{geometry}} and packaging constraints, the CV <b>joints</b> (<b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints)</b> {{attached to the}} wheel hub {{have a tendency to}} wear out much earlier than the universal joints typically used in their rear-wheel-drive counterparts (although rear-wheel-drive vehicles with independent rear suspension also employ CV joints and half-shafts). The significantly shorter drive axles on a front-wheel-drive car causes the joint to flex through a much wider degree of motion, compounded by additional stress and angles of steering, while the CV joints of a rear-wheel-drive car regularly see angles and wear of less than half that of front-wheel-drive vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{relative}} movement between the wheels and the differential is achieved {{through the use}} of swinging driveshafts connected via universal joints (U joints), analogous to the <b>constant-velocity</b> (CV) <b>joints</b> used in front-wheel-drive vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{incredible}} growth that Toyo underwent, the organization decentralized by creating subsidiaries to oversee new products. In 1961, Toyo {{set up a}} joint venture with INA Wälzlager Schaeffler called NTN Wälzlager Europa in order to manufacture needle bearings. Toyo utilized design data from INA Wälzlager Schaeffler to make these products. They also established Kongo Bearing Company to manage the creation of pillow block bearings. One year later, Toyo founded Senyo Kosakuki Kenkyujo, a maker of ball bearing equipment. In 1963, Toyo entered into business with Hardy Spicer to produce Birfield-type <b>constant-velocity</b> universal <b>joints.</b> They also pursued business overseas by establishing NTN Bearing Corporation of America. The following year, working with GKN Transmission, the company fabricated <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> in their home country and formed NTN Bearing-GKN while also opening a facility in Europe called NTN France. The year after that, Toyo started manufacturing oil-impregnated sintered bearings and pipe fittings. Four years later in 1968, the company set up yet another facility in North America called NTN Bearing Corporation of Canada.|$|R
50|$|The 505 had {{rear-wheel drive}} {{and the engine}} at the front, mounted longitudinally. The {{suspension}} system included MacPherson struts and coil springs at front and semi-trailing arms with coil springs at rear, with a body-mounted rear differential and four <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints.</b> Station wagons (and most sedans built in Argentina) had instead a live-axle rear suspension, with Panhard rod and coil springs. Stabilizer bars were universal at front but model-dependent at rear. The car used disc brakes at the front, and either disc or drum brakes at the rear, depending on the model. The steering was a rack and pinion system, which was power assisted on most models.|$|R
2500|$|Molybdenum is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used of the refractory metals. [...] Its most important use is as a strengthening alloy of steel. [...] Structural tubing and piping often contains molybdenum, as do many stainless steels. [...] Its strength at high temperatures, resistance to wear and low coefficient of friction are all properties which make it invaluable as an alloying compound. [...] Its excellent anti-friction properties lead to its incorporation in greases and oils where reliability and performance are critical. [...] Automotive <b>constant-velocity</b> <b>joints</b> use grease containing molybdenum. [...] The compound sticks readily to metal and forms a very hard, friction resistant coating. [...] Most of the world's molybdenum ore can be found in China, the USA, Chile and Canada.|$|R
