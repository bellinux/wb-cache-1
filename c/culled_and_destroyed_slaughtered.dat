More than fifty towns were destroyed; houses and food were burned, orchards <b>destroyed</b> <b>and</b> livestock <b>slaughtered.</b> Hundreds of Cherokees were killed, and survivors were sold as slaves. Virginia sent a large force and North Carolina sent volunteers to the Overhill Towns. Dragging Canoe, who had returned with his warriors, ordered the Cherokee towns burned, women, children and the elderly moved south of the Hiwassee River and the Virginians ambushed at the French Broad River.

In a 1948 RAF staff publication, Luftwaffe losses were given as about 4,500 parachute and glider troop casualties and about 170 Ju 52s lost or severely damaged; losses in fighter and bomber units were small {{due to the lack}} of air opposition.|$|R

Mechanisms {{contributing}} {{to the spread of}} avian influenza seem to be well identified, but how their interplay led to the current worldwide spread pattern of H 5 N 1 influenza is still unknown {{due to the lack of}} effective global surveillance and relevant data. Here we develop some determin-istic models based on the transmission cycle and modes of H 5 N 1 and focusing on the interaction among poultry, wild birds and environment. Some of the model parameters are obtained from existing literatures, and others are allowed to vary in order to assess the effectiveness of various control strategies involving bird migration, agro-ecological environments, live and dead poultry trading, smuggling of wild birds, mechanical movement of infected materials and specific farming practices. Our simulations are carried out for a set of parameters that leads to the basic reproduc-tion number 3. 3. We show that by reducing 95 % of the initial susceptible poultry population or by killing all infected poultry birds within one day, one may control the disease outbreak in a local setting. Our simulation shows that cleaning the environment is also a feasible and useful control measure, but <b>culling</b> wild birds <b>and</b> <b>destroying</b> their habitat are ineffective control measures. We use a one dimensional PDE model to examine the contribution to the spatial spread rate by the size of the susceptible poultry birds, the diffusion rates of the wild birds and the virus.
