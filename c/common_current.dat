25|$|The {{original}} purpose of HSL and HSV and similar models, and their most <b>common</b> <b>current</b> application, is in color selection tools. At their simplest, some such color pickers provide three sliders, {{one for each}} attribute. Most, however, show a two-dimensional slice through the model, along with a slider controlling which particular slice is shown. The latter type of GUI exhibits great variety, because of the choice of cylinders, hexagonal prisms, or cones/bicones that the models suggest (see the diagram {{near the top of}} the page). Several color choosers from the 1990s are shown to the right, most of which have remained nearly unchanged in the intervening time: today, nearly every computer color chooser uses HSL or HSV, at least as an option. Some more sophisticated variants are designed for choosing whole sets of colors, basing their suggestions of compatible colors on the HSL or HSV relationships between them.|$|E

The doctrine of unipolarity, as formerly stated, and I think generally understood[A], is evidently inconsistent with my view of a current (1627.); and the later singular phenomena of poles and flames described by Erman and others[B] partake of the same inconsistency of character. If a unipolar body could exist, i.e. one that could conduct the one electricity and not the other, what very new characters we should have a right to expect in the currents of single electricities passing through them, and how greatly ought they to differ, not only from the <b>common</b> <b>current</b> which is supposed to have both electricities travelling in opposite directions in equal amount at the same time, but also from each other! The facts, which are excellent, have, however, gradually been more correctly explained by Becquerel[C], Andrews[D], and others; and I understand that Professor Ohms[E] has perfected the work, in his close examination of all the phenomena; and after showing that similar phenomena can take place with good conductors, proves that with soap, &c. many of the effects are the mere consequences of the bodies evolved by electrolytic action.|$|E
