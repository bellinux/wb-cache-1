40|$|Background: Anti-ganglioside {{antibodies}} with a {{pathogenic potential}} {{are present in}} C. jejuni-associated Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) patients and are probably induced by molecular mimicry. Immunization studies in rabbits and mice have demonstrated that these anti-ganglioside antibodies can be induced using purified lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS) from C. jejuni in a strong adjuvant. Methodology/Principal Findings: To investigate whether natural colonization of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> a ganglioside-mimicking C. jejuni strain induces an anti-ganglioside response, and to investigate the diversity in anti-ganglioside response between and within genetically different chicken lines, we orally challenged <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> different C. jejuni strains. Oral challenge of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> a C. jejuni strain from a GBS patient, containing a LOS that mimics ganglioside GM 1, induced specific IgM and IgG anti-LOS and anti-GM 1 antibodies. Inoculation of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> the Penner HS: 3 serostrain, without a GM 1 -like structure, induced anti-LOS but no anti-ganglioside antibodies. We observed different patterns of anti-LOS/ganglioside response between and within the five strains of chickens. Conclusions: Natural infection of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> C. jejuni induces anti-ganglioside antibodies. The production of antibodies i...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAfter avian {{influenza}} (AI) vaccination dams will produce progeny <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> maternally derived AI specific antibodies. In {{this study we}} examined the effect of maternal immunity in young chickens on the protection against highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 AI infection and {{on the effectiveness of}} AI vaccination. The mean haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer in sera of 14 -day-old progeny chickens was approximately 8 -fold lower than the mean titer in sera of vaccinated dams. After H 5 N 1 infection at the age of 14 days, <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> maternal antibody titers lived a few days longer than control chickens. However, only a low percentage of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> maternal immunity survived challenge with H 5 N 1. In most progeny <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> maternal immunity, high virus titers (> 104 EID 50) were present in the trachea during the first 4 days after H 5 N 1 infection. In the cloaca only low virus titers were present in most chickens. In 14 -day-old progeny <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> maternal immunity the induction of antibody titers by vaccination was severely inhibited, with only a few chickens showing responses similar to the control chickens. It is concluded that high maternal antibody titers are required for clinical protection and reduction of virus titers after infection of chickens, whereas low antibody titers already interfere with vaccine efficacy...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of reoviruses in commercial <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> the runting/stunting syndrome, tenosynovitis, and normal chickens was investigated. Reoviruses were isolated from 3 -week-old <b>chickens</b> affected <b>with</b> the runting/stunting syndrome and from older <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> tenosynovitis; viruses were isolated from tissues {{with and without}} lesions. Reoviruses were also frequently isolated from rectal contents of normal 3 -week-old chickens, and there was serological evidence of previous reovirus infection in all flocks of adult meat breeder chickens examined. The widespread occurrence of reoviruses in both normal and diseased chickens indicates that the isolation of reoviruses from tissues of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> lesions does not necessarily imply any aetiological relationship of reovirus with disease, {{even in the absence}} of other known causes. However, the occurrence of reovirus in normal chickens does not preclude an aetiological relationship with disease and further investigation of strain variation and possible virulence factors in avian reoviruses is required...|$|R

5|$|With {{the breed}} that carries his name, John Sebright {{intentionally}} {{set out to}} create a very small bantam <b>chicken</b> <b>with</b> laced plumage similar to the laced variety of Polish chickens. Although the exact makeup of the breed is uncertain, he {{is thought to have}} crossed British, Hamburgh, Nankin and Polish birds with a base of Rosecombs before achieving a laced chicken that would breed true. After the breed's establishment circa 1810, Sebright founded The Sebright Bantam Club, which was the very first individual breed association for chickens. The breed has appeared in the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection since the first edition in 1874. Today, the breed is one of the ten most popular bantam chickens, according to the American Bantam Association.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{experimental}} Salmonella infection on chicken lymphoid organs, immune responses, and fecal shedding of salmonellae were assessed following oral inoculation of 1 -day-old chicks or intra-air-sac infection of 4 -week-old <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> virulent S. typhimurium wild-type X 3761 or avirulent S. typhimurium Acya Acrp vaccine strain x 3985. Some 4 -week-old <b>chickens</b> infected intra-air-sac <b>with</b> X 3761 or x 3985 were challenged with Bordetella avium {{to determine the}} effect of Salmonella infection on secondary infection by B. avium. S. typhimurium X 3761 caused lymphocyte depletion, atrophy of lymphoid organs, and immunosuppression 2 days after infection in 1 -day-old chicks and 4 -week-old chickens. The observed lymphocyte depletion or atrophy of lymphoid organs was transient and dose dependent. Lymphocyte depletion and immunosuppression were associated with prolonged fecal shedding of S. typhimurium X 3761. No lymphocyte depletion, immunosuppres-sion, or prolonged Salmonella shedding was observed in groups of chickens infected orally or intra-air-sac with x 3985. Infection of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> salmonellae before challenge with B. avium did not suppress the specific antibody response to B. avium. However, B. avium isolation was higher in visceral organs of <b>chickens</b> infected <b>with</b> X 3761 and challenged with B. avium than in <b>chickens</b> infected <b>with</b> B. avium only.

40|$|Campylobacter jejuni is {{a leading}} {{bacterial}} cause of human gastrointestinal disease worldwide. While C. jejuni is a commensal organism in chickens, case-studies have demonstrated a link between infection with C. jejuni and the consumption of foods that have been cross-contaminated with raw or undercooked poultry. We hypothesized that vaccination of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> C. jejuni surface-exposed colonization proteins (SECPs) would reduce the ability of C. jejuni to colonize chickens, thereby reducing the contamination of poultry products at the retail level and potentially providing a safer food product for consumers. To test our hypothesis, we injected <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> recombinant C. jejuni peptides from CadF, FlaA, FlpA, CmeC, and a CadF-FlaA-FlpA fusion protein. Seven days following challenge, chickens were necropsied and cecal contents were serially diluted and plated {{to determine the number}} of C. jejuni per gram of material.

25|$|The Top 3, Sophie, Bill and Fenton {{had just}} two final {{challenges}} to complete. The {{first was the}} last chance {{to work on their}} presenting skills with Mark and Julia. Mark held a Cue card which they were required to read while looking down the camera and deliver it with as much personality as possible. Mark was looking for someone with the ability to engage the audience. Bill and Sophie struggled with their delivery while big Fenton nailed it in one take, getting a round of applause from both judges. Then it was off to one of Sydney's best fine dining experiences, Mint bar and dining. Once there they had one last attempt to impress 5 VIP's with a signature dish under the keen eye of Ben O'Donoghue. This showed another side of Ben that the contestants had yet to see, a no nonsense head chef barking orders at them in the kitchen and putting the pressure on to get the meals out as efficiently as possible. Sophie served up a very fresh and light Mexican <b>chicken</b> <b>with</b> a tasty salad including heart of palm and pistachio. The food critiques were very impressed. Next up Bill aimed to impress with his dish, crayfish cooked in herb butter and served with a salad. The reaction was the same all round from the judges, not good. The presentation was lacking and the salad didn't suit the dish. Owner of Mint remarked 'It's like two different dishes on one plate.' Finally Fenton from Queensland served up an eye fillet with hollandaise and potato rösti (a favourite at his restaurant.) While one judge thought the beef was the best stating 'he (Fenton) put his whole life on the BBQ and served it up for us.' it was Sophie's chicken that got the majority of the VIP judges vote and won her ticket through to the grand finale. That left Fenton and Bill. Ben then announced that Bill would be going home and Fenton was going through. But then in a final twist, Chef Ben O'Donoghue decided to bring Bill back because he felt that he had let him down with his direction in the kitchen. So the Top 2 was again the Top 3 with all contestants going into the final with the winner announced on Australia Day.|$|E
