This paper describes the impact of an auditory secondary task on drivers' mental states during a primary driving task. N = 20 participants performed the test procedure in a car following task with repeated forced braking on a non-public test track. Performance measures (provoked reaction time to brake lights) and brain activity (EEG alpha spindles) were analyzed to describe distracted drivers. Further, a classification approach was used to investigate whether alpha spindles can predict drivers' mental states. Results show that reaction times and alpha spindle rate increased with time-on-task. Moreover, brake reaction times and alpha spindle rate were significantly higher while driving with auditory secondary task opposed to driving only. In single-trial classification, a <b>combination</b> of <b>spindle</b> parameters yielded a median classification error of about 8 % in discriminating the distracted from the alert driving. Reduced driving performance (i. e., prolonged brake reaction times) during increased cognitive load is assumed to be indicated by EEG alpha spindles, enabling the quantification of driver distraction in experiments on public roads without verbally assessing the drivers' mental states...|$|R

The number of twist of wrapping fibre layer is determined. The effect of the yarn delivery speed, hollow spindle diameter, and the main draft on the hairiness, mass irregularity, tenacity, elongation, resistance to abrasion and bending rigidity of Vortex yarn is observed. The yarn properties are compared with the properties of open-end rotor spun yarns. Slivers of the same spinning lot {{were used for the}} production of both kinds of yarn. The results showed that the delivery speed in <b>combination</b> with <b>spindle</b> diameter affects yarn diameter, hairiness and abrasion resistance. Mass irregularity and imperfections of yarn is mainly affected by the main draft of drafting unit. Technological parameters of spinning do not affect the level of bending rigidity of the Vortex yarn. Tested rotor spun yarns had a larger diameter, higher hairiness, lower tenacity and higher elongation, lower mass irregularity and number of imperfections, higher abrasion resistance and lower bending rigidity compared to tested Vortex spun yarns...|$|R
40|$|Most carcinomas {{present some}} form of {{chromosome}} instability in <b>combination</b> with <b>spindle</b> defects. Numerical instability is likely caused by spindle aberrations, but the origin of breaks and translocations remains elusive. To determine whether one mechanism can bring about both types of instability, we studied the relationship between DNA damage and spindle defects. Although lacking apparent repair defects, primary Dido mutant cells formed micronuclei containing damaged DNA. The presence of centromeres showed that micronuclei were caused by spindle defects, and cell cycle markers showed that DNA damage was generated during mitosis. Although the micronuclei themselves persisted, the DNA damage within was repaired during S and G 2 phases. DNA breaks in Dido mutant cells regularly colocalized with centromeres, which were occasionally distorted. Comparable defects were found in APC mutant cell lines, an independent system for spindle defects. On {{the basis of these}} results, we propose a model for break formation in which spindle defects lead to centromere shearing. Communicated by A.

40|$|Chatter is a {{particularly}} severe and damaging form of tool vibration that can occur in milling processes under certain <b>combinations</b> of <b>spindle</b> speed and axial depth of cut. The ability to predict the onset of chatter in a particular tool - workpiece dynamic system could enable {{the development of a}} real-time control system that predicts and avoids chatter conditions. Various Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) are considered here for estimating modal parameters or cutting force coefficients of the tool- workpiece dynamic system from tool deflection measurements in high-speed low-radial-immersion milling. These parameter estimates could be used to predict the dynamic stability of the system. A novel application of an EKF is proposed here to estimate both a radial and a tangential cutting force coefficient. Separate sets of force coefficients for each cutting tooth may also be estimated, and the system is found to be observable. The EKF is tested on simulated measurements and found to perform accurately and repeatably. The EKF is also tested on experimental measurements, and the resulting parameter estimates result in simulations that correlate well with experimental tool deflection trajectories. Model modifications are also proposed that could improve accuracy, including the addition of centrifugal and Coriolis inertial forces and a means of accounting for tool eccentricity...|$|R
40|$|The {{high-speed}} milling {{process is}} widely used in industry. However the material removal rate (MRR) is often limited by the occurrence of chatter. Chatter is a heavy vibration of the cutter, which results in a non-smooth workpiece surface, rapid tool wear and noise [1]. Therefore, to maximise production rates, the maximum MRR should be found where no chatter occurs. Several types of chatter exist, but the most occurring type is regenerative chatter. Therefore, {{in this study we}} focus on this type of chatter. Early {{studies have shown that the}} border at which chatter occurred could be graphically shown by a Stability Lobe Diagram (SLD). Often, on the horizontal axis the spindle speed is shown and on the vertical axis the depth of cut is depicted. At all <b>combinations</b> of <b>spindle</b> speed and depth of cut below this line no chatter occurs. At all points above this line chatter occurs. The goal of the TNO project Chatterbox, is to predict the stability lobes in a fast and accurate way. Furthermore, a controller will be built that assures a chatter-free cut, even if the process conditions, and hence the stability limit, changes over time. The model that describes the milling process is a nonlinear, nonautonomous set of delay differential equations. Using this model, it is found that the occurrence of chatter is due to...|$|R
40|$|The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is an E 3 {{ubiquitin}} ligase that targets substrates for degradation {{to promote}} mitotic progression. Here, {{we show that}} the DNA damage response protein 53 BP 1 contains conserved KEN boxes that are required for APC/C-dependent degradation in early mitosis. Mutation of the 53 BP 1 KEN boxes stabilized the protein and extended mitotic duration, whereas 53 BP 1 knockdown resulted in a shorter and delayed mitosis. Loss of 53 BP 1 increased APC/C activity, and we show that 53 BP 1 is a direct APC/C inhibitor. Although 53 BP 1 function is not absolutely required for normal cell cycle progression, knockdown was highly toxic in <b>combination</b> with mitotic <b>spindle</b> poisons. Moreover, chemical inhibition of the APC/C was able to rescue the lethality of 53 BP 1 loss.

Inhibition of proliferation was explored in vitro using dimethylthiazol carboxymethoxyphenyl sulfophenyl tetrazolium (MTS) assay. Mice bearing human xenografts {{were treated with}} weekly intravenous injections of volasertib. Volasertib inhibited proliferation in all 40 cell lines tested, with a mean half-maximal growth inhibitory concentration of 313 nmol/l (range: 4 - 5000 nmol/l).

The experiments have been conducted on vertical CNC machining centre using Taguchi's experimental design technique. The parameters used are Spindle speed, feed and wt % of reinforcement. The effect of machining parameters on burr height is evaluated and the optimum cutting condition for minimizing the burr height is determined by using desirability function. A model has been established between the cutting parameters and burr height using response surface methodology.

40|$|Abstract Although {{the large}} {{majority}} of solid tumors show a <b>combination</b> of mitotic <b>spindle</b> defects and chromosomal instability, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms that govern the initial steps in tumorigenesis. The recent report of spindle-induced DNA damage provides evidence for a single mechanism responsible for the most prominent genetic defects in chromosomal instability. Spindle-induced DNA damage is brought about by uncorrected merotelic attachments, which cause kinetochore distortion, chromosome breakage at the centromere, and possible activation of DNA damage repair pathways. Although merotelic attachments are common early in mitosis, some escape detection by the kinetochore pathway. As a consequence, a proportion of merotelic attachments gives rise to chromosome breakage in normal cells and in carcinomas. An intrinsic chromosome segregation defect might thus form the basis of tumor initiation. We propose a hypothesis in which merotelic attachments and chromosome breakage establish a feedback loop that results in relaxation of the spindle checkpoint and suppression of anti-proliferative pathways, thereby promoting carcinogenesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of apical–basal polarity {{within a single}} cell and throughout a growing tissue is a key feature of epithelial morphogenesis. To examine the underlying mechanisms, the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco- 2 was grown in a three-dimensional matrix to generate a cystlike structure, where the apical surface of each epithelial cell faces a fluid-filled central lumen. A discrete apical domain is established {{as early as the}} first cell division and between the two daughter cells. During subsequent cell divisions, the apical domain of each daughter cell is maintained {{at the center of the}} growing structure through a <b>combination</b> of mitotic <b>spindle</b> orientation and asymmetric abscission. Depletion of Cdc 42 does not prevent the {{establishment of}} apical–basal polarity in individual cells but rather disrupts spindle orientation, leading to inappropriate positioning of apical surfaces within the cyst.

40|$|Whereas muscle {{spindles}} play {{a prominent}} role in current theories of human motor control, Golgi tendon organs (GTO) and their associated tendons are often neglected. This is surprising since there is ample evidence that both tendons and GTOs contribute importantly to neuromusculoskeletal dynamics. Using detailed musculoskeletal models, we provide evidence that simple feedback using muscle spindles alone results in very poor control of joint position and movement since muscle spindles cannot sense changes in tendon length that occur with changes in muscle force. We propose that a <b>combination</b> of <b>spindle</b> and GTO afferents can provide an estimate of muscle-tendon complex length, which can be effectively used for low-level feedback during both postural and movement tasks. The feasibility of the proposed scheme was tested using detailed musculoskeletal models of the human arm. Responses to transient and static perturbations were simulated using a 1 -degree-of-freedom (DOF) model of the arm and showed that the combined feedback enabled the system to respond faster, reach steady state faster, and achieve smaller static position errors. Finally, we incorporated the proposed scheme in an optimally controlled 2 -DOF model of the arm for fast point-to-point shoulder and elbow movements. Simulations showed that the proposed feedback could be easily incorporated in the optimal control framework without complicating the computation of the optimal control solution, yet greatly enhancing the system's response to perturbations. The theoretical analyses in this study might furthermore provide insight about the strong physiological couplings found between muscle spindle and GTO afferents in the human nervous system. © 2013 the American Physiological Society...|$|R

40|$|Spinal {{circuits}} may organize trajectories using pattern {{generators and}} synergies. In frogs, prior work supports fixed-duration pulses of fixed composition synergies, forming primitives. In wiping behaviors, spinal frogs adjust their motor activity {{according to the}} starting limb position and generate fairly straight and accurate isochronous trajectories across the workspace. To test whether a compact description using primitives modulated by proprioceptive feedback could reproduce such trajectory formation, we built a biomechanical model based on physiological data. We recorded from hindlimb muscle spindles to evaluate possible proprioceptive input. As movement was initiated, early skeletofusimotor activity enhanced many muscle spindles firing rates. Before movement began, a rapid estimate of the limb position from simple <b>combinations</b> of <b>spindle</b> rates was possible. Three primitives {{were used in the}} model with muscle compositions based on those observed in frogs. Our simulations showed that simple gain and phase shifts of primitives based on published feedback mechanisms could generate accurate isochronous trajectories and motor patterns that matched those observed. Although on-line feedback effects were omitted from the model after movement onset, our primitive-based model reproduced the wiping behavior across a range of starting positions. Without modifications from proprioceptive feedback, the model behaviors missed the target {{in a manner similar to}} that in deafferented frogs. These data show how early proprioception might be used to make a simple estimate initial limb state and to implicitly plan a movement using observed spinal motor primitives. Simulations showed that choice of synergy composition played a role in this simplicity. To generate froglike trajectories, a hip flexor synergy without sartorius required motor patterns with more proprioceptive knee flexor control than did patterns built with a more natural synergy including sartorius. Such synergy choices and control strategies may simplify the circuitry required for reflex trajectory construction and adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Background. During EEG {{suppression}} with iso¯urane or sevo¯urane anaesthesia, median {{nerve stimulation}} causes cortical responses of two kinds: an N 20 wave with a latency of 20 ms and an EEG burst with a latency of 200 ms. We tested {{the possibility that}} median nerve stimula-tion during EEG suppression with propofol would cause an EEG response that was consistent enough to be of use for neuromonitoring. Methods. Eight patients were anaesthetized with propofol to allow burst suppression. Electrical stimulation of the median nerve was applied during general anaesthesia and the EEG was measured. Results. The EEG response to a painful stimulus had four successive components: (i) N 20 and P 22 potentials, re¯ecting activation of fast somatosensory pathways; (ii) a high-amplitude nega-tive wave, possibly re¯ecting activation of the somatosensory cortex SII bilaterally; (iii) a burst (i. e. a negative slow wave with superimposed 10 Hz activity, probably re¯ecting an arousal mechanism); and (iv) a 13 ± 15 Hz spindle, probably originating from the thalamus, similar to sleep spindles.

40|$|International audienceHigh-speed {{machining}} of thin-walled structures {{is widely}} used in the aeronautical industry. Higher spindle speed and machining feed rate, combined with a greater depth of cut, increases the removal rate and with it, productivity. The <b>combination</b> of higher <b>spindle</b> speed and depth of cut makes instabilities (chatter) a far more significant concern. Chatter causes reduced surface quality and accelerated tool wear. Since chatter is so prevalent, traditional cutting parameters and processes are frequently rendered ineffective and inaccurate. For the machine tool to reach its full utility, the chatter vibrations must be identified and avoided. In order to avoid chatter and implement optimum cutting parameters, the machine tool including all components and the workpiece must be dynamically mapped to identify vibration characteristics. The aim of the presented work {{is to develop a}} model for the prediction of stability limits as a function of process parameters. The model consists of experimentally measured vibration properties of the spindle-tool, and finite element calculations of the workpiece in (three) different stages of the process. Commercial software packages used for integration into the model prove to accomplish demands for functionality and performance. A reference geometry that is typical for an aircraft detail is used for evaluation of the prediction methodology. In order to validate the model, the stability limits predicted by the use of numerical simulation are compared with the results based on the experimental work...|$|R
40|$|A {{diverse group}} of proteins, the {{activities}} of which are precisely orchestrated during mitosis, have emerged as targets for cancer therapeutics; these include the Aurora kinases (AKs), Polo‐like kinases (PLKs), and the kinesin spindle protein (KSP). KSP {{is essential for the}} proper separation of spindle poles during mitosis. Agents that target KSP selectively act on cells undergoing cell division, which means that KSP inhibitors are mitosis‐specific drugs, and have demonstrated remarkable activities in vitro. However, a significant obstacle to the success of KSP inhibitors is that these compounds, with tremendous efficacy in vitro, have demonstrated little or even no antitumor activity in vivo. Accumulated data suggest that a combination of KSP inhibitors with various cytostatic drugs will result in a more powerful tumor‐killing effect than monotherapy. Combination therapies might predominate and represent the next frontier in the discovery research of KSP inhibitors as potential anticancer drugs.
