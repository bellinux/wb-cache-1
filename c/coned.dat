5|$|The tower's {{electrical}} service was supplied by Consolidated Edison (<b>ConEd)</b> at 13,800volts. The electricity {{passed through the}} World Trade Center Primary Distribution Center (PDC), and was then sent up the building's core to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors. The substations lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277volts, and the voltage was then further lowered to 208/120volts for general power and lighting services. The complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and {{on the roof of}} Five World Trade Center.|$|E
25|$|The first weather {{derivative}} deal was in July 1996 when Aquila Energy structured a dual-commodity hedge for Consolidated Edison (<b>ConEd).</b> The transaction involved ConEd's purchase of electric power from Aquila {{for the month}} of August. The price of the power was agreed, and a weather clause was embedded into the contract. This clause stipulated that Aquila would pay <b>ConEd</b> a rebate if August turned out to be cooler than expected. The measurement of this was referenced to Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) measured at New York City's Central Park weather station. If total CDDs were from 0 to 10% below the expected 320, the company received no discount to the power price, but if total CDDs were 11 to 20% below normal, <b>ConEd</b> would receive a $16,000 discount. Other discounted levels were worked in for even greater departures from normal.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{live steam}} and exhaust steam {{injectors}} also assists in the pre-heating of boiler feedwater {{to a small}} degree, {{though there is no}} efficiency advantage to live steam injectors. Such pre-heating also reduces the thermal shock that a boiler might experience when cold water is introduced directly. This is further helped by the top feed, where water is introduced to the highest part of the boiler and made to trickle over a series of trays. G.J. Churchward fitted this arrangement to the high end of his domeless <b>coned</b> boilers. Other British lines such as the LBSCR fitted some locomotives with the top feed inside a separate dome forward of the main one.|$|E

2500|$|The Pwllyrhebog Colliery incline on {{the former}} Taff Vale Railway was a [...] 1-in-13 incline with a {{continuous}} rope cable so that a descending train was partially counterbalanced by an ascending train.

No. 2750 Class 2721 had been fitted with the necessary winding gear to control the incline in 1935, but was withdrawn in 1945, and replaced by 5700 No. 7722 which was fitted with the winding gear in 1946.

5000|$|A <b>coned</b> disc also becomes stiff against axial loads, as the web is {{no longer}} purely {{perpendicular}} to the axis of the wheel. Unlike a flat disc, there is no direction where the whole of a <b>coned</b> disc would be perpendicular (and thus flexible) to it. A drawback of a simple cone is that the wheel now becomes wider, along the axis. The wobbly web effectively [...] "folds" [...] a <b>coned</b> disc wheel into pleats, making it narrower again, but retaining the axial stiffness. This pleated disc is also stiffer against nutating forces. A similar feature, a 'sine wave wall', is sometimes encountered in architecture where a straight wall is made stronger against sideways forces by corrugating it.|$|E
