40|$|The {{study of}} the micro-plastic {{behavior}} of rough surface contact is the critical link towards a fundamental understanding of contact, friction, adhesion, and surface failures at small length scales. In the companion paper (Yu et al., J. Mech. Phys. Solids 55, 489 - 516, 2007), we have studied the onset of surface yielding due to single-dislocation nucleation from a stepped surface under adhesive contact. Here we analyze the <b>contact</b> <b>hardening</b> behavior due to multiple dislocations in a two-dimensional dislocation model. Continuum micromechanical analyses are used to derive the configurational force on the dislocation, while a modified Rice-Thomson model is {{used to describe the}} dislocation nucleation. Dislocations nucleated from a surface source are stabilized and pile up {{as a result of the}} balance between the resolved driving force and the non-zero lattice resistance in the solid. The dislocation pileup will exert a strong back stress to prevent further dislocation nucleation and thus lead to the <b>contact</b> <b>hardening</b> behavior, the degree of which depends on the slip-plane orientation. Particularly, we find that the dislocation interactions between two slip planes can make the contact loading order-of-magnitude easy to nucleate multiple dislocations, which is thus named “latent softening”.

The two dominant factions in the early 20th century were the Bülow-Eulenburg clique, headed by Bernhard von Bülow and his close friend Eulenburg, who were rapidly eclipsing the faction headed by Friedrich von Holstein, the powerful director of the Political Department at the Auswärtiges Amt. Holstein had known Eulenburg since June 1886 and had once been his ally when the two had plotted against Bismarck in 1889-1890, but starting around 1894, Eulenburg and Holstein had started to come into conflict with each other. The close friendship between Eulenburg and the Kaiser meant that Holstein tended to lose his arguments with Eulenburg.

The ZDP was an effective antiwear additive for all the diesters except dibutyl oxalate and dibutyl sebacate.

Finally, the experimental findings were evaluated {{with respect to the}} initial microstructure of the tool steels in their as-received and/or heat-treated state. In the case of non-conformal point contact against ceramic counterbodies, the friction coefficient was found to depend only on the steel grade and the particular counterbody, tending to a constant value, regardless of the applied load and/or its heat- or surface treatment. In the case of conformal plane <b>contact</b> against <b>hardened</b> steel, each steel grade exhibited an applied pressure range within which the wear coefficient remains practically constant, whereas for higher pressure values, seizure occurred.

40|$|A robust {{procedure}} for the surface bio-functionalization of carbon surfaces was developed. It consists on the modification of carbon {{materials in contact}} with an aqueous suspension of the enzyme laccase from Trametes versicolor and the lyophilization agent maltodextrin, with the pH value adjusted close to the isoelectric point of the enzyme. We report in-situ investigations applying Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D) for carbon-coated sensor surfaces and, moreover, ex-situ measurements with static contact angle measurements, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM) for smooth Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) substrates, for contact times between the enzyme formulation and the carbon material surface ranging from 20 s to 24 h. QCM-D studies reveals the formation of rigid layer of biomaterial, a few nanometers thin, which shows a strongly improved wettability of the substrate surface upon contact angle measurements. Following spectroscopic characterization, these layers are composed of mixtures of laccase and maltodextrin. The formation of these adsorbates is attributed to attractive interactions between laccase, the maltodextrin-based lyophilization agent and the hydrophobic carbon surfaces; a short-term contact between the aqueous laccase mixture suspension and HOPG surfaces is shown to merely result in de-wetting patterns influencing the results of contact angle measurements.

From a mathematical perspective, they are char-acterized by the difficulties of variational inequalities for both the plastic behavior as well as the contact problem. Computationally, they also often lead to very large problems. In this paper, we present and evaluate a set of methods that allows us to efficiently solve such problems. In particular, we use adaptive finite element meshes with linear and quadratic elements, a Newton linearization of the plasticity, active set methods for the contact problem, and multigrid-preconditioned linear solvers. Through a sequence of numerical experiments, we show the performance of these methods. This includes highly accurate solutions of a benchmark problem and scaling our methods to 1, 024 cores and more than a billion unknowns. Key words.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to acquaint the technologically {{oriented}} public with the causes and laws governing the occurence and development of defects which appear {{in the form of}} crumbled spots on the running surface of railway wheels. These defects most likely occur {{as a result of the}} existence of initiators in the upper layer of the running surface. The propagation of these defects in the form of oblique cracks in influence especially by the general force effects in the wheel-rail contact area. The slids accompanying this action may be the cause of local martensitic structures (hard spots). Initiators of this type along the circumference of wheel running surface have been metalographically proven. Based upon a numeric calculation, we can presume a strong impact of shear forces in the contact area. As a result of the process of rolling, these forces change the plus-minus sign along contact and cause the asymetric character of radial load related to the contact normal. This proves the incorectness of the idea of so called single zone slid range.

40|$|International audienceMetamorphic soles {{correspond}} to m to 500 m thick highly strained metamorphic rock units found beneath myloniticbanded peridotites {{at the base}} of large-scale ophiolites, as exemplified in Oman. Metamorphic soles aremainly composed of metabasalts deriving from the downgoing oceanic lithosphere and metamorphosed up togranulite-facies conditions by heat transfer from the mantle wedge. Pressure–temperature peak conditions areusually estimated at 1. 00. 2 GPa and 800100 ºC. The absence of HP–LT metamorphism overprint implies thatmetamorphic soles have been formed and exhumed during subduction infancy. In this view, metamorphic soleswere strongly deformed during their accretion to the mantle wedge (corresponding, now, {{to the base of the}} ophiolite). Therefore, metamorphic soles and banded peridotites are direct witnesses of the dynamics of early subductionzones, in terms of thermal structure, fluid migration and rheology evolution across the nascent slab interface. Based on fieldwork and EBSD analyses, we present a detailed (micro–) structural study performed on samplescoming from the Sumeini window, the better-preserved cross-section of the metamorphic sole of Oman. Largedifferences are found in the deformation (CPO, grain size, aspect ratio) of clinopyroxene, amphibole and plagioclase,related to mineralogical changes linked with the distance to the peridotite <b>contact</b> (e. g., <b>hardening</b> due to theappearance of garnet and clinopyroxene). To model the incipient slab interface in laboratory, we carried out 5 hydrostatic annealing and simple-shear experimentson Griggs solid-medium apparatus. Deformation experiments were conducted at axial strain rates of 10 - 6 s- 1. Fine-grained amphibolite was synthetized by adding 1 wt. % water to a (Mid-Ocean Ridge) basalt powder asa proxy for the metamorphic sole (amphibole + plagioclase + clinopyroxene garnet assemblage). To synthetizegarnet, 2 experiments were carried out in hydrostatic conditions and with deformation at 800 C with confiningpressure of 2 GPa. Another simple-shear experiment has been carried out at 800 C and 1 GPa with fined-grainednatural garnet. With the aim of mimicking the early slab interface (between the metamorphic sole and bandedperidotites {{at the base of}} the ophiolite), 2 simple-shear deformation experiments with 2 layers have been carriedout at 800 C and confining pressure of 1 GPa. The bottom layer was made of hydrated basalt powder and the toplayer was made of olivine.
