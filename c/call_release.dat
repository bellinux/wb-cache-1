40|$|The {{recent decades}} have {{witnessed}} enormous development in communication world; especially in internet technology that has {{played an important}} role in moving forward the human communications, with such development user demands better communication services such as video conferencing. Video conferencing becomes more popular nowadays since it can break the constraints on the communication ways of people who are probably exist in diverse geographical locations in real time. SIP is preferred to be used as signaling protocol for video conferencing, but still using SIP for video conferencing is affected by the delay which reduces the satisfaction of user as it decreases the QoS. This thesis work is aimed to study the performance of SIP signaling for video conferencing, and also describing the causes of the delay in SIP session establishment and termination. The literature review and the two simulations have been carried out in this thesis to examine the effect of specific parameters on the session setup delay. The first study is carried out by using ns- 2 to simulate different transport protocols and study their effect on session setup delay. The second study is carried out by using SIPp to achieve two objects. The first object is to study the relationship between number of simultaneous calls on both the session setup delay and <b>call</b> <b>release</b> delay, while the second object is to verify the result of changing transport modes of transport protocol for both session setup delay and <b>call</b> <b>release</b> delay. The results obtained from first simulation showed that utilizing UDP as transport protocol will return less session setup delay than TCP and SCTP. The first objective of the second simulation results clarify the relationship between number of simultaneous calls on both the session setup delay and <b>call</b> <b>release</b> delay which was directly proportional; on the other hand the second object showed that by using UDP in mono socket mode has less session setup delay and <b>call</b> <b>release</b> delay.

40|$|Performance {{testing is}} a key element of {{industrial}} software development. While basic performance testing concepts are well understood, it is less clear how to manage performance tests in practice. I. e., we have encountered the following two problems. (1) While testing textbooks prescribe writing tests against performance goals, we find that it is impractical to gather from business analysts performance goals that are detailed enough for finding subtle performance bugs. (2) Once performance tests are conducted, we were asked questions such as the following, which we found hard to answer. How can you be confident that the executed tests assess the performance of the software truthfully? To enable practitioners to address these problems, this paper introduces two additional performance testing process components, which we <b>call</b> <b>release</b> certification and test data correlation. Our key idea to address problem (1) is to run two different versions of the same subject application side-by-side in the same test environment. This allows us to use the performance profile of the previous version as the detailed performance specification of the version under test. Our key idea to address the questions of (2) is to correlate the performance measurements of the test and production environments. We also report on our experience of applying this implementation on several releases of a commercial airline sales application...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Several {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} for synthesizing communication protocol specifications starting from given service specifications. Due to the inherently sequential nature of a finite state machine (FSM), some FSM-based protocol synthesis methods assume that primitives in the service specifications cannot be executed simultaneously. However, other synthesis methods were introduced to handle controlled primitive concurrency by imposing restrictions on the applicable FSM topologies. This paper proposes two alternative FSM-based protocol synthesis methods that eliminate the restrictions on concurrency imposed by earlier methods. The first method applies a sequential-based synthesis method to derive a sequential protocol specification (P-SPEC) from a service specification (S-SPEC) and then applies several state-expansion rules to re-model the resulting P-SPEC to consider the concurrency behavior specified in the S-SPEC. The second method re-models a concurrent S-SPEC into a sequential-like one by expanding its states and applies a sequential-based synthesis method to derive the concurrent P-SPEC. Thus, the paper’s main contribution is proposing synthesis methods that allow the protocol designers to model their service specifications with concurrency behaviors, using FSM-based models, and to derive, automatically, the corresponding protocol specifications for the concurrently executable protocol entities. The derived protocol specifications are guaranteed {{to be free of}} design errors; therefore, they do not require any further verification. The complexity of the two methods is discussed and their syntactic and semantic correctness are proven. As an example application, the synthesis method is used to derive the protocol specification of the H. 323 <b>call</b> <b>release</b> standard used in Internet calls...|$|E
