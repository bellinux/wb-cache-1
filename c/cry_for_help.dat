5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|Ten years later, J. D. Redding and {{his teenage}} {{daughter}} Tory rent the O'Grady farmhouse for the summer. Contract workers Nathan Murphy, his 12-year-old brother Alex, and their dimwitted friend Ozzie Jones help re-paint the farmhouse. While {{looking around the}} basement, Ozzie hears the leprechaun's <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> and mistakes him for a little child. He brushes the old four-leaf clover off the crate, freeing the leprechaun. After failing to convince the others that he met a leprechaun, Ozzie spots a rainbow and chases it, believing he will find a pot of gold at the end. Alex accompanies him for fear Ozzie might hurt himself. A bag of one hundred gold pieces magically appears before Ozzie. After Ozzie tests the gold and accidentally swallows a piece, they stash it in an old well and plot to keep it for themselves, hoping to fix Ozzie's brain.|$|E

25|$|In late 2005, the {{drinking}} water crisis of the Kashechewan First Nation received national media attention when E. coli was discovered in their water supply system, following two years of living under a boil-water advisory. The drinking water was supplied by a new treatment plant built in March 1998. The cause of the tainted water was a plugged chlorine injector that was not discovered by local operators, who were not qualified to be running the treatment plant. When officials arrived and fixed the problem, chlorine levels were around 1.7mg/l, which was blamed for skin disorders such as impetigo and scabies. An investigation led by Health Canada revealed that the skin disorders were likely due to living in squalor. The evacuation of Kashechewan was largely viewed by Canadians as a <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> for other underlying social and economic issues which Aboriginal people in Canada face.|$|E

25|$|Algoma Steel {{went through}} years of ups and downs, marked {{by a lack of}} strong leadership, and in 1935 the company was again forced into receivership, and with it went the city: a plaintive <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> from the mayor to Dunn details the ordeal. This time, at the age of 61, Dunn {{engineered}} a takeover so that he became the sole controlling shareholder thereby allowing him to take the tough but necessary reorganization measures to restore profitability to the steel maker. To accomplish this, he raised capital by negotiating bank loans, selling his beloved art collection and taking stock instead of income. As Algoma Steel's president and Chairman of its board of directors, he successfully turned it into one of the largest steel mills of the day and {{for more than twenty years}} guided the fortunes of the company he would eventually make into one of the most profitable producers in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in July 1974, Kallinger and his 15-year-old son Michael {{went on a}} crime spree {{spanning}} Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New Jersey. Over {{the next}} six weeks, they robbed, assaulted, and sexually abused four families and murdered three people, gaining entrance to each house by pretending to be salesmen. On January 8, 1975, they continued their spree in Leonia, New Jersey. Using a pistol and a knife, they overpowered and tied up the three residents. Then, when others entered the home, {{they were forced to}} strip and bound with cords from lamps and other appliances. This culminated in the killing of 21-year-old nurse Maria Fasching, the eighth person to arrive, when she reprimanded Kallinger and he responded by slitting her throat. Finally, another of the residents, still bound, managed to get outside and <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> Neighbors saw her and called the police, but by the time they arrived the Kallingers had fled, using the city bus as their getaway vehicle and dumping their weapons and a bloody shirt along the way.|$|E
25|$|Describing the {{original}} Palestinian Kairos document as “a heartfelt, sober, prayerful, urgent <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> {{to end the}} U.S.-backed Israeli occupation,” the Kairos USA “response” began “with a confession of sin to Palestinians in the State of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, the diaspora and in refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.” The authors of the “response” said that “As U.S. Christians we bear responsibility for failing to say 'Enough!' when our nation's ally, the State of Israel, violates international law.” Saying that “the 'peace process' has continued {{to be no more}} than a means for the ongoing colonization of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the imprisonment of Gaza and the continuation of the structures of oppression,” the authors expressed remorse for the history of Christian anti-Semitism and pledged to “work and even suffer for peace, filled with a heart of love for both Israelis and Palestinians.” They then proceeded to describe Israel as “pursuing a course that is fruitless and corrupting, both morally and politically.” Citing the gospels of Matthew and Luke, the authors call for BDS and nonviolent direct action against Israel.|$|E

500|$|Alongside the single-player mode is {{an online}} {{multiplayer}} mode, which allows players {{to compete in}} several maps. In each multiplayer match, there are two enemy teams: four survivors and four scavengers, and there are three types of games for multiplayer to compete in, played in five different maps: the modes are Team Deathmatch, Private Rescue and <b>Cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>Help.</b> The first mode is a simple PvP combat scenario, with teams pitted against each other, and the winning team being {{the one to kill}} the opposing team in three separate matches. In the second mode, the [...] "survivors" [...] team must take medical supplies to a specific point on the map, while the [...] "scavengers" [...] must reach a certain number of kills, both within a ten-minute time limit. The third mode, <b>Cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>Help,</b> involves the [...] "survivors" [...] exploring the maps and retrieving batteries for defended radio beacons while being hunted by the [...] "scavengers". Across all three modes, weapons and destroyable environments from the single-player campaign are carried over.|$|E
500|$|... 'Fly Like A Bird', is a kitchen-sink, hyper-produced gospel number, but {{is really}} quite moving.

But there’s {{a lot of hope}} and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, a firm grip on the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E
500|$|McMillen's {{childhood}} {{experiences and}} fears {{were used for}} the game's themes of loneliness, nervousness, and fear of abandonment or rejection. The boy's journeys through space represent inward-thinking and imagination, planets represent fears and the inhabitants personify McMillen's childhood [...] "inner demons". He was initially unsure {{as to whether or not}} he wished to release Aether, since it was based on personal experiences and made him feel vulnerable. Glaiel created the game's planets and gameplay, designing the layout of the planets to convey the emotions involved in the game, but he did not know which planets would ultimately be used to relate to each emotion. He felt that the game's sense of emotion and mood was improved because development was not thoroughly planned from the outset. Both developers expressed a wish to port the game to the WiiWare service on the Wii video game console. Aether was released as part of McMillen's game and comic compilation CD This is a <b>Cry</b> <b>For</b> <b>Help</b> in early November 2008.|$|E

500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Plath had not intended to kill herself. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.Thomas, what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading [...] "Call Dr.Horder," [...] including the doctor's phone number. Therefore, it is argued Plath turned on the gas {{at a time when}} Mr.Thomas {{would have been able to}} see the note. However, in her biography Giving Up: The Last Days of SylviaPlath, Plath's best friend, Jillian Becker wrote, [...] "According to Mr.Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner's office... had thrust her head far into the gas oven... had really meant to die." [...] Dr.Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that [...] "No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion." [...] Plath had described the quality of her despair as [...] "owl's talons clenching my heart." [...] In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic Al Alvarez claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> and spoke, in a BBC interview in March2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: [...] "I failed her on that level. I was thirtyyears old and stupid. What did I know about chronic clinical depression? [...] She kind of needed someone to take care of her. And that was not something I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{background}} vocals in {{the song}} were compressed using a compressor program called Waves Renaissance Compressor, which was used {{in order to create}} an enhanced polished effect. In an interview with Sound on Sound, mixing engineer Phil Tan, who carried out the audio mixing on [...] "SOS", explained that he compressed the background vocals because [...] "SOS" [...] is a [...] "high energy track", and he wanted the vocals to complement it. Tan also noted that the background vocals were pitch shifted to increase tonal quality and create an enhanced effect during the chorus. The pitch shifting consisted of making the left vocals flat and the right vocals sharp, with varying degrees of delay, and later mixing them together. When asked about the production of the lead vocals, Tan described the song as [...] "a pounding type of song, and the lyrics are a <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> so the vocals need to be 'in your face', almost aggressive," [...] and said that he wanted the vocals to remain constant. As with the background vocals, the lead vocals were compressed using the Waves Renaissance Compressor. Tan continued to note that the lack of reverb included on [...] "SOS" [...] was largely {{due to the fact that}} being an uptempo song, there was not a lot of room left to add anything else. Tan explained the production process of sampling [...] "Tainted Love", as well as the changes which were made: ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 6, 1910. It states: [...] "Mr. Jenks {{and his family are}} spending the summer in a fashionable summer hotel, and Mr. Jenks is kept bored and busy performing the many services demanded by his wife. He hits upon the bright idea of sending himself a business telegram which would necessitate his immediate presence in the city, then starts out on a little vacation on his own account. Walking on the beach he discovers a secluded spot, and leaving his clothes on the beach he takes a swim. In the meantime, a convict, who has escaped from a nearby penitentiary, has entered a house nearby in search of a change of clothes, his stripes being too conspicuous. The convict locks a woman of the house up and ransacks the house, but the only garments he can find are women's clothes, and, deciding that they are better than stripes, he dons them. As the convict in his new disguise is walking along the beach he sees Jenks' clothes lying there and promptly makes another change. There is nothing for Jenks to do when he comes out except to array himself as a woman. On {{his way back to the}} hotel he passes the house that has been robbed and is unlucky enough to hear the woman's <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> When she gets out of the closet, through his aid, she naturally believes that he is the convict, and screams for help. Jenks, frightened, runs away, but is captured after a chase in which the entire village takes part. His wife and daughter witness humiliation, and it's almost impossible for them to 'square things.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Connected to {{the concept}} of holding is what Winnicott called the anti-social tendency, {{something}} which he argued [...] "may be found in a normal individual, or in one that is neurotic or psychotic". The delinquent child (Winnicott thought) was looking for a sense of secure holding lacking in their family of origins from society at large. He considered antisocial behaviour as a <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> fuelled by a sense of loss of integrity, when the familial holding environment was inadequate or ruptured.|$|E
