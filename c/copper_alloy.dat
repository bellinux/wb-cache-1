5|$|One of the barrows (south {{of where}} the {{thatched}} barn now stands) contained a high status cremation of a woman of about twenty years in age, accompanied by an incense cup, a halberd-style pendant made from amber and <b>copper</b> <b>alloy,</b> and two gold cones that would have covered buttons of an organic material. The burial-goods recovered {{are similar to those}} of the Wessex culture, the Wilsford and Dorset Ridgeway series in particular. An urn from one of the barrows likely to have been made between 1700 and 1500 B.C., has been identified as Trevisker ware, a type widely found throughout Devon and Cornwall which was transported east in lesser amounts, this find being one of the easternmost discovered.|$|E
5|$|Other organic {{materials}} such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface. Alloys of lead and pewter are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|E
5|$|Pendants in a {{distinctive}} shape representing the hammer of Thor (known in Norse sources as Mjöllnir) have frequently been unearthed in Viking Age Scandinavian burials. The hammers {{may have been}} worn {{as a symbol of}} Norse pagan faith and of opposition to Christianization, a response to crosses worn by Christians. Casting moulds have been found for the production of both Thor's hammers and Christian crucifixes, and at least one example of a combined crucifix and hammer has been discovered. The Eyrarland Statue, a <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> figure found near Akureyri, Iceland dating from around the 11th century, may depict Thor seated and gripping his hammer.|$|E

5|$|The Crosby Garrett Helmet is a <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> Roman cavalry helmet {{dating from}} the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. It was found by an unnamed metal detectorist near Crosby Garrett in Cumbria, England, in May 2010.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Iron Age, {{there is}} much {{evidence}} for the use of horses in transport and battle, and for extensive trade between the inhabitants of Britain and other cultures. A collection of Iron Age artefacts from Polden Hill in Somerset includes a very large hoard of horse gear, and a rare, cast <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> cheekpiece dating from the late, pre-Roman Iron Age was found in St Ewe, Cornwall. The horse was an important figure in Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic religion and myth, and is symbolised in the hill figure of the Uffington White Horse, near the Iron Age hill fort of Uffington Castle in Oxfordshire.|$|E
5|$|Six medieval coins were recovered, the {{earliest}} {{of which was}} a silver penny of John from the early 13thcentury. Coins from later periods were a silver threepence from the reign of Elizabeth I and a silver penny from Charles I. Only low-denomination coins were found from the 18thcentury and later, including a 10-pfennig piece from Germany dated 1901. Two silver spoons were recovered, one of which was dated 1846 from the hallmark. Objects made from <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> were found, many of which were associated with personal adornment and dress including brooches, buckles, and buttons. Also found from this period was a small simple chape (scabbard tip), and part of a skimmer that had been used in the kitchen. Artefacts made from iron, other than nails, were again mainly items of personal adornment and dress. Other identifiable iron items from this period included keys, two possible rowel spurs (spurs with revolving pointed wheels), and about 12horseshoes.|$|E

25|$|For certain applications, <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> {{conductors}} are preferred {{instead of}} pure copper, especially when higher strengths or improved abrasion and corrosion resistance properties are required. However, relative to pure copper, the higher strength and corrosion resistance benefits that are offered by copper alloys are offset by their lower electrical conductivities. Design engineers weigh {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of the various types of copper and <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> conductors when determining which type to specify for a specific electrical application. An example of a <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> conductor is cadmium copper wire, which is used for railroad electrification in North America. In Britain the BPO (later Post Office Telecommunications) used cadmium copper aerial lines with 1% cadmium for extra strength; for local lines 40lb/mile (1.3mm dia) and for toll lines 70lb/mile (1.7mm dia).|$|E

40|$|Clostridium difficile {{is rapidly}} {{becoming}} {{a major cause}} of hospital-acquired infections worldwide, due in part to transmission of the faecal pathogen between contaminated hands and contact surfaces. Accordingly, this study evaluated survival of C. difficile vegetative cells and spores on the contact surface commonly found in healthcare settings, stainless steel, compared to five <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> (65 – 100 % copper content). C. difficile requires prolonged incubation to grow and therefore the total number and number of viable cells was estimated using a fluorescence dual-staining technique. For viability assessment the redox dye 5 -cyano- 2, 3 -ditolyl tetrazolium (CTC) was used to measure metabolic activity. Results demonstrated that <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> with a <b>copper</b> content > 70 % provide a significant reduction in survival of C. difficile vegetative cells and spores on <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> compared with stainless steel. Complete death of spores was observed after 24 – 48 h on <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> whereas no significant death rate was observed on stainless steel even after 168 h. The use of CTC gave comparable results to culture and offers a more rapid viability analysis (8 h) than culture. The results suggest that using <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> in hospitals and other healthcare facilities could offer the potential to reduce spread of C. difficile from contaminated surfaces. <br/...|$|R
40|$|<b>Copper</b> cast <b>alloys</b> de-activate antibiotic-resistant {{bacteria}} on {{contact and}} could be very effective in decreasing potentially harmful microorganisms in the environment. In this study <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> with varying <b>copper</b> contents were utilized to evaluate their antimicrobial effects on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium in changing environmental conditions. The survival rates of P. aeruginosa wild type and its derivative transposon mutants of the cin operon on <b>copper</b> cast <b>alloys</b> were investigated in order to demonstrate the influence of genes involved in copper resistance. The gene disruption of the response regulator of the cin operon resulted in shorter survival rates on <b>copper</b> <b>alloys,</b> which was also influenced by temperature and method of exposure. Bacteria often have acquired copper resistance mechanisms in order to withstand higher copper concentrations in their surroundings, which may {{be a factor in}} their survival rates on copper surfaces. Copper- and antibiotic-resistant E. coli and E. faecium strains were obtained from pigs raised on feeds containing copper sulfate and antibiotics. Survival rates of these bacteria were influenced by the percentage of <b>copper</b> in the <b>alloys,</b> varying moisture conditions on copper surfaces, suspension media used, and differences between strains. Survival was also dependent on copper corrosion rates since corrosion inhibition with benzotriazole or a thick surface layer of thermal oxide resulted in prolonged survival on copper surfaces. Corrosion of copper surfaces releases copper ions which directly affect bacterial survival on <b>copper</b> <b>alloys.</b> The results obtained in this study emphasize that <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> are effective as antimicrobial materials but changing environmental conditions can significantly influence bacterial survival on copper surfaces. These findings can be applied to a better utilization of <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> in water, food, and healthcare environments. Antibiotic- and copper ion-resistant bacteria can be killed on contact with <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> which makes the proliferation of these microorganisms less likely and reduces the risk to human health. However, in a very different environment copper ion-resistant microbes can be useful for plant-microbe associations in bioremediation of copper mining wastelands...|$|R
