5|$|Roman Britain {{had become}} fully Christianized, but the Anglo-Saxons {{retained}} their native faith. In 597 Augustine {{was sent by}} Pope Gregory I to England to <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Christianity. Augustine landed in eastern Kent, and soon managed to convert Æthelberht, who gave Augustine land in Canterbury. Two other rulers, Sæberht, king of Essex, and Rædwald, king of East Anglia, were converted through Æthelberht's influence.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{dealt with}} several {{conflicts}} with Indian tribes. The Nez Perce, led by Chief Joseph, began an uprising in June 1877 when Major General Oliver O. Howard {{ordered them to}} move on to a reservation. Howard's men defeated the Nez Perce in battle, and the tribe began a 1,700-mile retreat into Canada. In October, after a decisive battle at Bear Paw, Montana, Chief Joseph surrendered and General William T. Sherman ordered the tribe transported to Kansas, where they were forced to remain until 1885. The Nez Perce war was not the last conflict in the West, as the Bannock rose up in Spring 1878 and raided nearby settlements before being defeated by Howard's army in July of that year. War with the Ute tribe broke out in 1879 when the Utes killed Indian agent Nathan Meeker, who had been attempting to <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Christianity. The subsequent White River War ended when Schurz negotiated peace with the Ute and prevented the white Coloradans from taking revenge for Meeker's death.|$|E
5|$|Though {{attending}} Christian Sunday services, Mandela studied Islam. He {{also studied}} Afrikaans, hoping {{to build a}} mutual respect with the warders and <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> his cause. Various official visitors met with Mandela, most significantly the liberal parliamentary representative Helen Suzman of the Progressive Party, who championed Mandela's cause outside of prison. In September 1970, he met British Labour Party politician Dennis Healey. South African Minister of Justice Jimmy Kruger visited in December 1974, but he and Mandela did not get along with each other. His mother visited in 1968, dying shortly after, and his firstborn son Thembi {{died in a car}} accident the following year; Mandela was forbidden from attending either funeral. His wife was rarely able to see him, being regularly imprisoned for political activity, and his daughters first visited in December 1975. Winnie was released from prison in 1977 but was forcibly settled in Brandfort and remained unable to see him.|$|E

25|$|Evans and Cheevers were {{released}} in 1662. Their release came only after repeated attempts to <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Catholicism failed. Both the priests responsible {{for them and}} the new consul grew weary with their behavior while imprisoned, coincident with continued petitions from George Fox and Gilbert Lately. On their journey home, Evans and Cheevers continued proselytizing and advertising their faith. Though they were not met with open hostility, their journey back to England was hastened by English authorities.|$|E
25|$|The company {{grew out}} of the {{amalgamation}} of the Chester Canal with its branch to Middlewich and the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, which ran from Nantwich to Autherley. They took over the Eastern and Western branches of the Montgomery Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and leased the Shropshire Canal. Although plans to <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> railways had been dropped by 1849, the LNWR bought the Shropshire Canal outright in 1857, following severe subsidence, and used it as the route for a railway to Coalport, opened in 1861.|$|E

25|$|The game, {{played over}} two halves, each of 50 minutes, was won by Scotland, who scored a goal with a {{successful}} conversion kick after grounding {{the ball over}} the goal line (permitting them to 'try' to kick a goal). Both sides achieved a further 'try' each, but failed to <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> goals as the kicks were missed (see also 'Method of Scoring and Points' below). Angus Buchanan of Royal High School FP and Edinburgh University RFC was {{the first man to}} score a try in international rugby.|$|E
25|$|When East Asian {{names are}} transliterated into the Latin alphabet, some people prefer to <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the Western order, while others {{leave them in}} the Eastern order but write the family name in capital letters. To avoid confusion, some always write a family name in capital letters, {{especially}} when writing for an international audience. This habit is commonly used in the international language Esperanto. In Hungarian, the Eastern order of Japanese names is officially kept and Hungarian transliteration is used (e.g. Mijazaki Hajao), but Western name order is also sometimes used with English transliteration (e.g. Hayao Miyazaki).|$|E
25|$|The units {{continued}} to be used exceptionally in special and charter trains. Proposals were made to reuse them as carriages, but this would require costly rebuilding. Other proposals were to <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fast reaction trains to respond to derailments and accidents, use them as charter trains or selling them abroad. The cost of rebuilding was prohibitive {{to any of these}} plans being carried out. Although there was a certain desire to preserve a unit, the Norwegian Railway Museum lacked space and the Norwegian Railway Club lacked capacity to maintain a copy. All the trains were therefore scrapped in 1973.|$|E

25|$|Luther wrote {{negatively}} {{about the}} Jews throughout his career. Though Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people {{guilty of the}} murder of Christ, and he lived in a locality which had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier. He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus. In 1523, Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Christianity. When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them.|$|E
25|$|Another {{group of}} Indians {{to arrive in}} Israel belong to the Bnei Menashe ("Children of Menasseh", Hebrew בני מנשה) a group of more than 9,000 people from India's North-Eastern border states of Manipur and Mizoram, who claim descent {{from one of the}} Lost Tribes of Israel, and of whom about 1,700 now live in Israel (some of them in Israeli {{settlements}} on the West Bank). Linguistically, Bnei Menashe are Tibeto-Burmans and belong to the Mizo, Kuki and Chin peoples (the terms are virtually interchangeable). The move to <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Judaism and bring them to Israel is politically controversial in both India and Israel.|$|E
25|$|Anselm {{chose to}} depart in October 1097. Although Anselm {{retained}} his nominal title, William immediately seized the revenues of his bishopric and retained them til death. From Lyons, Anselm wrote to Urban, requesting {{that he be}} permitted to resign his office. Urban refused but commissioned him to prepare a defence of the Western doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit against representatives from the Greek Church. Anselm arrived in Rome by April and, according to his biographer Eadmer, lived beside the pope during the Siege of Capua in May. Count Roger's Saracen troops supposedly offered him food and other gifts but the count actively resisted the clerics' attempts to <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Catholicism.|$|E

25|$|In 1845, the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company {{took over}} the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, and {{appointed}} a committee to consider how best to <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> railways, and what extensions might be necessary to provide a comprehensive transport network. The following year, the company became the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company, by an Act of Parliament which authorised the new company {{to take over the}} Shrewsbury Canal and to buy the Montgomery Canal and the Shropshire Canal. In 1847, the Shropshire Union Company agreed to the terms of a lease from the London and North Western Railway Company (LNWR), and so lost its independence after little more than a year, but continued to manage the canals under its control.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Metropolitan Mar Jacob in 1552, the Portuguese became more {{aggressive}} {{in their efforts to}} subjugate the Saint Thomas Christians. Protests {{on the part of the}} natives were frustrated by events back in the Church of the East's Mesopotamian heartland, which left them devoid of consistent leadership. In 1552, the year of Jacob's death, a schism in the Church of the East resulted in there being two rival patriarchates, one of which entered into communion with the Catholic Church, and the other of which remained independent. At different times both patriarchs sent bishops to India, but the Portuguese were consistently able to outmaneuver the newcomers or else <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Latin Rite Catholicism outright. In 1575 the Padroado declared that neither patriarch could appoint prelates to the community without Portuguese consent, thereby cutting the Thomas Christians off from their hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft Word {{supports}} bullet {{lists and}} numbered lists. It {{also features a}} numbering system that helps add correct numbers to pages, chapters, headers, footnotes, and entries of tables of content; these numbers automatically change to correct ones as new items are added or existing items are deleted. Bullets and numbering can be applied directly to paragraphs and <b>convert</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> lists. Word 97 through 2003, however, had problems adding correct numbers to numbered lists. In particular, a second irrelevant numbered list might have not started with number one, but instead resumed numbering after the last numbered list. Although Word 97 supported a hidden marker that said the list numbering must restart afterwards, the command to insert this marker (Restart Numbering command) was only added in Word 2003. However, if one cut the first item of the listed and pasted it as another item, e.g. fifth, the restart marker would have moved with it and the list would have restarted in the middle instead of at the top.|$|E
