It was researched and indexed by one of Keynes's favourite students, later the economist David Bensusan-Butt. The work served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. The General Theory challenged the earlier neoclassical economic paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish full employment equilibrium. In doing so Keynes was partly setting himself against his former teachers Marshall and Pigou. Keynes believed the classical theory was a [...] "special case" [...] that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century, his own theory being the general one. Classical economists had believed in Say's law, which, simply put, states that [...] "supply creates its own demand", and that in a free market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> stickiness – the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is rational {{for them to do}} so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of [...] "aggregate demand" [...] and [...] "aggregate supply" [...] may lead to stable unemployment equilibria – and in those cases, it is the state, not the market, that economies must depend on for their salvation.|$|E

2500|$|During the Great Depression, the {{definitive}} liberal {{response to it}} was given by the English economist John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946). Keynes had been [...] "brought up" [...] as a classical liberal, but especially after World War I became increasingly a welfare or social liberal. A prolific writer, among many other works, he had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s. [...] Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the Great Depression. He believed that budget deficits were a good thing, a product of recessions. He wrote, [...] "For Government borrowing {{of one kind or}} another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as to present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill". At the height of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes published The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter cyclical public spending. The Means to Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect.

50|$|A {{feed-in tariff}} can {{differentiate}} {{on the basis}} of marginal cost. This is a theoretical alternative which is based on the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> differentiation (Finon). Under such a policy the tariff price ranges from some level slightly above the spot rate to the price required to obtain the optimal level of production determined by the government. Firms with lower marginal costs receive prices on {{the lower end of the}} spectrum that increase their revenue but not by as much as under the uniform feed-in tariff. The more marginal producers face the higher tariff price. This version of the policy has two objectives. The first is to reduce the profitability of certain production cites.|$|E

What differentiates it from most forms of technical analysis is that its main focus is the relation of a security's current price to its past prices as opposed to values derived from that price history. This past history includes swing highs and swing lows, trend lines, and support and resistance levels.|$|E

5000|$|In his {{critique}} of political economy, Marx denied {{that any of these}} assumptions were scientifically true (see further real prices and ideal prices). He distinguished carefully between the values, exchange values, market values, market prices and prices of production of commodities. However he did not analyze all the different forms that prices can take (for example, market-driven prices, administered prices, accounting prices, negotiated and fixed prices, estimated prices, nominal prices, or inflation-adjusted prices) focusing mainly on the value proportions he thought to be central to the functioning of the capitalist mode of production as a social system. The effect of this omission was that debates about the relevance of Marx's value theory became confused, and that Marxists repeated the same ideas Marx himself had rejected as [...] "vulgar economics". In other words, they accepted a vulgar <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E

40|$|Speaking on an {{ambivalent}} {{character of}} labor and consequently on the whole economic process, K. Marx emphasises that it is both the process of increasing values and generating utility value. He does not also treat a relation of theory of value to a price making process directly and onesidedly. Prices have to reflect verified effects of social labor expenditures and not only an ordinary acceptance of it under conditions of material-utility criteria of managing economy and in the competitive buyer-consummer market. A rational true price has to reflect real economic proportions resulting from a long term and perspective plan as well as currently formed economic conditions effected by the given productive machinery and market situation. The law of value cannot act as a law <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> in its classic formulation, under these conditions even in the increasing role of commodity- -monetary categories. Yet it {{can act as a}} law of labor expenditures determining possibilities of fulfilling needs of production and consumption within the framework of basic productive and exchange proportions included in a long term plan and in autonomous decisions of enterprises. Consequently, adopting a cost <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> in economic literature is not satisfactory {{from the point of view}} of realizing a natural target of production and socio-economic rationality. It seems that the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> market equilibrium is rather closer to rational principles <b>of</b> <b>price</b> making, handling price as an objective category reflecting real proportions and conditions of economy, under one condition though: it can not be treated as a result of unrestrained formation of economic processes.
