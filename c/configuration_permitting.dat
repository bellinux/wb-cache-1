40|$|The {{concept of}} dissociation-time {{entanglement}} {{provides a means}} of manifesting non-classical correlations in the motional state of two counter-propagating atoms. In this article, we discuss in detail the requirements for a specific experimental implementation, {{which is based on}} the Feshbach dissociation of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate of fermionic lithium. A sequence of two magnetic field pulses serves to delocalize both of the dissociation products into a superposition of consecutive wave packets, which are separated by a macroscopic distance.
