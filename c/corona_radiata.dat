50|$|In neuroanatomy, the <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> is a {{white matter}} sheet that {{continues}} ventrally as the internal capsule and dorsally as the centrum semiovale. This sheet of both ascending and descending axons carries most of the neural traffic from and to the cerebral cortex.

Data suggests that the <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> and superior capsular lesions may correlate with more favorable levels of functional recovery. Lesions seated inferiorly are likely to correlate with poorer levels of recovery regarding upper limb movement. Findings also suggest that motor deficit severity {{is likely to increase}} as a lesion occupies progressively more posterior regions of the internal capsule.|$|E
50|$|By {{command of}} an oocyte-secreted morphogenic gradient, the antral follicle's granulosa cells begin to {{differentiate}} themselves into four distinct subtypes: <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> {{that surrounds the}} zona pellucida, membrana that's interior to the basal lamina, periantral that's adjacent to the antrum, and cumulus oophorus that connects the membrana and <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> granulosa cells together.

5000|$|Projection fibers are afferents {{carrying}} {{information to}} the cerebral cortex, and efferents carrying information away from it. The most prominent projection fibers are the <b>corona</b> <b>radiata,</b> which radiate out from the cortex and then come together in the brain stem. The projection fibers {{that make up the}} <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> also radiate out of the brain stem via the internal capsule. Cerebral white matter is commonly regarded today as an intricately organized system of fasciculi that facilitate the highest expression of cerebral activity.|$|E
50|$|In normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus, {{expansion of}} the lateral ventricles causes distortion of the fibers of the <b>corona</b> <b>radiata.</b> This contributes to the urinary incontinence seen with NPH.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> may be {{affected}} by diseases affecting the cerebral white matter, including ischemic leukoencephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and progressive leukoencephalopathy. These may have major effects on intellectual, social, and emotional functioning.|$|E
50|$|The <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> is the {{innermost}} {{layer of the}} cells of the cumulus oophorus and is directly adjacent to the zona pellucida, the outer protective glycoprotein layer of the ovum. Its main purpose in many animals is to supply vital proteins to the cell. It is formed by follicle cells adhering to the oocyte before it leaves the ovarian follicle, and originates from the squamous granulosa cells present at the primordial stage of follicular development. The <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> is formed when the granulosa cells enlarge and become cuboidal, which occurs during the transition from the primordial to primary stage. These cuboidal granulosa cells, also known as the granulosa radiata, form more layers throughout the maturation process, and remain attached to the zona pellucida after the ovulation of the Graafian follicle. For fertilization to occur, sperm cells rely on hyaluronidase (an enzyme found in the acrosome of spermatozoa) to disperse the <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> from the zona pellucida of the secondary (ovulated) oocyte, thus permitting entry into the perivitelline space and allowing contact between the sperm cell and the nucleus of the oocyte.|$|E
50|$|The sperm binds {{through the}} <b>corona</b> <b>radiata,</b> {{a layer of}} {{follicle}} cells {{on the outside of}} the secondary oocyte. Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell, known as zygote. The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism.|$|E
50|$|In most {{mammalian}} fertilization, hyaluronidase {{is released}} by the acrosome of the sperm cell after it has reached the oocyte, by digesting hyaluronan in the <b>corona</b> <b>radiata,</b> thus enabling conception. Gene-targeting studies show that hyaluronidases such as PH20 are not essential for fertilization, although exogenous hyaluronidases can disrupt the cumulus matrix.|$|E
50|$|Normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus (NPH), also termed Hakim's {{syndrome and}} symptomatic hydrocephalus, {{is a type}} of brain malfunction caused by expansion of the lateral cerebral ventricles and distortion of the fibers in the <b>corona</b> <b>radiata.</b> Its typical symptoms are urinary incontinence, dementia, and gait disturbance. CSF pressure is usually normal. Ventricles are chronically dilated.|$|E

5000|$|The cumulus oophorus (Latin cumulus=heap, Greek oo=egg + phor=carrier; Latinized ending [...] "-us"), {{also called}} discus proligerus, is {{a cluster of}} cells (called cumulus cells) that {{surround}} the oocyte both in the ovarian follicle and after ovulation.

50|$|The {{first stage}} is the {{penetration}} of <b>corona</b> <b>radiata,</b> by releasing hyaluronidase from the acrosome to digest cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte and exposing acrosin {{attached to the}} inner membrane of the sperm.

After reaching the zona pellucida the actual acrosome reaction begins.|$|E
50|$|The corticospinal tract {{constitutes}} {{a large part}} of the internal capsule, carrying motor information from the primary motor cortex to the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord.

50|$|The {{proprioception}} of {{the lower}} limbs differs from the upper limbs and upper trunk. There is a four-neuron pathway for lower limb proprioception. This pathway initially follows the dorsal spino-cerebellar pathway. It is arranged as follows: proprioceptive receptors of lower limb -> peripheral process -> dorsal root ganglion -> central process -> Clarke's column -> 2nd order neuron -> medulla oblogata (Caudate nucleus) -> 3rd order neuron -> VPL of thalamus -> 4th order neuron -> posterior limb of internal capsule -> <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> -> sensory area of cerebrum.|$|E
50|$|The {{corticobulbar tract}} {{originates}} {{in the primary}} motor cortex of the frontal lobe, just superior to the lateral fissure and rostral to the central sulcus in the precentral gyrus also known as Brodmann area 4. The tract descends through the <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> and genu of the internal capsule with a few fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, as it passes from the cortex down to the midbrain. In the midbrain, the internal capsule becomes the cerebral peduncles. The white matter {{is located in the}} ventral portion of the cerebral peduncles, called the crus cerebri. The middle third of the crus cerebri contains the corticobulbar and corticospinal fibers. The corticobulbar fibers exit at the appropriate level of the brainstem to synapse on the lower motor neurons of the cranial nerves.|$|E
5000|$|The posterolateral tract {{contains}} centrally projecting axons from {{dorsal root}} ganglion cells carrying crude touch and pressure information (location, intensity and quality). These axons enter the spinal column and penetrate the grey matter of the dorsal horn, where they synapse on second-order neurons in either the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando or the nucleus proprius. Those neurons project their axon to the anterolateral quadrant of the contralateral half of the spinal cord, where they give the spinothalamic tract. The axons of second-order neurons ultimately synapse on neurons in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus after coursing in the medial leminiscus. After this, the 3rd order neuron fibers traverse the internal capsule and the <b>corona</b> <b>radiata,</b> ultimately synapsing in the post central gyrus (somatosensory cortex). The location of this synapse is dependent upon the somatotopic organisation of the somatosensory cortex, it can be estimated according to the position on the 'somatosensory homunculus' ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{status of}} the Roman emperors was {{in contrast to the}} kings of Rome who were expelled {{in the early years of}} the city, paving the way for a republic. Therefore the Emperors were traditionally acclaimed by the Senate or by a legion speaking for the armies as a whole, and were subsequently confirmed without any special ritual. The Eastern diadem was later introduced by Aurelian, but did not truly become part of the imperator's regalia until the reign of Constantine. [...] Prior to this, Roman sovereigns wore the purple paludamentum, and sometimes a laurel wreath as emblems of their office.Aurelian strengthened the position of Sol Invictus, whose <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> or [...] "radiant crown" [...] had become popular in depictions of emperors earlier in the 3rd century (Gordian III) with the development of the imperial cult,. Emperor Diocletian (r. 285-305) greatly developed the ceremony surrounding the Roman Emperor; the quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' primus inter pares were abandoned for all but the Tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use of purple cloth to all but the Emperors.|$|E
50|$|The neurons of {{the lateral}} spinothalamic tract {{originate}} in the spinal ganglia. They project peripheral processes to the tissues {{in the form of}} free nerve endings which are sensitive to molecules indicative of cell damage. The central processes enter the spinal cord in an area {{at the back of the}} posterior horn known as the posterolateral tract. Here, the processes ascend approximately two levels before synapsing on second-order neurons. These secondary neurons are situated in the posterior horn, specifically in the Rexed laminae regions I, IV, V and VI. Region II is primarily composed of Golgi II interneurons, which are primarily for the modulation of pain, and largely project to secondary neurons in regions I and V. Secondary neurons from regions I and V decussate across the anterior white commissure and ascend in the (now contralateral) lateral spinothalamic tract. These fibers will ascend through the brainstem, including the medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain, as the spinal lemniscus until synapsing in the ventroposteriorlateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus. The third order neurons in the thalamus will then project through the internal capsule and <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> to various regions of the cortex, primarily the main somatosensory cortex, Brodmann areas 3, 1, and 2.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pyramidal}} motor system, {{also called}} the pyramidal tract or the corticospinal tract, start in the motor center of the cerebral cortex. [...] There are upper and lower motor neurons in the corticospinal tract. The motor impulses originate in the giant pyramidal cells or Betz cells of the motor area; i.e., precentral gyrus of cerebral cortex. These are the upper motor neurons (UMN) of the corticospinal tract. The axons of these cells pass in {{the depth of the}} cerebral cortex to the <b>corona</b> <b>radiata</b> and then to the internal capsule passing through the posterior branch of internal capsule and continue to descend in the midbrain and the medulla oblongata. In the lower part of Medulla oblongata 80 to 85% of these fibers decussate (pass to the opposite side) and descend in the white matter of the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord on the opposite side. The remaining 15 to 20% pass to the same side. Fibers for the extremities (limbs) pass 100% to the opposite side.The fibers of the corticospinal tract terminate at different levels in the anterior horn of the grey matter of the spinal cord. Here the lower motor neurons (LMN) of the corticospinal cord are located.Peripheral motor nerves carry the motor impulses from the anterior horn to the voluntary muscles.|$|E
