500|$|In {{the second}} act, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, now teenagers, are rehoused in cottages {{on a farm}} in 1985. They are {{permitted}} to leave the grounds on day trips, but are resigned to their eventual fate. At the farm, they meet former pupils of schools similar to theirs, and it is revealed that they are all clones. They also hear rumours of the possibility of [...] "deferral" [...] – a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it.</b> Tommy becomes convinced that The Gallery at Hailsham was intended to look into their souls and that artwork sent to The Gallery will be able to confirm true love where it is present. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth becomes sexual, and jealousy causes Kathy and Ruth to break their friendship. The lonely Kathy leaves and becomes a [...] "carer" [...] – a clone who is given a temporary reprieve from donation as a reward for supporting and comforting donors as they are made to give up their organs. Tommy and Ruth's relationship ends.|$|E

2500|$|Let me {{make one}} other point clear {{for the benefit of}} the {{millions}} in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. Our program – we <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it</b> – saved the lives of millions of head of livestock. They are still on the range, and other millions of heads are today canned and ready for this country to eat." ...|$|E
