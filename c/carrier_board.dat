50|$|Using a <b>carrier</b> <b>board</b> is {{a benefit}} in many cases, {{as it can}} {{implement}} special I/O interfaces, memory devices, connectors or form factors. Separating {{the design of the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>board</b> and COM makes design concepts more modular, if needed. A carrier tailored to a special application may involve high design overhead by itself. If the actual processor and main I/O controllers are located on a COM, it is much easier, for example, to upgrade a CPU component to the next generation, without having to redesign a very specialized carrier as well. This can save costs and shorten development times. On the other hand, this only works if the board-to-board connection between the COM and its carrier remains compatible between upgrades.|$|E

40|$|In {{this note}} is {{reported}} {{the testing of}} the pre-production version of a solid-state adder type modulator. In this configuration, the adder consists of transformers that are driven by an array of MOSFET switches that are connected in parallel but not in series; i. e. the input voltage on the transformer {{is limited to the}} maximum voltage rating on the MOSFETs. At present, there are only enough printed circuit <b>boards</b> (MOSFET <b>carrier</b> <b>boards)</b> to drive four transformers and two of those are prototypes that are restricted by their gate drive circuits to a minimum output pulse width of {approx} 100 ns. We also have two pre-production boards that meet all of our requirements for rise and fall-times and minimum pulse width.

40|$|The {{tracking}} {{system of the}} CMS detector at the LHC employs Front End Driver (FED) cards to digitise, buffer and sparsify analogue data arriving via optical links from on detector pipeline chips. This paper describes a prototype version of the FED based upon the popular commercial PCI bus Mezzanine Card (PMC) form factor. The FED-PMC consists of an 8 channel, 9 bit ADC, card, providing a 1 MByte data buffer and operating at the LHC design frequency of 40 MHz. The core of the card is a re-programmable FPGA which allows the functionality of the card to be conveniently modified. The card is supplied with a comprehensive library of C routines. The PMC form factor allows the card to be plugged onto {{a wide variety of}} processor <b>carrier</b> <b>boards</b> and even directly into PCI based PCs. The flexibility of the FPGA based design permits the card to be used in a variety of ADC based applications...|$|R

Most international flights operated by SkyTeam, Oneworld and non-aligned international <b>carriers</b> <b>board</b> and deplane at Boarding Area A's 13 gates (gates A1–A10, A11–A11A, A12). However, Star Alliance carriers Asiana Airlines and Avianca El Salvador operate out of Boarding Area A, and non-aligned carriers Aer Lingus, Fiji Airways, WestJet (select flights), and WOW air have designated gates located at Boarding Area G. Boarding Area A is also used by domestic carriers Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Sun Country Airlines, and Hawaiian Airlines. When all gates in an airline's designated international boarding area are full, the passengers will board or deplane from the opposite international boarding area. Air Canada, Aer Lingus, Etihad Airways, and WestJet operate from airports with United States border preclearance, allowing arriving passengers to skip the wait at customs and immigration when they arrive at SFO, and exit the airport from the departure level.|$|R
