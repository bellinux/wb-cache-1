Crowds will applaud your great plays and touchdowns, but the essence of a football game revolves around atmosphere. Here, it’s completely lacking," [...] said Acevedo in his review. The game was also criticized for its lack of play-by-play and poor audio. [...] "There's no witty banter between a play-by-play announcer and color commentator (although some would argue that Madden's audio presentation's been seriously lacking the past few iterations), there's no stadium music aside from “Boom” by P.O.D. being played during kickoffs (it gets old pretty fast), and the stadium crowds are basically an afterthought," [...] added Doug Aamoth of Techland.

2500|$|In the United States, {{there are}} no federal laws prohibiting {{discrimination}} against employees based on their sexual orientation. However, Executive Order 13087, signed by President Bill Clinton, outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation against federal government employees. If a small business owner owns his or her business {{in a state where}} there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. For example, California has laws in place to protect employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those [...] "with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination <b>comes</b> <b>up,</b> <b>for</b> instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are transgender.|$|E
2500|$|At the social, {{during an}} upbeat square dance ("The Farmer and the Cowman"), the rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys over fences and water rights {{has led to}} fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone. Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. In an effort to rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will's souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also {{contributes}} to this by purchasing Will's Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie's basket, not realizing that without the $50, {{he would no longer}} have the money her father insisted he needs to [...] "purchase" [...] marriage with her. [...] Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey's basket <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> auction. [...] Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey's basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money. [...] Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket. [...] Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance. [...] Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men ("All Er Nuthin'").|$|E
2500|$|Having found a liberty {{interest}} in avoiding placement in OSP, the Court {{went on to}} consider whether Ohio afforded its inmates the required procedural protections. [...] The particular protections required emerged from a three-part balancing test first articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge, [...] [...] The three factors are (1) the private interest affected by the official action, (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation by the procedures used, and the marginal value of any increased protections, and (3) {{the burden on the}} government that adding those increased protections would impose. [...] After weighing these factors, the Court concluded that Ohio afforded its inmates the requisite procedures. [...] The {{interest in}} avoiding assignment to a Supermax facility must be [...] "evaluated... {{within the context of the}} prison system and its attendant curtailment of liberties." [...] Ohio afforded inmates notice that it was considering placing them in OSP and a fair opportunity for rebuttal; this was consistent with the procedural protections afforded in other prison administration contexts. [...] Furthermore, Ohio's requirement that it explain the factual basis for the classification review and offer the inmate an opportunity for rebuttal [...] "safeguards against the inmate being mistaken for another or being singled out for insufficient reason". [...] At each of the three levels, the reviewing administrator can decline to recommend OSP placement, at which point the process terminates. [...] The Court found this arrangement preferable to Ohio's former system, under which inmates were sometimes placed in OSP without any explanation at all. [...] Because the inmate will always have an explanation of the reasons for recommended OSP placement, he will always have something to argue against when he proceeds to the next level of review or <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his next suitability hearing.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{takeover}} by Walmart, several [...] "Asda Walmart Supercentres" [...] have been opened, creating {{some of the}} largest hypermarkets in the United Kingdom. Since 2006, all new Supercentres have been solely branded as Asda Supercentre without the Walmart branding. The first Supercentre with a sales area of [...] opened in Patchway, Bristol in the summer of 2000. The first Scottish Supercentre opened in Livingston, in 2001. The Bletchley, Milton Keynes Supercentre which opened in November 2005 is currently the largest Asda Supercentre with a net sales floor of over [...] This was preceded in June 2002 by the Eastlands, Manchester store which was the largest store at the time with a sales area of [...] but is currently the second largest Asda Supercentre, and the third largest is located in Minworth, West Midlands, followed by Patchway. As of 31 January 2017, there are 32 Supercentres. There have been no more new Supercentre openings since 2008, and the dual Asda Wal*Mart branding on the older Supercentres is being gradually phased out in favour of using the sole Asda branding as each store <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> major refurbishment work. Most supercentres have now removed the dual Walmart branding. Most supercentres also have a petrol station. They also have either a customer cafe, or a McDonald's franchise restaurant. However, the Pudsey supercentre has both. This store is also the only supercentre to have a basement-level sales floor underneath the original surface-level ground floor sales area. At the time of the Pudsey superstore conversion to the supercentre format in 2002, the building contractors could not build a traditional exterior extension due to lack of space, because the Pudsey site had been a joint venture development with Marks & Spencer in 1990, and they had a large store immediately adjacent to the Asda store. So, it was decided that instead of creating a first floor mezzanine level extension {{it would be better to}} drill down underneath the original shop floor to excavate and create a new basement store extension.|$|E
