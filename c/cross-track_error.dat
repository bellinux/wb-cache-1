We have reformulated the problem as an optimal control problem, using a trajectory generator that can meet arbitrary boundary state constraints. The goal state along the target path is determined dynamically by minimizing a utility function based on corrective trajectory feasibility and <b>cross-track</b> <b>error.</b> A set of field tests compared the proposed method to an implementation of the pure pursuit algorithm and showed that the smooth corrective trajectory constrained optimization approach exhibited higher performance than pure pursuit by achieving rough four times lower average <b>cross-track</b> <b>error</b> and two times lower heading error. ...|$|E

The distributed situation awareness of a system is inherently dependent {{on the level of}} interaction between system elements. Previous studies have found that the distributed situational relevance of team communication is highly correlated with team performance. This study investigated the impact of the combination of both relevance and situational correctness of communication during simulated high-speed craft navigation. A natural experiment with navigation in the inner Oslo Fjord was performed with a three-person team in a maritime desktop simulator. Participants were required to communicate verbally to ensure safe and efficient navigation. All statements communicated by the participants during the experiment was rated for relevance (relevant/irrelevant) and for situational correctness (correct or incorrect) and these scores was combined to form a Communication score ranging from + 1 (good) to - 1 (bad). Measures of the relevancy, correctness and the combined communication score were then correlated with the navigational team performance (measured as <b>cross-track</b> <b>error).</b> Findings indicate surprisingly that the relevance of communication (irrespective of its correctness) did not have any relationship to navigational performance (r ≈ 0) while the ratio of wrong communication showed a small to moderate positive correlation (r =. 237) to <b>cross-track</b> <b>error.</b> Most interestingly the combined communication score had a moderately large negative correlation with <b>cross-track</b> <b>error</b> (r = -. 349) thus indicating that at least for dynamic navigation tasks {{it is not enough to}} only look on the relevance of communication – but that also the situational correctness of information must be measured...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis investigates whether the National Hurricane Center (NHC) operational product for producing probabilistic forecasts of tropical cyclone (TC) wind distributions {{could be further}} improved by examining the distributions of track errors it draws upon to calculate probabilities. The track spread/skill relationship for several global ensemble prediction system forecasts is examined {{as a condition for}} a description of a full probability distribution function. The 2007, 2008, and 2009 NHC official track forecasts are compared to the ensemble prediction system model along-, cross-, and forecast-track errors. Significant differences in statistical properties were then identified among the groups to determine whether conditioning based on geographic location was warranted. Examination of each regional distribution interval suggests that differences in distributions existed for along-track and <b>cross-track</b> <b>errors.</b> Because errors for ensemble mean and deterministic forecasts typically have larger mean errors and larger variance than official forecast errors, it is unlikely that independent error distributions based on these models would refine the PDFs used in the probabilistic model. However, this should be tested with a sensitivity analysis and verified with the probability swath. Overall, conditional formatting suggests that the NHC probability product may be improved if the Monte Carlo (MC) model would draw from refined distributions of track errors based on TC location.

40|$|This report {{presents}} two optimization problems, {{where three}} cost-functions are suggested for each. The {{goal for the}} first optimization problem {{is to find a}} time variant look-ahead distance which improves the performance of the vessel in terms of the <b>cross-track</b> <b>error,</b> relative to constant look-ahead distances. The second optimization problem is an extension of the first, where a time variant surge velocity reference is also calculated. This results in smaller cross-track errors, at the cost of increased calculation time. It is assumed that the path and the desired surge velocity on the path is supplied by some external source. Existing kappa-exponential control laws are used to track the references resulting from the calculated optimal look-ahead distance and surge velocity reference. The predictions needed to solve the optimization problem are made from a model where the control laws are inserted into the dynamics to simplify the model. The optimization problems are solved for two different approaches. The first approach uses an LTV model for predictions and a QP-solver to solve the optimization problem. The second approach forms predictions of the states by numerical integration of the system dynamics and uses an optimization problem solver for general non-linear functions to solve the optimization problem. The latter approach generally results in longer calculation times but better accuracy, while the first approach yields convexity of the optimization problem. A passive observer is used to estimate the current such that it can be included in the predictions. Four of the six suggested cost-functions lead to significantly improved performance of the vessel in terms of the <b>cross-track</b> <b>error.</b> This is true both in the case of no disturbances and {{in the presence of a}} constant irrotational current. That is, the position of the vessel converges faster to the path, the vessel stays closer to the path and has less over-shoot in the <b>cross-track</b> <b>error,</b> for the optimal inputs than for constant inputs. The cost-functions includes weights for tuning where the tuning process is easy for some of the cost-functions. One of the cost-functions where only the optimal look-ahead distance is calculated, results in calculation times shorter than the time between samples, after a few time steps. This is a promising result since the application of MPC to fast-dynamic systems such as marine vessels is desired, but often problematic due to too long calculation times for solving the optimization problem. It takes more time to solve the optimization problem when the optimal surge velocity reference is found in addition to the optimal look-ahead distance. </p...|$|E

The conference is available at [URL] also the record [URL] paper presents the development, implementation and verification of a flight control system for the automated landing of an intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in crosswind conditions. There is an increasing number of commercial opportunities for UAVs in business, agriculture, industry and mining, the emergency services and security services. The major barrier to commercialisation of UAVs is the certification process, where automated take-off and landing is a key feature required. The automated landing system presented in this paper uses a longitudinal control system based on the total energy control system (TECS), and a lateral control system that combines a heading and guidance controller with a <b>cross-track</b> <b>error</b> controller. A software state machine is used to advance the flight control system through the different stages of the automated landing. The TECS architecture allows the airspeed and flight path angle to be decoupled, while the Cross-Track Controller uses a limited integrator to drive the <b>cross-track</b> <b>error</b> to zero in the presence of crosswind. The automated landing system is implemented on a UAV with an on-board computer, sensors and actuators, and is verified in simulation and with practical flight tests.

40|$|This thesis will {{compare the}} {{performance}} of the Challenge 1 unmanned surface vehicle when autonomously conducting a radiological survey of a bounded, obstacle free, convex polygon via a traditional raster scan versus a novel spiral-like path plan. Currently, unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and unmanned surface vehicles (USV) use a simple raster scan to insure complete coverage of a predefined, obstacle free area. Raster scans require a 180 degree change in heading which is easy for tracked UGVs and vertical take-o_ UAVs to accomplish, but more difficult for marine vehicles and fixed winged UAVs. A spiral-like path plan will not completely eliminate turns close to 180 degrees, but presents the possibility of removing the number of sharp turns at the expense of adding more slight turns. The author of this thesis originally hypothesized that this spiral-like path plan would result in shorter autonomous surveys by the Challenge 1 USV, as well as a higher percentage of coverage. Shorter surveys will allow operators such as the mission specialist overseeing a disaster in which radiological material may be present or treaty verification inspectors searching a facility to conduct more surveys in a limited time, which therefore increases the total area searched over this time period as well as provides data to the mission specialist faster. A higher percentage of coverage attained by the spiral-like path plan would guarantee a more complete representation of the area surveyed. To test this hypothesis the author used the 1. 15 acre pond at John Crompton Park in College Station, Texas, to generate twenty-five unique convex polygons via teleoperation of the Challenge 1, ranging in size from 450 square meters to 1027 square meters, to which a raster path plan and spiral-like path plan were each used by the Challenge 1 to survey the area, resulting in fifty total runs. Following the data collection, the associated log from each run was used to calculate total survey time, total survey distance, root mean square of <b>cross-track</b> <b>error,</b> Hausdorff Distance (max RMS error), percent coverage, and percent of survey locations inside the bounded convex polygon. The average survey time for a spiral like path plan versus a raster scan was 13. 68 seconds shorter (p < : 59). The average total distance for a raster path versus a spiral like path was 15. 53 meters less (p < : 061). The average RMS of <b>cross-track</b> <b>error</b> for a spiral like path plan versus a spiral path plan was 0. 31 meters less (p < : 123). The average Hausdorff Distance for a spiral like path plan versus a raster scan was 1. 53 meters less (p < 0 : 0005). The average of percent coverage for a raster scan versus a spiral like path was 4 : 22 % higher (p < 0 : 027). The average of percentage of locations in the bounding area for a raster path versus a spiral like path was 16 : 88 % higher (p < 0 : 00023). This shows that for ? = : 05, there is no statistical difference between either of the two path plans for survey time, survey distance, or RMS of <b>cross-track</b> <b>error.</b> However, there is a statistical difference between the two path plans for Hausdorff Distance, percent coverage and percentage of locations inside the bounding area. Due to the spiral path plan's inability to maintain locations inside the bounding area, a raster scan is the best path plan to use when surveying a bounded convex polygon with the Challenge 1 since it results in the highest percentage of coverage with no statistical difference in survey time, survey distance, or RMS of <b>cross-track</b> <b>error.</b> This result is only guaranteed for the Challenge 1 and its associated controller, with potentially different outcomes if tested on other surfaces vehicles, especially those with underwater propellers, rudders, or jet pump (no propeller or rudder) propulsion systems...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} accurate path following control for an underactuated unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) in the horizontal plane. For an underactuated UUV, the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance method is adopted to map 2 D reference trajectory into a desired orientation, and through the tracking of heading to achieve path following, where the sideslip is introduced to modify the desired orientation. In this paper, we propose a method called dynamic surface and active disturbance rejection control (DS-ADRC) to solve the path following control problem. This controller can effectively avoid the phenomenon of explosion of terms in the conventional backstepping method, reduce the dependence on the UUV controller mathematical model, and enhance the antijamming ability. Simulation is carried out to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed control method for an underactuated UUV. The results show that, even for this controller with disturbance, the <b>cross-track</b> <b>error</b> of UUV is gradually converged to zero and has some certain robustness...|$|E
40|$|A new {{nonlinear}} guidance logic, {{that has}} demonstrated superior performance in guiding unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) on curved trajectories, is presented. The logic approximates a proportional-derivative controller when following {{a straight line}} path, but the logic also contains an element of anticipatory control enabling tight tracking when following curved paths. The method uses inertial speed in the computation of commanded lateral acceleration and adds adaptive capability to the change of vehicle speed due to external disturbances, such as wind. Flight tests using two small UAVs showed that each aircraft was controlled to within 1. 6 meters RMS when following circular paths. The logic was ultimately used for air rendezvous of the two aircraft, bringing them {{in close proximity to}} within 12 meters of separation, with 1. 4 meters RMS relative position errors.

40|$|Spaceborne gravity {{gradients}} are proposed {{in this paper}} to provide autonomous orbit determination capabilities for near Earth satellites. The {{gravity gradients}} contain useful position information which can be extracted by matching the observations with a precise gravity model. The extended Kalman filter is investigated as the principal estimator. The stochastic model of orbital motion, the measurement equation and the model configuration are discussed for the filter design. An augmented state filter is also developed to deal with unknown significant measurement biases. Simulations are conducted to analyze the effects of initial errors, data-sampling periods, orbital heights, attitude and gradiometer noise levels, and measurement biases. Results show that the filter performs well with additive white noise observation errors. Degraded observability for the along-track position is found for the augmented state filter. Real flight data from the GOCE satellite are {{used to test the}} algorithm. Radial and <b>cross-track</b> position <b>errors</b> of less than 100 m have been achieved.

40|$|Method {{and system}} for {{analyzing}} and processing information {{on one or}} more aircraft flight paths, using a four-dimensional coordinate system including three Cartesian or equivalent coordinates (x, y, z) and a fourth coordinate. delta. that corresponds to a distance estimated along a reference flight path to a nearest reference path location corresponding to a present location of the aircraft. Use of the coordinate. delta., rather than elapsed time t, avoids coupling of along-track error into aircraft altitude and reduces effects of errors on an aircraft landing site. Along-track, <b>cross-track</b> and/or altitude <b>errors</b> are estimated and compared with a permitted error bounding space surrounding the reference flight path...|$|R
40|$|Earth {{orbiting}} spacecraft {{are exposed}} to hazardous Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris environment. These objects can collide at very high velocity, causing significant damages to operational satellites in any orbital regime, from LEO to GEO. Many of these objects are catalogued and regularly monitored, thus their orbital parameters are always updated {{and can be used}} to perform a risk assessment analysis based on the probability of impact that can occur between orbiting objects. In order to perform a Close Approach (CA) analysis, the two space objects position and velocity vectors are necessary, as well as the state covariance. These parameters can be obtained from the Two Line Element sets (TLE); however the accuracy of the provided state vectors is not sufficient for accurate collision analyses, and further orbit determination should be performed in order to determine an accurate state vector and the related covariance. This level of accuracy can be achieved by integrating the TLE parameters with optical measures. Nevertheless, to achieve suitable orbit determination results from optical measurements the accuracy of the angular measures {{is as important as the}} timing precision: A tenth of a second error on timing can lead to several hundred meters error on the position estimation. In order to accomplish this requirement a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is used as external trigger for the CCD camera. In order to evaluate the measurement acquisition system performances the measures accuracy must be determined. To this purpose, several measurements of the Global Position System (GPS) satellites have been collected and compared to their precise ephemeris. About a hundred GPS satellite measures were used to achieve the statistical distributions of the error committed, both Along-Track and Cross-Track, in terms of mean and Standard Deviation (SD) values. Mean values achieved are on the order of magnitude of tenth of arcsecond for both cases, while SD are equal to 3. 5 and 3. 3 arcseconds for the Along-Track and the <b>Cross-Track</b> <b>errors.</b> In this paper is presented a study case, based on the Close Approach in GEO region between GORIZONT 11 and COSMOS 1738 occurred on 2011 December 22 nd, to compare the results obtainable by using TLE only or the accurate orbit determination system based on the observation campaign.
