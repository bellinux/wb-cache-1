40|$|We {{present a}} {{real-world}} testbed {{for research and}} development in vehicular networking that has been deployed successfully in the sea port of Leixões in Portugal. The testbed allows for cloud-based code deployment, remote network control and distributed data <b>collection</b> <b>from</b> moving <b>container</b> trucks, cranes, tow boats, patrol vessels and roadside units, thereby enabling a wide range of experiments and performance analyses. After describing the testbed architecture and its various modes of operation, we give concrete examples of its use and offer insights on how to build effective testbeds for wireless networking with moving vehicles...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss a real-life case study in the {{optimization}} of the logistics network for the <b>collection</b> of <b>containers</b> <b>from</b> end-of-life vehicle dismantlers in the Netherlands. Advanced planning concepts like dynamic assignment of dismantlers to logistic service providers are analyzed by a simulation model. In this model, we periodically solve a vehicle routing problem to gain insight in the long-term performance of the system. The vehicle routing problem considered is a multi depot pickup and delivery problem with alternative delivery locations. We solve this problem with a heuristic based on route generation and set partitioning. ...|$|R

50|$|AOP {{is usually}} treated by blood {{transfusion}} but the indications for this are still unclear. Blood transfusions have {{the risk of}} incompatibility and transfusion reactions as well as viral infections. Also, blood transfusions are costly and add to parental anxiety. The best treatment in prevention is minimizing the amount of blood drawn from the infant. It is found that since blood loss attributable to laboratory testing is {{the primary cause of}} anemia among preterm infants during the first weeks of life, we quantified blood lost attributable to phlebotomy overdraw, something that might be avoided. A study was done to see when and if overdraw was a problem. They recorded all of the data that could be of influence such as the test performed, the blood collection container used, the infants location (neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and intermediate intensive care unit), the infant’s weight sampling and the phlebotomist’s level of experience, work shift, and clinical role. Infants were classified by weight into 3 groups: <1 kg, 1 to 2 kg, and >2 kg. The volume of blood removed was calculated by subtracting the weight of the empty <b>collection</b> <b>container</b> <b>from</b> that of the container filled with blood. They found that the mean volume of blood drawn for the 578 tests exceeded that requested by the hospital laboratory by 19.0% ± 1.8% per test. The main factors of overdraw was: collection in blood containers without fill-lines, lighter weight infants and critically ill infants being cared for in the NICU.|$|R

Larval <b>collections</b> <b>from</b> cemetery vases revealed a colonized area of approximately 1400 km 2 in northern Switzerland spreading into bordering Germany, suggesting that the mosquito {{has been established in}} this region for several years. Within this range, larvae of Ae. japonicus were recovered <b>from</b> more <b>containers</b> than the most common resident culicid species Culex pipiens. Possible introduction sites (used tyre yards and international airports) revealed few or no larvae, and the mode of introduction remains unclear.

40|$|Fungal {{pathogens}} tend {{to accumulate}} within styroblock containers, which are reused to produce successive crops of container-grown seedlings. Most nurseries treat reused containers by immersing them {{in hot water}} for varying time periods. The efficacy of radio frequency waves (RFs) to reduce levels of selected groups of fungi within styroblock containers was evaluated. RFs were effective only on containers that had been wetted in warm water prior to treatment. RFs were not effective on dry containers. Fusarium proliferatum was the most commonly encountered potentially-pathogenic fungus isolated <b>from</b> <b>containers.</b> Seven other species of Fusarium and two species of Cylindrocaipon were also isolated <b>from</b> <b>containers.</b> Common fungal saprophytes on containers included Trichoderma and Penicillium spp. Although wet RF treatment was as effective as hot water immersion, such treatments may be much more expensive due to high costs of RF equipment...|$|R
