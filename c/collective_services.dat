50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} serious gaps in living {{standards}} between rural and urban areas were in education and health care. Primary schools existed in most rural localities, and 80 percent of the country's primary-school teachers worked in rural schools. Secondary schools were less widely distributed; only 57 {{percent of the total}} number of secondary-school teachers served in rural schools. Most rural schools were less well equipped, and their staffs less adequately trained than their urban counterparts. Health care had been greatly improved in rural areas in the 1960s and 1970s through sanitation campaigns and the introduction of large numbers of barefoot doctors, midwives, and health workers. Most modern hospitals, fully trained doctors, and modern medical equipment, however, were located in urban areas and were not easily accessible to rural families. In 1985 two-thirds of all hospital beds and medical staff personnel were located in urban hospitals. The economic reforms affected rural education and health care positively in places where farm communities used their higher incomes to improve schools and hospitals and negatively in localities where the reduced role of the collective resulted in deterioration of <b>collective</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

After fifteen years he moved away from classic ethnographic description of small scale society to observe how modernity and western influences are incorporated into, and subverted by, African societies - particularly through public and <b>collective</b> <b>services</b> delivery, and by development aid. In his 1995 book (Olivier de Sardan, 1995, English version 2005) he significantly enhanced the field of anthropology of development, advocating for a [...] "fundamental" [...] and non normative anthropology of development (and not only an [...] "applied" [...] one), being attentive to the drifts, unintended effects and implementations gaps of development projects, describing the various perceptions and logics of development 'actors' and stakeholders in Africa and how they related to existing socio-political structures.

The Demographic Census of IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) and the Annual Social Information (RAIS) of the Labou rMinistery served as data base. As a result, it can be stated that the towns located in the North Center have been undertaking a restructuring process serving agribusiness and its production process.

The researches developed for the Walloon context on this topic confirm the literature concerning the importance of the costs of sprawl for infrastructure services (particularly for drinking water pipes and wastewater treatment). It also arises from the analysis that the costs of sprawl are massively collectivised, via taxation or invoicing which by no means consider the influence of the modes of settlement on the investment needs. urban sprawl, Wallonia, <b>collective</b> <b>services,</b> infrastructure costs, wastewater treatment, planning, land-use...|$|E

40|$|Co-housing {{is a type}} of {{cooperative}} living wherein residents retain private dwellings, but share some conunon facilities. Although it is frequently referred to as a "new " idea that "began " iu Denmark in the 1970 s (see McCamant & Durrett, 1988), socialized neighborhood design is anything but new, as Dolores Hayden's book, The Grand Domestic Revolution (1981), makes strikingly clear. In this highly readable chronicle, Hayden recounts the fascinating story of a two-generation movement of turn-of-the-century American feminists who strived to build neighborhoods with <b>collective</b> <b>services</b> such as conunon kitchens, dining rooms, laundries, day care centers, and the like. Their efforts, though similar to those of today's co-housing activists, were not motivated by the need to renew a sense of conununity or increase togetherness. Rather, these early feminists worked to create <b>collective</b> <b>services</b> in order to free women from the chains of domestic servitude. As Hayden takes us through the waxing and waning of this movement to socialize American neighborhoods, she carefully analyzes everything from the architectural blueprints of kitchenless houses to the philosophical underpinnings o...|$|E

Moreover, when the goods provided are at least partly public in nature, buyers face individual incentives to divert donations towards providers that adopt low-fixed cost technologies, and so providers may forgo the adoption of more efficient technologies that require fixed costs. In these situations, government grants in support of core costs can have a non-neutral effect on entry, technology adoption, and industry performance. core funding; entry; not-for-profit organizations...|$|R
