5000|$|Austin, TX band Full Service {{recorded}} {{a song about}} Eddie Aikau called [...] "In A Rescue," [...] found on their 2006 album [...] "Recess." [...] They performed the song at the Full <b>Service</b> <b>Circus</b> in May 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Following Full <b>Service</b> <b>Circus</b> 2, Steve Rennie drew {{attention}} to it on his website, calling Full Service [...] "the poster boys of F*ck the Gatekeepers," [...] a mentality he describes as [...] "the idea of overcoming obstacles {{on the way to}} doing something great." ...|$|R
25|$|On November 12, 2007, Quicken Loans {{announced}} its development {{agreement with the}} city to move its headquarters to downtown Detroit, consolidating about 4,000 of its suburban employees in a move {{considered to be a}} high importance to city planners to reestablish the historic downtown. The construction sites reserved for development under the agreement include the location of the former Statler on Grand Circus Park and the former Hudson's location. (The western edge of the park was formerly home to the now demolished Statler and Tuller hotels). Grand <b>Circus</b> is <b>serviced</b> by a People Mover station.|$|R
5000|$|Based on {{the overall}} success of the first Full <b>Service</b> <b>Circus,</b> the band hoped to make this an annual event. Full <b>Service</b> <b>Circus</b> 2 was held October 24-26, 2014, with a similar format as the first. Highlights {{included}} a silent auction of various band-related items (proceeds going toward tour van maintenance, etc.), a show at Empire Control Room, a [...] "Red Team vs. Blue Team" [...] soccer match consisting of the band members along with attendees interested in playing, two backyard acoustic shows in which the album [...] "Roaming Dragons" [...] was played in its entirety, and a show at The Buzz Mill with a puppet show prior to it (relocated due to city maintenance work). A school bus was also rented and decorated as the [...] "Locobus" [...] to transport people to and from various places. The graphic is from an information packet each attendee received.|$|R
50|$|Foreign Office {{civil servant}} Samuel Fennan {{apparently}} commits suicide after a routine security check by Circus agent George Smiley. Smiley had interviewed and cleared Fennan only days previously after an anonymous accusation; because of this, <b>Circus</b> head of <b>service</b> Maston sets up Smiley {{to be blamed}} for Fennan's death. While interviewing Fennan's wife Elsa in her home, Smiley answers the telephone, expecting the call to be for him. It is a requested 8:30 AM call from the telephone exchange.|$|R
5000|$|On December 5, 2012, Full Service {{announced}} {{that they would be}} hosting a festival in Austin, TX, in May 2013. [...] The Full <b>Service</b> <b>Circus</b> would be akin to a [...] "reverse 20 tour"; instead of the fans hosting the band, this time the band would host the fans in their hometown and, literally, their own backyard. [...] The Circus would not feature animals ("just the band members") but instead showcase {{the sights and sounds of}} Austin, visiting such places as FSHQ (the band's home and headquarters), Antone's, and Zilker Park. Sponsors, including Austin's Pizza and Wahoo's Fish Taco, would host events and offer discounted food and drinks throughout the event ($1 pizza slices, tacos and local draft beers).|$|R
500|$|Childhood friends Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon from Essex met Alex James {{when they}} began {{studying}} at London's Goldsmiths College in 1988. Albarn was in a group named Circus, who were joined by drummer Dave Rowntree that October. <b>Circus</b> requested the <b>services</b> of Coxon after the departure of their guitarist. That December, Circus fired two members and James joined as the group's bassist. This new group named themselves Seymour in December 1988, inspired by J. D. Salinger's [...] The group performed live {{for the first time}} in summer 1989. In November, Food Records' A representative Andy Ross attended a Seymour performance that convinced him to court the group for his label. The only concern held by Ross and Food was that they disliked the band's name. Food drew up a list of alternatives, from which the group decided on [...] "Blur". Food Records finally signed the newly christened band in March 1990.|$|R
40|$|Developments in sensor {{technologies}} have made consumer-grade digital cameras {{one of the}} more recent tools in remote sensing applications. Consumer-grade digital cameras have been the imaging sensor of choice by researchers due to their small size, light weight, limited power requirements, and their potential to store hundreds of images (Hardin 2011). Several studies have focused on the use of digital cameras and their efficacy in remote sensing applications. For satellite and airborne multispectral imaging systems, there is a well established radiometric processing approach. However, radiometric processing lines for digital cameras are currently being researched. The goal of this report is to describe an absolute method of radiometric normalization that converts digital numbers output by the camera to reflectance values {{that can be used for}} remote sensing applications. This process is used at the AggieAir Flying <b>Circus</b> (AAFC), a <b>service</b> center at the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University. The AAFC is a research unit that specializes in the acquisition, processing, and interpretation of aerial imagery obtained with the AggieAirTM platform. AggieAir is an autonomous, unmanned aerial vehicle system that captures multi-temporal and multispectral high resolution imagery for the production of orthorectified mosaics. The procedure used by the AAFC is based on methods adapted from Miura and Huete (2009), Crowther (1992) and Neale and Crowther (1994) for imagery acquired with Canon PowerShot SX 100 cameras. Absolute normalization requires ground measurements at the time the imagery is acquired. In this study, a barium sulfate reflectance panel with absolute reflectance is used. The procedure was demonstrated using imagery captured from a wetland near Pleasant Grove, Utah, that is managed by the Utah Department of Transportation...|$|R
