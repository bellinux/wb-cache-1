5|$|Weinstein did not land {{a job on}} a major comedy series, as {{previous}} Harvard {{graduates who}} wrote for the Lampoon had done, despite writing numerous spec scripts for shows such as Saturday Night Live and Late Night with David Letterman; he moved back home to Washington, D.C.

40|$|This study explores {{occupational}} health nurses' encounters with unemployed clients in Finland. It involved setting up and evaluating a new service, Career Health Care, that resembled {{occupational health}} care, except that clients {{were recruited from}} among job seekers who were participating {{in one of three}} active labour market policy measures: vocational training, subsidised employment in the public sector, or participatory training for entering the labour market. Our main interest focused on nurses' perceptions of the unemployed and their professional practices in the context of Career Health Care. The analysis revealed four overlapping discourses with regard to clients: the <b>client</b> <b>as</b> a casualty of unemployment, the <b>client</b> <b>as</b> unemployed but active, the <b>client</b> <b>as</b> a deviant in the labour market, and the <b>client</b> <b>as</b> a skilled user of the system. Each discourse had implications for professional practice. The risk of negative stereotyping and consequent exclusion from services is discussed here. In conclusion, we stress the complexity of providing health services that can match the increasing diversity of contemporary labour market trajectories.
