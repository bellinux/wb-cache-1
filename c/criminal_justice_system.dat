5|$|David Cameron criticised the Labour Government's <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> and {{the absence}} of father-figures in ethnic {{minority}} cultures, which he claimed as causes in the murder of Pryce.

He insisted that parental background had a key role in preventing crime and called for zero tolerance of knife crime, claiming that not enough criminals were being sent to jail.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E

He declined, believing that an author's merit could only be determined by the posthumous verdict of history. 1946 saw the publication, as The Crime of Imprisonment, of the preface Shaw had written 20 years previously to a study of prison conditions.

Sotomayor has supported, while on the court, the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her tenure on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants, calls for reform of the <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system,</b> and making impassioned dissents on issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Watch, {{in their}} 2008 report on Saudi Arabian <b>{{criminal}}</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system,</b> {{noted that the}} criminal procedure code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but, as mentioned above, had been ignored by judges in any case. Those arrested are often not informed {{of the crime of}} which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E

5|$|Louis {{reformed}} {{the administrative}} {{structure of the}} Bastille, creating the post of governor, although this post was still {{often referred to as}} the captain-governor. During Louis's reign the policing of marginal groups in Paris was greatly increased: the wider <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> was reformed, controls over printing and publishing extended, new criminal codes were issued and the post of the Parisian lieutenant general of police was created in 1667, all of which would enable the Bastille's later role in support of the Parisian police during the 18th century. By 1711, a 60-strong French military garrison had been established at the Bastille. It continued to be an expensive institution to run, particularly when the prison was full, such as during 1691 when numbers were inflated by the campaign against French Protestants and the annual cost of running the Bastille rose to 232,818 livres.|$|E
5|$|Pound's lawyer, Julien Cornell, whose {{efforts to}} have him {{declared}} insane are credited with having saved him from life imprisonment, requested his release at a bail hearing in January 1947.

The historian Stanley Kutler was given access in the 1980s to military intelligence and other government documents about Pound, including his hospital records, and wrote that the psychiatrists believed Pound had a narcissistic personality, but they considered him sane. Kutler believes that Overholser protected Pound from the <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> because he was fascinated by him.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through the <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys {{that they wanted to}} exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E

5000|$|Forensic {{photography}} {{resulted from}} the modernization of <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> {{and the power of}} photographic [...] During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, these two developments were significant to both forensic photography and police work in general.

Then, <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> began incorporating science into the procedures of police and judiciaries. The main reason, however, for the acceptance of police photography, is a conventional one. Other than its growing popularity, the widespread notion of photography was the prominent belief in the realism of the medium.|$|R
