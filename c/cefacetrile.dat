50|$|<b>Cefacetrile</b> (INN, also spelled cephacetrile) is a broad-spectrum first {{generation}} cephalosporin antibiotic effective in gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. It is a bacteriostatic antibiotic. <b>Cefacetrile</b> is marketed under the trade names Celospor, Celtol, and Cristacef, and as Vetimast {{for the treatment}} of mammary infections in lactating cows.|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{inhibition of}} mild steel in acidic media using <b>Cefacetrile</b> was investigated by using various corrosion monitoring {{techniques such as}} weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. All the techniques used for the studies showed the increase in inhibition efficiency and decrease in the corrosion rate by increasing the inhibitor concentration. Langmuir adsorption isotherm and impedance studies showed that CFT inhibits through adsorption mechanism. Potentiodynamic polarization reveals that CFT acted as mixed-type predominantly cathodic inhibitor. The mechanism of corrosion inhibition is also proposed...|$|E
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for the confirmatory and quantitative analysis of 30 Î²-lactam antibiotic residues in bovine muscle. The method includes 12 penicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, mecillinam, methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, penicillin G, penicillin V, piperacillin, ticarcillin), 12 cephalosporins (<b>cefacetrile,</b> cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefalonium, cefazolin, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefquinome, cefuroxime, desacetyl cephapirin, desfuroylceftiofur cysteine disulfide, desfuroylceftiofur dimer), five carbapenems (biapenem, doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem) and faropenem. Samples were extracted using a simple solvent extraction with acetonitrile:water (80 : 20, v/v) and C 18 dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) clean-up, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) detection. Chromatography was performed on a reversed phase CSH C 18 column, using a binary gradient separation comprising of 0. 01 % formic acid and 0. 2 mM ammonium acetate in water (mobile phase A) and 0. 01 % formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray ionisation mode (ESI(+)). Validation was performed following the 2002 / 657 /EC guidelines. Trueness ranged between 69 % and 143 % and precision ranged between 2. 0 % and 29. 9 % under within-laboratory reproducibility conditions. The developed method uses minimal sample preparation and 30 test samples can be analysed by a single analyst in a single day. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first method for carbapenems in foodstuff that does not require derivatisation. </p...|$|E
