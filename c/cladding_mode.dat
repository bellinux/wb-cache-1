40|$|The optical {{properties}} of the guided modes {{in the core of}} photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) can be easily manipulated by changing the air-hole structure in the cladding. Special properties can be achieved in this case such as endless singlemode operation. Endlessly single-mode fibers, which enable single-mode guidance over a wide spectral range, are indispensable in the field of fiber technology. A two-dimensional photonic crystal with a silica central core and a micrometer-spaced hexagonal array of air holes is an established method to achieve endless single-mode properties. In addition to the guidance of light in the core, different <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> occur. The coupling between the core and the <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> can affect the endlessly single-mode guides. There are two possible ways to determine the dispersion: measurement and calculation. We calculate the group velocity dispersion(GVD) of different <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> based on the measurement of the fiber structure parameters, the hole diameter and the pitch of a presumed homogeneous hexagonal array. Based on the scanning electron image, a calculation was made of the optical guiding {{properties of the}} microstructured cladding. We compare the calculation with a method to measure the wavelength-dependent time delay. We measure the time delay of defined <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> with a homemade supercontinuum light source in a white light interferometric setup. To measure the dispersion of <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> of optical fibers with high accuracy, a time-domain white-light interferometer based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is used.

The spectrum of the re-grown TFBG contrasts with that of normal TFBG by exhibiting large differences in the amplitude between neighboring symmetric and asymmetric <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> resonances, moreover each asymmetric <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> resonance splits into two peaks (corresponding to two orthogonal polar-ization states). The differential response of the three individual resonances of such group provides quantitative information about the magnitude and directions of bends in the TFBG. Numerical simulations indicate that {{the changes in the}} cladding-mode pro-files in a bent fiber are responsible for this behavior through their impact on coupling coefficients.

40|$|A simple {{mechanism}} {{useful to}} tailor the field profile in single mode optical fibers is proposed. It involves {{the local and}} permanent bend of the fiber with bending radius of few hundred micrometers.

Also, since the light propagated by guided <b>cladding</b> <b>modes</b> interacts with the surrounding medium by evanescent wave, the field distribution can be additionally tailored by changing the refractive index of the medium surrounding the straight fiber region after the permanent bend. Here, the effects of permanent bend on the guided mode in single mode fiber is first theoretically introduced and then widely experimentally investigated.

The response of <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> effective index with increasing overlay thickness is analyzed. The lower order modes are transferred to the overlay, and the higher order modes replace the lower order modes order by order and continue to propagate in the cladding. Further, the transmission spectrum of the coated LPFG is investigated while the overlay thickness is located in mode transition and the surrounding region, the amplitude of attenuation peak of the <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> which will enter the overlay decreases rapidly and the peak position of adjacent higher <b>cladding</b> <b>mode</b> shift towards the former lower mode. To design high sensitivity LPFG sensor, the optimal overlay thickness is selected {{to ensure that the}} coated LPFG is located in the mode fast transition region. Finally, the response characteristics of film refractive index of coated LPFG were investigated for two typical cladding modes, and two kinds of the sensor sensitivity are defined and calculated. The results indicate that the resolution of film refractive index in mode transition can be available to 10 - 6 and 10 - 7 respectively, if the sensor is detected by transmittance change and wavelength shift.
