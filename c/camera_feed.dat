5|$|Shooting {{took place}} over several days at Music Bank, the famous {{rehearsal}} studios in London. Actor Michael spent forty hours practising the drumming beforehand, but with vision inside the suit limited to a <b>camera</b> <b>feed</b> piped to a small screen inside the head, precision was almost impossible. Many takes ended with the wooden drum sticks broken against the rims, sending shards of wood flying off-camera. This, combined with the difficulty of choreographing the delicate movements of the gorilla head with Michael's acting, meant that 35takes were required to produce the final 90-second scene.|$|E

Among other problems, Pete swears too much and does not seem {{affected}} by the atmosphere, while cues are missed by the pranksters. Terry is surprised to hear a child's voice during Anne's performance as Madam Talbot, and, backstage, the camera stream is blurry. When [...] "Blue Demon Dwarf" [...] appears, Pete punches him, and the production crew rush in. The extra drifts {{in and out of consciousness}} before Gemma—having covered her face in blue paint after giving mouth-to-mouth—says he has died. Backstage, people wait for the police and ambulance; Terry is worried about his career, Anne wants to get away for some food and Amanda is keen to retrieve props from the corpse, but Pete and Gemma show some remorse. When alone, Terry looks to the <b>camera</b> <b>feed</b> and sees the extra standing in the séance room, and, relieved, runs to see him. Facing away from Terry and speaking in a rasping voice, the figure introduces himself as [...] "Spirit of Little Boy", and talks of a suicide after the embarrassment of wetting himself on television. After speaking to the [...] "boy", Terry believes that he himself is on Scaredy Cam, but no one is watching from backstage. When he touches the figure, the extra collapses, but a child's voice continues to shout. A corpse-like child (Wall) begins to rise from the cot used for Madam Talbot's doll. Backstage, Gemma and a police officer look for Terry. They find him in the séance room; he has wet himself, and insists that he is on Scaredy Cam. The child's face appears on the <b>camera</b> <b>feed.</b>|$|E
500|$|In post-production, Wan {{found he}} did not have enough shots or takes to work with as he was {{basically}} shooting rehearsals. Having a lot of missing gaps in the final product, he and editor Kevin Greutert created shots to mend together during editing; such as making a shot look like a surveillance <b>camera</b> <b>feed</b> and using still photographs. [...] "We did {{a lot of things to}} fill in gaps throughout the film. Whatever we cut to newspaper clippings and stuff like that, or we cut to surveillance cameras, or we cut to still photography within the film, which now people say, 'Wow, that's such a cool experimental style of filmmaking', we really did that out of necessity to fill in gaps we did not get during the filming," [...] he explained.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than nine}} {{helicopters}} eventually joined the chase; {{the high degree}} of media participation caused camera signals to appear on incorrect television channels. The chase was so long that one helicopter ran out of fuel, forcing its station to ask another for a <b>camera</b> <b>feed.</b> Radio station KNX also provided live coverage of the low-speed pursuit. USC sports announcer Pete Arbogast and station producer Oran Sampson contacted former USC coach John McKay to go on the air and encourage Simpson to end the pursuit. McKay agreed and asked Simpson to pull over and turn himself in instead of committing suicide; [...] "My God, we love you, Juice. Just pull over and I'll come out and stand by you all the rest of my life", he promised. LAPD detective Tom Lange, who had previously interviewed Simpson about the murders on June 13, realized that he had Simpson's cellular phone number and called him repeatedly. A colleague hooked a tape recorder up to Lange's phone and captured a conversation between Lange and Simpson in which Lange repeatedly pleaded with Simpson to [...] "throw the gun out [...] the window" [...] {{for the sake of his}} mother and children. Simpson apologized for not turning himself in earlier that day and responded that he was [...] "the only one who deserved to get hurt" [...] and was [...] "just gonna go with Nicole." [...] Cowlings' voice is overheard in the recording (after the Bronco had arrived at Simpson's home surrounded by police) pleading with Simpson to surrender and end the chase peacefully. During the pursuit and without having a chance to hear the taped phone conversation, Simpson's friend Al Michaels interpreted his actions as an admission of guilt.|$|E
