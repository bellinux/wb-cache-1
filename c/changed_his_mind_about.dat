5|$|Shackleton {{had given}} Mackintosh the {{impression}} that he would if possible attempt his crossing during the coming 1914–15 Antarctic season. Before departing for the Weddell Sea, he <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the feasibility of this timescale. Mackintosh was not informed of this change of plan; this misunderstanding led to the underprepared and near-chaotic depot-laying journeys of January–March 1915.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Hergé <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> {{moving to}} Argentina {{for reasons that}} remain unknown. Serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun culminated on 22 April 1948.

5|$|Furthermore, {{the late}} King had only insisted on that oath {{to protect the}} {{stability}} of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late King's royal steward, to swear that the King had <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 22 December.|$|E

5|$|In late 1933, he was {{employed}} at the Sheba Gold Mine at Baberton. He enjoyed the work {{so much he}} contemplated studying for a mining degree. Soon afterwards his interest in aviation was stimulated again {{by the arrival of}} a logistics aeroplane at the mine. He requested a flight which he enjoyed immensely. Consequently, Pattle <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> engineering and opted to find a career as a pilot.|$|E

The angels' wings to Mary's left are visible, but not those to the right, probably because of later overpainting.

5|$|Danish author Steen Steensen Blicher, {{an amateur}} {{archaeologist}} {{and one of}} the first to visit the site, made the first literary reference to the Haraldskær Woman. In 1836, he published his novella Gravhøjen which was a parody about a mistaken archaeological find. However, by 1841 Blicher seemed to have <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the Haraldskær Woman's identity when he wrote the poem Dronning Gunhild, a lament for the dead queen in the bog. In 1846, the Danish playwright Jens Christian Hostrup wrote his comedy, A Sparrow Doing a Crane Dance, (En Spurv i Tranedans), in which the ghost of Queen Gunnhild gives a magical ring to a scheming tailor and makes everyone blind to his actions. Hostrup's play indirectly satirized the theory that the Haraldskær Woman was Queen Gunnhild, and became the first major public endorsement of Worsaae’s hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} debut as a second-half {{substitute}} in Valencia's Champions League group-stage defeat {{at home to}} Chelsea, and started the next league match, another home defeat against Espanyol, but was selected only infrequently either by Quique Flores, who had signed him, or by successor Ronald Koeman. With the transfer window approaching, Koeman had given Žigić two weeks to convince him he was worth keeping. Prior to the Copa del Rey on 19 December, Valencia had not scored for six matches, and they were soon 1–0 down to third-tier opponents Real Union. Žigić came on and scored twice to turn the match around, and followed up with another goal three days later as Valencia came from behind to secure a 2–2 draw at Real Zaragoza. A mooted loan to English club Portsmouth fell through when Koeman <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the player leaving, but he made only nine league appearances (two starts) in {{what remained of the}} season, and was sent off in the first of those.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{business}} issues forced Tibbets's family {{to return to}} Alton, Illinois, where he graduated from Western Military Academy in 1933. He then attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta Chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity in 1934. During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami's Opa-locka Airport with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at Eastern Airlines. After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the University of Cincinnati after his second year to complete his pre-med studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only {{a year and a}} half as he <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> wanting to become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the United States Army and become a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps.|$|E
5|$|Keen to {{strengthen}} Bolton for a European push in the 2006–07 season, Allardyce signed France international striker Nicolas Anelka from Fenerbahçe for a club record £8million. He also signed Ivory Coast defender Abdoulaye Méïté from Marseille, {{and in an}} unusual sequence of events made a £400,000 profit on Dietmar Hamann, who <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> joining Bolton and signed with Manchester City a day after signing a pre-contract agreement with Bolton; Manchester City agreed to pay Bolton £400,000 in compensation. However Allardyce's relationship with chairman Phil Gartside became increasingly strained as Gartside refused to sanction greater transfer spending to finance a push for UEFA Champions League qualification. On 29 April 2007, Allardyce resigned with the club in fifth place with two {{games of the season}} left to play, and the following day his assistant Sammy Lee was announced as his replacement.|$|E

5|$|During {{the initial}} {{negotiations}} in the U.S. embassy, Chen did not request asylum in the United States or considered leaving China, but instead demanded to remain {{there as a}} free man. However, soon after leaving the embassy, Chen feared that Chinese authorities would renege on their promises or take punitive actions against his family members. While in the hospital, Chinese security personnel barred U.S. diplomatic staff from meeting with him. Rumors emerged that Chinese officials had coerced Chen into leaving the embassy by threatening his family. U.S. negotiators stated that while in the embassy, Chen {{had been told by}} Chinese officials that if he sought asylum in the United States, his wife and daughter would likely remain under house arrest in Shandong. However, they maintained that they had not heard of the threats from local officials that his family would be beaten, and that they had not communicated such a message to Chen. On 3 May, Chen clarified to the BBC that he had become aware of the threats against his family after leaving the embassy, and at that point <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> wishing to stay in China.|$|E
5|$|Page and MacLachlan flew to No. 96 Squadron RAF {{which was}} then flying de Havilland Mosquito night fighters. He {{requested}} his old gunner, Les Davies, who now piloted Mosquitos to join them. Davies accepted but MacLachlan was killed before he could take up the offer. MacLachlan and Page flew to Tangmere on 15 July. On his next mission on 18 July 1943 MacLachlan's Mustang FD442 was probably hit by ground fire when crossing the French coast near Dieppe. Page noticed MacLachlan's Mustang suddenly pull up sharply from their tree-top height by about 1,000 feet. He saw MacLachlan pull back the canopy but apparently <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> bailing out as the aircraft leveled out and descended. The Mustang then headed towards a small field. MacLachaln touched down three-quarters the way across and the Mustang ploughed into an orchard at the field's edge which ripped off the wings. Page orbited the crash site several times and considered landing to rescue him but the space was too confined. Page dived at the wreck and took gun-camera footage but could see no signs of life and then headed home. The Operations Record was unable to {{determine the cause of}} the crash. MacLachlan made no radio broadcast. It was possibly the result of enemy small-arms fire or mechanical failure. On 30 July MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E
