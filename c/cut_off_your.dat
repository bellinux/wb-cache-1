25|$|The {{environment}} in which the Inuit lived inspired a mythology filled with adventure tales of whale and walrus hunts. Long winter months of waiting for caribou herds or sitting near breathing holes hunting seals gave birth to stories of mysterious and sudden appearance of ghosts and fantastic creatures. Some Inuit looked into the aurora borealis, or northern lights, to find images of their family and friends dancing in the next life. However, some Inuit believed that the lights were more sinister and if you whistled at them, they would come down and <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>your</b> head. This tale is still told to children today. For others they were invisible giants, the souls of animals, a guide to hunting and as a spirit for the angakkuq to help with healing. They relied upon the angakkuq (shaman) for spiritual interpretation. The nearest thing to a central deity was the Old Woman (Sedna), who lived beneath the sea. The waters, a central food source, were believed to contain great gods.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the verses}} {{of the opening}} song [...] "Arabian Nights" [...] was altered {{following}} protests from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC). The lyrics were changed in July 1993 from [...] "Where they <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>your</b> ear if they don't like your face," [...] in the original release to [...] "Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense." [...] The change first appeared on the 1993 video release. The original lyric was intact on the initial CD soundtrack release, but the re-release uses the edited lyric. The rerecording has the original voice on all other lines and then a noticeably deeper voice says the edited line. The Broadway adaptation also uses the edited line. Entertainment Weekly ranked Aladdin in {{a list of the}} most controversial films in history, due to this incident. The ADC also complained about the portrayal of the lead characters Aladdin and Jasmine. They criticized the characters' Anglicized features and Anglo-American accents, in contrast to the other characters in the film, which are dark-skinned, have foreign accents and grotesque facial features, and appear villainous or greedy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993 ADC {{protested the}} {{characterization}} of Arabs and the song lyrics in the 1992 Disney film, Aladdin. In response, the offensive lyrics – [...] "Where they <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>your</b> ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but, hey, it's home" [...] – were changed to unoffensive ones – [...] "Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but, hey, it's home" [...] – for the 1993 video release. Due to this incident, Entertainment Weekly listed Aladdin {{as one of the}} most controversial films in history.|$|E
500|$|The {{intensity}} of passion, {{and the consequences}} of its manifestation, result in a stark contrast of vice and virtue. Bette and Valérie are pure wickedness, and even celebrate the ruin of their targets. As one critic says, [...] "life's truths are viewed in their most atrocious form". Mocking the use of the guillotine during the French Revolution while acknowledging her own malicious intent, Valérie says with regard to Delilah: [...] "La vertu coupe la tête, le Vice ne vous coupe que les cheveux." [...] ("Virtue <b>cuts</b> <b>off</b> <b>your</b> head; vice only <b>cuts</b> <b>off</b> <b>your</b> hair.") Hulot is not intentionally cruel, but his actions are no less devastating to the people around him.|$|R

[...] You report us with your mouth, and we <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>your</b> lips? [...] Who is to blame? [...] It is you! [...] The Bible says that if your hand, eye or mouth is at fault, it should be cut off." [...] While the {{government}} efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency.

2500|$|Islam Awazi {{released}} a video called [...] "We Are Coming O Buddhists" [...] (نحن قادمون أيّها البوذيون) of a TIP affiliated Uyghur cleric named Sheikh Abu Dhar 'Azzam who {{also called for}} the killing of Buddhists in addition to Chinese, saying in Arabic that [...] "Killing you...

( [...] إننا قوم نحب الموت كما تحبون الخمر والنساء، وإننا قادمون إن شاء الله، نحن نريد أن نقتل البوذيين في شرق الأرض وغربها.ـ), he also said [...] "those Chinese Buddhists, their small eyes, flat noses.

2500|$|Art Fern was the [...] "Tea Time Movie" [...] announcer, whose {{theme song}} was [...] "Hooray for Hollywood". Carson once {{admitted}} on camera {{that this was}} his favorite character, based on late-afternoon TV hosts who would deliver commercials throughout the movie. Each sketch usually featured three long commercials interrupted by silent, four-second clips from antique films. When the camera returned from each clip, Art was always caught off-guard and immediately reminded viewers that they were watching a film favorite. The movies always had unlikely casts and even less likely titles: [...] "Slim Pickens, Patti Page, Duke Wayne, and Charlton Heston in another classic Western: 'Kiss My Saddle Horn'!" [...] Carson originally played the fast-talking huckster in his own voice (as Honest Bernie Schlock or Ralph Willie), and finally settled on a nasal, high-pitched, smarmy drone, reminiscent of Jackie Gleason's [...] "Reginald Van Gleason III" [...] character. The character, now permanently known as Art Fern, wore a lavish toupee, loud jackets, and a pencil mustache. Actress Carol Wayne became famous for her 100-plus appearances (1971–1982) as Art's buxom assistant, the Matinée Lady. While Art gave his spiel, she would enter the stage behind him. Art would react to her attractive body by wincing, loudly shouting [...] "Ho— leeeee!" [...] and turning almost everything she said into a sexual double entendre. After Carol Wayne's death in 1985, Carson kept Art Fern off the air {{for most of the}} next year, and finally hired Danuta Wesley and then Teresa Ganzel to play the Matinée Lady. Carson also used these sketches to poke fun at the intricate Los Angeles interstate system, using a pointer and map to give confusing directions to shoppers, often including points where he would unfold the cardboard map to point out, via the appropriate picture, when the shopper would arrive at [...] "the fork in the road". Another freeway routine in the same theme centered on the [...] "Slauson Cutoff", a slang term Carson popularized to describe the truncated Marina Freeway (which ended abrubtly at Slauson Avenue in Culver City). Art Fern would advise drivers to take a series of freeways until they reached the Slauson Cutoff, and would then advise them to [...] "Get out of your car, <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>your</b> slauson, get back in your car," [...] often followed by peals of laughter from the audience, led by McMahon.|$|E

5000|$|Given {{the fact}} that such a large {{proportion}} of working poor households are headed by a single mother, one clear way to reduce working poverty would be to make sure that children's fathers share the cost of child rearing. In cases where the father cannot provide child support, scholars like Irwin Garfinkel advocate for the implementation of a child support guarantee, whereby the government pays childcare costs if the father cannot. Child support is not always a guarantee if the father or mother does not work. For example, if the parent without custody is not working then the parent with custody does not receive any child support unless the non working parent is employed at their job longer than 90 days, excluding if the non begins to work for its a city or government. Also, the government does not pay for childcare cost if you make more than the <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> range (<b>your</b> gross, per county or state.) ...|$|R
