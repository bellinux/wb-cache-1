40|$|We generalize our theorems in "Mirror Principle I" to a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>balloon</b> manifolds. Many of {{the results}} are proved for convex {{projective}} manifolds.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> {{languages}} is defined by a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> two-way deterministic <b>balloon</b> automata {{if and only if}} that class is closed under marked union, marked Kleene closure and the inverse mappings performed by deterministic GSMs that move two ways on the input. Hence, the context sensitive languages and various time and tape complexity classes are equivalent to <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> two-way deterministic <b>balloon</b> automata...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{establish}} rigorous existence theorems for {{a mathematical}} model of a thin inflated wrinkled membrane that is subjected to a shape dependent hydrostatic pressure load. We are motivated by the problem of determining the equilibrium shape of a strained high altitude large scientific balloon. This problem {{has a number of}} unique features. The balloon is very thin (20 - 30 µm), especially when compared with its diameter (over 100 meters). Unlike a standard membrane, the balloon is unable to support compressive stresses and will wrinkle or form folds of excess material. Our approach can be adapted {{to a wide variety of}} inflatable membranes, but we will focus on two types <b>of</b> high altitude <b>balloons,</b> a zero-pressure natural shape balloon and a super-pressure pumpkin shaped balloon. We outline the shape finding process for these two <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>balloon</b> designs, formulate the problem <b>of</b> a strained <b>balloon</b> in an appropriate Sobolev space setting, establish rigorous existence theorems using direct methods in the calculus of variations, and present numerical studies to complement our theoretical results. ...|$|R

Development of mechanical embolic protection devices (EPDs) has been associated with improved clinical outcomes and is now a strongly advocated adjunct to the procedure. Characteristically, EPDs have been broadly defined into 3 primary categories, of which the distal filter elements have largely been the most developed and used. Improvements among the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> proximal <b>balloon</b> occlusion devices with flow reversal have a number of theoretic advantages and are the focus of this review article...|$|R

40|$|The Mars Aerobot Validation Program (MABVAP) was {{initiated}} in August 1997 {{to develop and}} validate key technologies needed for aerobot missions on Mars. The major elements of the program are the development <b>of</b> <b>balloons</b> for flight on Mars, robust techniques for deployment and inflation and modeling and simulation <b>of</b> <b>balloon</b> flight paths, selection, development and tests <b>of</b> available <b>balloon</b> materials, design and fabrication <b>of</b> <b>balloons</b> (both superpressure and solar-heated), design and fabrication of deployment and inflation systems for aerial deployment, design and fabrication of avionics to control deployment/inflation process and to get telemetry and video data. The program includes laboratory, wind tunnel, vacuum chamber tests of the system components {{and a number of}} tropospheric and stratospheric flight tests of deployment and inflation <b>of</b> light-film <b>balloons</b> in a simulated Martian environment Key issues in the design include: the use of proven materials or their combinations; the availability <b>of</b> adequate <b>balloon</b> fabrication technologies and processes; evacuation of gas from the balloon prior to packaging and the design <b>of</b> a <b>balloon</b> container capable <b>of</b> storing the <b>balloon</b> over a wide range of ambient pressures.
