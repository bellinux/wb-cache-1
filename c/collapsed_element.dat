An interface element tailored for the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) was applied. Fixed cracks and moving cracks under dynamic loads were simulated. The results were compared to other VCCT-based analyses. With {{the implementation of a}} crack speed function within the element, it can be easily expanded to the cases of varying crack velocities, without convergence difficulty for all cases.

40|$|Considered are {{the details}} of a {{collapsed}} 27 node (singular) Lagrangian element for use in three-dimensional stress intensity factor calculations. The element is shown to capture both the 1 /root r singularity near the front as required for linear elastic fracture mechanics and a 1 /r singularity under a relaxed constraint for plastic fracture. It is shown that the radial and circumferential strains exhibit the singularity, but that direct strain along the front is zero, thus providing plane strain conditions. Of equal relevance is the quality of mesh at the front. For this we adopt a standard suite of elements comprising a number of singular 'wedge-shaped' elements around the crack tip {{in the form of a}} tube, with the major axis placed along the front.

40|$|The {{effect of}} using <b>collapsed</b> quarter-point <b>elements</b> (CQPE) in {{conjunction}} with the adaptive refinement procedure in solving crack problems is investigated. It is found that by using the <b>collapsed</b> quarter-point <b>elements</b> around the tip of the crack, the efficiency of the adaptive procedure can be increased considerably. The number of times of remeshing, and hence the computation time, required for achieving a solution with the same prescribed accuracy is much reduced. In addition, it is demonstrated that by using a simple swapping procedure to control the mesh layout surrounding the crack tip, it is possible to obtain highly accurate estimates of stress intensity factors by the adaptive refinement procedure. From the results of the uniform and adaptive finite element analysis on a set of problems, we conclude that in general there is no strong correlation between the relative error in energy norm of the solution and the relative percentage error of the stress intensity factors. The latter is much more dependent on the mesh geometry around the crack tip. © 1992. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Approach: Column jacketing, adding steel braces and new shear walls to an existing building are common strengthening methods used by practical engineers in North Cyprus to increase the performance level of an existing building. Results: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the most effective strengthening method among these three mentioned techniques. As a case study, a four stories RC existing building was selected and assessed using finite element method. To remodel of the existing building, the survey works done included three main steps, detecting the reinforcement bars for beams and columns, actual used concrete strength and soil type. The beams and columns reinforcement bars were determined using Ferro scan method and the soil was sampled in Girne city to determine the soil type. The actual concrete strength was determined using core test. Three common strengthening techniques mentioned above, were applied to the existing building. Then the efficiency of each strengthening method was investigated on the basis of removing of weak columns, not-safe beam-column joints in shear and performance levels based on the FEMA 356 and Turkish earthquake code. Conclusion/Recommendations: Results showed that column jacketing is the most effective method to remove the weak columns and not-safe column-beam joints in shear. Nonlinear static pushover results showed that despite that adding shear walls caused an increase in the structural base shear and a reduction in the maximum roof displacement and the number of <b>collapsed</b> <b>elements</b> at FEMA 356 performance point, but it caused a remarkable reduction in the building ductility ratio.

40|$|PLAN 2 D is a FORTRAN {{computer}} {{program for the}} plastic analysis of planar rigid frame structures. Given a structure and loading pattern as input, PLAN 2 D calculates the ultimate load that the structure can sustain before <b>collapse.</b> <b>Element</b> moments and plastic hinge rotations are calculated for the ultimate load. The location of hinges required for a collapse mechanism to form are also determined. The program proceeds in an iterative series of linear elastic analyses. After each iteration the resulting elastic moments in each member are compared to the reserve plastic moment capacity of that member. The member or members that have moments closest to their reserve capacity will determine the minimum load factor and {{the site where the}} next hinge is to be inserted. Next, hinges are inserted and the structural stiffness matrix is reformulated. This cycle is repeated until the structure becomes unstable. At this point the ultimate collapse load is calculated by accumulating the minimum load factor from each previous iteration and multiplying them by the original input loads. PLAN 2 D is based on the program STAN, originally written by Dr. E. L. Wilson at U. C. Berkeley. PLAN 2 D has several limitations: 1) Although PLAN 2 D will detect unloading of hinges it does not contain the capability to remove hinges; 2) PLAN 2 D does not allow the user to input different positive and negative moment capacities and 3) PLAN 2 D does not consider the interaction between axial and plastic moment capacity. Axial yielding and buckling is ignored as is the reduction in moment capacity due to axial load. PLAN 2 D is written in FORTRAN and is machine independent.

40|$|EDTA (5 mM at 37 °C and pH 7. 4 for 30 min) induces morphologic {{changes in}} the {{platelet}} surface-connected canalicular system (SCCS), in particular the collapse of some portions of the canaliculi. These <b>collapsed</b> <b>elements</b> {{are made up of}} two parallel limiting membranes and a central irregular striated zone, a pentalaminar organization that clearly resembles that of Langerhans cell Birbeck granules (BG). Such BG-like structures are also seen between adjacent platelets in EDTA-treated platelet microaggregates. EDTA is known to induce an irreversible dissociation of the platelet membrane glycoprotein(GP) IIb-IIIa, the αIIbβ 3 platelet-specific integrin, a calcium-dependent heterodimer that serves as an inducible receptor for fibrinogen and is essential for platelet aggregation. Hence, we looked for involvement of the GPIIb-IIIa in the formation of these BG-like modifications. We observed that these changes i) cannot be induced in type I Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, where the GPIIb-IIIa complexes are absent; ii) did not appear when human platelets were pre-incubated with MoAb anti-GPIIb-IIIa complex, which protected GPIIb-IIIa from EDTA-induced dissociation; iii) appeared only at alkaline pH and 37 °C, which corresponds to the range of pH and temperature where EDTA can dissociate the GPIIb-IIIa complexes; iv) are accompanied by the dissappearance on fluorescence flow cytometry analysis of the heterodimer specific epitopes; and v) do not appear in rat platelets at pH 7. 4 where G-PIIb-IIIa does not dissociate after EDTA treatment. Thus, the appearance of BG-like structures in the platelet SCCS is directly dependent on the EDTA-induced dissociation of the GPIIb-IIIa complexes. Furthermore, using gold-labeled MoAb concomitantly with the addition of EDTA, we observed that only GPIIb is present in the collapsed portions of the canaliculi. On Lowicryl thin sections essentially polyclonal antibodies to GPIIb labeled the central striated zone.

40|$|The static {{liquefaction}} tank (SL-tank) is {{a unique}} large-scale facility that provides a means to simulate the conditions of a submerged soil slope under failure conditions. Static liquefaction (SL) may {{be defined as a}} significant loss of soil’s shear strength due to a substantial development of excess pore water pressure under monotonic loads. This complex soil behavior is commonly related to case studies such as submarine flow slides. The main objective of this project is to use a finite element method (FEM) based on a Hypoplasticity (HP) framework to numerically simulate the experimental data obtained from the Static liquefaction tank facility of Delft University of Technology. A set of Elasto-Plastic (EP) constitutive models were chosen as an initial reference to simulate the SL-tank and afterwards compare their results to the HP framework. The numerical results were analyzed mainly in terms of excess pore water pressure and relating them to experimental data. Additionally, effective stresses, strains and stress paths were examined from the given model outputs. A fine-cohesion less soil called Geba sand was used in the experimental procedure of the SL-tank, as well as in elements tests performed within this study. The model parameter determination and calibrations were performed by means of element tests, empirical correlations, theoretical formulations, and best-fits from experimental data. Soil behavior at low stresses is of fundamental importance for the performed experiments and numerical simulations in this work. A potential instability behavior from the given numerical simulations was studied by means of an adopted instability line (IL). The IL criteria is a framework which is commonly illustrated in stress paths as a boundary that delimits a potential susceptibility to soil <b>collapse.</b> <b>Element</b> test data from fine-loose sands, as well as the numerical outputs from this work were used for estimating a potential IL applicable for the scope of this Master’s thesis project.
