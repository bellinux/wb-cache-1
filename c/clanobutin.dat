40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Although it {{is found}} in the Karoo, it always grows near water, eg. Near dams, streams, vleis etc. chiefly on {{alluvial}} soils, but also in calciferous and brackish areas. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: General: This is a many-branched, woody shrublet, growing up to 0, 5 m in height. It sometimes occurs as an invader. Leaves: Small narrow leaves are arranged opposite each other on pale yellowish branchlets that end in sharp spikes. The leaf base is clasping the stem. Flowers: The small yellowish to white flower heads are stalkless. Seed: The seed is small, oblong, without a crown of hairs or scales (pappus). TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Toxic principle unknown. Associated with secondary photosensitivity in sheep. Farmers’ name “vuursiekte” indicates they knew about it for many years. Plants only eaten when sheep are driven by necessity to do so. SYNDROMES: Hepatogenous photosensitivity due to liver parenchymal damage, Vuursiekte. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: LiverCLINICAL SIGNS: Sheep become sick from 3 – 7 days after exposure. Associated with secondary photosensitivity in sheep. Photodermatitis, icterus. Anorexia, rumen stasis. Confused with geeldikkop in some areas. NECROPSY: Clear macroscopic damage to liver. Liver is swollen friable and yellow brown. Accentuated lobulation – dark red zones in most gives a mosaic appearance. Icterus, gall bladder oedema. Nephrosis. TREATMENT: Can try choleretics, i. e. <b>clanobutin.</b> Antihistamines, antibiotics. Place in shade, dose activated charcoal. Diet low in chlorophyll (good quality hay). Skin protectant creams.

40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Grass- and bushveld, mainly Pretoria/Magaliesburg area. Botanical description: General: A shrub, 0, 5 - 1 m high, {{with many}} {{branches}} spreading from ground level. All parts strongly aromatic, smelling like lemon peel. Young stems quadrangular, becoming more round with age - they are slightly hairy and rough to the touch. Leaves: The leaves are opposite, with toothed margins and rough surfaces. Flowers: The small, yellowish white flowers are grouped in compact round flower heads, which are borne on long stalks (± 5 cm) in the leaf axils. Spring - summer. Fruit: The fruit {{is small and}} two-chambered with one seed in each chamber. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: • Icterogenins and rhemannic acid are also pentacyclic, triterpene acids like lantadene. • The toxicity {{is very similar to}} that of Lantana camara. Mechanism of action: • Alters permeability of liver cell membranes and leads to intrahepatic cholestasis with relatively little damage to liver cells. • Also paralyses smooth muscle of gall bladder - can’t contract and bile accumulation may cause erosion. • Phylloerythrin concentration increases in the circulation. SYNDROMES: Hepatogenous photosensitivity primarily due to liver parenchymal damage. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Liver. CLINICAL SIGNS: • Clinical signs very similar to Lantanta camara poisoning. • Mainly a cattle problem. Sheep are also susceptible, but seldom eat it. Goats may eat it. • Secondary photosensitivity - hairless areas i. e. muzzle and perineal area, also unpigmented areas. • Marked icterus. • Rumen stasis, constipation - may have diarrhoea. NECROPSY: Macroscopical findings: 1. Secondary photosensitivity skin lesions 2. Yellow to orange brown liver with enormously enlarged gall bladder with oedematous wall containing straw-coloured to dark green bile. 3. Nephrosis 4. Impaction of caecum and colon. HISTOPATHOLOGY: • Relatively mild changes in liver and kidney. TREATMENT: • Can try choleretics, i. e. <b>clanobutin</b> • Antihistamines • Antibiotics • Place in shade • Dose activated charcoal • Diet low in chlorophyll (good quality hay) • Skin protectant creams.

40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Originally from Central and South America, {{it is now}} {{a serious}} invading plant. More {{commonly}} found in the moist eastern parts of the country. Often cultivated as a garden subject. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: General: A bushy shrub or untidy scrambler. The branches are ridged or four- angled and generally covered with short stiff hairs and recurved prickles. Leaves: The dark green leaves have toothed margins, are rough to the touch on the upper surface and slightly hairy beneath. They smell strongly when crushed. Flowers: Compact flower heads with tubular flowers coloured from red, orange, mauve to white. Usually a mixture of 2 or more of these colours. September - April. Fruit: Round, black berries in a cluster, ± 5 mm in diameter, containing a stone with two seeds. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: • Very similar to that of Lippia rehmannii • Pentacyclic, triterpene acids such as lantadene. Mechanism of action: • Alters permeability of liver cell membranes and leads to intrahepatic cholestasis with relatively little damage to liver cells. • Also paralyses smooth muscle of gall bladder - can’t contract - bile accumulation may cause erosion. • Phylloerythrin concentration increases in circulation. SYNDROMES: Hepatogenous photosensitivity primarily due to liver parenchymal damage. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Liver. CLINICAL SIGNS: • Mainly a cattle problem. • Goats may eat it. • Sheep are also susceptible, but seldom eat it. • Secondary photosensitivity - unpigmented areas, hairless areas, i. e. muzzle, and perineal area. • Marked icterus. • Rumen stasis, constipation - may have diarrhea. NECROPSY: Macroscopical findings: • Secondary photosensitivity skin lesions• Yellow to orange brown liver with enormously enlarged gall bladder with oedematous wall containing straw-coloured to dark green bile. • Nephrosis • Impaction of caecum and colon. HISTOPATHOLOGY: Cellular degeneration and necrosis in liver and kidney. TREATMENT: • Can try choleretics, i. e. <b>clanobutin.</b> • Antihistamines • Antibiotics • Place in shade • Dose activated charcoal • Diet low in chlorophyll (good quality hay) • Skin protectant creams. PREVENTION AND ERADICATION: • Avoid infected veld at danger periods. • Eradication difficult - spread by birds. • Herbicides: “Round-up” (glyphosate), “Tordon” (picloram) effective, but expensive.
