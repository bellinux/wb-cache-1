40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the viability of}} a passive variable pitch propeller for small aerial Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV’s) and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS’s) using a self adjusting mechanical pitch control mechanism. The work described in this paper includes the design and testing of a mechanical pitch change mechanism based on a <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> <b>spring</b> for an off-the-shelf propeller. A propeller performance prediction code, based on the vortex lattice method, in combination with a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize a propeller for given motor performance data. The optimization process includes results for both single point and multipoint design optimization efforts. Background Fixed pitch propellers have been used {{since the beginning of}} powered flight and are still used today because of their simplicity and weight advantage. One of the pitfalls of fixed pitch propellers is that they operate efficiently only at one propeller speed and one flight speed. Efforts on variable pitch propeller design started with the Frenchman named J. Croce-Spinelli in 1871. But it took the effort of several more inventors i...|$|E
40|$|Spring brake {{orthosis}} (SBO) concentrates purely on {{the knee}} to generate the swing phase of the paraplegic gait with the required hip flexion occurring passively {{as a consequence of}} the ipsilateral knee flexion, generated by releasing the torsion spring mounted at the knee joint. Electrical stimulation then drives the knee back to full extension, as well as restores the spring potential energy. In this paper, genetic algorithm (GA) and its variant multi-objective GA (MOGA) is used to perform the search operation for the ‘best’ spring parameters for the SBO spring mounted on an average sized subject simulated in the sagittal plane. Conventional torsion spring is tested against constant torque type spring in terms of swing duration as, based on first principles, it is hypothesized that <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> <b>spring</b> would be able to produce slower SBO swing phase as might be preferred in assisted paraplegic gait. In line with the hypothesis, it is found that it is not possible to delay the occurrence of the flexion peak of the SBO swing phase further than its occurrence in the natural gait. The use of conventional torsion spring causes the swing knee flexion peak to appear rather faster than that of the natural gait, resulting in a potentially faster swing phase and hence gait cycle. The constant torque type spring on the other hand is able to stretch duration of the swing phase to some extent, rendering it the preferable spring type in SBO...|$|E

50|$|The soil {{mechanics}} surface sampler {{was designed to}} dig, scrape, and trench the lunar surface and to transport lunar surface material while being photographed so that {{the properties of the}} lunar surface could be determined. The sampler was mounted below the television camera and consisted primarily of a scoop approximately 120 mm long and 50 mm wide. The scoop consisted of a container, a sharpened blade, and an electric motor to open and close the container. A small footpad was attached to the scoop door to present a flat surface to the lunar surface. The scoop was capable of holding a maximum quantity of approximately 32 mm diameter of solid lunar material and a maximum of 100 cm³ of granular material. The scoop was mounted on a pantograph arm that could be extended about 1.5 m or retracted close to the spacecraft motor drive. The arm could also be moved from an azimuth of +40 to -72 degrees or be elevated 130 mm by motor drives. It could also be dropped onto the lunar surface under force provided by gravity and a spring. The surface sampler performed seven bearing tests, four trench tests, and 13 impact tests. The total operating time was 18 hours, 22 minutes on 10 separate occasions. Measurements of motor currents and forces applied to the surface were not obtained due to the state of the spacecraft telemetry following landing on the lunar surface. However, estimations were possible. The small <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> of the <b>torque</b> <b>spring</b> precluded the determination of density from the impact tests. Penetrations of 38 to 50 mm were obtained from the bearing tests, and a 175 mm depth was reached during trenching operations. The design of the mechanism and its electronic auxiliary was more than adequate for the lunar surface operations.|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{improved}} continuous-time model predictive control (CTMPC) of permanent magnetic synchronous motors (PMSMs) for a wide-speed range, including the <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> {{region and the}} flux-weakening (FW) region. In the <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> region, the mathematic models of PMSMs in dq-axes are decoupled without the limitation of DC-link voltage. However, in the FW region, the mathematic models of PMSMs in dq-axes are cross-coupled together with the limitation of DC-link voltage. A nonlinear PMSMs mathematic model in the FW region is presented based on the voltage angle. The solving of the nonlinear mathematic model of PMSMs in FW region will lead to heavy computation load for digital signal processing (DSP). To overcome such a problem, a linearization method of the voltage angle is also proposed to reduce the computation load. The selection of transiting points between the <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> region and FW regions is researched to improve {{the performance of the}} driven system. Compared with the proportional integral (PI) controller, the proposed CTMPC has obvious advantages in dealing with systems’ nonlinear constraints and improving system performance by restraining overshoot current under step torque changing. Both simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving good steady-state performance and smooth switching between the <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> and FW regions...|$|R
40|$|Over 0. 9 % of the {{population}} suffers from a movement disorder. The pathophysiology of most movement disorders remains unknown, thereby impairing effective diagnosis and consequently effective treatment. Abnormal activity of the cerebellum (CBL) and basal ganglia (BG) has been implicated in many movement disorders, including Parkinsonian tremor and dystonia. Selectively activating these brain regions may help identify pathological changes and expedite diagnosis. Dedicated pairs of isometric wrist flexion tasks with and without visual feedback of the exerted torque were devised to selectively activate the CBL and BG in healthy subjects (N= 5), while ensuring safety and keeping artifacts to a minimum. Increased activity in CBL and BG (putamen) was found during a <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> task with visual feedback compared to a <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> task without visual feedback. Increased BG (caudate nucleus) activity was found when comparing a torque task with visual feedback where flexion and rest were rapidly alternated, to the same task without visual feedback. Increased activity in the CBL was found during a <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> task with visual feedback with an added visual error compared to a <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> task with normal visual feedback. This study shows that specific pairs of motor tasks using the wrist and simple MR-compatible equipment allow for targeted activation of CBL and BG and paves the way for more extensive research and eventually improved diagnosis of patients.

The primary of the machine was supplied from a three-phase voltage regulator which in addition to producing a motoring torque can also provide plug braking by phase reversal and dynamic braking by d. c. injection. The hoist drive characteristics are of a <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> nature and these were obtained by the control of a variable duty cycle forced commutated thyristor chopper in the secondary circuit of the motor. The operation of the voltage regulator has been examined for a load consisting of a delta wound induction motor.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the direct torque control (DTC) techniques, implemented in four- and six-switch inverter, for brushless dc (BLDC) motors with non-sinusoidal back- EMF using two and three-phase conduction modes. First of all, the classical direct torque control of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with sinusoidal back-EMF {{is discussed in}} detail. Secondly, the proposed two-phase conduction mode for DTC of BLDC motors is introduced in the <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> region. In this control scheme, only two phases conduct at any instant of time using a six-switch inverter. By properly selecting the inverter voltage space vectors of the two-phase conduction mode from a simple look-up table the desired quasi-square wave current is obtained. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} achieve DTC of a BLDC motor drive with faster torque response while the stator flux linkage amplitude is deliberately kept almost constant by ignoring the flux control in the <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> region. Third, the avarege current controlled boost power factor correction (PFC) method is applied to the previously discussed proposed DTC of BLDC motor drive in the <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> region. The test results verify that the proposed PFC for DTC of BLDC motor drive improves the power factor from 0. 77 to about 0. 9997 irrespective of the load. Fourth, the DTC technique for BLDC motor using four-switch inverter in the <b>constant</b> <b>torque</b> region is studied. For effective torque control in two phase conduction mode, a novel switching pattern incorporating the voltage vector look-up table is designed and implemented for four-switch inverter to produce the desired torque characteristics.
