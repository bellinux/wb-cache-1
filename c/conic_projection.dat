This problem is ill-posed and prior information must therefore be used to regularize the solution. We restrict ourselves to methods that are able to handle the sparseness and the non-negativity that caracterize a iodinated vascular structure: the Extreme Value Technique and related methods, and the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique. The results we obtained led us to derive a new method based on a two steps detection-estimation scheme. 1. INTRODUCIYION Reconstructing a three-dimensional (3 -D) object from a set of its 2 -D <b>conic</b> <b>projections</b> is an inverse problem which cannot be considered as an elementary extension of what is commonly done today in 2 -D standard CT. The 3 -D problem arises specific theoretical and computational difficulties. The inversion of the analytical relationship between a 3 -D function and its divergent beam X-ray transforml, either directly or through a transform (3 -D Fourier transform, 3 -D Radon transform), requires conditions on the trajectory of the source. But the sufficient conditions given in,litterature 2 r 3 t 4 are unrealistic in the case of medical applications. For example, the Tuy’s condition, which is the less restrictive, states tha...|$|R
