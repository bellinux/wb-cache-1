5|$|The {{first modern}} {{biography}} of Tubman {{to be published}} after Sarah Hopkins Bradford's 1869 and 1886 books was Earl Conrad's Harriet Tubman (retitled Harriet Tubman: Negro Soldier and Abolitionist in some later printings). Conrad had experienced great difficulty in finding a publisher – the search took four years – and endured disdain and contempt for his efforts to construct a more objective, detailed account of Tubman's life for adults. Several highly dramatized versions of Tubman's life had been written for children, and many more came later, but Conrad wrote in an academic style to document the historical importance of her work for scholars and the nation's memory. The book was finally published by Carter G. Woodson's Associated Publishers in 1943. Despite her popularity and significance, another Tubman biography for adults did not appear for 60 years, until Jean Humez published a <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> of Tubman's life stories in 2003, and Larson and Clinton both published their biographies in 2004. Author Milton C. Sernett discusses all the major biographies of Tubman in his 2007 book Harriet Tubman: Myth, Memory, and History.|$|E

25|$|In 1918, {{nationalisation}} {{was seen}} by many voters as akin to modernisation – the nationalisation of the railways was a widely supported policy, for instance, as it would reduce the plethora of uncoordinated and competing companies. This text is usually assumed to involve nationalisation of the whole economy but <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> of the text shows {{that there are many}} other possible interpretations. Common ownership, though later given a technical meaning by the 1976 Industrial Common Ownership Act, could mean municipal ownership, worker cooperatives or consumer cooperatives.|$|E

25|$|Divine {{judgment}} by God {{was passed}} upon Sodom and Gomorrah and two neighboring cities, which were completely consumed by fire and brimstone. Neighboring Zoar (Bela) {{was the only}} city to be spared. In Abrahamic religions, Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of divine retribution. Sodom and Gomorrah have been used historically and today as metaphors for vice and homosexuality, although a <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> {{of the text and}} other Ancient Near Eastern sources suggest that this association may be incorrect.|$|E
25|$|The Fugitive Movement {{similarly}} influenced Brooks' {{approach to}} criticism. The Fugitives, {{a group of}} Southern poets consisting of such influential writers as John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, Donald Davidson, and Robert Penn Warren, met Saturday evenings to read and discuss poetry written {{by members of the}} group (Singh 1991). The discussion was based on intensive readings and included considerations of a poem's form, structure, meter, rhyme scheme, and imagery (Singh 1991). This <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> formed the foundation on which the New Critical movement was based and helped shape Brooks' approach to criticism (Singh 1991).|$|E
25|$|Since theorists of {{literature}} often draw {{on a very}} heterogeneous tradition of Continental philosophy and the philosophy of language, any classification of their approaches is only an approximation. There are many types of literary theory, which take different approaches to texts.

25|$|Well-versed in {{the pagan}} {{philosophy}} of the Greco-Roman world, Augustine both criticized its perceived shortcomings, and employed it to articulate the message of Christianity. Although open to the study and <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> of his fellow African writer, Apuleius (c. 125–185), a pagan thaumaturge, Augustine strongly criticized his understanding of spiritual phenomena. In a well-known work, The City of God, Augustine embarks on wide-ranging discussions of Christian theology, and also applies his learned views to history. He harshly criticizes the ancient state religion of Rome, yet frankly admires traditional Roman civic virtues; in fact he opines that their persistent practice found favor with God (unknown in name to them), hence {{the progress of the}} Roman cause throughout the Mediterranean. Later he traces the history of Israel as guided by God, and searches out the gospels of Christianity.|$|E
25|$|The {{main source}} for the {{practice}} of agriculture in the period is Hesiod's Works and Days, which gives the impression of very small subsistence holdings in which the owner performed most of the labour personally; <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> reveals that much of the produce is to be sold for profit, much of the work to be performed by slaves (douloi or dmoes), and much of the owner's time to be spent away from the farm. Slaves' labour was supplemented by labourers who worked for a wage, as sharecroppers (called hektemoroi at Athens), or to pay off debts; this practice seems to have increased in the eighth century as the growth of the population increased the number of works available, and intensified in the seventh century with the development of legally enforced debts and the status of the labourers increasingly becoming a source of social strife.|$|E
25|$|New Bearings in English Poetry was {{the first}} major volume of {{criticism}} Leavis was to publish, and it provides insight into his own critical positions. He has been frequently (but often erroneously) associated with the American school of New Critics, a group which advocated <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> and detailed textual analysis of poetry over, or even instead of, an interest in the mind and personality of the poet, sources, the history of ideas and political and social implications. Although there are undoubtedly similarities between Leavis's approach to criticism and that of the New Critics (most particularly in that both take the work of art itself as the primary focus of critical discussion), Leavis is ultimately distinguishable from them, since he never adopted (and was explicitly hostile to) a theory of the poem as a self-contained and self-sufficient aesthetic and formal artifact, isolated from the society, culture and tradition from which it emerged. New Bearings, devoted principally to Gerard Manley Hopkins, William Butler Yeats, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, was an attempt to identify the essential new achievements in modern poetry. It also discussed at length and praised the work of Ronald Bottrall, whose importance was not to be confirmed by readers and critics.|$|E

500|$|Fränger's thesis stimulated {{others to}} examine The Garden more closely. Writer Carl Linfert also senses the joyfulness {{of the people}} in the center panel, but rejects Fränger's {{assertion}} that the painting is a [...] "doctrinaire" [...] work espousing the [...] "guiltless sexuality" [...] of the Adamite sect. While the figures engage in amorous acts without any suggestion of the forbidden, Linfert points to the elements in the center panel suggesting death and temporality: some figures turn away from the activity, seeming to lose hope in deriving pleasure from the passionate frolicking of their cohorts. Writing in 1969, E. H Gombrich drew on a <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> of Genesis and the Gospel According to Saint Matthew to suggest that the central panel is, according to Linfert, [...] "the state of mankind on the eve of the Flood, when men still pursued pleasure with no thought of the morrow, their only sin the unawareness of sin." ...|$|E
500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly {{called the}} novel a [...] "big-hearted, restless story" [...] and rated it an A minus. Lisa Zeidner of The Washington Post opined that Middlesex [...] "provides not only incest à la Ada and a Lolita-style road trip, but enough dense detail to keep fans of <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> manically busy." [...] Tami Hoag of People concurred, writing that [...] "this feast {{of a novel}} is thrilling in the scope of its {{imagination}} and surprising in its tenderness". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon agreed, praising Middlesex as an [...] "epic and wondrous" [...] novel filled with numerous characters and historical occurrences. Mendelsohn praised Middlesex for its [...] "dense narrative, interwoven with sardonic, fashionably postmodern commentary." [...] However, he criticized the novel as a disjointed hybrid. He wrote Eugenides was successful {{with the story of}} the Greek immigrants, which he described as [...] "authenti", but mishandled the hermaphrodite material, which Mendelsohn characterized as [...] "unpersuasiv". The Economist review stated that a more concise, concentrated depiction of hermaphroditism would have made the book more [...] "fun to read". Jeff Zaleski of Publishers Weekly praised Eugenides' portrayal of the girl, Callie, and the man Cal. Zaleski wrote that [...] "t's difficult to imagine any serious male writer of earlier eras so effortlessly transcending the stereotypes of gender." [...] Paul Quinn of Contemporary Literary Criticism commended the novel, writing: [...] "That Eugenides manages to move us without sinking into sentiment shows how successfully he has avoided the tentacles of irony which grip so many writers of his generation." [...] Christina McCarroll of The Christian Science Monitor wrote that [...] "Eugenides wrangles with a destiny that mutates and recombines like restless chromosomes, in a novel of extraordinary flexibility, scope, and emotional depth." ...|$|E
