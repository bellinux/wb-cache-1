40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to provide training in the preservation, processing, quality control and marketing of crops grown by rural women and members of farm families. Further, the project was to introduce new, locally processed, agriculture-based products to the retail market, and to increase the demand for Barbadian productsThe project provided international expertise, demonstration equipment, and funds to cover operating expenses {{and the production of}} training materials and teaching aids. More particularly, a technical manual was prepared on the range of indigenous products suitable for small-scale processing. Thirty-four participants attended the project's training course from February to April 1991, where weekly sessions concentrated on food processing and preservation techniques, in particular the use of dehydration, heat sterilization, vinegar, salt, sugar and oil. Products included cucumber and beet pickles, mango nectar and mango chutney, tomato puree, peeled tomatoes, bajan sauce made of tomatoes and okra, mango and guava leather, guava jelly, sorrel jam and sorrel drink, and eggplant preserved in oil. The course also focused on economic questions and how to set up feasibility studies. Finally, training included a look into the issue of quality control, and the specifications and laboratory instruments needed to ensure standards are metBased on the experience gained during the project, it was concluded that the use of appropriate, simple and effective technology, based on modern and standardized techniques, would result in profitable processing operations. The several thriving small-scale industries producing good-quality seasonings and hot pepper sauces are a case in pointIn transferring knowledge of appropriate technologies to rural women, the project demonstrated how other agricultural products might be processed and preserved. In teaching the basic economics of developing small-scale industries and introducing new products, the project demonstrated the importance of conducting feasibility studies and calculating production costs and retail prices, before moving into the world of commerceA number of constraints became apparent during the project: {{there was a lack of}} processing and laboratory equipment, suitable raw materials for processing, and packaging materials. Finally, there was also a need for agro-processing advisory and extension servicesIn order that the <b>cottage</b> <b>industries</b> may contribute to agricultural development in Barbados, it was recommended that an Advisory Service for Agro-Processing be formed under the Barbados Agricultural Development Corporation, and that this Service then provide advice on appropriate processing and laboratory equipment, training, raw materials for processing, production of new varieties, and packaging. Furthermore, the proposed Service should promote traditional processed products and new products, strengthen the Barbados Agricultural Development Corporation's Extension Service to provide advice to persons involved in processing at the cottage level, disseminate technical information through the Extension Service, promote small commercial enterprise, and provide advice on marketing opportunities, feasibility studies and credit channels.

5000|$|In 1900, P. Mitter asked Shashida to {{send him}} some young men of character. It was the moment when Mitter was busy {{founding}} the Kolkata Anushilan Samiti and knew Shashida’s popularity among the college students. Shashida sent him Satish Mukherjee, Nibaran Bhattacharya, Indranath Nandi, Nikhileshvar Ray Maulik. And he personally introduced Jatindranath Mukherjee alias Bagha Jatin, who had already known Mitter during a meeting around Kakuzo Okakura at Surendranath Tagore’s house. Meanwhile, invited by Brahmabandhav, on 6 January 1902, Shashida joined the first batch of teachers at the new boarding school established by Rabindranath Tagore at Santiniketan, along with Jagadananda Ray, Revachand Makhijani, Shivadhan Vidyarnav, Subodhchandra Majumdar and Manoranjan Banerjee. In March 1902, Shashida {{had to return to}} Kolkata for the inauguration of the Anushilan Samiti. Soon, with the coming of Jatin Banerjee alias Niralamba, Mitter {{was under the impression that}} the organisation was taking too much of a military turn, while Banerjee disagreed with Barin Ghose’s untimely terrorist enterprise. In the midst of this tension, Shashida and Bagha Jatin served as mediators. Coming from Baroda, in 1903, Sri Aurobindo at Yogendra Vidyabhushan’s place, tried to settle the disputes, and discussed with Bagha Jatin and Banerjee his programme for Bengal. Very soon, Banerjee chose to set out for Upper India, where he continued his work as a revolutionary missionary.The Anushilan Samiti, under Shashida’s guidance, opened in Kolkata the Shramajivi Vidyalay or [...] "Working Men’s Institution" [...] where evening classes attracted people who had no means to be educated. Many poor students, too, received there supplementary coaching in various subjects. The Samiti also recruited volunteers for social services such as nursing the sick; cremating; sell handmade soaps, padlocks from Shashida’s village and <b>cottage</b> <b>industry</b> <b>products,</b> on a cooperative basis; organise significant public functions as the Shivaji, Pratapaditya and Sitaram festivals. This was the prototype of the well-known Chatra-bhandar or [...] "Students’ Store" [...] and, later, of the Shramajivi Samavaya run by Amarendranath Chatterjee and other associates of Bagha Jatin.Probably as the Party’s emissary, Shashida went to Mungheyr in Bihar towards the end of 1904 and, encouraged by Nimdhari Singh and other regional leaders, he opened a model school. Then, in 1905, he went to Orissa, and inspired Utkalamani Gopabandhu Das to start a physical culture centre at Bhubaneswar, in collaboration with Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Misra, Acharya Harihar Das and Godavarish Misra. This was the beginning of the Satyavadi Vidyalaya, founded near Puri in 1909. Alerted by Shashida about the terrible flood in Orissa, in 1908, P. Mitter sent a relief delegation headed by Naren Bhattacharya alias M.N. Roy and Harikumar Chakravarti, two direct recruits of the restless Vedic scholar and radical leader Mokshada Charan Samadhyai.|$|R

The study scrutinises, who promoted <b>cottage</b> <b>industries</b> and what their cultural, social, and ideological backgrounds were, and how they influenced the construction of <b>cottage</b> <b>industry</b> policy. Research work builds on the microhistorical research angle making use of textual details in the 1949 committee report.

Especially {{in the aftermath of the}} WWII, <b>cottage</b> <b>industry</b> was essentially conceived of as a cultural political measure to balance the society facing large settlement and land acquisition projects by creating a sense of cultural continuity through the means of domestic craft practices.

30|$|Article 40 of the Mozambican National Forest and Wildlife Law criminalizes {{fires that}} destroy {{all or part}} of forests, bush, thicket, or savanna, and {{requires}} offenders to serve one year in prison and pay corresponding fines (Serra and Chicue 2005). This no-burn policy does not distinguish between wildfires and controlled burns. Limited manpower and transport make it difficult for Matutúine District administration and REM staff to enforce this law. As a result, residents of Matutúine District communities are not punished for using controlled burns to clear agricultural fields. Non-governmental organizations, like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) and the Swiss development group Helvetas, have been more successful in encouraging a no-burn policy as part of their assistance packages. In Madjadjane and Gala, the IUCN and Helvetas are working with residents to build ecotourism lodges and develop a <b>cottage</b> <b>industry</b> for local <b>products</b> such as honey and woodcarvings. “People have been told burning is very bad. It destroys nature, the animals suffer” [REM guard B, Madjadjane].

The main risk that is being faced by this industry is from the factory based medium or large industries which are again capital intensive in nature. This is because of the fact that these large industries utilize all sorts of cost effective technologies which enable them to supply the products at low price. On the other hand, The <b>Cottage</b> <b>Industry</b> is basically labour intensive and utilizes traditional techniques in production process which are generally not cost effective in nature which escalates the price of their product.
