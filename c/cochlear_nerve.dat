5|$|The {{vestibulocochlear nerve}} (VIII) splits into the {{vestibular}} and <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerve.</b> The vestibular part {{is responsible for}} innervating the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear; this structure transmits information about balance, and {{is an important component}} of the vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> transmits information from the cochlea, allowing sound to be heard.|$|E
25|$|Auditory canal {{decompression}} {{is another}} surgical technique that can prolong usable hearing when a vestibular schwannoma has grown {{too large to}} remove without damage to the <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerve.</b> In the IAC (internal auditory canal) decompression, a middle fossa approach is employed to expose the bony roof of the IAC without any attempt to remove the tumor. The bone overlying the acoustic nerve is removed, allowing the tumour to expand upward into the middle cranial fossa. In this way, pressure on the <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> is relieved, {{reducing the risk of}} further hearing loss from direct compression or obstruction of vascular supply to the nerve.|$|E
25|$|Cochlear {{implants}} bypass most of {{the peripheral}} auditory system which receives sound and converts that sound into movements of hair cells in the cochlea; the inside-portion of these hair cells release potassium ions {{in response to the}} movement of the hairs, and the potassium in turn stimulates other cells to release the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which makes the <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> send signals to the brain, which creates the experience of sound. Instead, the devices pick up sound and digitize it, convert that digitized sound into electrical signals, and transmit those signals to electrodes embedded in the cochlea. The electrodes electrically stimulate the <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerve,</b> causing it to send signals to the brain.|$|E

40|$|The vestibular, <b>cochlear</b> {{and facial}} <b>nerves</b> {{have a common}} course in the {{internal}} auditory canal (IAC). In this study we investigated {{the average number of}} nerve fibres, the average cross-sectional areas of the nerves and nerve fibres, and the apparent connections between the facial, <b>cochlear</b> and vestibular <b>nerve</b> bundles within the IAC, using light and scanning electron microscopy. The anatomical localization of the nerves within the IAC was not straightforward. The general course showed that the nerves rotated anticlockwise in the right ear from the inner ear end towards the brainstem end and vice versa for the left ear. The average number of fibres forming vestibular, <b>cochlear,</b> and facial <b>nerves</b> was not constant during their courses within the IAC. The superior and the inferior vestibular nerves showed {{an increase in the number}} of nerve fibres from the inner ear end towards the brainstem end of the IAC, whereas the facial and the <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerves</b> showed a reduction in the number of fibres. This suggests that some of the superior and inferior vestibular nerve bundles may receive fibres from the facial and/or <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerves.</b> Scanning electron microscopic evaluations showed superior vestibular–facial and inferior vestibular–cochlear connections within the IAC, but no facial–cochlear connections were observed. Connections between the nerves of the IAC can explain the unexpected vestibular disturbances in facial paralysis or persistence of tinnitus after cochlear neurectomy in intractable tinnitus cases. The present study offers morphometric and scanning electron microscopic data on the fibre connections of the nerves of the IAC...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{development}} of cochlear implantation has al-lowed {{the majority of}} patients deafened after the {{development of}} language to regain significant auditory benefit. In a subset of patients, however, loss of hearing results from destruction of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerves,</b> rendering <b>cochlear</b> implantation ineffec-tive. The {{most common cause of}} bilateral destruction of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerves</b> is neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2). The hall-mark of this genetic disorder is the development of bilateral acoustic neuromas, the growth or removal of which causes deafness in most patients. Patients with NF 2 may benefit from direct stimulation of the cochlear nucleus. We describe the devel-opment, use, and results of the auditory brainstem implant (ABI), which is typically implanted via craniotomy at the time of tumor removal. Most patients with the implant have good appreciation of environmental sounds, but obtain more modest benefit with regard to speech perception. The majority of patients make use of the implant to facilitate lip reading; some can, to varying degrees, comprehend speech directly. We discuss future directions in cen-tral implants for hearing, including the penetrating ABI, the use of ABI in nontumor patients, and the auditory midbrain implant. Ke...|$|R

The magnetic resonance imaging revealed only two nerves in each inner auditory canal: one in the anterior superior quadrant, identified as the facial nerve, and one on the posterior quadrants, representing both the superior and inferior vestibular nerves.

2500|$|Auditory evoked {{potential}} {{can be used}} to trace the signal generated by a sound through the ascending auditory pathway.

2500|$|The most {{sophisticated}} {{of these devices}} is the cochlear implant, which can sometimes restore {{a high level of}} auditory function even when natural hearing is totally lost. However, the amount of destruction to the <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> caused by the typical NF2 schwannoma often precludes the use of such an implant. In these cases, an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) can restore a primitive level of hearing, which, when supplemented by lip reading, can restore a functional understanding of spoken language.|$|E

40|$|Intraoperative {{monitoring}} of neurophysiologic function is rapidly evolving {{as an important}} adjunct during skull base surgery to {{reduce the incidence of}} neurologic deficit. Facial nerve monitoring is an excellent model, since electrical and mechanical evoked potentials can be directly presented to the surgeon in real-time through an acoustic loudspeaker display. The lower cranial nerves may also be monitored using similar electromyographic techniques. Auditory system monitoring is more difficult due to the low amplitude response that requires averaging and filtering to extract the evoked potential. In conjunction with auditory monitoring, improved hearing preservation may be further enhanced by concomitant facial nerve monitoring, since the surgeon is alerted to traumatic manipulations that may affect both facial and <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerves.</b> Techniques and interpretative issues are presented to maximize the efficacy and safety of cranial nerve monitoring...|$|R

2500|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} otitis externa, MOE requires oral or intravenous antibiotics for cure. Pseudomonas is {{the most}} common offending pathogen. [...] Diabetes control is also an essential part of treatment. [...] When MOE goes unrecognized and untreated, the infection continues to smolder and over weeks or months can spread deeper into the head and involve the bones of the skull base, constituting skull base osteomyelitis (SBO). Multiple cranial nerve palsies can result, including the facial nerve (causing facial palsy), the recurrent laryngeal nerve (causing vocal cord paralysis) , and the <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> (causing deafness). The infecting organism is almost always pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it can instead be fungal (aspergillus or mucor). MOE and SBO are not amenable to surgery, but exploratory surgery may facilitate the culture of unusual organism(s) that are not responding to empirically used anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (ciprofloxacin being the drug of choice).

40|$|AbstractThe cochleovestibular (CV) nerve, which {{connects the}} inner ear to the brain, is the nerve that enables the senses of hearing and balance. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{document}} the morphological development of the mouse CV nerve with respect to the two embryonic cells types that produce it, specifically, the otic vesicle-derived progenitors that give rise to neurons, and the neural crest cell (NCC) progenitors that give rise to glia. Otic tissues of mouse embryos carrying NCC lineage reporter transgenes were whole mount immunostained to identify neurons and NCC. Serial optical sections were collected by confocal microscopy and were compiled to render the three dimensional (3 D) structure of the developing CV nerve. Spatial organization of the NCC and developing neurons suggest that neuronal and glial populations of the CV nerve develop in tandem from early stages of nerve formation. NCC form a sheath surrounding the CV ganglia and central axons. NCC are also closely associated with neurites projecting peripherally during formation of the vestibular and <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerves.</b> Physical ablation of NCC in chick embryos demonstrates that survival or regeneration of even a few individual NCC from ectopic positions in the hindbrain results in central projection of axons precisely following ectopic pathways made by regenerating NCC...|$|R

40|$|Study of {{the brain}} stem, stato-acoustic nerve, and inner ear of the mouse by a cholinesterase {{technique}} has disclosed that the acetylcholinesterase-positive centrifugal fibers to the inner ear {{are part of a}} general visceral efferent system which supplies fibers to the facial, vestibular and <b>cochlear</b> <b>nerves.</b> This system largely corresponds in its central course to that of the bundle of fibers which has been called “olivocochlear”, but its cells of origin do not appear to lie in the superior olivary complex. Instead, the preganglionic cells of origin are chiefly organized into four nuclei: one medial to the genu of the facial nerve; one lateral to the genu; the superior salivatory nucleus; and a small nucleus lying within the borders of the lateral vestibular nucleus. The fibers to the inner ear synapse, perhaps completely, on postganglionic cells located along their peripheral courses. Additionally, orthosympathetic acetylcholinesterasepositive fibers are present in the cochlear nerve; they arrive via the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Postganglionic fibers supply not only vascular walls and secretory epithelium in the inner ear but also (1) contact the somata of some acetylcholinesterase-positive, bipolar cochlear neurons and (2) ramify among, or terminate upon distal, acetylcholinesterase-positive processes of some sensory neurons at the foramina nervosa.

40|$|The {{ability of}} bats and toothed whales to echolocate is a {{remarkable}} case of convergent evolution. Previous genetic studies have documented parallel evolution of nucleotide sequences in Prestin and KCNQ 4, {{both of which are}} associated with voltage motility during the cochlear amplification of signals. Echolocation involves complex mechanisms. The most important factors include <b>cochlear</b> amplification, <b>nerve</b> transmission, and signal re-coding. Herein, we screen three genes that play different roles in this auditory system. Cadherin 23 (Cdh 23) and its ligand, protocadherin 15 (Pcdh 15), are essential for bundling motility in the sensory hair. Otoferlin (Otof) responds to nerve signal transmission in the auditory inner hair cell. Signals of parallel evolution occur in all three genes in the three groups of echolocators [...] two groups of bats (Yangochiroptera and Rhinolophoidea) plus the dolphin. Significant signals of positive selection also occur in Cdh 23 in the Rhinolophoidea and dolphin, and Pcdh 15 in Yangochiroptera. In addition, adult echolocating bats have higher levels of Otof expression in the auditory cortex than do their embryos and non-echolocation bats. Cdh 23 and Pcdh 15 encode the upper and lower parts of tip-links, and both genes show signals of convergent evolution and positive selection in echolocators, implying that they may co-evolve to optimize cochlear amplification. Convergent evolution and expression patterns of Otof suggest the potential role of nerve and brain in echolocation. Our synthesis of gene sequence and gene expression analyses reveals that positive selection, parallel evolution, and perhaps co-evolution and gene expression affect multiple hearing genes that play different roles in audition, including voltage and bundle motility in <b>cochlear</b> amplification, <b>nerve</b> transmission, and brain function...|$|R
