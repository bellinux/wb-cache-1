40|$|Abstract—The paper aims to {{investigate}} the relationship between unemployment rate and shadow economy with USA data using spline models. The shadow economy is estimated as percentage of official GDP, using MIMIC model. The size of the shadow economy as % of official GDP is estimated using a MIMIC model with four causal variables (taxes on corporate income, contributions for government social insurance, unemployment rate and selfemployment) and two indicators (index of real GDP and <b>civilian</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation rate). The size of the shadow economy (SE) {{is estimated to be}} decreasing over the last two decades. In order to evaluate {{the nature of the relationship}} between the two variables, we have estimated cubic B-spline, natural cubic B-spline and smoothing models. Using an F-test, we compare the smoothing spline to a global linear fit and the results indicate a sufficiently linear relationship. Finally, we have compared the local polynomial models with the spline model; the smoothing spline model closely matches the linearity between the size of the shadow economy and the unemployment rate. We extend the classical Okun law, in order to estimate the relationship between growth rate of official economy, unemployment rate and the size of the shadow economy. The results reveal a significant direct relationship between shadow economy and the unemployment rate and an indirect relation between shadow economy and growth of official sector.

Those who are {{actively}} employed {{as well as those}} classified as "unemployed " are included in the total <b>civilian</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force.</b> I'he length of working life is determined by the level of mortality of the particular cohort that is being studied and its level of participation in the labour force.

Although mortality and labour force participation rates are the factors which directly affect the length of working life, there are factors which indirectly also determine this index. For instance, morbidity would have an impact on how many people were- disabled and therefpre unable to participate in economic activity. An improvement in morbidity may reduce the rate of'retirements t which were caused by physical ailments or disorders. Reduced morbidity would generally lengthen the average length of working life in a society,, Similarly fertility and migration will influence the level of activity in the labour force by persons of a specific age and sex.
