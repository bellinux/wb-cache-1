40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to assess the effect of various additives on coalescence of nickel, copper and cobalt from slags generated during nickel extraction. The analyzed fluxes were silica and lime while examined reductants were pig iron, ferrosilicon and <b>copper-silicon</b> compound. Slag was settled at the different holding temperatures for various times in conditions that simulated the industrial environment. The newly formed matte and slag were characterized by their chemical composition and morphology. Silica flux generated higher partition coefficients for nickel and copper than the addition of lime. Additives used as reducing agents had higher valuable metal recovery rates and corresponding partition coefficients than fluxes. Microstructural studies showed that slag formed after adding reductants consisted of primarily fayalite, with some minute traces of magnetite as the secondary phase. Addition of 5 wt% of pig iron, ferrosilicon and <b>copper-silicon</b> alloys favored {{the formation of a}} metallized matte which increased Cu, Ni and Co recoveries. Addition of <b>copper-silicon</b> alloys with low silicon content was efficient in copper recovery but coalescence of the other metals was low.

40|$|The {{solid state}} {{reaction}} between copper and germanium {{has been studied}} in diffusion couples in the range 400 to 575 °C. The main product is coarse-grained Cu 3 Ge, but Cu 5 Ge and the (Cu, Ge) solid solution are also formed, albeit in thin layers. The reaction rate is determined by bulk diffusion of copper through the germanide layer, with an activation energy of 104 kJ/mol. Above 570 °C a sudden acceleration occurs. At 500 °C the interdiffusion coefficient in the solid solution is 6 × 10 *(- 12) cm 2 /s, D(Cu 5 Ge) = 4 × 108 *(- 11) cm 2 /s and 0 D in Cu 3 Ge is raised from 1 × 10 *(- 10) cm 2 /s at 22 atom-% Ge to 1 × 10 *(- 8) cm 2 /s at 25 atom-% Ge.

30|$|Sol–gel {{methods can}} be used to {{producing}} durable Cu containing glasses but these have not been investigated for their antimicrobial properties (Perez-Robles et al., 1999; Tohidi et al., 2010). Coatings with antimicrobial activity containing Cu nanoparticles have been prepared by surface coating with a powder mixture followed by heat treatment to fuse the particles into a glass-like coating (Esteban-Tejeda et al., 2012). In the present study chemical vapour deposition (CVD) was used to produce thin film coatings. In this process a reactive gas mixture containing coating precursors is introduced into a coating region and a source of energy e.g. heat applied to initiate (or accelerate) decomposition of the precursor and growth of the coating on the target substrate (Choy, 2003). Atmospheric Pressure CVD (APCVD) has been widely used e.g. for production of self-cleaning coatings for glass which generally have excellent hardness and durability. We have previously reported the use of CVD to produce antimicrobial SiO 2 (silicon dioxide) coatings containing silver (Ag; Cook et al., 2011; Varghese et al., 2013). In this report we describe the activity of similar coatings but containing Cu instead of Ag as the antimicrobial component. The activity of these Cu-SiO 2 (<b>copper-silicon</b> dioxide) coatings against hospital related pathogens that are of current interest was investigated.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} two theoretical research topics: Multiscale Simulations of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM, chapters 1 through 3) and Density Functional Theory Characterization of Functionalized and non-functionalized Silicon Surfaces (chapters 4 through 8). The first topic presents {{the development of}} an AFM simulation methodology, based on first principles, which incorporates the atomistic details of probe, sample, and impurities {{in the construction of the}} images. It also includes studies of the influence of common artifacts (such as elastic deformations and imaging multistability) and probe structure (tilt angle and number of walls in the carbon nanotube probe) on image quality. The second topic concerns the structure and energetics of reconstructed and unreconstructed silicon (111) surfaces (either functionalized with groups such as methoxy and methyl or without functionalization) and non-functionalized <b>copper-silicon</b> surfaces and crystals. These studies lead to novel findings such as the formation of a full stacking fault on the methylated Si(111) surface in the presence of large etch pits and the quantification of the surface energy path of the Si(111) 1 x 1 [...] > DAS 7 x 7 reconstruction.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) possess {{extremely high}} thermal conductivity in the axial direction. To {{take advantage of}} this property, new methods are needed to functionalize nanotubes across length scales of practical engineering relevance. In this research, a tri-layer catalyst configuration has been developed for well anchored and vertically oriented multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays synthesized on various substrates by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system. Dense (108 to 109 CNTs/mm 2) and tall (10 to 100 μm) CNT arrays have been created over areas of order 1 to 10 cm 2. The resulting arrays have been characterized for tube type, uniformity, density, and alignment with electron microscopy. ^ A reference calorimeter testing rig in a high vacuum environment with infrared temperature measurement has been set up and calibrated in this work for thermal contact resistance characterization. Experimental measurements of contact conductance between varieties of surfaces, CNT arrays, and combinations with other thermal interface materials have been performed to assess and to optimize the efficacy of CNT array interfaces. The investigation has demonstrated that with CNT arrays, <b>copper-silicon</b> interface resistance can be reduced by nearly an order of magnitude. Further, two-sided CNT interfaces and CNT wax composites can produce very low interface resistances of 4 and below 3 mm 2 K/W respectively. ^ A nano-contact resistance model (NCR) has been developed in this work to explain and predict CNT interface resistance. The effects of phonon ballistic transport and CNT array properties, e. g. diameter, density and distribution, have been explicitly incorporated into conductance. The model reveals that: (1) phonon ballistic transport resistance dominates at the CNT array interface; (2) the overall performance of CNT interfaces is governed by the resistance at the CNT-Cu contacts; and (3) the conformability and volume ratio have very important effects on CNT interface conductance. ...|$|E
40|$|The plasma-based etching {{processes}} of copper (Cu) and titanium tungsten (TiW) thin films, and the electromigration of the copper lines patterned by above etching processes were studied. Instead of vaporizing the plasma/copper reaction product, a dilute hydrogen chloride solution {{was used to}} dissolve the nonvolatile reaction product. The plasma/copper reaction process was affected by many factors including the microstructure of the copper film and the plasma conditions. Under the same chlorine plasma exposure condition, the copper conversation rate and the copper chloride (CuClx) formation rate increased monotonically with the Cu grain size. The characteristics of the Cu etching process were explained by diffusion mechanisms of Cl and Cu in the plasmacopper reaction process as well as microstructures of Cu and CuClx. The Cu chlorination process was also affected by the additive gas in the Cl 2 plasma. The additive gas, such as Ar, N 2, and CF 4, dramatically changed the plasma phase chemistry, i. e., the Cl concentration, and the ion bombardment energy, which resulted in changes of the Cu chlorination rate and the sidewall roughness. TiW thin films, used as the diffusion barrier layer for the Cu film, were reactive ion etched with CF 4 /O 2, CF 4 /Cl 2, and CF 4 /HCl plasma. Process parameter such as feed gas composition, RF power, and plasma pressure showed tremendous effects on the etch rate and the etch selectivity. The TiW etch rate was {{a function of the}} sum of Cl and F concentrations and the ion bombardment energy. Cu/diffusion barrier metal stack was successfully patterned by above plasma etch processes. The electromigration (EM) performance of the Cu lines was evaluated by the accelerated isothermal test. The activation energy of 0. 5 ~ 0. 6 eV and the current density exponent of 2. 7 were obtained. Failure analysis showed that both <b>copper-silicon</b> nitride cap layer interface and the copper grain boundary were active diffusion paths. The EM induced stress caused the cap layer crack and affected the reliability of Cu lines. The processes studied in this dissertation can be applied in advanced microelectronic fabrication including large area flexible microelectronics...|$|E
