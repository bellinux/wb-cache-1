5|$|On 22 October 1972, {{while driving}} {{home from a}} session of work on his injured {{shoulder}} with the Stoke physiotherapist, Banks lost control of his new Ford Consul (a re-badged Ford Granada Mk 1) car, which {{ended up in a}} ditch. He had attempted to overtake a <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sharp bend and collided with an oncoming Austin A60 van. He was taken to the North Staffordshire Hospital and during an operation received 200 stitches in his face and over 100 micro-stitches inside the socket of his right eye, and was told the chances of saving the sight in his eye were 50–50. His sight never returned, and as the loss of binocular vision severely limited his abilities as a goalkeeper, he retired from professional football the following summer.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Australia, Edwards {{became the}} Australian Representative for Selection Trust. In 1966 his wife, Cherry, died; he married Dorothy Carew Berrick in 1972. The pair {{were said to}} {{complement}} each other well, as Dorothy limped on her left leg after being knocked over by a <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> crosswalk in Sydney in 1970, while Edwards limped with his right after his flying accident in 1938. In 1974, Edwards relinquished his position as the Australian Representative for Selection Trust and was appointed Governor of Western Australia. He was sworn in on 7 January 1974, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) the following October.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Dive Coaster can vary {{slightly}} from one to another. Depending on the amusement park's request, one row on the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders. Stadium seating {{is also used to}} give every rider a clear view. Next, compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 abreast cars, because of the extra weight of each <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Dive Coaster, the size of the track must be larger than other B models (such as the Hyper Coaster) to support the weight. At the top of the primary vertical drop, a braking system holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds, giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop.|$|E

5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, {{had been}} driving in a marked 71st precinct police <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers scanned the BMW's license plate on a computer in their police car. When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to pull over, and the driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E
5|$|At the Tour de Corse, Audi debuted the Quattro A2, {{which was}} 70kg (155lb) lighter {{and had an}} engine {{producing}} 30 more horsepower. Mouton's rally ended when her engine caught on fire. On the first stage in Greece, she rolled her <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hairpin turn 18km (11mi) from the start. Rally New Zealand was for Mouton a repetition of the previous year; she took the lead on the seventh stage and held on to it until her A2's engine failed, with only six of the 33 stages to go. The three retirements in a row dropped Mouton to fifth place in the championship. She then finished third behind Mikkola and Blomqvist at the Rally Argentina, but this would remain her last podium finish of the season. At the 1000 Lakes in Finland, Mouton finished the first day in seventh place after setting two top-five stage times. Her car later caught on fire, but {{she was able to}} continue in the event by following Mikkola's advice and driving into a lake. With a string of top-ten times, she eventually finished 16th. In the Rallye Sanremo, the tarmac stages were dominated by the Lancia 037 and Mouton finished seventh after suffering from fuel injection problems. In the season-ending RAC Rally, she started well and held second place after the first twelve stages. An Audi mechanic later accidentally refilled Mouton's fuel tank with pure water which resulted in time-consuming repairs. She eventually retired after crashing out, and placed fifth overall in the drivers' championship. Although Mikkola beat Lancia's Röhrl and Alén to the drivers' title, Audi had lost the manufacturers' title to Lancia after the latter's triple win in Sanremo.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of November 2, 2002, a female {{employee}} of the Camp Courtney officers' club on Okinawa drove up to the Courtney main gate and reported to base security personnel that a Marine Corps major had just attempted to sexually assault her in her <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> deserted road near the back gate of the base. She identified the Marine as Major Michael Brown and stated that during the assault the major threw her mobile phone into the nearby Tengan River. The woman, later identified with the initials V.N., who was 40 years old, and originally from the Philippines, had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, and was married to a Japanese citizen of Okinawan descent. She reported that she had picked up Brown in her car about 1:30a.m. after the officers' club closed and that he directed her to the deserted road behind the base and after parking, Brown tried to rape her and then threw her mobile phone into the river when she tried to call the police. The Camp Courtney security personnel called the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA). Japanese officers came and took V. N.'s report.|$|E

A larger 30kWh battery is on the SL and SV trims, and the S trim initially kept the smaller 24kWh battery found in earlier Leafs.

25|$|By July 1934, Dillinger {{had dropped}} {{completely}} out of sight, and the federal agents had no solid leads to follow. He had, in fact, drifted into Chicago where he went under the alias of Jimmy Lawrence, a petty criminal from Wisconsin who bore a close resemblance to Dillinger. Working as a clerk, Dillinger found that, in a large metropolis like Chicago, {{he was able to}} lead an anonymous existence for a while. What he did not realize was that the center of the federal agents' dragnet happened to be Chicago. When the authorities found Dillinger's blood-spattered getaway <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Chicago side street, they were positive {{that he was in the}} city.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Ramírez's {{name was}} put in the hit list of the cartel {{and it did not}} rest until it was able to break through his {{security}} to avenge the damage he did to its criminal network. On November 17, 1986, when he was returning with his family to Bogotá, men in a green Renault 18 began to shoot at his <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bridge between the municipalities of Mosquera and Fontibón, taking advantage {{of the fact that he}} was without a convoy. Colonel Ramírez lost control of his car and crashed against a rock, not far from a police station. The assassins approached his car and shot him in front of his wife and sons.|$|E
25|$|Capone became {{increasingly}} security-minded and desirous of {{getting away from}} Chicago. As a precaution, he and his entourage would often show up suddenly at one of Chicago's train depots and buy up an entire Pullman sleeper <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> night train to Cleveland, Omaha, Kansas City, Little Rock, or Hot Springs, where they would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names. In 1928, Capone paid $40,000 to beer magnate August Busch for a 14-room retreat at 93 Palm Avenue on Palm Island, Florida in Biscayne Bay between Miami and Miami Beach. He never registered any property under his name. He did not even have a bank account, but always used Western Union for cash delivery, not more than $1,000.|$|E

25|$|What {{eventually}} became the No. 27 car at RCR {{was formed in}} 2001 as the No. 30 America Online-sponsored Chevrolet, with AOL signing a four-year contract. Childress initially planned to have Kevin Harvick drive the <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> limited basis during that season {{as part of a}} transition from the Busch Series to Winston Cup for 2002. After Dale Earnhardt's death, Harvick was moved into RCR's primary car and 2000 Busch Series champion Jeff Green was selected to drive the car in his place. Originally planning to debut at Atlanta in March, the team debuted at the NAPA Auto Parts 500 at California Speedway in April, with Green finishing 21st. The team qualified for six more races that season, with Green earning a pole at the Sharpie 500 at Bristol in August, and went full-time the next season as scheduled with Green behind the wheel.|$|E
25|$|He returns {{briefly in}} April 1997 for Ricky's wedding to Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) {{and again in}} December to console Ricky {{following}} {{the loss of his}} child. On another visit in May 1998, he becomes attracted to landlady Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) and they soon begin a relationship. Peggy asks Frank to move in with her at the Vic and they soon announce their engagement. Roy remains jealous of Frank, believing Pat has feelings for her ex-husband. When Pat turns to Frank following an argument with Roy and is seen leaving his flat, Roy and Peggy believe Frank and Pat are having an affair. Peggy calls off her engagement and Roy speeds off in his <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> suicide bid but Frank manages to convince him that his relationship with Pat is now platonic. He and Roy bond, leading Frank to admit he got a young woman called Gemma pregnant in Manchester, and had a young son, Danny, of whom no one else is aware.|$|E
25|$|Rookie Regan Smith {{meanwhile}} {{made his}} debut at Bristol Motor Speedway in March, finishing 25th. Smith would run 6 more {{races in the}} car, with a best finish of 24th at Talladega Superspeedway. On July 17, {{it was announced that}} Smith would move to the 14 <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> full-time basis, replacing veteran Sterling Marlin. Meanwhile, 23-year-old Aric Almirola, who was granted his release from Joe Gibbs Racing after being pulled out of a car he qualified on the pole during a Busch Series race in favor of Denny Hamlin, signed on to be the new co-driver of the 01. With the merger of Ginn and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. not long afterwards, Smith was left on the sidelines while Almirola ran 5 races. Aric's results were not much better than Regan's, with a best finish of 26th at Phoenix. Both drivers would continue with DEI in 2008 running for ROTY, and both would become winners later in their Cup careers.|$|E

25|$|The No. 36 team {{returned}} for 2005, expanding Said's schedule {{to a minimum}} of 10 races beginning with the Daytona 500. Like the 10 team which was co-owned by Valvoline executive James Rocco, sponsor Centrix's owner and racing enthusiast Bob Sutton came on as an equity partner for the 36 car, changing the team name to MB Sutton Motorsports. Said had stated {{that he would have}} liked to drive the <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> full-time basis if sponsorship was found. Veteran crew chief Frankie Stoddard would lead the 36 team. Said ultimately attempted 12 races, struggling on oval tracks, with a best finish of 27th at Daytona and Texas and three DNQs. He did run well at Talladega in May, qualifying 12th and running in the top 15 before a 25-car pileup ended his day with 35 laps remaining. Boris was, however, strong as always in his road course element. At Sonoma in June, Said was running well when he entered the pits while they were closed after a caution was thrown with 40 laps to go. Sent back to 32nd place, he made it up to 13th place with 10 laps to go, but was relegated to a 17th-place finish after a caution with 7 laps to go. Said shined later in the year at Watkins Glen, starting 41st after qualifying was rained out, and racing with NASCAR Road Course aces Tony Stewart and Robby Gordon for the win. Said would score a career-best 3rd-place finish. Said left the team to drive for No Fear Racing in the No. 60 Ford in 2006.|$|E
