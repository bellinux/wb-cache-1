40|$|The {{association}} of the four following congenital abnormalities-ectodermal dysplasia affecting the hair, teeth and nails; polydactyly; chondro-dysplasia; and congenital morbus cordis-has been observed in two children in whom the clinical picture is so strikingly similar as to justify its description as a separate syndrome. Although many atypical cases of achondroplasia and chondro-osteo-dystrophy have been recorded with associated abnormalities, {{and there is an}} extensive literature relating to <b>congenital</b> <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> we have found no detailed description of the syndrome previously published.

40|$|Ablepharon macrostomia {{syndrome}} (AMS) and Barber-Say syndrome (BSS) {{are rare}} <b>congenital</b> <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasias</b> characterized by similar clinical features. To establish the genetic basis of AMS and BSS, we performed extensive clinical phenotyping, whole exome and candidate gene sequencing, and functional validations. We identified a recurrent {{de novo mutation}} in TWIST 2 in seven independent AMS-affected families, as well as another recurrent de novo mutation affecting the same amino acid in ten independent BSS-affected families. Moreover, a genotype-phenotype correlation was observed, because the two syndromes differed based solely upon {{the nature of the}} substituting amino acid: a lysine at TWIST 2 residue 75 resulted in AMS, whereas a glutamine or alanine yielded BSS. TW 1 ST 2 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that regulates the development of mesenchymal tissues. All identified mutations fell in the basic domain of TWIST 2 and altered the DNA-binding pattern of Flag- 1 'WIST 2 in HeLa cells. Comparison of wild-type and mutant TW 1 ST 2 expressed in zebrafish identified abnormal developmental phenotypes and widespread transcriptome changes. Our results suggest that autosomal-dominant TW 1 ST 2 mutations cause AMS or BSS by inducing protean effects on the transcription factor's DNA binding...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tumours of {{the nail}} bed are rare. Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} {{is the most}} frequent among them. Chronic infection, chemical or physical trauma/microtrauma, genetic disorders such as <b>congenital</b> <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> radiation, tar, arsenic or exposure to minerals, sun exposure, immunosuppression, and previous HPV infection have all been discussed as etiologic factors. The diagnosis is often delayed because {{of the variety of}} clinical manifestations, often resembling benign or common infectious processes. Rapidly growing ulcerative lesions should also be considered as potential malignancy. Furthermore, a lack of antifungal or antibacterial treatment response is the most indicative symptom, always requiring subungual biopsy. Early diagnosis is of great importance for therapeutic effectiveness. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of subungual squamous cell carcinoma, associated with long-lasting onychomycosis in a 76 -year-old female patient, treated with amputation of the distal phalanx and the distal part of the proximal phalanx. CONCLUSION: Although there are no available data in the literature to confirm or reject the contribution of the chronic nail infection to the malignant process, we emphasise the importance of this co-existence regarding the possible disguising of the malignant process. An early biopsy of a chronic persistent nail lesion may be preventive and beneficial regarding avoiding more aggressive treatments and achieving a favourable prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Hay-Wells {{syndrome}}, {{also known}} as ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (AEC) syndrome (OMIM 106260), is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by <b>congenital</b> <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> including alopecia, scalp infections, dystrophic nails, hypodontia, ankyloblepharon and cleft lip and/or cleft palate. This constellation of clinical signs is unique, but some overlap can be recognized with other ectodermal dysplasia syndromes, for example ectrodactyly [...] ectodermal dysplasia [...] cleft lip/palate (EEC; OMIM 604292), limb [...] mammary syndrome (LMS; OMIM 603543), acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth syndrome (ADULT; OMIM 103285) and recessive cleft lip/palate [...] ectodermal dysplasia (CLPED 1; OMIM 225060). We have recently demonstrated that heterozygous mutations in the p 63 gene are the major cause of EEC syndrome. Linkage {{studies suggest that the}} related LMS and ADULT syndromes are also caused by mutations in the p 63 gene. Thus, it appears that p 63 gene mutations have highly pleiotropic effects. We have analysed p 63 in AEC syndrome patients and identified missense mutations in eight families. All mutations give rise to amino acid substitutions in the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, and are predicted to affect protein [...] protein interactions. In contrast, {{the vast majority of the}} mutations found in EEC syndrome are amino acid substitutions in the DNA-binding domain. Thus, a clear genotype [...] phenotype correlation can be recognized for EEC and AEC syndromes...|$|E
40|$|Incontinentia pigmenti, {{also called}} Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome, {{is a rare}} X-linked {{inherited}} dominant disorder that affects females, but causes spontaneous abortion of prenatal males. Incontinentia pigmenti is a systemic disease with clinical features similar to <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> including congenitally missing teeth. The pathogenesis is related to gene mutations in NF-kappa-B essential modulator on chromosome Xq 28. Incontinentia pigmenti {{is caused by a}} defect in the developmental stage of organs originating from the ectoderm or mesoderm and involves the skin, eyes, hair, teeth and central nervous system. This report discusses the management of three cases of 3 to 5 years old females with incontinentia pigmenti and accompanying multiple missing teeth.

40|$|Genetic {{improvement}} programmes in cattle have significantly {{contributed to the}} large increase in milk and meat production. As along with these breeding schemes top ranking AI sires are widely used and in the case, if these sires are carriers of mutated alleles, inherited defects can be widely disseminated. Most of the about 350 inherited anomalies in cattle occur at very low to low frequencies and thus, carriers are usually not detected in progeny tests based on reporting calves with congenital malformations. The molecular genetic decipherment of inherited anomalies is the necessary prerequisite for an efficient prevention of the dissemination of undesired alleles. The paper gives a survey on inherited anomalies being already characterized in cattle with molecular genetic methods.

40|$|In healthy {{human skin}} host defense {{molecules}} such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) contribute to skin immune homeostasis. In {{patients with the}} <b>congenital</b> disease <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (ED) skin integrity is disturbed {{and as a result}} patients have recurrent skin infections. The disease is characterized by developmental abnormalities of ectodermal derivatives and absent or reduced sweating. We hypothesized that ED patients have a reduced skin immune defense because of the reduced ability to sweat. Therefore, we performed a label-free quantitative proteome analysis of wash solution of human skin from ED patients or healthy individuals. A clear-cut difference between both cohorts could be observed in cellular processes related to immunity and host defense. In line with the extensive underrepresentation of proteins of the immune system, dermcidin, a sweat-derived AMP, was reduced in its abundance in the skin secretome of ED patients. In contrast, proteins involved in metabolic/catabolic and biosynthetic processes were enriched in the skin secretome of ED patients. In summary, our proteome profiling provides insights into the actual situation of healthy versus diseased skin. The systematic reduction in immune system and defense-related proteins may contribute to the high susceptibility of ED patients to skin infections and altered skin colonization...|$|R

These phenotypic features {{are a result}} of an imbalance between the proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells during development of ectoderm-derived structures. Mutations in the p 63 and interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF 6) genes have been found in human patients with these syndromes, consistent with phenotypes. Here, we used human and mouse primary keratinocytes and mouse models to investigate the role of p 63 and IRF 6 in proliferation and differentiation. We report that the DeltaNp 63 isoform of p 63 activated transcription of IRF 6, and this, in turn, induced proteasome-mediated DeltaNp 63 degradation. This feedback regulatory loop allowed keratinocytes to exit the cell cycle, thereby limiting their ability to proliferate. Importantly, mutations in either p 63 or IRF 6 resulted in disruption of this regulatory loop: p 63 mutations causing <b>ectodermal</b> <b>dysplasias</b> were unable to activate IRF 6 transcription, and mice with mutated or null p 63 showed reduced Irf 6 expression in their palate and ectoderm.
