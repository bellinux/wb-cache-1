25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to be}} ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man <b>can</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> idea of destruction.|$|E
25|$|Arab-plan or {{hypostyle}} mosques are {{the earliest}} type of mosques, pioneered under the Umayyad Dynasty. These mosques have square or rectangular plans with an enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Historically, {{in the warm}} Middle Eastern and Mediterranean climates, the courtyard served to accommodate {{the large number of}} worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat roofs on prayer halls, which required the use of numerous columns and supports. One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, the building being supported by over 850 columns. Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer arcades so that visitors <b>can</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, the mosques consequently losing popularity.|$|E

25|$|On 1 January 1923 {{ownership}} of the viaduct, {{along with the rest}} of the line, passed to the London and North Eastern Railway and thence to the North Eastern region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. The line through Kielder lost its passenger service on 15 October 1956 and closed completely on 1 September 1958 and the viaduct's future became uncertain when the £167million Kielder reservoir project was begun in 1976, a substantial part of the route of the old line being lost under the waters. However, steps were taken by the Northumberland and Newcastle Society to protect the viaduct itself by encasing the bases of its piers in concrete and waterproofing the bridge deck. The structure is now a Scheduled Monument and forms part of a footpath from which walkers <b>can</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> views from the top of its arches.|$|E

500|$|The show's humor {{turns on}} {{cultural}} references that cover {{a wide spectrum}} of society so that viewers from all generations <b>can</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> show. Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history. The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, billboards, and elsewhere. The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show. Kristin Thompson argues that The Simpsons uses a [...] "flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show." ...|$|E

500|$|In his 1958 New York Times review, Crowther {{writes that}} Pather Panchali delicately {{illustrates}} how [...] "poverty {{does not always}} nullify love" [...] and how even very poor people <b>can</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> little pleasures of their world. Marie Seton describes how the film intersperses the depiction of poverty and the delights and pleasures of youth. She represents the bond between Durga and Indir, and their fate, as signifying a philosophical core: that both {{the young and the}} old die. Seton writes of the film's [...] "lyrical" [...] qualities, noting especially the imagery immediately before the onset of monsoon. Robinson writes about a peculiar quality of [...] "lyrical happiness" [...] in the film, and states that Pather Panchali is [...] "about unsophisticated people shot through with great sophistication, and without a trace of condescension or inflated sentiment".|$|E

500|$|Development for Killer7 {{began in}} mid-2002 {{as part of}} the Capcom Five, a set of games overseen by Shinji Mikami and {{intended}} to be exclusive to the GameCube. Capcom produced the games to bring new intellectual property to the video game industry, which the company viewed as stagnant. Killer7s gameplay mechanics were finalized late in development because most resources went to story and visual work. Director Suda51 wrote the scenario based on a plot he conceived together with Mikami, and later decided on the unconventional control scheme as a deconstruction of how gamers play and to [...] "create new expression". Complex controls and combos were omitted to present a system that fosters easy progression for the player. Producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi described the controls as [...] "intuitive" [...] and stated that the team wanted players to [...] "think when they are playing" [...] so they <b>can</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> mystery in the story. The long development process culminated in several delays, the last of which was due to an artistic desire to release the game on July 7 (7/7).|$|E
