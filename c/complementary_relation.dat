40|$|This paper {{pretends to}} {{demonstrate}} the <b>complementary</b> <b>relations</b> between three relatively recent sociological theories, each one of which explains a different aspect of the same social object: the origin, diffusion and change {{of social and cultural}} values, aiming at demonstrating that there is not {{such a thing as a}} sociological theory that explains all, but rather diverse theories that offer partial explanations of social reality. To that effect, and on the basis of the necessary relationship between theory and research, three different theories are evaluated separately: Hawley’s and Duncan’s theory of the social ecosystem, Galtung’s centre-periphery theory, and Inglehart’s theory of values’ change in modern-industrial societies, offering theoretical and empirical evidence of their <b>complementary</b> <b>relations,</b> based on Spanish and international data. Social ecosystem and centre-periphery theories show a high level of generalization (through space and time) and a high level of abstraction, though both can easily operationalize their main concepts through valid and reliable indicators. The theory of values’ change, however, though showing a high level of generalization, is limited in time to the historical period after World War II, and also shows a high level of abstraction. Centre-periphery theory and values’ change theory use individual and collective units of analysis, but social ecosystem theory only uses collective units, by definition.

As the results of the examination, it is illustrated experimentally on a variety of surfaces that the <b>complementary</b> <b>relation</b> is valid within an experimental uncertainty.

If a surface is designed so that it does not reflect a narrow spectral region of radiation to any direction and reflects the other spectral regions of radiation much over the hemisphere, then the surface can be a new spectrally-functional emitter of radiation. It is also suggested that thermal radiation emitted at a surface is considered as the emission of plane waves at the surface rather than as the emission of spherical waves by electric dipoles...|$|E
40|$|Wave-particle duality, an {{important}} and fundamental concept established upon pure quantum systems, {{is central to the}} complementarity principle in quantum mechanics. However, due to the environment effects or even the entanglement between the quanton and the which-way detector (WWD), the quanton should be described by a mixed quantum state but not a pure quantum state. Although there are some attempts to clarify the complementarity principle for mixed quantum systems, it is still unclear how the mixedness affects the <b>complementary</b> <b>relation.</b> Here, we give a ternary <b>complementary</b> <b>relation</b> (TCR) among wave, particle and mixedness aspects for arbitrary multi-state systems, which are respectively quantified by the $l_ 1 $ measure for quantum coherence, the which-path predictability, and the linear entropy. In particular, we show how a WWD can transform entropy into predictability and coherence. Through modifying the POVM (positive-operator valued measure) measurement on WWD, our TCR can be simplified as the wave-mixedness and particle-mixedness duality relations. Beyond enclosing the wave-particle duality relation [PRL 116, 160406 (2016) ], our TCR relates to the wave-particle-entanglement complementarity relation [PRL 98, 250501 (2008); Opt.

It has been found that {{over a period of time}} lot of changes have taken place in the socio-economic milieu and agricultural practices in mountains. The cropping pattern, extent of diversification and commercialization have been found to vary considerably across different MFS. A high degree of externalities has developed particularly under vegetable- and fruit-based farming systems. The proportion of purchased inputs has increased while the share of farm-produced inputs (own seeds, FYM, family labour, bullock labour, feed and fodder, etc.) has decreased. Thus, the system interlinkages and in-built <b>complementary</b> <b>relations</b> among sub-systems are getting distorted with commercialization through vegetables and fruits. The shortage of fodder, decrease in the number of farm animals and thus FYM-scarcity, are the burgeoning signs of unsustainability, particularly on vegetable- and fruit-based systems.

40|$|We find {{a single}} {{parameter}} family of genuinely entangled three qubit pure states, called the maximally Bell inequality violating states (MBV), which exhibit maximum Bell inequality violation by the reduced bipartite system for a fixed amount of genuine tripartite entanglement quantified by the so called tangle measure. This in turn implies that there holds a <b>complementary</b> <b>relation</b> between the Bell inequality violation by the reduced bipartite systems and the tangle present in the three qubit states, not necessarily pure. The MBV states also exhibit maximum Bell inequality violation by the reduced bipartite systems of the three qubit pure states with a fixed amount of genuine tripartite correlation quantified by the generalized geometric measure, a genuine entanglement measure of multiparty pure states, and the discord monogamy score, a multipartite quantum correlation measure from information theoretic paradigm.
