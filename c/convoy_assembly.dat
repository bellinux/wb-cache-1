25|$|The BX convoys were a World War II {{series of}} convoys across the Gulf of Maine from Boston to HalifaX. These convoys were escorted by the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) of the Royal Canadian Navy to protect coastal {{shipping}} in transit between North American loading ports and trans-Atlantic <b>convoy</b> <b>assembly</b> points in Nova Scotia.|$|E
25|$|She {{served in}} a number of convoys during the war, {{occasionally}} sailing between British ports, such as Methil and Southend, Milford Haven and Liverpool, as well as the Arctic <b>convoy</b> <b>assembly</b> point at Loch Ewe. She sailed several times to North America, as part of convoys ON 17, ON 109 and ON 165, and back again as part of convoys SC 49, SC 50, SC 54 and SC 122. In January 1942 she sailed to Gibraltar as part of convoy OG 78, returning to Liverpool in February with convoy HG 79. Empire Morn was then assigned to the Arctic convoys, delivering supplies to the Soviet Union. She sailed in April 1942 as part of convoy PQ 15 to Murmansk, making the return journey in late April to May with convoy QP 12.|$|E

She was laid up in reserve in March 1946 and converted in 1952 to a research vessel for Canadian Department of Marine and Fisheries, a role she served in until the early 1980s when she was acquired by the trust. She has been restored to her wartime appearance and serves in the summer months as a museum ship on loan to the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia, while wintering securely in the naval dockyard at CFB Halifax {{under the care of}} Maritime Forces Atlantic, Maritime Command. Sackvilles presence in Halifax is considered very appropriate, given the port was an important North American <b>convoy</b> <b>assembly</b> port during the war. Sackville makes her first appearance each spring when she is towed by a naval tug from HMC Dockyard to a location off Point Pleasant Park on the first Sunday in May to participate in the Commemoration of the Battle of the Atlantic ceremonies held at a memorial in the park overlooking the entrance to Halifax Harbour. Sackville typically hosts several dozen RCN veterans on this day and has also participated in several burials at sea for dispersing the ashes of RCN veterans of the Battle of the Atlantic at this location.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the centre}} of town is a marina with {{moorings}} for about 150 boats. 2300m north {{of this is a}} floating platform where the very large Airbus A380 wings and fuselage sections are transferred from sea-going RORO ferries to barges. The parts are manufactured in Broughton, UK and Germany. The barges take them through Bordeaux to a dock at Langon and then by oversize road <b>convoy</b> to the <b>assembly</b> plant at Blagnac, Toulouse. See Itinéraire à Grand Gabarit for more details of the transportation.|$|R
50|$|In Saint-Nazaire {{in western}} France, the ship exchanges the {{fuselage}} sections from Hamburg for larger, assembled sections, {{some of which}} include the nose. The ship unloads in Bordeaux. The ship then picks up the belly and tail sections from Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA in Cádiz in southern Spain, and delivers them to Bordeaux. From there, the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon, and by oversize road <b>convoys</b> to the <b>assembly</b> hall in Toulouse. In order to avoid damage from direct handling, parts are secured in custom jigs carried on self-powered wheeled vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|Force 121 {{left the}} Clyde in Scotland on 23 March and joined up with South African-born Admiral Syfret's ships at Freetown in Sierra Leone, {{proceeding}} from there in two <b>convoys</b> to their <b>assembly</b> point at Durban on the South African east coast. Here {{they were joined}} by the 13th Brigade Group of the 5th Division - General Sturges' force consisting of three infantry brigades, while Admiral Syfret's squadron consisted of the flag battleship , the aircraft carriers [...] and , the cruisers [...] and , eleven destroyers, six minesweepers, six corvettes and auxiliaries. It was a formidable force to bring against the 8,000 men (mostly Malagasy) at Diego Suarez, but the Chiefs of Staff were adamant that the operation was to succeed, preferably without any fighting.|$|R
25|$|From {{the start}} of the war in 1939 until VE Day, several of Canada's Atlantic coast ports became {{important}} to the resupply effort for the United Kingdom and later for the Allied land offensive on the Western Front. Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia, became the primary <b>convoy</b> <b>assembly</b> ports, with Halifax being assigned the fast or priority convoys (largely troops and essential material) with the more modern merchant ships, while Sydney was given slow convoys which conveyed bulkier material on older and more vulnerable merchant ships. Both ports were heavily fortified with shore radar emplacements, search light batteries, and extensive coastal artillery stations all manned by RCN and Canadian Army regular and reserve personnel. Military intelligence agents enforced strict blackouts throughout the areas and anti-torpedo nets were in place at the harbor entrances, making a direct attack on those facilities unfeasible due to the impossibility for Germany to provide air support. Even though no landings of German personnel took place near these ports, there were frequent attacks by U-boats on convoys departing for Europe once these had reached the mouth of the St. Lawrence. Less extensively used, but no less important, was the port of Saint John which also saw matériel funneled through the port, largely after the United States entered the war in December 1941. The port's location within the protected waters of the Bay of Fundy made it a difficult target for attack. The Canadian Pacific Railway mainline from central Canada (which crossed the state of Maine) could be used to transport in aid of the war effort.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-January, Japanese {{advances}} southward cut {{the anticipated}} aircraft ferry routes to the Philippines and reinforcement {{was no longer}} feasible. Instead, using aircraft as their assembly was completed and assigning personnel at hand, provisional fighter squadrons were organized in Brisbane to assist the Royal Netherlands Indies Air Force (ML-KNIL) in defending the NEI. The 17th Pursuit Squadron (Provisional) was established on 14 January, and 13 of its 17 pilots had previously been with the 24th PG. With 17 P-40s delivered by the Pensacola <b>convoy</b> (<b>assembly</b> of the 18th could not be completed {{because of a lack}} of parts), it flew across northern Australia from Brisbane to Darwin, then to Java via Penfoie Airdrome at Koepang and Den Pasar Field on Bali between 16 and 25 January. Only 12 Warhawks arrived at the designated FEAF fighter base at Ngoro Field, the others lost to accidents, combat, and pilot illness. [...] The 20th Pursuit Squadron (Provisional), incorporating pilots of the 35th PG, took off from Darwin in 25 P-40s on 2 February, but only 17 reached Java, the remainder shot down over Bali or damaged on the ground by air raids. Likewise, 25 P-40s of the 3rd Pursuit Squadron (Provisional) departed Brisbane, but because of accidents involving novice pilots, only 18 reached Darwin on 8 February. Just nine eventually reinforced Ngoro; an entire flight of eight was lost when it exhausted its fuel after its LB-30 navigation guide aircraft became lost in a storm trying to find Koepang. Survivors of both the 3rd and 20th provisional squadrons were integrated into the 17th PS. The 33rd Pursuit Squadron (Provisional) was en route to Java at Darwin when it was nearly annihilated by a Japanese air raid on 19 February. Of 83 P-40s assembled and flown from Brisbane, only 37 arrived at Ngoro Field, and by 15 February less than 20 could be mustered for operations.|$|E

50|$|Airbus - Saint-Nazaire {{is one of}} the European {{centers of}} Airbus, {{responsible}} for the fitting out of fuselage sections. Originally a factory built for SNCASO, it is located at Penhoët, immediate north of the sites of Chantiers de l'Atlantique. An additional facility was built in Gron in 1980. For the Airbus A380, the Airbus Roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ship Ville de Bordeaux brings fuselage sections from Hamburg, Germany for larger, assembled sections, some of which include the nose. The ship then unloads these sections plus wings from Filton, Bristol and Broughton in North Wales at Bordeaux. From there, the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon, Gironde, and by oversize road <b>convoys</b> to the <b>assembly</b> hall in Toulouse. New wider roads, canal systems and barges were developed to deliver the A380 parts. After assembly, the aircraft are flown to Hamburg, XFW to be furnished and painted.|$|R

[...] She was brought to a <b>convoy</b> <b>assembly</b> camp at Pithiviers and on 17 July 1942, together with 928 other Jewish deportees, transported to German concentration camp Auschwitz. Upon her arrival there two days later, her forearm was marked with an identification number. She died a month later of typhus. On 6 November 1942 her husband, Michel Epstein, was sent to Auschwitz and immediately sent to the gas chambers.|$|E
50|$|The {{single issue}} driving {{nearly all the}} command's {{functions}} was availability and movement of shipping that was coordinated with the port but not under the sole control of the port. Troops and supplies had {{to be available to}} meet ship availability, the convoy cycle and sailing dates and adjustments made for events concerning ships from mechanical to weather and other demands. Convoy schedules were Navy controlled and all ship sailings required Navy clearance. Convoy schedules were determined in Washington by Navy and War Departments with a pre-sailing convoy conference held by the Office of the Port Director with local Navy, commanders of the escort vessels and masters of the convoy vessels attending to ensure final details of <b>convoy</b> <b>assembly,</b> operation and emergency actions were determined and understood.|$|E
