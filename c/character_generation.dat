5|$|In the remakes, after {{selecting}} a character, the player {{can change the}} character's starting abilities with five magical seeds, given at the tavern. Also, each character has a personality trait which affects {{the growth rate of}} their abilities. The Hero's personality is determined by the player's choices and actions during a dream sequence {{at the start of the}} game, while other characters' personalities are determined by their status at the end of the <b>character</b> <b>generation</b> process. Most personalities are available to both male and female characters, while a few are exclusive to male or female characters. A character's personality can be temporarily changed by equipping certain accessories, or permanently changed by using certain consumable books.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a new {{incremental}} learning strategy for handwritten character recognition systems. This learning strategy enables the recognition system to learn “rapidly” any new character from very few examples. The presented strategy is driven by a confusion detection mechanism {{in order to control}} the learning process. Artificial <b>characters</b> <b>generation</b> techniques are used to overcome the problem of lack of learning data when introducing a new character from unseen class. The results show that a good recognition rate (about 90 %) is achieved after only 5 learning examples. Moreover, the rate quickly rises to 94 % after 10 examples, and approximately 97 % after 30 examples. A reduction of error of 40 % is obtained by using the artificial <b>characters</b> <b>generation</b> techniques...|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{the games}} in SSI's Gold Box series, <b>character</b> <b>generation</b> is greatly simplified. The player chooses a name, by which they are known {{throughout}} the game. There is no race, class or skill selection, and play begins immediately. The single-player character begins the game as a second-level corsair, whose statistics are predetermined; the player cannot upgrade the character's weapons and armor. The character earns experience points by solving puzzles and finishing quests, some of which do not involve combat. The character gains levels in exchange for experience points; gaining levels increases hit points, and grants {{the opportunity to learn}} new skills for combat.|$|E
500|$|Moria (1983) was {{developed}} by Robert Alan Koeneke while a student at University of Oklahoma, inspired by both Adventure and Rogue. Having access to a VAX-11/780, but without the source to Rogue due to computer administrator restrictions, he began trying to recreate Rogue but specifically flavored with the complex underground cave maze {{of the same name}} in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth stories. Following Tolkien's fiction, the player's goal was to descend to the depths of Moria to defeat the [...] Balrog, akin to a boss battle. As with Rogue, levels were not persistent: when the player left the level and then tried to return, a new level would be procedurally generated. Among other improvement to Rogue, Koeneke included a persistent town at the highest level where players could buy and sell equipment, and the use of data structures within the Pascal language allowed him to create a more diverse bestiary within the game. He got help from several playtesters as well as another student, Jimmey Wayne Todd, who helped to program a deeper <b>character</b> <b>generation</b> system. UMoria (short for UNIX Moria) is a close variation on Moria by Jim E. Wilson, making the game more portable to a larger variety of computers while fixing various bugs.|$|E
500|$|The Game Boy Color {{version is}} based on the Super Famicom version. For the North American release of the Dragon Quest III Game Boy Color remake, Enix decided to give the {{packaging}} an anime feel, due to fan demand on Enix's message boards. Both remake versions of Dragon Quest III offer many new features and changes. The game received a new translation, incorporating many adult elements that were cut from its original American release, and becoming the first Game Boy Color RPG with a [...] "Teen" [...] rating. It was also the largest Game Boy Color game released in North America, with 32 Mb ROM and 256Kb of save-state SRAM on one cartridge. A new class, the Thief, was added to the roster in each of the remakes. Many of the names of the classes were changed in the English localization of the Game Boy Color version, such as Soldier to Warrior. Also, in the new versions was the ability to change into the Jester class at Dhama, which was not allowed in the original. New mini-games were added to the remakes, including Pachisi (called Suguroku in Japan / Treasures and Trapdoors as of the Dragon Quest V Remake), which is a giant board game style adventure from which the player can win items. This game {{is based on}} Horii's series Itadaki Street. The Mini Medal system, which lets players collect hidden medals to gain new items, seen in later Dragon Quest games (it originated in [...] ), was added. Another medal system, Monster Medals, lets players collect medals from fallen enemies, was added in Game Boy Color remake, and two players could trade Monster Medals via a Game Link Cable. Two bonus dungeons become available after the main quest is over. The remakes feature updated graphics. An overhauled introduction for the game was made, similar to the one in the original Dragon Quest III, which included Ortega's battle with the Dragon Queen. Monster and attack animation in battles were added, a feature first introduced in [...] A personality system was added to the remakes of Dragon Quest III. A pre-game sequence in which the player answers moral dilemmas similar to that in Ultima IV determines the Hero's personality. The personality of {{the other members of the}} party is determined by the stat-raising seeds that the player gives them during the <b>character</b> <b>generation</b> process. Personalities determine which stats increase when a character levels up. The personalities may be changed by use of special items and books.|$|E

The proposed strategy aims at overcoming the problem of lack of training data when introducing a new character class.

2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} role-playing video game on a microcomputer was Dungeon n Dragons, written by Peter Trefonas and published by CLOAD (1980). This early game, published for a TRS-80 Model 1, was just 16K long and included a limited word parser command line, <b>character</b> <b>generation,</b> a store to purchase equipment, combat, traps to solve, and a dungeon to explore. Other contemporaneous CRPGs (Computer Role Playing Games) were Temple of Apshai, [...] and , the precursor to Ultima. Some early microcomputer RPGs (such as Telengard (1982) or Sword of Fargoal) were based on their mainframe counterparts, while others (such as Ultima or Wizardry, the most successful of the early CRPGs) were loose adaptations of D. They also included both first-person displays and overhead views, sometimes in the same game (Akalabeth, for example, used both perspectives). Most of the key features of RPGs were developed in this early period, prior {{to the release of}} , one of the prime influences on both computer and console RPG development. For example, Wizardry featured menu-driven combat, Tunnels of Doom featured tactical combat on a special [...] "combat screen", and Dungeons of Daggorath featured real-time combat which took place on the main dungeon map.|$|E
