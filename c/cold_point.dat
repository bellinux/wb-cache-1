5000|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that warming of the tropical oceans since a [...] "tipping point" [...] in 2000 may have acted as a negative feedback, reducing the observed warming during the 2000s (decade). As warming and evaporation above the Pacific Ocean, temperatures in the lower stratosphere near the tropopause declined due to both greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances, reducing water vapor levels and removing its warming effect, with vapor concentrations below 2.2 ppmv {{as measured by the}} HALOE instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, in the lower stratosphere of the tropics between 5°N - 5°S first being observed since 2001, although a reversal in this pattern is also likely. The water vapor in the stratosphere arrives through tall thunderstorms, while 15% of this vapor is delivered by tropical cyclones, and through chemical breakdown of methane into water vapor and carbon dioxide, both of which are greenhouse gases. The vapor is frozen out of the stratosphere as more of the water is subjected to temperatures that freeze it out of the stratosphere. Water vapor concentrations in the lower stratosphere have declined by 10% (0.4 ppmv) since 2000, reducing warming during the decade by 25%. A rapid cooling of 4 °C to 6 °C also occurred in the lower stratosphere in the mid-1990s, while the rate of ocean warming increased. During the 1990s, increased stratospheric water vapor led to a 30% increase in warming. After 2000, the sea surface temperatures of the tropical Western Pacific, where a warm pool of water exists and where temperatures are heavily influenced by ENSO, between 10°N - 10°S and 139° - 171° longitude became anti-correlated with temperatures at the tropopause in the same latitudes between 171° - 200° longitude, both measured since the early 1980s; although the correlation had been previously positive, since 2000 the SST anomalies increased while tropopause temperatures decreased. A sharp increase in average SSTs within the Western Pacific warm pool by more than 0.25 °C in 2000, which has since stabilized, occurred as the [...] "cold point" [...] temperature of the study area at the tropopause experienced a significant reduction. This resulted in less water vapor from tropical thunderstorms entering the stratosphere. However, prior to 2000, increases in average Western Pacific SSTs had resulted in increases in tropopause <b>cold</b> <b>point</b> temperatures.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of the sterilization value for low acid foods in retorts includes a critical evaluation of the factory's facilities and utilities, validation of the heat processing equipment (by heat distribution assays), and finally heat penetration assays with the product. The intensity of the heat process applied to the food can be expressed by the Fo value (sterilization value, in minutes, at a reference temperature of 121. 1 °C, and a thermal index, z, of 10 °C, for Clostridium botulinum spores). For safety reasons, the lowest value for Fo is frequently adopted, being obtained in heat penetration assays as indicative of the minimum process intensity applied. This lowest Fo value should always be higher than the minimum Fo recommended for the food in question. However, {{the use of the}} Fo value for the coldest can fail to statistically explain all the practical occurrences in food heat treatment processes.
