5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this <b>could</b> <b>best</b> be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he <b>could</b> <b>best</b> adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E
5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became {{manager of the}} Shuttle Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads <b>could</b> <b>best</b> be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle. During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the White Paper, the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) was set up to examine how expansion at Heathrow <b>could</b> <b>best</b> be accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits the White Paper required. A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the simultaneous use of both runways for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|E
5|$|Recognising {{his stature}} within the archaeological establishment, the {{government}} appointed Wheeler as the British representative on a UNESCO project {{to undertake a}} programme of rescue archaeology in the Nile Valley ahead {{of the construction of}} the Aswan Dam, which was going to flood large areas of Egypt and Sudan. Personally securing UK funding for the project, he deemed it an issue of national and personal shame when he was unable to persuade the British government to supply additional funding for the relocation of the Abu Simbel temples. In October 1968, he took part in a UNESCO visit to Pakistan to assess the state of Mohenjo-daro, writing the project's report on how the archaeological site <b>could</b> <b>best</b> be preserved. His involvement with UNESCO continued {{for the rest of his}} life, and in March 1973 he was invited to the organisation's conference in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Turgenev was {{impressed}} with German society and returned home believing that Russia <b>could</b> <b>best</b> improve itself by incorporating ideas from the Age of Enlightenment. Like many of his educated contemporaries, he was particularly opposed to serfdom. In 1841, Turgenev started his career in Russian civil service and spent two years working for the Ministry of Interior (1843-1845).|$|E
25|$|He {{promoted}} both {{socialism and}} individualism {{and argued that}} the full flowering of the individual <b>could</b> <b>best</b> be realized in a socialist order. He would however always reject grand narratives such as a predestined position for a society to arrive at, and his writings in exile promoted small-scale communal living with the protection of individual liberty by a noninterventionist government.|$|E

25|$|After a near-incident with Spanish {{forces at}} Natchitoches, Wilkinson decided he <b>could</b> <b>best</b> serve his {{conflicting}} interests by betraying Burr's plans to President Jefferson {{and to his}} Spanish paymasters. Jefferson issued an order for Burr's arrest, declaring him a traitor before any indictment. Burr read this in a newspaper in the Territory of Orleans on January 10, 1807. Jefferson's warrant put Federal agents on his trail. Burr twice turned himself in to the Federal authorities. Two judges found his actions legal and released him.|$|E
25|$|Frustrated by the Japanese response, Phan {{turned to}} Liang, who {{explained}} to Phan it was naïve to expect financial {{assistance from the}} Japanese. The Vietnamese people would have to look only within Vietnam for support and financial backing. Liang told Phan that he <b>could</b> <b>best</b> serve the cause by writing and distributing pamphlets advocating for the revolution to rally support from the Vietnamese and others abroad. Phan took Liang's advice very seriously and immediately began to publish materials to obtain support for the revolutionary cause.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{offered the}} throne of Norway to a prince of the Dano-German royal house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. Prince Carl of Denmark was unanimously elected king by the Norwegian Parliament, the first king of a fully independent Norway in 508 years (1397: Kalmar Union); he took the name Haakon VII. In 1905, the country welcomed the prince from neighbouring Denmark, his wife Maud of Wales and their young son to re-establish Norway's royal house. Following centuries of close ties between Norway and Denmark, a prince from the latter was the obvious choice for a European prince who <b>could</b> <b>best</b> relate to the Norwegian people.|$|E
25|$|Dame Cicely Saunders was a British {{registered}} nurse whose chronic health problems had {{forced her to}} pursue a career in medical social work. The relationship she developed with a dying Polish refugee helped solidify her ideas that terminally ill patients needed compassionate care to help address their fears and concerns as well as palliative comfort for physical symptoms. After the refugee's death, Saunders began volunteering at St Luke's Home for the Dying Poor, where a physician told her that she <b>could</b> <b>best</b> influence the treatment of the terminally ill as a physician. Saunders entered medical school while continuing her volunteer work at St. Joseph's. When she achieved her degree in 1957, she took a position there.|$|E
25|$|In 1792–93 {{he succeeded}} in {{carrying}} a Roman Catholic Relief Act conferring the franchise on Catholics; in 1794 in conjunction with William Ponsonby, he introduced a reform bill which was even milder than Flood's bill of 1783. He was as anxious as Flood had been to retain the legislative {{power in the hands}} of men of property. Grattan had a strong conviction that while Ireland <b>could</b> <b>best</b> be governed by the Irish, democracy in Ireland would inevitably turn to plunder and anarchy. At the same time he wished to open membership of the House of Commons to Catholic men of property, a proposal that was the logical corollary of the Relief Act of 1793.|$|E

25|$|Camp Patiya is a 30-acre {{camping and}} day use camp about seven {{miles west of}} Boulder, Colorado. Camp Patiya started by the Camp Fire Girls. The Camp Fire Council {{purchased}} the original twenty acres for the camp in 1960 and began holding group and family camps shortly thereafter. All the buildings on site were constructed between 1963 and 1981. In 1977, an additional ten acres of land was donated, bringing the camp to its present size. Camp Fire continued to hold group camping year round and Day Camps in the summers. In the 1980s, membership in Camp Fire declined. In 1987, {{it was determined that}} the goals for operating the camp <b>could</b> <b>best</b> be met by transferring the ownership to Longs Peak Council, Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
25|$|Bayonetta is {{voiced by}} Hellena Taylor in English and Atsuko Tanaka in Japanese. For the {{original}} game, despite production being based in Japan, Kamiya was particular {{to insist that}} the character have an English voice actor, and had no Japanese voice actor assigned due to his belief that speaking Japanese would not suit the character. Tanaka first voiced the character in the anime , an adaptation of the original Bayonetta, and subsequently assumed the role in Bayonetta 2 and the re-release of the original title on Wii U. Tanaka also voiced the character in commercials for the original game in 2009. She was chosen {{due to the fact that}} her name kept cropping up when the team asked who <b>could</b> <b>best</b> portray the character in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|On 22 April 1918, the {{parliament}} of Transcaucasia voted for independence, declaring {{itself to be}} the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. It was to last for only a month. The new republic {{was made up of}} Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, each with their different histories, cultures and aspirations. The Armenians were well aware of the Armenian Genocide in Turkey, so for them defence against the invading army was paramount, while the Muslim Azeris were sympathetic to the Turks. The Georgians felt that their interests <b>could</b> <b>best</b> be guaranteed by coming to a deal with the Germans rather than the Turks. On 26 May 1918, Georgia declared its independence and a new state was born, the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which would enjoy a brief period of freedom before the Bolsheviks invaded in 1921.|$|E
