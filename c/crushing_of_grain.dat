This paper investigates the hypothesis for {{the mechanism of}} soil creep, which is crack growth induced particle breakage. A mathematical model which is able to simulate the effects of crack growth leading to the <b>crushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> under high stress was discussed in Kwok et al. (2008). This DEM technique was then applied to the simulation of creep in a triaxial test with 378 breakable grains. The DEM results show that crack growth can lead to softening of samples with volumetric contraction due to grain breakage accompanying dilation due to shearing. Creep induced failure might be anticipated when the axial strain reaches about 5 %. The 2 nd International FLAC/DEM Symposium on Numerical Modeling, Melbourne, Australia, 14 - 16 February 2011...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Working out of {{technique}} of synthesizing statistically optimal controllers of induction electric drives with frequency scalar control operating under stochastic loads. Methodology. It is shown, {{that one of}} the ways of increasing the energy efficiency of induction electric drives at random changes of loads is to create closed systems of electric drives with statistically optimal regulators that would take into account the stochastic nature of the disturbances and acted as filters of occasional high frequency fluctuations. The structure of such controls depends on the statistical characteristics of stochastic loads – correlation function and spectral density. In this mode, the minimum loss in dynamic mode with random intensive changed loads is provided by criterion of minimum mean square error of optimal parameter control. In the case of frequency controlled electric drive such a parameter is the optimum rotor flux. Results. The optimal structures of regulators of electric drives under stochastic loads according to type of random disturbances are identified. Originality. The technique of statistically optimal synthesis with feature of the expansion of a random process load on average, served as a useful signal, and high-frequency fluctuations around the average value, served as barrier, is developed.

The purpose of the analysis is to forecast the development of permanent normalised axial deformations ▫$/epsilon_ 1 ^{p*}$▫ regarding the number of loading cycles N and appurtenant stress states during cycling loading. The analysis used the results of tests performed by ZAG Ljubljana and Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geodesy (FGG) of the University of Ljubljana [1]. The analysis considers five types of stonematerials of different quantity <b>of</b> <b>crushed</b> <b>grains</b> in the mixture and of different water contents. Four types of stone materials are mixtures of different portions <b>of</b> <b>crushed</b> <b>grains</b> larger than 2 mm (Dcr = 87. 7 %, 58. 9 %, 32. 6 % in 0 %), and of the water content around w = wopt - 2 %. The stone material with portions <b>of</b> <b>crushed</b> <b>grains</b> larger than 2 mm Dcr= 58. 9 % is analysed also for water content w = wopt + 0. 7 %. The results of the analysis are deformations expressed {{as a function of the}} number of loading cycles N, and a spherical component of the repeated loading p and a distortional component of the repeated loading q. The results can be presentedas deformation surfaces in the ▫$/epsilon_ 1 ^{p*}$▫ - p - q space for an arbitrary number of cycles N. The relation between the spherical stress component p and the distortional stress component q, at arbitrary values of axial permanent deformations ▫$/epsilon_ 1 ^{p*}$▫, gives a failure envelope, and the so called deformation envelopes in the p - q space. The failure envelopes and deformation envelopes are given separately for five types of stone material. The deformation envelopes are low at small values of the axial permanent deformation ▫$/epsilon_ 1 ^{p*}$▫ When permanent axial deformations grow, the permanent deformation approaches the failure envelopes. The failure envelopes for individual types of stone material agree with research results performed by [1]. The analysis of permanent deformations also shows their dependence on the portion <b>of</b> <b>crushed</b> material Dcr in the mixture <b>of</b> <b>crushed</b> and uncrushed stone material. The deformation envelope for uncrushed stone material is situated in the lowest position, regarding the portion <b>of</b> <b>crushed</b> material in the mixture. With an increased portion <b>of</b> <b>crushed</b> material in the mixture <b>of</b> <b>crushed</b> and uncrushed stone material, the deformation envelope is also higher, similarly to the lawfulness of failure envelopes.

The strength of brittle particles seems to be quite well described by a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Nevertheless, such a distribution predicts that failure is possible under any level of applied stress. On the contrary a three-parameter Weibull distribution contains a stress threshold under which grain failure is unlikely.

40|$|Porous {{sandstones}} represent classical reservoirs {{for water}} or hydrocarbons. Deformation in such granular material {{is due to}} tectonic events and occurs {{through the process of}} cataclasis, implying the <b>crushing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grains</b> to a diversity of smaller clasts. Cataclasis is generally accompanied by porosity and permeability decrease. Although it is known that cataclastic deformation localizes to form individual bands and clusters of bands, the parameters controlling the distribution of this deformation were not well understood until recently. We used scanline measurements to show a favoured localization and clustering of the deformation on the case of normal-fault stress regime and potentially in strike-slip fault regime. The reverse regime favours the formation of distributed networks of conjugate deformation bands. At the scale of a cluster, field data reveals that the minimum modal <b>grain</b> size value <b>of</b> the host sandstone(s) controls the band density. Finally, microscopic cathodoluminescence analysis reveals enhanced quartz cementation for high degree of cataclasis. Hence, because band clustering, high degree of cataclasis and band cementation are favoured in normal-fault stress regime, tectonic extension appears to be favourable conditions for the formation of efficient barriers to fluid-flow in porous sandstone reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Reduction of {{porosity}} in sandstones {{with increasing}} burial {{is a function}} of mechanical compaction causing reorganization and <b>crushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> with increasing pressure, and chemical compaction, mainly precipitation of authigenic quartz cement as temperatures reaches 70 - 80 ºC and above. The amount of mechanical compaction is governed by the initial lithological and textural features of the sediments. The precipitation of authigenic quartz can be reduced if efficient grain coats exist on detrital quartz grains. This study investigates the parameters related to the reservoir quality of the Stø formation, the processes occurring during burial, the initial composition of the sediments and how they relate. Well data and thin section samples from the Stø formation the two wells, 7120 / 2 - 3 S and 7120 / 12 - 2, situated in the western parts of the Hammerfest basin in the Southwestern Barents Sea were examined using a petrographical and petrophysical approach. The well logs were utilized in a petrophysical investigation, and thin sections were investigated using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscope. The sandstones of the Stø formation were seen to consist of highly matures quartz arenites with the major difference in initial composition between the units being the clay content, related to the depositional setting. The depositional settings observed ranged from upper shoreface beach/barrier bar deposits to more distal offshore deposits. The Stø formation in well 7120 / 2 - 3 S have been subjected to more extensive burial and higher temperatures resulting in the formation of more quartz cement than the formation in well 7120 / 12 - 2. The Stø formation in well 7120 / 2 - 3 consisted of a lower unit of consistently clean sands with porosities around 12 - 15 % and significant quartz cement, and an upper unit with higher porosities of around 15 - 18 % and less quartz cement interpreted to be caused by allogenic grain coats corresponding to the higher clay content. The Stø formation in well 7120 / 12 - 2 consisted of two clean sandstone units in the upper and lower parts of the formation with good porosities of 20 - 25 % and a more extensive unit with higher clay content and frequent clay laminated horizons most likely reducing vertical permeability...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to stress, high porosity sandstones tend to deform and localize strain {{in the form}} of deformation bands, which form by rotation, sliding and potentially <b>crushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains.</b> Contrary to slip surfaces and fractures, these planar and tabular strain localization features are not discontinuities within the host rock volume in which they form; instead they maintain or enhance its cohesion, generally reducing porosity and permeability. This research used outcrop analogs widely exposed in western USA to investigate deformation bands of highly porous sandstones formed under contractional tectonic regimes, evaluating their potential impact in terms of sandstone reservoirs in comparable settings, while comparing them with high porous deformation of sandstones in extensional regimes. This analysis included character, spatial distribution and evolution, as well as interpretation of controlling mechanisms of such deformation. Two particular settings were examined: fault-propagation-folding and footwalls of long distance overthrusts. In both cases, a temporal evolution of deformation band formation is proposed, (Papers I and IV). For the fault-propagation fold, a flow simulation model was created using the field observations (Paper II), while for the overthrust system, {{a detailed description of the}} microstructure mechanisms, and resulting petrophysical properties of the sandstone layer is presented (Paper III). Regarding tectonic regimes, this research provides additional evidences for the claim that contraction-induced deformation band arrangements are less prone to cluster and that such bands tend to be more broadly spaced than their extensional counterparts. Such anticlustering prevents them from becoming effective precursors for large offset faults, with the exception of meso-scale slip surfaces. The second major difference between deformation band formation in different tectonic regimes is that, in addition to the cataclastic shear bands (CSB) characteristic of extensional regimes, two types of deformation bands exist, apparently restricted to the contractional regime, namely pure compaction bands and shear enhanced compaction bands (PCB and SECB); pure compaction bands are posited as being the porous sandstone equivalent to stylolites, as they reveal consistent orientations perpendicular to the maximum principal stresses in our study areas. Our analyses show that for reservoirs analogous to the contractional structures analysed, the effect of deformation bands is negligible for fluid flow at reservoir (km) scale, unless permeability contrast is equal or higher than three orders of magnitude between deformation bands and host rock and combined with long term production. In the latter case, the wider spacing of contractional arrangements of deformation bands allows for a better (albeit slower) sweep of reservoirs. </p...|$|R

Conical pick is one of the coal cutting tools. The tip of the pick is made of WC-Co material. As coal and rock are heterogeneous elements, they pose various constraints during excavation. As a result the tools wear out during the process. Other parameters like cutting techniques, tool orientation, and environmental conditions also affect the tool significantly. The wearing phenomenon greatly reduces the service life of the tools and thereby cuts down the production rate.

40|$|This study {{provides}} an example of a high-quality fluvial hydrocarbon reservoir that was completely destroyed by hydrothermal processes. The reservoir unit was deposited in the Cameros Basin, located in the NW sector of the Iberian Chain (Spain). The basin was filled with clastic fluvial deposits (sandstones and conglomerates) between Late Berriasian and Early Aptian times. Provenance of sands was mainly from coarse crystalline rocks. A humid tropical climate produced intense weathering of K-feldspar during transport from source to basin. Thus, a mineralogically mature rigid framework with high porosity existed at the time of deposition, which would have constituted a high-quality hydrocarbon reservoir. At present however, the porosity of the reservoir is negligible. Porosity was reduced by a sequence of diagenetic processes: (1) mechanical compaction (i. e. <b>crushing</b> <b>of</b> metamorphic lithic <b>grains)</b> and chemical compaction, (2) kaolinite and siderite cementation, and (3) early quartz cementation. Hydrocarbon emplacement probably occurred between phases (2) and (3). A low-grade metamorphic (hydrothermal) event, reaching greenschist facies, took place during the Late Cenomanian. It dramatically reduced the remaining porosity of the reservoir and destroyed the hydrocarbon charge. Hydrothermal processes which affected the sandstones include (1) re-compaction; (2) late quartz cementation and silicification of remaining feldspars; (3) carbonate cementation; (4) chloritization of feldspars, metamorphic lithic fragments and intrabasinal argillaceous grains; and (5) growth of pyrite and chloritoid crystals on argillaceous material of intrabasinal, extrabasinal or even diagenetic origin. Hydrocarbons that migrated to the margins of the basin escaped these hydrothermal modifications and were preserved.

The author gives an equation of the increment of energy dissipated per unit volume in grain crushing in the form; δW_c=pδν_c. Based {{on a few}} assumptions, the increment of volumetric strain due to grain crushing δν_c is determined experimental]y {{as a function of}} effective mean stress p. Hence, the non-recoverable energy change per unit volume δW is divided into two components, namely the energy loss in grain crushing δW_c and the energy dissipated in the interparticle relative motion (sliding and rolling) δW_s. Thus, the axial strain ε_ and volumetric strain ν_s due solely to the interparticle relative motion are derived from the measured axial strain ε_ 1 and volumetric strain ν, respectively. Obtained values of ε_ and ν_s are utilized for the examination of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> during shear, in the light of Rowe's stress-dilatancy theory. This procedure is applied to the results of triaxial tests on a sand under various high confining pressures, up to 500 kg per sq. cm. It is shown that the relation curves between stress ratio (σ'_ 1 /σ'_ 3) and dilatancy factor (1 -δν_s/δε_) tend to move along the K_cυ line...|$|R

Riots for grain, tumultuous Assemblages demanding to have the price <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> fixed abound far and near. The Mayor of Paris and other poor Mayors are like to have their difficulties. Petion was re-elected Mayor of Paris; but has declined; being now a Convention Legislator. Wise surely to decline: for, besides this <b>of</b> <b>Grains</b> and all the rest, there is in these times an Improvised insurrectionary Commune passing into an Elected legal one; getting their accounts settled,--not without irritancy! Petion has declined: nevertheless many do covet and canvass. After months of scrutinising, balloting, arguing and jargoning, one Doctor Chambon gets the post of honour: who will not long keep it; but be, as we shall see, literally <b>crushed</b> out <b>of</b> it.
