5|$|A team of {{scholars}} worked from 1040 to 1044 to compile the Wujing Zongyao {{with the intent}} to collect all known military knowledge and to disseminate it to a wider government audience. Its <b>chief</b> <b>editor,</b> Zeng Gongliang, was assisted by the prominent astronomer Yang Weide and the scholar Ding Du.

5|$|When {{it came to}} {{building}} up a new newspaper, Kringen had a certain personal drive, as he ran for parliament in 1909. When he lost the election, he also lost interest to a certain degree.
