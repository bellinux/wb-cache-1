The {{purpose of}} this {{experimental}} work is to develop some basic insight into the pre-buckling behavior and the buckling transition toward plastic collapse of a granular silo by studying different patterns of deformation generated on thin paper cylindrical shells during granular discharge. We study the <b>collapse</b> <b>threshold</b> considering {{the influence of the}} bed heights, flow rates and grain sizes. We compare the patterns that appear during the discharge of spherical beads, with those obtained in the axially compressed cylindrical shells. When the height of the granular column is close to the <b>collapse</b> <b>threshold,</b> we observe a ladder like pattern that rises around the cylinder surface in a spiral path of diamond shaped localizations, and develops into a plastic collapsing fold that grows around the collapsing silo. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{majority}} of two-alternative forced choice (2 AFC) psychophysics {{studies have examined}} speed-accuracy trade-offs either in free-response or fixed viewing time paradigms with no hard time constraints on responding. Under response deadlines, reward maximization requires participants to modulate decision thresholds {{over the course of}} a trial such that when the deadline arrives a response is ensured despite the possible reduction of accuracy to the chance level. Importantly, this normative <b>threshold</b> <b>collapsing</b> process should take account not only of the deadline time but also the participants’ level of timing uncertainty about the deadline. For instance, for a given level of timing uncertainty participants facing a more stringent deadline and for a given deadline participants with higher timing uncertainty should start <b>collapsing</b> <b>thresholds</b> earlier within a trial(Frazier, P., & Yu, A. J. (2008). Sequential hypothesis testing under stochastic deadlines. Advances In Neural Information Processing Systems, 20, 465 - 472). We tested human participants in random dot motion discrimination task in three different conditions: free-response paradigm and with two different response deadlines (800 and 1000 ms). We also quantified the level of timing uncertainty using two different temporal reproduction tasks. Micro speed-accuracy trade-off curves suggested that participants might have <b>collapsed</b> <b>thresholds</b> within a trial when facing a response deadline; however, observed performance diverged markedly from optimality. Participants did not take account of either response deadline times or their timing uncertainty. Our findings define a limit on the optimal temporal risk assessment performance of humans. We also consider other possible sources of observed reduction in accuracy as response times approach the deadline, through simulations of data using empirical model parameters...|$|R

They are most probably not due to any resonant wave-wave interactions such as the electrostatic decay instability because their wavelengths are much shorter than those of Langmuir waves. The Langmuir waves occur as coherent field structures with peak intensities exceeding the Langmuir <b>collapse</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Their scale sizes are of the order of the wavelength of an ion sound wave. These Langmuir wave field characteristics indicate that the observed short wavelength {{ion sound waves}} are most probably generated during the thermalization of the burnt-out cavitons left behind by the Langmuir collapse. Moreover, the peak intensities of the observed short wavelength ion sound waves are comparable to the expected intensities of those ion sound waves radiated by the burnt-out cavitons. However, the speeds of the electron beams derived from the frequency drift of type III radio bursts are too slow to satisfy the needed adiabatic ion approximation. Therefore, some non-linear process such as the induced scattering on thermal ions most probably pumps the beam excited Langmuir waves towards the lower wavenumbers, where the adiabatic ion approximation is justified...|$|R

40|$|Threshold {{machines}} are Turing machines whose acceptance {{is determined by}} what portion of the machine's computation paths are accepting paths. Probabilistic {{machines are}} Turing machines whose acceptance {{is determined by the}} probability weight of the machine's accepting computation paths. In 1975, Simon proved that for unboundederror polynomial-time machines these two notions yield the same class, PP. Perhaps because Simon's result seemed to <b>collapse</b> the <b>threshold</b> and probabilistic modes of computation, the relationship between threshold and probabilistic computing for the case of bounded error has remained unexplored. In this paper, we compare the bounded-error probabilistic class BPP with the analogous threshold class, BPP path, and, more generally, we study the structural properties of BPP path. We prove that BPP path contains both NP BPP and P NP[log], and that BPP path is contained in P Σ p 2 [log], BPP NP, and PP. We conclude that, unless the polynomial hierarchy <b>collapses,</b> bounded-error <b>threshold</b> computation is strictly more powerful than bounded-error probabilistic computation. We also consider the natural notion of secure access to a database: an adversary who watches the queries should gain no information about the input other than perhaps its length. We show, for both BPP and BPP path, that if there is any database for which this formalization of security differs from the security given by oblivious database access, then P 6 = PSPACE. It follows that if any set lacking small circuits can be securely accepted, then P 6 = PSPACE...|$|R
40|$|Perceptual {{decision}} making {{has been successfully}} modeled {{as a process of}} evidence accumulation up to a threshold. In order to maximize the rewards earned for correct responses in tasks with response deadlines, participants should <b>collapse</b> decision <b>thresholds</b> dynamically during each trial so that a decision is reached before the deadline. This strategy ensures on-time responding, though at the cost of reduced accuracy, since slower decisions are based on lower thresholds and less net evidence later in a trial (compared to a constant threshold). Frazier & Yu (2008) showed that the normative rate of threshold reduction depends on deadline delays and on participants’ uncertainty about these delays. Participants should start <b>collapsing</b> decision <b>thresholds</b> earlier when making decisions under shorter deadlines (for a given level of timing uncertainty) or when timing uncertainty is higher (for a given deadline). We tested these predictions using human participants in a random dot motion discrimination task. Each participant was tested in free-response, short deadline (800 ms), and long deadline conditions (1000 ms). Contrary to optimal-performance predictions, the resulting empirical function relating accuracy to response time (RT) in deadline conditions did not decline to chance level near the deadline; nor did the slight decline we typically observed relate to measures of endogenous timing uncertainty. Further, although this function did decline slightly with increasing RT, the decline was explainable by the best-fitting parameterization of Ratcliff's diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978), whose parameters are constant within trials. Our findings suggest that at the very least, typical decision durations are too short for participants to adapt decision parameters within trials...|$|R

40|$|This thesis principally {{concentrates}} on the prevention of degrade due to collapse during the controlled kiln drying of timber. Collapse is an abnormal shrinkage which occurs in wood during drying to fibre saturation point (FSP). Formation of internal checking {{is often associated with}} it. Collapse is particularly common in native Australian eucalypt timbers. Specific work was also performed on the drying of karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor F. Muell) and brushbox (Tristania conferta R. Br.) as part of the commercialisation process of the Clever Kiln Controller® (CKC). The CKC is a personal computer based kiln control package which uses sensed acoustic emissions (AE) and on-line modelling of drying to optimise the seasoning process. Collapse shrinkage occurs {{as a result of the}} physical flattening of water filled fibre cells due to the action of internal tension. The work on collapse presented in this thesis begins with stress-strain modelling of a single fibre under such conditions. This model predicted that collapse of fibres is precipitated at the inner fibre wall, and that fibre collapse is strongly dependant on temperature. Following the predictions of the single fibre model and observations of drying trials, the concept of a "collapse threshold temperature" was introduced. If wood at moisture content (MC) above FSP is dried at temperatures above the <b>collapse</b> <b>threshold</b> temperature, then it will collapse. If it is dried at temperatures below the <b>collapse</b> <b>threshold</b> temperature, then it will not collapse. This concept was first tested on a 20 m 3 kiln load of Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Past {{decades of}} {{research}} within the area of decision-making has had a large focus on advancing process models, which are models that contain theoretically meaningful parameters, {{in order to better}} understand the processes that underlie decision-making. One of the most popular types of process models within decision-making research has been evidence accumulation models (EAMs), which propose that decision-making is made up of some process where evidence for the various alternates accumulate {{over the course of a}} decision, until the evidence reaches some threshold value, where the decision is triggered. Importantly, EAMs have enjoyed a great deal of success in being fit to empirical data, being able to successfully account for a wide range of phenomena and helping to answer theoretical questions that would have been near impossible without the use of a process model. This thesis aims to accomplish 3 main goals with EAMs: to extend EAMs to new research areas to help solve novel empirical questions, to test newly proposed components that could potentially be added to existing EAMs, and to propose a new method of how to test between models in the EAM framework to answer empirical research questions. The first goal is addressed in Chapters 2 and 3, which applies the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) to personality and genetics research, respectively, which are two areas previously unexplored with EAMs. The second goal is addressed in Chapters 4 and 5, which assesses whether a newly proposed component of EAMs, a threshold that decreases over the course of a trial (collapsing threshold; or a mathematically similar urgency signal), can be justified in empirical data. The final goal is addressed in Chapter 6, which presents a new method of calculating Bayes factors - a method of selecting between competing models - for the LBA using Monte-Carlo integration and general-purpose graphics processing unit computing. Generally speaking, the findings indicate that EAMs are capable of extending to the fields of personality and genetics, that the proposed component of a <b>collapsing</b> <b>threshold</b> is not necessarily justified within the EAM framework, and that the use of Bayes factors through Monte-Carlo integration improves upon previous methods of model selection...|$|R
30|$|The {{application}} of the linear ARX-structured modeling method is {{under the assumption that}} the power system to be modeled is relatively linear around certain operation points. Although the power system is nonlinearin nature, the operating point of the large-scale power grid does not change dramatically generally. The power system shows linear characteristics most of the time and thus ARX-structured method may have merit in bulk power grid modeling [24]. However, when a series of disturbances are increasingly stressing the system, the system will become less and less stable so that the trained ARX model will tend to be less accurate to estimate the dynamic response under the changed topology, which will be reflected as the accuracy index becoming lower. The threshold for the instability early warning was obtained when the system under the marginally stable situation after cascading outage.

40|$|A {{key problem}} in {{neuroscience}} is understanding {{how the brain}} makes decisions under uncertainty. Important insights have been gained using tasks such as the random dots motion discrimination task in which the subject makes decisions based on noisy stimuli. A descriptive model known as the drift diffusion model has previously been used to explain psychometric and reaction time data from such tasks but to fully explain the data, one is forced to make ad-hoc assumptions such as a time-dependent collapsing decision boundary. We show that such assumptions are unnecessary when decision making is viewed {{within the framework of}} partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We propose an alternative model for decision making based on POMDPs. We show that the motion discrimination task reduces to the problems of (1) computing beliefs (posterior distributions) over the unknown direction and motion strength from noisy observations in a Bayesian manner, and (2) selecting actions based on these beliefs to maximize the expected sum of future rewards. The resulting optimal policy (belief-to-action mapping) is shown to be equivalent to a <b>collapsing</b> decision <b>threshold</b> that governs the switch from evidence accumulation to a discrimination decision.

We compare levels of secondary extinctions in communities generated by four structural food-web models and a fifth null model in response to sequential primary species removals. We focus on various aspects of food-web structural integrity including robustness, community <b>collapse</b> and <b>threshold</b> periods, and how these features relate to assumptions underlying different models, different species loss sequences and simple measures of diversity and complexity. Hierarchical feeding, a fundamental characteristic of food-web structure, appears to impose a cost in terms of robustness and other aspects of structural integrity. However, exponential-type link distributions, also characteristic of more realistic models, generally confer greater structural robustness than the less skewed link distributions of less realistic models. In most cases for the more realistic models, increased robustness and decreased levels of web collapse are associated with increased diversity, measured as species richness S, and increased complexity, measured as connectance C. These and other results, including a surprising sensitivity of more realistic model food webs to loss of species with few links to other species, are compared with prior work based on empirical food-web data...|$|R
