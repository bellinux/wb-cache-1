The performance was witnessed and described by Simon Forman in his manuscript The Book of Plays and Notes thereof per Formans for <b>Common</b> <b>Policy.</b> His account, however, does not establish whether the play was Shakespeare's Macbeth or a work on the same subject by another dramatist. The role may have been beyond the talents of a boy actor {{and may have been}} played by a man in early performances.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{public opinion}} on <b>common</b> European <b>policies</b> in foreign affairs and defence. It proposes three models of support for <b>common</b> <b>policies</b> in these fields. Drawing on Eurobarometer data, the analysis shows that instrumental self-interest and territorial identities contribute considerably to explaining support for common foreign affairs and defence policies. Moreover, support for <b>common</b> <b>policies</b> is strongly driven by domain-specific evaluations of the European Union's performance. These findings suggest that popular support for <b>common</b> European <b>policies</b> in foreign affairs and defence has an experiential base. Thus, elites {{have an incentive to}} respond to public opinion when making policy decisions, so this analysis supports the liberal view in international relations rather than the realist account...|$|R

In later life, some people discovered letters on government and institution files showing that their parents had tried to make contact, or have them returned home.|$|E

An administrative position but it was decided that the Secretary-General would also be appointed High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). In this role he represented the EU abroad where there was an agreed <b>common</b> <b>policy.</b> He took up the post on 18 October 1999, shortly after standing down from NATO. The post has a budget of €40 million, most of which goes to Balkan operations. From 25 November 1999 he was also appointed Secretary-General of Western European Union (WEU), overseeing the transfer of responsibilities from that organisation to the CFSP. In 2004 his 5-year mandate was renewed. He has also become president of the European Defence Agency.|$|E

500|$|Influential as Stubbs was, it {{was long}} before this view was challenged. In a 1960 article, titled [...] "Edward III and the Historians", May McKisack pointed out the teleological nature of Stubbs' judgement. A medieval king could not be {{expected}} to work towards the future ideal of a parliamentary monarchy; rather his role was a pragmatic one—to maintain order and solve problems as they arose. At this, Edward III excelled. Edward had also been accused of endowing his younger sons too liberally and thereby promoting dynastic strife culminating in the Wars of the Roses. This claim was rejected by K.B. McFarlane, who argued that this was not only the <b>common</b> <b>policy</b> of the age, but also the best. Later biographers of the king such as Mark Ormrod and Ian Mortimer have followed this historiographical trend. The older negative view has not completely disappeared; as recently as 2001, Norman Cantor described Edward III as an [...] "avaricious and sadistic thug" [...] and a [...] "destructive and merciless force." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1802, {{during its}} {{annexation}} to France under Napoleon I, the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Chambéry, but the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the 1816 Treaty of Turin stipulated that [...] in territories {{transferred to a}} now considerably extended Geneva the Catholic religion was to be protected, and that no changes were {{to be made in}} existing conditions without agreement with the Holy See. Napoleon's <b>common</b> <b>policy</b> was to emancipate Catholics in Protestant-majority areas, and the other way around, as well as emancipating Jews.

2500|$|Ion Antonescu and his {{subordinates}} were for long {{divided on the}} issue of the Final Solution, as applied in territories under direct Nazi control from 1941. At an early stage, German attempts to impose the RSHA's direct control over Old Kingdom Jews drew some objections from Mihai Antonescu, but the two sides agreed to a <b>common</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to Soviet Jews. In various of his early 1940s statements, Ion Antonescu favorably mentions the Axis goal of eliminating the Jewish presence in the event of victory. The unrestrained character of some Romanian actions toward Jews alarmed Nazi officials, who demanded a methodical form of extermination. When confronted with German decisions to push back Jews he had expelled before the occupation of Transnistria, Antonescu protested, arguing that he had conformed with Hitler's decisions regarding [...] "eastern Jews". In August 1941, in preparation for the Final Solution's universal application, Hitler remarked: [...] "As for the Jewish question, today in any case one could say that a man like Antonescu, for example, proceeds much more radically in this manner than we have done until now. But I will not rest or be idle until we too have gone all the way with the Jews." ...|$|E
2500|$|Professing {{a belief}} that {{politics}} should not interfere with sport, Muldoon resisted pressure to bar the 1981 Springbok Tour by the Springboks, the national rugby squad of apartheid-era South Africa. By allowing [...] "the Tour", Muldoon was accused of breaking the 1977 Gleneagles Agreement (to form a <b>common</b> <b>policy</b> on sporting with South Africa amongst the Commonwealth, signed after the boycott of the Montreal Olympics in 1976). Muldoon noted, however, that the Gleneagles Agreement had been amended and, {{in an article in}} The Times, that he had not broken the Gleneagles Agreement because [...] "New Zealand and subsequently other countries {{made it clear that they}} could not subscribe to an agreement which required them to abrogate the freedoms of their sportsmen and prohibit sporting contacts". [...] "The Tour", as it has become known, provoked massive public demonstrations, the formation of public pressure group Halt All Racist Tours (HART) and some of the worst social schisms New Zealand has ever seen. Muldoon came down firmly on the pro-Tour side, arguing that sport and politics should be kept separate. He argued that his refusal to ban the Springboks was anti-authoritarian, leaving it up to individual consciences whether to play sports with representatives of apartheid. He also argued that allowing their rugby team to tour did not mean supporting apartheid any more than playing a Soviet Union team meant supporting Communism.|$|E

6000|$|The {{character}} of the times aggravated these suspicions. [...] "In those days there was no king in Israel." [...] Since the departure of James VI. to assume the richer and more powerful crown of England, there had existed in Scotland contending parties, formed among the aristocracy, by whom, as their intrigues at the court of St. James's chanced to prevail, the delegated powers of sovereignty were alternately swayed. The evils attending upon this system of government resembled those which afflict the tenants of an Irish estate, the property of an absentee. There was no supreme power, claiming and possessing a general interest with the community at large, to whom the oppressed might appeal from subordinate tyranny, either for justice or for mercy. Let a monarch be as indolent, as selfish, as much disposed to arbitrary power as he will, still, in a free country, his own interests are so clearly connected {{with those of the}} public at large, and the evil consequences to his own authority are so obvious and imminent when a different course is pursued, that <b>common</b> <b>policy,</b> as well as common feeling, point to the equal distribution of justice, and to the establishment of the throne in righteousness. Thus, even sovereigns remarkable for usurpation and tyranny have been found rigorous in the administration of justice among their subjects, in cases where their own power and passions were not compromised.|$|E
60|$|As to the {{question}} of secession and rebellion being one and the same thing, the point to me does not seem to bear an argument. The confederation of States had a common army, a <b>common</b> <b>policy,</b> a common capital, a common government, and a common debt. If one might secede, any or all might secede, and where then would be their property, their debt, and their servants? A confederation with such a license attached to it would have been simply playing at national power. If New York had seceded--a State which stretches from the Atlantic to British North America--it would have cut New England {{off from the rest of}} the Union. Was it legally within the power of New York to place the six States of New England in such a position? And why should it be assumed that so suicidal a power of destroying a nationality should be inherent in every portion of the nation? The Slates are bound together by a written compact, but that compact gives each State no such power. Surely such a power would have been specified had it been intended that it should be given. But there are axioms in politics as in mathematics, which recommend themselves to the mind at once, and require no argument for their proof. Men who are not argumentative perceive at once that they are true. A part cannot be greater than the whole.|$|E
