5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of Vesta is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E

5|$|A {{scenario}} <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> phylogenetic, {{ice sheet}} size, and sea-level depth data is {{that during the}} Late Pleistocene the sea levels were at their lowest. A single wave of wolf colonization into North America commenced {{with the opening of}} the Bering land bridge 70,000YBP. It ended with the closing of the Yukon corridor that ran along the division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet 23,000YBP during the Late Glacial Maximum. As wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but the genetic ancestry of modern wolves could be traced back only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through genetic admixture. The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> findings of earlier studies.|$|E
