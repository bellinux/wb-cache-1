5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} <b>catalyst</b> <b>for</b> {{oxidation}} reactions; in fact it {{is somewhat}} too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a <b>catalyst</b> <b>for</b> the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E

But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only <b>catalyst</b> <b>for</b> Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{storage and}} {{conversion}} schemes based on environmentally benign chemical fuels {{will require the}} discovery of faster, cheaper, and more robust <b>catalysts</b> <b>for</b> the oxygenevolution reaction (OER). Although the incorporation of pendant bases into molecular <b>catalysts</b> <b>for</b> hydrogen production and utilization has led to enhanced turnover frequencies, the analogous incorporation of pendant bases into molecular <b>catalysts</b> <b>for</b> water oxidation has received little attention. Herein, the syntheses, structures, and catalytic activities of new iron complexes with pendant bases are reported. Of these new complexes, [Fe(L 1) ] 2 + {L 1 = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'- bis(pyridazin- 3 -ylmethyl) ethane- 1, 2 -diamine} is the most active catalyst. Initial turnover frequencies of 141 and 24 h - 1 were measured by using ceric ammonium nitrate at pH 0. 7 and sodium periodate at pH 4. 7, respectively. These {{results suggest that the}} incorporation of pendant bases into molecular <b>catalysts</b> <b>for</b> water oxidation might be an effective strategy that can be considered in the development of new <b>catalysts</b> <b>for</b> the OER, but will require the careful balance of many factors. © 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
