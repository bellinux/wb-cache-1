5|$|During certain {{situations}} the player {{will be put}} in a perilous situation, where they will be prompted to choose between two possible actions or suffer a certain penalty, if not instant death. These choices affect how the story unfolds and which ending is achieved. Additionally, a creature called Nemesis is encountered multiple times throughout the game as a recurring boss. Nemesis is considerably more powerful than the player and has the ability to use a rocket launcher as a weapon, dodge incoming fire, and pursue the player from one area to the next. During one of these encounters, the player can choose to either fight Nemesis or run until he is evaded. A variety of encounters are possible, with some being mandatory, and some varying in nature and location based on certain choices made by the player. Even if evaded or defeated during one of these encounters, Nemesis will inevitably <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>pursue</b> the player {{until the end of the}} game.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of which language is preferred in Singapore {{seem to have}} caused a debate among the Chinese Singaporeans recently. The {{question of}} declining standards in the command of the Chinese language amongst Chinese Singaporeans seems to cause several revisions in the government's education policies towards the Chinese language. The government of Singapore's continued policy towards bilingualism for all Chinese Singaporeans, which is to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>pursue</b> English as the first language while making Mandarin the lingua franca (or at least the 2nd language or home language) amongst all Chinese has drawn mixed responses. The more English-speaking Chinese Singaporeans generally prefer English as the lingua franca or their home language, while the Mandarin-speakers worry that English will replace Mandarin as the lingua franca, which would eliminate the thin thread of Chinese identity altogether. With the rising economy of China in the 21st century, {{which has led to}} more Singaporean companies requiring fluency in Mandarin, Mandarin has been viewed with greater importance amongst the Singaporean Chinese than before. Both English and Mandarin will continue to dominate the language scene among Chinese Singaporeans.|$|E

25|$|On 8 April the 2nd Battalion {{started on}} a long march towards Winzlar and moved into the corps reserve, being {{replaced}} in front by the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division. 2nd Ox and Bucks moved on transport from Winzlar to Heitlingen. On 14 April the battalion advanced through Celle and {{spent the night in}} nearby woods and on 15 April whilst moving to the village of Nettelkamp, east of Uelzen, they were bombed by Jet planes. The 2nd Ox and Bucks encountered heavy enemy resistance at Kahlstorf, near Emern, on 16–17 April and sustained 25 casualties; there were many enemy bomb attacks and the battalion then moved to the hamlet of Gross Pretzier. The battalion moved through Rosche then Katzien and were at Ebstorf from 23 April to 29 April. After leaving Ebstorf on foot, D Company 2nd Ox and Bucks took over as the spearhead of the British Army's advance across Northern Germany. A few miles north of Ebstorf D Company 2nd Ox and Bucks discovered a satellite of Bergen Belsen concentration camp. They were ordered to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>pursue</b> the enemy; the camp guards had already fled. The 2nd Ox and Bucks crossed the River Elbe on 30 April and the advance continued through Nostorf, Schwartow and Lutterstorf to Bad Kleinen, {{on the banks of the}} Schweriner See. On 2 May 1945 2nd Ox and Bucks moved eastwards along the same routes that units of the German army complete with heavy tanks, troop carriers and heavy artillery were travelling westwards determined to surrender to the British army and escape from the Soviet army. Many German soldiers and refugees were unable to move to the British army controlled area and were forced into Soviet captivity. The battalion linked up with the Soviet Red Army near the Baltic port of Wismar on 3 May 1945.|$|E
