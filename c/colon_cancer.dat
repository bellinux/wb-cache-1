50|$|Thus, {{there are}} three {{mechanisms}} that {{may be responsible for}} the low level of protein expression of ERCC1 in 84% to 100% of sporadic <b>colon</b> <b>cancers.</b> From results in gliomas and in cadmium carcinogenesis, methylation of the ERCC1 promoter may be a factor.

40|$|Human <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> {{commonly}} harbor loss {{of function}} mutations in APC, a repressor of the canonical WNT pathway, thus leading to hyperactive WNT-TCF signaling. Re-establishment of Apc function in mice, engineered to conditionally repress Apc through RNAi, resolve the intestinal tumors formed due to hyperactivated Wnt-Tcf signaling. These and other results have prompted the search for specific WNT pathway antagonists as therapeutics for clinically problematic human <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> and associated metastases, which remain largely incurable. This widely accepted view seems at odds {{with a number of}} findings using patient-derived material: Canonical TCF targets are repressed, instead of being hyperactivated, in advanced <b>colon</b> <b>cancers,</b> and repression of TCF function does not generally result in tumor regression in xenografts. The results of a number of genetic mouse studies have also suggested that canonical WNT-TCF signaling drives metastases, but direct in vivo tests are lacking, and, surprisingly, TCF repression can enhance directly seeded metastatic growth. Here we have addressed the abilities of enhanced and blocked WNT-TCF signaling to alter tumor growth and distant metastases using xenografts of advanced human <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> in mice. We find that endogenous WNT-TCF signaling is mostly anti-metastatic since downregulation of TCF function with dnTCF generally enhances metastatic spread. Consistently, elevating the level of WNT signaling, by increasing the levels of WNT ligands, is not generally pro-metastatic. Our present and previous data reveal a heterogeneous response to modulating WNT-TCF signaling in human cancer cells. Nevertheless, the findings that a fraction of <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> tested require WNT-TCF signaling for tumor growth but all respond to repressed signaling by increasing metastases beg for a reevaluation of the goal of blocking WNT-TCF signaling to universally treat <b>colon</b> <b>cancers.</b> Our data suggest that WNT-TCF blockade may be effective in inhibiting tumor growth in only a subset of cases but will generally boost metastases...|$|R

5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2â10% of endometrial cancer cases. Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40â60%risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before <b>colon</b> <b>cancer,</b> on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} mismatch repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2â3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E
5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, as a recent {{meta-analysis}} including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that Î²-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of <b>colon</b> <b>cancer.</b> Beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological studies {{indicate}} {{an association between}} reproductive hormonal factors and <b>colon</b> <b>cancers.</b> The present study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of hormonal variations of the menstrual cycle on the mucin histochemistry of normal colonic mucosa and to analyse its significance in relation to <b>colon</b> <b>cancers.</b> METHODS: Fifty three specimens of colon from both 33 reproductive age group females and 20 postmenopausal females were analysed for mucin histochemistry.

CONCLUSIONS: A postulated mechanism for an estrogenic effect include an increased production of bile acids which may act as either promoter or carcinogen in colonic cancers.

40|$|Germline {{mutations}} of the PTEN/MMAC 1 /TEP and LKB 1 genes cause hamartomas {{to develop}} in the gastrointestinal tracts of patients with Cowden syndrome and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, respectively. PTEN mutations may also be responsible for some cases of juvenile polyposis. Histologically, hamartomas appear benign, but there is good evidence that in these syndromes, the hamartomas can progress to colorectal carcinoma. It remains unknown whether or not cancers that develop from hamartomas acquire a spectrum of mutations {{similar to those in}} sporadic <b>colon</b> <b>cancers.</b> PTEN and LKB 1 are candidate genes for mutations in sporadic <b>colon</b> <b>cancers,</b> either as initiating events in tumorigenesis or providing a selective advantage during tumor growth. Using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis, we have screened a set of sporadic <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> for somatic mutations in PTEN and LKB 1. No variants predicted to alter protein function were detected in LKB 1, but 1 of 72 cancers showed a somatic mutation in PTEN, together with allele loss. This cancer did not have a detectable APC mutation or allele loss at APC. It remains possible that PTEN and LKB 1 are inactivated in other sporadic <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> by means such as deletion or promoter methylation. Like BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, however, it appears that PTEN and LKB 1 mutations can cause cancers when present in the germline, but occur rarely in the soma...|$|R
