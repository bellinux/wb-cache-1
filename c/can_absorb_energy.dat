Zeroken cannot perform the ability at first, but after he forgives himself for abandoning Goldion previously, he both unlocks an Overload of his own and is able to use the Final Skill on Bloodis. Unknown to anyone, Goldion is restored to normal but hides this fact; knowing that the group is too weak to challenge Void Dark, he plans to use his position as Bloodis to protect them from Void Dark and train them to challenge Void Dark. At this point, Void appears and easily defeats the group, but they are saved when Void is alerted that they have found an Overload which <b>can</b> <b>absorb</b> <b>energy.</b> The rebel army assumes this is to empower Alma Ice Sculptor, but in reality it is needed to empower Broken Faith Magia to be strong enough to resurrect Lieze as a fully living person rather than a mindless corpse.
