40|$|This paper {{addresses}} geometric {{problems in}} manufacturing objects by casting. In casting, molten material is {{poured into the}} cavity of the cast and allowed to solidify, after which the cast is removed. The cast has two <b>cast</b> <b>parts</b> to be removed in opposite directions. To manufacture more complicated objects, the cast may also have a side core to be removed in a direction skewed to the removal directions for the <b>cast</b> <b>parts.</b> We address the following problem: Given an object and the removal directions for the <b>cast</b> <b>parts</b> and the side core, can a cast be constructed such that the <b>cast</b> <b>parts</b> and the side core can be removed in the directions specified without colliding with the object or each other? We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the problem, {{as well as a}} discrete algorithm to perform the test in O(n(3) log n) time for polyhedral objects, where n is the number of vertices, edges, and facets. If the test result is positive, a cast with complexity O(n(3)) can be constructed within the same time bound.

50|$|Slip-casting methods provide {{superior}} surface quality, {{density and}} uniformity in casting high-purity ceramic raw materials over other ceramic casting techniques, such as hydraulic casting, since the <b>cast</b> <b>part</b> {{is a higher}} concentration of ceramic raw materials with little additives. A slip is a suspension of fine raw materials powder in a liquid such as water or alcohol with small amounts of secondary materials such as dispersants, surfactants and binders. Pottery slipcasting techniques employ a plaster block or flask mould. The plaster mould draws water from the poured slip to compact and form the casting at the mould surface. This forms a dense cast removing deleterious air gaps and minimizing shrinkage in the final sintering process.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the whole}} {{workpiece}} may be {{inserted into the}} die, the sizing operation can give dimensional accuracy to {{a portion of the}} part based on the contact with the die. Sizing is mostly used to give a forged or <b>cast</b> <b>part</b> better dimensional accuracy. Mated surfaces between touching parts like gears are often sized. The sizing operation also provides a better surface hardness and finish to the workpiece. Also, the sized surface of the workpiece gets denser and stronger when the operation is performed. The dimensional tolerance of the operation is about 0.025 mm. Primary pressing or a compacting die are typically used when sizing small batches of compact. To keep costs down, larger batches of compact usually have a specialized die made specifically for the operation.|$|E
50|$|AutoCAST is a {{software}} program for casting methods design, simulation and optimization developed by IIT Bombay. It uses geometric reasoning for automating the design of casting methods elements - cores, mold cavity layout, feeders, feedaids and gating channels. Fast and intelligent simulation technology is employed to visualize mold filling and casting solidification in near-real time. Foundry engineers can quickly import a 3D model of <b>cast</b> <b>part,</b> create methods elements, simulate the casting, predict internal defects (like shrinkage porosity and sand inclusion), and modify the methods design to improve quality and yield. Product designers can improve the casting design for manufacturability by minor modifications, such as fillets at junctions. This enables better compatibility between part requirements and process capability, leading to zero defects.|$|E
