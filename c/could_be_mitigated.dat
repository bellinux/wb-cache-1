25|$|In 2013 ONS {{commissioned}} a review led by Professor Chris Skinner of LSE {{to assess the}} robustness of the methodology and statistical research; identify where evidence could be significantly improved; and what the main risks were with the likely approach and how these riskes <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>mitigated.</b> Aside {{from a number of}} recommendations of further work to be undertaken the Review report, published in November 2013 concluded that of the two leading options, online census and administrative data, the online census approach would provide a robust methodology to succeed the 2011 census, whereas the administrative data approach whilst potentially offering some advantages did not as yet have a sufficiently developed methodology to replace the present questionnaire surveying approach.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the new project was that Director T-10 {{encountered}} difficulties in calculating the target velocity by differentiating the target position. Due to discontinuities, variations and noise in the radar signal, the position derivatives sometimes fluctuated wildly and this caused erratic motion in the servomechanisms of the gun because their control signal {{was based on the}} value of the derivatives. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>mitigated</b> by smoothing or averaging out the data but this caused delays in the feedback loop that enabled the target to escape. As well, the algorithms of Director T-10 required a number of transformations from cartesian (rectangular) to polar coordinates and back to Cartesian, a process that introduced additional tracking errors.|$|E
25|$|The {{main concern}} with {{gasoline}} on the environment, {{aside from the}} complications of its extraction and refining, is the potential effect on the climate through the production of carbon dioxide. Unburnt gasoline and evaporation from the tank, when in the atmosphere, reacts in sunlight to produce photochemical smog. Vapor pressure initially rises with some addition of ethanol to gasoline, but the increase is greatest at 10% by volume. At higher concentrations of ethanol above 10%, the vapor pressure of the blend starts to decrease. At a 10% ethanol by volume, the rise in vapor pressure may potentially increase the problem of photochemical smog. This rise in vapor pressure <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>mitigated</b> by increasing or decreasing the percentage of ethanol in the gasoline mixture.|$|E

500|$|Perl {{has been}} {{referred}} to as [...] "" [...] by some programmers who claim its syntax makes it a write-only language. The earliest such mention was in the first edition of the book Learning Perl, a Perl 5 tutorial book written by Randal L. Schwartz, in the first chapter of which he states: [...] "Yes, sometimes Perl looks like line noise to the uninitiated, but to the seasoned Perl programmer, it looks like checksummed line noise with a mission in life." [...] He also stated that the accusation that Perl is a write-only language could be avoided by coding with [...] "proper care". The Perl overview document perlintro states that the names of built-in [...] "magic" [...] scalar variables [...] "look like punctuation or line noise". The perlstyle document states that line noise in regular expressions <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>mitigated</b> using the /x modifier to add whitespace.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} edition of The Population Bomb began with this statement: [...] "The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s {{hundreds of millions}} of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate..." [...] Ehrlich argued that the human population was too great, and that while the extent of disaster <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>mitigated,</b> humanity could not prevent severe famines, the spread of disease, social unrest, and other negative consequences of overpopulation. By the end of the 1970s, this prediction proved to be incorrect. However, he continued to argue that societies must take strong action to decrease population growth in order to mitigate future disasters, both ecological and social.|$|E
2500|$|Then in late September {{he began}} reading [...] "for amusement" [...] the 6th edition of Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population which {{reminded}} him of Malthus's statistical proof that human populations breed beyond their means and compete to survive, {{at a time when}} he was primed to apply these ideas to animal species. Malthus had softened from the bleakness of the earlier editions, now allowing that the population crush <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>mitigated</b> by education, celibacy and emigration. Already Radical crowds were demonstrating against the harsh imposition of Malthusian ideas in the Poor Laws, and a slump was resulting in mass emigration. Lyell was convinced that animals were also driven to spread their territory by overpopulation, but Darwin went further in applying the Whig social thinking of struggle for survival with no handouts. His views were secular, but not atheistic. He asked how God's laws had produced [...] "so high a mind" [...] as ours, with purpose shown by descent geared towards the [...] "production of higher animals", suggesting that [...] "we are [...] step towards some higher end".|$|E

2500|$|The {{review of}} the Bail Act 2013 by John Hatzistergos {{investigated}} whether the risk management approach adequately reduced {{the risk that the}} accused would endanger others' safety, commit a serious offence while on bail, interfere with witnesses in their case, or not attend court; whether the Act was balanced in looking after the safety of the community as well as the rights of the accused; and looking at bail decisions. The review found that the two-stage test as to whether a risk was 'unacceptable' but <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>mitigated</b> through bail conditions was confusing to the public, and recommended that the test be altered so that an 'unacceptable risk' was defined as a risk that would preclude granting bail. It recommended adding the following reasons to the 'unacceptable risk' test: the criminal connections of the accused, the views of the victim or the victim's family (for serious offences and where known), and the conduct of the accused toward the victim and his or her family after the event. The review noted that there was little guidance as to what constituted a serious offence. Reforms to the Bail Act passed parliament in September 2014. The burden of proof was placed on people accused of [...] "the most serious crimes" [...] to show why they should be released on bail. The amendment incorporated all the recommendations of the review.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the four}} {{existing}} state institutions, the Party, the Chamber of Fasci and Corporations, the Senate and the Grand Council, {{only the last}} two were suitable for an action: the Senate because there were still quite a few anti- or pre-Fascist members, and the Grand Council since several members were against the Duce. In the event, a motion by 61 senators on 22 July asking to convene the Senate was blocked by Mussolini, and only the Mussolini {{had the power to}} summon the Grand Council and determine its agenda. In those days, the only gerarca (except Roberto Farinacci, who started from opposite premises) with a clear plan to exit from the impasse was Dino Grandi. His idea was to depose Mussolini, let the king make a government without Fascists, {{and at the same time}} attack the German army in Italy. Only thus was there a chance that the declaration of Casablanca <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>mitigated</b> in the case of Italy. Later, the new Party Secretary, Carlo Scorza also developed his plan. Like Farinacci, for him the only solution was the political [...] "embalming" [...] of Mussolini and the pursuit of a total war, but while Farinacci acted in close cooperation with the Germans, Scorza thought that the power should be assumed directly by the Party, which had been largely discredited in the previous few years. On 13 and 16 July several Fascists led by Farinacci met in the main seat of the Party in Piazza Colonna, and decided to go to Mussolini in Palazzo Venezia to ask for the convocation of the Grand Council. At the end of the meeting, Mussolini surprisingly consented to convoke the supreme assembly of Fascism.|$|E

30|$|The {{quality of}} iris images <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{affected}} {{by a variety of}} factors. As this quality degradation significantly influences the performance of feature extraction and matching processes, it must be handled properly. In general, one can classify the underlying factors in two main categories namely, noncooperative subject behavior and non-ideal environmental illumination. Although the effects of such factors <b>could</b> partially <b>be</b> <b>mitigated</b> by means of a robust feature extraction strategy, they must be alleviated in the image enhancement module as well, making texture features more salient.|$|R
30|$|Further {{improvements}} for {{estimating the}} position of the bolt plates <b>could</b> <b>be</b> realised by incorporating different feature sets into the visual analytics approach. For example, ambiguities associated with the class of target identification methods based on signal strength alone <b>could</b> <b>be</b> significantly <b>mitigated</b> through the use of resonant frequency target identification techniques (Hargrave et al. 2013), which have remarkable properties for aspect-independent imaging. The features extracted using this technique <b>could</b> <b>be</b> incorporated into the classifier algorithm to further refine the discrimination results.|$|R

50|$|However, {{this effect}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> largely <b>mitigated,</b> even reversed, by {{a release of}} {{enormous}} quantities of water vapor and carbon dioxide caused by the initial global heat pulse after the impact.

50|$|In the {{computer}} desktop/workstation world, the transputer was fairly fast (operating at about 10 MIPS at 20 MHz).

This <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>mitigated</b> to a large extent if machines had used multiple transputers as planned, but T800s cost about $400 each when introduced, which meant a poor price/performance ratio. Few transputer-based workstation systems were designed; the most notable probably being the Atari Transputer Workstation.|$|R
50|$|The risk {{management}} plan should propose applicable and effective security controls for managing the risks.
