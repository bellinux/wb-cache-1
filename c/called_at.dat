5|$|A Junkers F.13 <b>called</b> <b>at</b> Lympne on 10 January 1923 {{to clear}} customs and then flew to Croydon where it was {{inspected}} by Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare. In February, {{it was reported that}} Lympne had taken part in a test of the newly introduced Mayday radio signal used by aircraft to indicate that they were in distress. Georges Barbot won a prize of F.25,000 from Le Matin when he made a flight from St Inglevert to Lympne and back again on the same day, 6 May. He flew the route in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine. On landing a bracing wire in the undercarriage of the aircraft broke, but repairs were effected within half an hour. Problems starting the engine then delayed his departure slightly. On 28 October the Light Aircraft Trials were held (see below). In 1923, Air Union started a service flying newspapers to Lympne using a Farman F.60 Goliath.|$|E
