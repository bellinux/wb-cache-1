25|$|According to Lovell {{this did}} not {{represent}} {{as much of a}} disruption as Dee believed; to some extent, the klystron work at Birmingham had been instigated by the Army for GL purposes, so it was not entirely fair to complain. Lovell's primary task during this period was developing a <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> system that improved the accuracy of the radar beam many times, enough to allow it to be used directly to lay the guns (that is, about the same accuracy as optical instruments). This did not really require much effort, and would be useful for any centimetric radar, including AIS.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cavity magnetron in 1940 allowed radars to operate effectively at much shorter microwave wavelengths, which reduced the antennas to only a few centimetres long. These antennas were so short {{that they could be}} placed in front of parabolic reflectors, which focused the signal into a very tight beam. Instead of the broadcast pattern being as much as 150 degrees wide, typical microwave designs might have a beam width of perhaps 5 degrees. Using a technique known as <b>conical</b> <b>scanning,</b> a rotating version of lobe switching, this could be further reduced to well under ½ a degree, more than enough to directly lay the guns.|$|E

Basically <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> (of the non-revolving {{nutating}} feed type), {{the size of}} the scan cone cyclically increased and decreased roughly twice a second. The scanned area was several degrees, in all. (Once the target was acquired, the operator switched to <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> for tracking.) ...|$|R
2500|$|The Würzburg D was {{introduced}} in 1941 and added a <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> system, using an offset receiver feed called a Quirl (German for whisk) that spun at [...] The resulting signal was slightly offset from the centreline of the dish, rotating around the axis and overlapping it in the centre. If the target aircraft was {{to one side of}} the antenna's axis, the strength of the signal would grow and fade as the beam swept across it, allowing the system to move the dish in the direction of the maximum signal and thereby track the target. The angular resolution could be made smaller than the beam width of the antenna, leading to much improved accuracy, on the order of 0.2degrees in azimuth and 0.3degrees in elevation. Earlier examples were generally upgraded to the D model in the field.|$|E
50|$|<b>Conical</b> <b>scanning</b> is {{a system}} used in early radar units to improve their accuracy, as well as {{making it easier to}} steer the antenna {{properly}} to point at a target. <b>Conical</b> <b>scanning</b> is similar in concept to the earlier lobe switching concept used on some of the earliest radars, and many examples of lobe switching sets were modified in the field to <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> during World War II, notably the German Würzburg radar. Antenna guidance can be made entirely automatic, as in the American SCR-584. Potential failure modes and susceptibility to deception jamming led to the replacement of conical scan systems with monopulse radar sets. They are still used by the Deep Space Network for maintaining communications links to space probes. The spin-stabilized Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 probes used onboard <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> maneuvers to track Earth in its orbit.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} a <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> versus a linear scan {{multispectral}} scanner (MSS) instrument on a small local-user data processing facility was studied. User data requirements were examined to determine the unique system rquirements for a low cost ground system (LCGS) compatible with the Earth Observatory Satellite (EOS) system. Candidate concepts were defined for the LCGS and preliminary designs were developed for selected concepts. The {{impact of a}} <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> MSS versus a linear scan MSS was evaluated for the selected concepts. It was concluded that there are valid user requirements for the LCGS and, {{as a result of}} these requirements, the impact of the conical scanner is minimal, although some new hardware development for the LCGS is necessary to handle <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> data...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} a <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> versus a linear scan {{multispectral}} scanner (MSS) instrument was studied in terms of: (1) design modifications required in framing and continuous image recording devices; and (2) changes in configurations of an all-digital precision image processor. A baseline system was defined to {{provide the framework for}} comparison, and included pertinent spacecraft parameters, a conical MSS, a linear MSS, an image recording system, and an all-digital precision processor. Lateral offset pointing of the sensors over a range of plus or minus 20 deg was considered. The study addressed the <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> impact on geometric, radiometric, and aperture correction of MSS data in terms of hardware and software considerations, system complexity, quality of corrections, throughput, and cost of implementation. It was concluded that: (1) if the MSS data are to be only film recorded, then there is only a nomial concial scan impact on the ground data processing system; and (2) if digital data are to be provided to users on computer compatible tapes in rectilinear format, then there is a significant <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> impact on the ground data processing system...|$|R

40|$|A new {{scanning}} {{laser head}} {{is designed to}} use single Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) for performing measurements up to {{6 degrees of freedom}} (DOF) at a target. The scanning head is supported by a rotating hollow shaft, which allows the laser beam to travel up to the scanning head from an opposite direction where an LDV is set up. The scanning head is made of a set of two mirrors, which deflects the laser beam with an angle so that the rotation of the scanning head produces a <b>conical</b> <b>scan.</b> When measurements are performed at {{the focal point of the}} <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> then three translational vibration components can be measured, otherwise the very small circle scan, before and after the focal point, can measure up to 6 degrees of freedom, including three translations and three rotations.

50|$|<b>Conical</b> <b>scanning</b> {{was similar}} in concept to lobe switching, {{but as the}} name implies it was {{operated}} in a rotary fashion instead of two directions. This allowed the operator to get a 2-D view of which direction had the strongest return, and was much easier to operate as a result. However, <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> could only easily be used on an antenna with a single feed horn, which is only practical with microwave radars. As such systems were introduced into service, lobe switching generally disappeared.|$|E
50|$|Monopulse radar is a {{radar system}} that compares the {{received}} signal {{from a single}} radar pulse against itself in order to compare the signal as seen in multiple directions, polarizations, or other differences. The most common form is an adaptation of <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> radar which compares the return from two directions to directly measure {{the location of the}} target. This avoids problems in decoding conventional <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> systems, which can be confused by rapid changes in signal strength. The system also makes jamming more difficult. Most radars designed since the 1960s are monopulse systems.|$|E

40|$|Terrain-disrupted {{turbulent}} airflow creates windshear to aircraft at the Hong Kong Interna-tional Airport (HKIA). Better {{knowledge of}} the structures of the turbulent airflow will aid detection of the windshear and understanding of its impact on aircraft. A methodology is developed here to identify Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) from the turbulent airflow sampled by Doppler velocity measurements of LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) sys-tems at HKIA. As a demonstration of this methodology, strong southerly flow associated with a tropical cyclone in April 2008 is analyzed. In this methodology, a variational method is first applied to the <b>conical</b> <b>scans</b> of the radial velocity from the LIDAR to derive the 2 D wind field. Lagrangian airflow analysis is then used to identify the LCS in the airflow as revealed in the 2 D wind data. The Lagrangian flow field is integrated in backward and forward time to locate updraft and downdraft in the flow, respectively. The results are compared with the vertical scans of the LIDAR which have not {{been used in the}} Lagrangian flow analysis. It is found that the updraft and downdraft identified from the Lagrangian flow analysis of the LIDAR <b>conical</b> <b>scans</b> are generally consistent with the airflow convergence and divergence as analyzed from the LIDAR vertical scans. The 2 D Lagrangian flow analysis presented in the study, therefore, provides a way to infer the vertical air motion from the <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> data of the LIDAR. This finding may lead to significant progress in LIDAR-based windshear detection, because the vertical wind shear component so far could not be measured directly by LIDAR or other ground-based weather sensors. 1 1...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Conical</b> <b>scanning</b> {{addresses}} {{this problem}} by [...] "moving" [...] the radar beam slightly off center from the antenna's midline, and then rotating it. Given an example antenna that generates a beam of 2 degrees width [...] - [...] fairly typical [...] - [...] a <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> radar might move the beam 1.5 degrees {{to one side of}} the centerline by offsetting the feed slightly. The resulting pattern, at any one instant in time, covers the midline of the antenna for about 0.5 degrees, and 1.5 degrees to the side. By spinning the feed horn with a motor, the pattern becomes a cone centered on the midline, extending 3 degrees to the sides in our example.|$|E
50|$|German Würzburg radar was {{susceptible}} to Window attack. The short wavelength allowed {{the use of}} short strips which fell only slowly, giving the cloud a long dispersion time.
