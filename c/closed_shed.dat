5000|$|Cavendish's {{equipment}} was remarkably sensitive for its time. The force involved in twisting the torsion balance was very small, , about [...] {{of the weight}} of the small balls. To prevent air currents and temperature changes from interfering with the measurements, Cavendish placed the entire apparatus in a wooden box about 2 ft thick, 10 ft tall, and 10 ft wide, all in a <b>closed</b> <b>shed</b> on his estate. Through two holes in the walls of the shed, Cavendish used telescopes to observe the movement of the torsion balance's horizontal rod. The motion of the rod was only about 0.16 in. Cavendish was able to measure this small deflection to an accuracy of better than one hundredth of an inch using vernier scales on the ends of the rod.Cavendish's accuracy was not exceeded until C. V. Boys' experiment in 1895. In time, Michell's torsion balance became the dominant technique for measuring the gravitational constant (G) and most contemporary measurements still use variations of it. This is why Cavendish's experiment became the Cavendish experiment.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of parity of female goat, social ranking and ovulatory responses of does during seasonal anestrus period by exposure to male effect. Materials and methods: The {{study was conducted}} on a flock of Baladi goats at the animal farm of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University during November 2014 to January 2015. A total of 54 healthy Baladi goats comprising of 4 males and 50 females aging 12 - 18 months were used for this study. The goats were raised under indoor raising system, and were released to graze during daylight hours and returned to <b>closed</b> <b>shed.</b> The animals were fed dehydrated alfalfa granules and mixed fodder. The goats were given water ad libitum. Sexual behavioral patterns of both male and female goats were observed. During estrus behavioral resposes shown by the does, blood samples were collected from the goats for the examination of luteinizing hormone (LH). Results: The mounting activity were higher in males in contact with multiparouse females than those of nulliparouse ones. The sexually experienced does induce the activation of L. H hormones leading to stimulation of estrus responses of does. Thats why social ranking of does had a significant effect on sexual behavior of bucks when exposed to does during anestrus period. LH hormones secretion in 2 nd week in female exposure to males was higher than those of 1 st week of exposure at both multiparous and nulliparous females. Conclusion: It concluded that visual, alfactactory, auditory contact with the male stimulate estrus response of anestrus females to be sexually responsive resulting in an increase in the economic gain of goat farm.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{dehydration}} curve and nutritional value of Tifton 85 bermudagrass at two cutting heights from ground level (4 and 8 cm) during 120 days of storage in a <b>closed</b> <b>shed.</b> The dehydration curve was determined using samples from the entire plant at eight different times. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with plots subdivided per times and five replicates. The second step consisted of assessing the nutritional value of the stored Tifton 85 bermudagrass in randomized blocks with plots subdivided per times and two treatments per plot: cutting height of four and eight centimeters from the ground, and five different times for the subplots, with five replicates. Dehydration of Tifton 85 bermudagrass at the two heights occurred in 48 hours, considered an ideal time for hay drying. The dry matter content responded quadratically to the time of storage of the two heights, only differing during baling and after 120 days of storage. Crude protein content had a quadratic behavior in the two cutting heights, with the smallest value after 30 days of storage (107. 0 g kg- 1) and the largest after 90 days (147. 8 g kg- 1) in the cutting height of eight centimeters. The ether extract exhibited a quadratic behavior in the two cutting heights, only differing after 90 days of storage. The neutral detergent fiber content had linear positive response according to the time of storage, with no difference between the cutting heights. For the neutral detergent fiber content in the two cutting heights, the quadratic regression model was the best fit to the data, differing between the heights after 30 and 60 days of storage. In vitro dry matter digestibility and in vitro cell wall digestibility values of the stored hay were lower than the values obtained at the time of cutting. Cutting performed at four centimeters from the ground was the most suitable for hay production due to higher dry matter production and nutritional value without difference between bailing treatments. Hay storage caused undesirable changes in the nutritional value, especially in fiber content and in vitro digestibility...|$|E
40|$|Grooming is an {{important}} factor on animal resistance to ticks. Rhipicephalus microplus is the most pathogenic cattle tick in Brazil causing death in susceptible animals. Cortisol is the hormone of stress. The influence of grooming on tick infestation and serum cortisol level was studied in 16 Holstein heifers from fifth to eight-month-old. They were infested with 10, 000 larvae in June/ 20 / 2011. Half of them used a necklace made of wood strips and had an infestation chamber made by cotton cloth covering about 50 cm diameter of the shaved flank, fixed at the skin in both sides with adhesive to prevent larvae to escape from the infestation chamber and the amount of larvae was divided into the two chambers. Such artifacts had the purpose to avoid grooming. The heifers remained all the tick parasitic life cycle in individual pens inside a <b>closed</b> <b>shed</b> at Instituto de Zootecnia, in Nova Odessa, São Paulo State. Tick females bigger than 4. 5 mm were counted in the right side from day 20 to 22 after the artificial infestation. The tick recovery rate was calculated by adding and multiplying by two the number of ticks counted, assuming that 5, 000 female larvae had infested the cattle. Immediately before infestation (day 0) and in day 2, day 8, and day 17 after infestation, blood samples were collected using vacuum tubes, in the morning (8 : 30 – 10 : 00 A. M.). Cortisol was measured by immunoassay (EIA) and the D. O. (optical density) at 420 nm was converted in ng of cortisol/mL of serum sample. The experimental design was randomized with 8 replications. Data from serum cortisol were analyzed using the General linear models of the SPSS® statistical package (version 12. 0) using the presence of the artifacts (necklace and chamber) and sampling day as independent variables and serum cortisol as the dependent variable. In the analyse of tick recovery rate, the presence of artifacts was the independent variable and tick recovery rate the dependent variable. The presence of chamber and necklace did not affect the cortisol level, although they had prevented grooming. Consequently, animals with the artifacts had more ticks than the ones with no artifacts (34. 56 % versus 14. 9 % tick recovery rate, P< 0. 05). The last blood sample collection had revealed an increase on the cortisol level, coinciding with the final parasitic life cycle of R. microplus (Table 1). No significant correlation were detected between cortisol levels and the tick recovery rate. Grooming is important to decrease the cattle tick infestation, but its limitation presented in this study, did not elevate the serum cortisol level, related to animal stress...|$|E
