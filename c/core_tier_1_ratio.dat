40|$|This paper {{starts with}} the {{observation}} that the average issue size during 2012 of contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds was more than $ 1 bn. Typically a CoCo is converted in shares when a pre-defined capital ratio such as the <b>core</b> <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> <b>ratio</b> (CT 1) drops below a minimum level. In some other cases, the contingent convertibles investors will suffer from a pre-defined haircut in stead of a conversion into shares. Investors could dynamically hedge the equity exposure embedded within a contingent convertible by taking an offsetting short position in the underlying shares. This dynamic hedging can in some circumstances {{have a negative impact}} on the share price of the bank. It could indeed lead to a spiral of falling share prices. This so-called death spiral effect can only be avoided if the size of the contingent convertible is moderate compared to the amount of outstanding public traded shares. In this contribution we advocate the use of contingent debt where there is more than one conversion trigger. Banks should move away from one large single CoCo issue towards issues with multiple accounting triggers spread across an extended range. This will alleviate the death spiral risk. The expected dynamic behavior of a CoCo bond has been modeled using a credit derivates approach. From these models we then quantify the equity sensitivity and the negative gamma resulting from the design of a contingent convertible and illustrate the possible pitfalls of a death spiral on the share price. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|This thesis studies {{credit risk}} {{determinants}} in the Chinese banking industry. Generally speaking, bank credit risk {{is influenced by}} macroeconomic conditions, counterparty characteristics, and bank-specific factors. Various credit risk assessing models {{could be used to}} quantify the effects of different credit risk determinants. Chinese banks are researching and developing appropriate and advanced credit risk systems to narrow the gap with foreign banks. This paper establishes and estimates a credit risk model for the Chinese banking industry taking into account the data for the period from 2002 to 2009. The empirical results suggest a significant and fairly robust relationship between credit risks and key factors including the microeconomic factors (total loan ratio, loan loss provision, <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> capital <b>ratio,</b> and bank size) and macroeconomic factors (gross domestic product (GDP) growth, consumer price index (CPI) growth, and unemployment rate). The author also raises the issue of whether the determinants of non-performing loans are or are not similar between national commercial banks (NCBs) and urban commercial banks (UCBs). By comparing the regression results, it is found that five factors: total loan <b>ratio,</b> <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> <b>ratio,</b> bank size, GDP growth and unemployment rate, have major influences on NCB credit risk, meanwhile, UCB credit risk is significantly affected by loan loss provision, <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> <b>ratio,</b> CPI growth and unemployment rate...|$|R

The results of the empirical analysis indicate that bank CDS spreads, both in the pre-crisis period, but especially in the crisis period, reflect the risk captured by bank balance sheet ratios.

By considering the heterogeneity among the banks of the list, an explanation of the probability of highly sever losses is offered by considering the previous variables with the addition of interbanking assets. By using a probit model we find a confirmation of the new rules, inspired by the Basel 3 Accord and by the Financial Stability Board, requiring a solid patrimonial structure, in particular for the “too big to fail” financial institutions, accompanied by a medium return in order to assure a low probability to suffer losses. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three papers addressing different aspects of financial markets and macroeconomic activities. Firm Risks, Credit, and Labor Market Fluctuations studies the effect of changes in firm risks on the cyclical properties of the labor market. I develop a general equilibrium model in which the adjustment of employment is costly. Financial frictions arise from the limited liability property of the contract between lenders and firms. The changes in firm risks alter the amount of debt that firms can borrow to finance their working capital. This mechanism amplifies labor market fluctuations and displays a countercyclical external finance premium, consistent with the empirical evidence. Shadow Banks and Stabilization Policies studies the interaction between commercial banks and shadow banks {{and the effect of}} stabilization policies. I develop a general equilibrium model in which the shadow banks obtain loans from commercial banks in the form of short-term collateralized debt. The moral hazard creates volatile leverage of shadow banks, which makes the economy more vulnerable to economic shocks. Upon an aggregate disturbance, a stabilization policy in the form of direct lending is relatively more efficient than policies aimed at the shadow-banking sector.

40|$|Since the 2005 the {{relevance}} of the disclosure on company’s risks as well as the systems for risk management has increased and this is probably due to the major importance assigned to such information by the International accounting standards (particularly IFRS 7 and IAS 32) and the EU directive 51 / 2001. In this paper are presented the results of an empirical analysis carried out on the annual reports of Italian banks listed to the segment “FTSE All Share” of the Milan Stock Exchange. The main objectives of the research are: - Evaluate the propensity of the banks to report voluntary the information about their risks; - Analyze the attributes (qualitative vs. quantitative, past oriented vs. forward-looking orientation, etc.) of the risk disclosure; - Assess if some relations exist between the quantity of the risk disclosure and other key risk indicators such as the <b>TIER</b> <b>1</b> <b>ratio</b> and the Beta. The findings of our analysis reveal that the risk disclosure concerns almost entirely the mandatory information that the company must produce according to Italian law (particularly the “Circolare 262 / 2005 ” of Bank of Italy) whilst the voluntary disclosure is significant less extended than the mandatory one. The normative requirements influence the content of the external reporting so as the major part of the information regard those elements (type of risks, actions of risk management, units involved in the risk management processes, etc) that the company must produce to comply with the aforementioned Law. The analysis of data shows that a significant relation exists between the quantity of the risk disclosure that concerns credit risk, market risk and operational risk and the level of company’s risk. This means that those banks {{with a high level of}} inherent risk (measured by the Tier <b>1</b> <b>ratio)</b> and a high level of systematic risk (measured by the Beta) disclosure more information on risks. This mean that risk reporting could be seen by the financial statement’s prepares as a mean for reducing the perception of the bank’s risk profile that the stakeholders could have if they use other risk indicators as the Tier <b>1</b> <b>ratio</b> or the Beta...|$|R
40|$|We use data on {{loan loss}} {{provisions}} and total loans over the period spanning 1995 until 2009 to estimate a stress testing model for the Luxembourg banking sector. The sample encompasses the recent global crisis and covers {{a period in which}} the average probability of default of the Luxembourg banking sector?s counterparties is observed to increase significantly. A joint model, consisting of several macroeconomic variables and the logit-transformed probability of default, is specified and estimated via seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). The results suggest that counterparty default rates are significantly affected by the euro area real GDP growth rate, the real interest rate and a domestic property price index. Conversely, changes in the Luxembourg real GDP growth rate have a much smaller effect on counterparty risk. We attribute this to the large number of foreign subsidiaries operating within Luxembourg. The estimated model is then used to simulate values of the probability of default and the macroeconomic variables over a horizon of 10 quarters. This allows us to construct distributions for the probability of default under both baseline and adverse scenarios. From the results of these simulations stressed Basel II <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> capital <b>ratios</b> are calculated and compared to their associated unstressed capitalization levels. Our calculations suggest that, under all the given adverse macroeconomic scenarios, the aggregate Luxembourg financial sector remains above the 4 % minimum Basel II <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> capital requirement.

We use the panel data set of bank leverage and <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> capital <b>ratio.</b> Our dataset comprises the 172 French banks; commercial banks, cooperative banks, investment banks and saving banks covering the period of 2002 to 2012. We estimate models with generalized method of moments (GMM). Our results support both the theory of corporate finance and the buffer view, where a tendency towards the latter seems to be evident for banks. This is consistent with an effect of capital regulation on bank capital structure. We introduce also Tier <b>1</b> capital <b>ratio</b> as an explanatory variable to analyse the effect of capital regulation. However, Tier 1 capital total for banks seems to be increased.

Remaining good assets and deposits below €100,000 with Laiki Bank would be saved and transferred to Bank of Cyprus (BoC), while shareholder capital would be written off, and the uninsured deposits above €100,000 - along with other creditor claims - would be lost to the degree being decided by how much the receivership subsequently can recover from liquidation of the remaining bad assets.

40|$|The {{stress testing}} {{literature}} abounds with reduced-form macroeconomic models {{that are used}} to forecast the evolution of the macroeconomic environment {{in the context of a}} stress testing exercise. These models permit supervisors to estimate counterparty risk under both baseline and adverse scenarios. However, the large majority of these models are founded on the assumption of normality of the innovation series. While this assumption renders the model tractable, it fails to capture the observed frequency of distant tail events that represent the hallmark of systemic financial stress. Consequently, these kinds of macro models tend to underestimate the actual level of credit risk. This also leads to an inaccurate assessment of the degree of systemic risk inherent in the financial sector. Clearly this may have significant implications for macro-prudential policy makers. One possible way to overcome such a limitation is to introduce a mixture of distributions model in order to better capture the potential for extreme events. Based on the methodology developed by Fong, Li, Yau and Wong (2007), we have incorporated a macroeconomic model based on a mixture vector autoregression (MVAR) into the stress testing framework of Rouabah and Theal (2010) that is used at the Banque centrale du Luxembourg. This allows the counterparty credit risk model to better capture extreme tail events in comparison to models based on assuming normality of the distributions underlying the macro models. We believe this approach facilitates a more accurate assessment of credit risk. financial stability, stress testing, MVAR, mixture of normals, VAR, <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> capital <b>ratio,</b> counterparty risk, Luxembourg banking sector...|$|R

STIS comprises a comprehensive scheme of biological effects and marker determination {{in order to}} generate appropriate information on early key elements of pathogenesis, such as inflammatory reactions in the lung and indications of effects in other organs. Within the STIS information on the persistence, progression and/or regression of effects is obtained. The STIS also addresses organ burden in the lung and potential translocation to other tissues. Up to now STIS was performed in research projects and routine testing of nanomaterials.
