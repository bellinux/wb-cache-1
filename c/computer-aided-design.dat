2500|$|A {{computer}} {{graphic representation}} of the projected teeth movements, [...] created in the software program ClinCheck, is provided {{to the doctor and}} patient [...] for approval or modification before aligners are manufactured. The aligners are modeled using CAD-CAM (<b>computer-aided-design</b> and computer-aided-manufacturing) software and manufactured using a rapid prototyping technique called stereolithography. The molds for the aligners are built in layers using a photo-sensitive liquid resin that cures into a hard plastic when exposed to a laser. The aligners are made from an elastic thermoplastic material that applies pressure to the teeth to move into the aligner's position. Patients that need a tooth rotated or pulled down may have a small, tooth-colored composite attachment bonded onto certain teeth. More attachments can make the aligners less aesthetically pleasing. Reproximation, (also called interproximal reduction or IPR and colloquially, filing or drilling), is sometimes used at the contacts between teeth to allow for a better fit.|$|E

The Laboratory conducted correspondence courses, hosted numerous conferences, {{and worked on}} environmental planning and architectural projects with the Harvard Graduate School of Design. From 1978 to 1983, the Laboratory hosted a popular annual Harvard Computer Graphics Week.

[...] This rotating strip of 3,000 holograms depicted an animated sequence of 3d maps showing US population growth from 1790 to 1970, generated by the Laboratory's ASPEX program. Dutton also contributed the program DOT.MAP to the Laboratory's family of distributed software (1977).

5000|$|As with CNC {{subtractive}} methods, the <b>computer-aided-design</b> - {{computer-aided manufacturing}} CAD-CAM workflow {{in the traditional}} Rapid Prototyping process starts {{with the creation of}} geometric data, either as a 3D solid using a CAD workstation, or 2D slices using a scanning device. For RP this data must represent a valid geometric model; namely, one whose boundary surfaces enclose a finite volume, contain no holes exposing the interior,and do not fold back on themselves. In other words, the object must have an [...] "inside". The model is valid if for each point in 3D space the computer can determine uniquely whether that point lies inside, on, or outside the boundary surface of the model. CAD post-processors will approximate the application vendors' internal CAD geometric forms (e.g., B-splines) with a simplified mathematical form, which in turn is expressed in a specified data format which is a common feature in additive manufacturing: STL (stereolithography) a de facto standard for transferring solid geometric models to SFF machines. To obtain the necessary motion control trajectories to drive the actual SFF, rapid prototyping, 3D printing or additive manufacturing mechanism, the prepared geometric model is typically sliced into layers, and the slices are scanned into lines a [...] "2D drawing" [...] used to generate trajectory as in CNC's, mimicking in reverse the layer-to-layer physical building process.|$|E
