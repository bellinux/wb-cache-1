5|$|Some Western {{academics}} cautiously {{view the}} hadith collections as accurate historical sources. Scholars such as Madelung do not reject the narrations {{which have been}} compiled in later periods, but judge them {{in the context of}} history and {{on the basis of their}} compatibility with the events and figures. Muslim scholars on the other hand typically place a greater emphasis on the hadith literature instead of the biographical literature, since hadiths maintain a verifiable <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> (isnad); the lack of such a chain for the biographical literature makes it less verifiable in their eyes.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 the Italian {{physician}} Carlo Urbani (1956–2003) was {{the first}} to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS-CoV. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the World Health Organization helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission,</b> which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{movements}} of refugees and soldiers {{during the war}} enabled and unleashed one of the world's worst plagues—the so-called Spanish Flu (so-named because even the king of Spain came down with it), which went on to attack almost 50% of the world's population. Falls Church and the portions of Fairfax County closest to Alexandria were particularly hard hit. Schools and churches closed and all meetings of any kind were suspended for over a month in October and November 1918, {{in an attempt to}} break the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> Before the influenza subsided it killed 531 people in Fairfax County, which included Falls Church.|$|E
500|$|To {{establish}} {{the authenticity of}} a particular Hadith or report, {{it had to be}} checked by following the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> (isnad). Thus the reporters had to cite their reference, and their reference's reference {{all the way back to}} Muhammad. All the references in the chain had to have a reputation for honesty and possessing a good retentive memory. [...] Thus biographical analysis (`ilm al-rijāl, lit. [...] "science of people"), which contains details about the transmitter are scrutinized. This includes analyzing their date and place of birth; familial connections; teachers and students; religiosity; moral behaviour; literary output; their travels; as well as their date of death. Based upon these criteria, the reliability (thiqāt) of the transmitter is assessed. Also determined is whether the individual was actually able to transmit the report, which is deduced from their contemporaneity and geographical proximity with the other transmitters in the chain. Examples of biographical dictionaries include Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani's [...] "Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb" [...] or al-Dhahabi's [...] "Tadhkirat al-huffāz." ...|$|E

500|$|Early {{traditions and}} stories explain this verse as a miracle {{performed}} by Muhammad, following requests of {{some members of}} the Quraysh. Most Muslim commentators accept the authenticity of those traditions. The following verse 54:2, [...] "But if they see a Sign, they turn away, and say, 'This is (but) transient magic'" [...] is taken in the support of this view. The classical commentator Ibn Kathir provides a list of the early traditions mentioning the incident: A tradition transmitted on the authority of Anas bin Malik states that Muhammad split the moon after the pagan Meccans asked for a miracle. Another tradition from Malik transmitted through other chains of narrations, mentions that the mount Nur was visible between the two parts of the moon (Mount Nur is located in Hijaz. Muslims believe that Muhammad received his first revelations from God in a cave on this mountain, Cave Hira'). A tradition narrated on the authority of Jubayr ibn Mut'im with a single <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> says that the two parts of the moon stood on two mountains. This tradition further states that the Meccan responded by saying [...] "Muhammad has taken us by his magic... If he was able to take us by magic, he {{will not be able to}} do so with all people." [...] Traditions transmitted on the authority of Ibn Abbas briefly mention the incident and do not provide much details. Traditions transmitted on the authority of Abdullah bin Masud describe the incident as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|Maududi had {{a unique}} {{perspective}} on the transmission of hadith—the doings and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, that form part of the basis of Islamic law.

2500|$|Rabbis of the Talmudic era {{conceived}} of the Oral Torah in two distinct ways. First, Rabbinic tradition {{conceived of}} the Oral Torah as an unbroken <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> The distinctive {{feature of this}} view was that Oral Torah was [...] "conveyed {{by word of mouth}} and memorized." [...] Second, the Rabbis also conceived of the Oral Torah as an interpretive tradition, and not merely as memorized traditions. In this view, the written Torah was seen as containing many levels of interpretation. It was left to later generations, who were steeped in the oral tradition of interpretation to discover those ("hidden") interpretations not revealed by Moses. Instead, Moses was obligated to impart the explanations orally to students, children, and fellow adults. It was thus forbidden to write and publish the Oral Torah.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, in modern-day Southwestern United States {{specifically}} New Mexico, {{which was a}} former territory of New Spain, several Hispanos of New Mexico have stated a belief that they are descended from crypto-Jews of the colonial period. While most maintain their Roman Catholic and Christian faiths, they often cite as evidence memories of older relatives practicing Jewish traditions. Since the 1990s, the crypto-Jews of New Mexico have been extensively studied and documented by several research scholars, including Stanley M. Hordes, Janet Liebman Jacobs, Schulamith Halevy, and Seth D. Kunin, who calls them Hispanos. Kunin noted that most of this group in New Mexico has not formally embraced Judaism nor joined the organized Jewish community. Though some have been sceptical, such as Folklorist Judith Neulander arguing that people could be referring to traditions of modern Ashkenazi Jews migrants and Evangelical Protestant Christians who purposely acquired and employed Jewish traditions. [...] More recently, Evangelical Protestant Christians have opened missionary groups aimed at cultivating evangelical doctrine in Southwestern American communities where crypto-Judaism had survived. The highly influential [...] Hordes {{has been charged with}} [...] "single-minded [...] speculation [...] based [...] on [...] largely [...] ephemeral [...] or highly ambiguous evidence" [...] for his conclusion that modern-day [...] Hispanos [...] who [...] claim [...] crypto-Jewish [...] roots [...] are [...] heirs [...] to [...] an unbroken <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> Kunin responded to some of this criticism in his book Juggling Identities: Identity and Authenticity Among the Crypto-Jews.|$|E
