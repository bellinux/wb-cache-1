25|$|The program {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} for students to develop an appreciation for different cultures and promotes greater understanding. They <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> lot by asking questions directly to international students from various countries. Some local schools may request specific topics for volunteers to present about their country, especially if the students are learning it in class. If not, a simple PowerPoint with basic background information including geography, language, food, music, dance, sports, holidays, weather, and celebrations is sufficient. The content and depth of presentations depends on whether volunteers will be presenting to elementary, middle school or high school students or adults. Usually presentations will also include an activity for children to get involved such as learning a dance, song, game or several words and phrases in the language.|$|E

25|$|Most of Plato's {{philosophical}} {{ideas were}} communicated through his beloved teacher Socrates as {{a presence in}} the dialogues. Though there are no extant writings of Socrates known, it is evident through Plato's works that Socrates had an incredible ability to explore the most intense analytical discussions. However, for some there is controversy regarding how much historical fact can be derived from Plato's Socrates (Russell). Some doubt Socrates ever existed. Others are skeptical as to the accuracy of some of Plato's dialogues but nonetheless maintain that we <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> substantial amount of historical information about Socrates from the dialogues. Still others take practically everything Plato wrote about Socrates as veridical history. Regardless, it may be safe to say that Plato never meant to record Socrates verbatim and it may plausibly be concluded that his general ideas were communicated in the dialogues.|$|E
500|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Ricky Ponting from international Twenty20 cricket, there were some calls for White to be promoted to captain the side, led by his Victoria coach Greg Shipperd. [...] Despite these calls, White backed the favourite, incumbent vice-captain Michael Clarke for the role. White was eventually named as Clarke's vice-captain, although worries about Clarke's injury-prone back and his struggles with form in Twenty20 resulted in continued calls for White to take over, though White again backed Clarke, claiming [...] "Michael's {{going to do a}} great job and I'll just look forward to working with him.

500|$|... "Under the Bridge", {{which became}} a {{breakout}} song for the band, {{was considered to be}} a highlight of the album by several critics. Allmusic reviewed the song individually and called it a [...] "...poignant sentiment... it is self evident among the simple guitar which cradles the introductory verse, and the sense of fragility that is only doubled by the still down-tempo choral crescendo", and ultimately [...] "has {{become an integral part of}} the 1990s alterna-landscape, and remains one of the purest diamonds that sparkle amongst the rough-hewn and rich funk chasms that dominate the Peppers' own oeuvre." [...] However, Entertainment Weekly criticized the seriousness that the Red Hot Chili Peppers explored as being [...] "disapproving of the band's usual Red Hot antics", and [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had [...] "fancy-shmancy touches". The song ended up peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1992. [...] "Give It Away" [...] was also praised, though as [...] "...a free-associative mixture of positive vibes, tributes to musical heroes, and free love", with Frusciante [...] "...adding the song's two most unpredictable change-ups: a sudden contrast to Kiedis' hyperactivity in the form of a languid solo pre-recorded and dubbed backwards over the rhythm track, and a hard-rocking riff which is not introduced until the song's outro..." [...] Tracks such as [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy", however, were criticized for being overly explicit. Devon Powters of Pop Matters said that [...] "Eight minutes of 'Sir Psycho Sexy' will turn RHCP's young listeners into quivering masses of hormonal jello. Oversexed lines sneak their way into 'Apache Rose Peacock'; 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik', simply, sounds like fucking. Even the purest virgin comes away from Blood Sugar Sex Magik with a degree of sexual maturity; even the slickest playa <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> couple of new moves." [...] In contrast, [...] "Suck My Kiss", according to Amy Hanson of Allmusic, [...] "completely flew in the face of the established pecking order of alternative rock." [...] With the song, the Chili Peppers [...] "fully allied themselves with the very few genre-bending bands that were able to make a radical impact on the sonic landscape that was dominated, it seemed, from every minute angle by grunge." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fish {{can learn}} how to perform a {{behavior}} simply by watching other individuals in action. [...] This is variously called observational learning, cultural transmission, or social learning. For example, fish <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> particular route after following an experienced leader a few times. One study trained guppies to swim through a hole marked in red while ignoring another one marked in green in order to get food {{on the other side of}} a partition; when these experienced fish (“demonstrators”) were joined by a naive one (an “observer”), the observer followed the demonstrators through the red hole, and kept the habit once the demonstrators were removed, even when the green hole now allowed food access. [...] In the wild, juvenile French grunt follow traditional migration routes, up to 1km long, between their daytime resting sites and their nighttime foraging areas on coral reefs; if groups of 10-20 individuals are marked and then transplanted to new populations, they follow the residents along what is for them – the transplants – a new migration route, and if the residents are then removed two days later, the transplanted grunts continue to use the new route, as well as the resting and foraging sites at both ends.|$|E

Kernel methods that approximate values functions or transition models can address this prob-lem. Yet, many current approaches rely on instable greedy maximization.

Our method <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> non-parametric control policies for infinite hori-zon continuous MDPs with high-dimensional sensory representations.

Reinforcement <b>Learning</b> is <b>a</b> popular {{technique}} for gameplaying because it <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>an</b> optimal policy for sequential decision problems {{in which the}} outcome (or reward) is delayed. However, Reinforcement Learning does not readily enable transfer of acquired knowledge to other instances. Case-Based Reasoning, in contrast, addresses exactly the issue of transferring solutions to slightly different instances of a problem. We describe a {{technique for}} abstracting reusable cases from Reinforcement Learning. We also report on preliminary experiments with case abstraction in a microworld. ...|$|R
