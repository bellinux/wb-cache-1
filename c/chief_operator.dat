25|$|The <b>chief</b> <b>operator</b> of {{the type}} was Pawan Hans of India. The British {{government}} agreed with India to supply 21 Westland 30s for oil exploration duties using a British grant of 65 million pounds. India was reluctant to accept the deal until it was {{made clear that the}} aid would not otherwise be forthcoming. The aircraft were delivered to Pawan Hans between 1986 and 1988 for offshore operations on behalf of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC). A similar number of SA 365N Dauphin helicopters was supplied by France. It was soon found that the Westland helicopters were ill-suited to Indian conditions, and after two fatal accidents, the fleet was grounded in 1991. The 19 surviving Westland 30s were sold to a British company, but after six had been shipped to the United Kingdom, the deal fell through, and the aircraft are believed to remain in storage in the United Kingdom and India.|$|E
500|$|Grace D. Banker (October 25, 1892 – September 17, 1960) was a {{telephone}} operator who served during World War I (1917–1918) as <b>chief</b> <b>operator</b> of mobile for the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. She led thirty-three women telephone operators known popularly as Hello Girls. They were assigned in New York {{to travel to}} France to operate telephone switch boards at the war front in Paris, and at Chaumont, Haute-Marne. They also operated the telephone switch boards at First Army headquarters at Ligny-en-Barrois, about [...] {{to the south of}} Saint-Mihiel, and later during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. After her return to civilian life, Banker and her team members were treated as citizen volunteers and initially not given recognition as members of the military. In 1919, Banker was honoured with the Distinguished Service Medal for her services with the First Army headquarters during the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne Offensives, with a commendation.|$|E
500|$|Banker sailed {{with her}} team members from New Jersey on 6 March 1918, {{to take up}} the {{assignment}} as <b>chief</b> <b>operator</b> for First Army headquarters in Paris. After arriving with her team in England, the group set sail by ferry across the English Channel. However, bad [...] weather, in the form of thick fog, prevented the ferry from reaching French shores, and it had to be anchored a few miles away to wait for the fog to lift. This location made the vessel an easy target for German bombing (at that time, one vessel out of four had suffered bombing), and the team members remained at full readiness to evacuate the vessel at short notice. The women's group stayed on deck in the open for forty-eight continuous hours. This situation did not dishearten Banker or her team members, and, as Banker later said: [...] "What good sports girls were in that First Unit! They took everything in their stride. They were the pioneers." ...|$|E

50|$|Founder of École Louis-Lumière (situated on rue de Vaugirard), Philippe Agostini debuted as {{assistant}} to the <b>chief</b> <b>operators</b> Georges Périnal and Armand Thirard. In the 1930s, he began a fruitful career as director of photography, working with directors with such differing styles as Robert Bresson, Marcel Carné, Max Ophüls, Claude Autant-Lara, Jean Grémillon, Yves Allégret, Jules Dassin and even Julien Duvivier. His career as a director was much less remarkable.|$|R
500|$|After {{working for}} twenty {{months at the}} war front, in September 1919 Banker {{and the rest of}} her team {{returned}} home. General Edgar Russel, chief signal officer of the AEF, extolled their service as [...] "indispensable". Reminiscing about her wartime experience as <b>chief</b> <b>operator,</b> Banker humorously noted that [...] "an afternoon in the switchboard office sometimes sounded like a scene from Alice in Wonderland, where only the initiated can make sense of the proceedings". She also noted the confidentiality aspect of her assignment when she was tested by an intelligence officer about her ability to keep a secret, which was about her posting out of the unit. About her work at the war front she said that [...] "the secrecy surrounding their operations gave it an aura of romance and set it apart from the civilian work". After returning from the war front with her team, she reflected: [...] "We missed the First Army with its code of loyalty and hard work. We were back in the petty squabbles of civilian life where even chief operators had 'tantrums' and where the wives of civilians attached to the Peace Conference spilled all over Paris in Army cars." ...|$|E
2500|$|During World War I, women {{switchboard}} operators, {{known as}} the [...] "Hello Girls", were sworn into the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Despite {{the fact that they}} wore U.S. Army uniforms and were subject to Army regulations (<b>Chief</b> <b>Operator</b> Grace Banker received the Distinguished Service Medal), they were not given honorable discharges but were considered [...] "civilians" [...] employed by the military, because Army regulations specified the male gender. Not until 1978—the 60th anniversary of the end of World War I—did Congress approve veteran status/honorable discharges for the remaining [...] "Hello Girls".|$|E
2500|$|Through May 2013, the First, Second, and Third Class (commercial) Radiotelegraph Licenses using code tests {{based upon}} the CODEX {{standard}} word were still being issued in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission. [...] The First Class license required 20 WPM code group and 25 WPM text code proficiency, the others 16 WPM code group test (five letter blocks sent as simulation of receiving encrypted text) and 20 WPM code text (plain language) test. [...] It was also necessary to pass written tests on operating practice and electronics theory. [...] A unique additional demand for the First Class was a requirement of a year of experience for operators of shipboard and coast stations using Morse. [...] This allowed the holder to be <b>chief</b> <b>operator</b> on board a passenger ship. [...] However, since 1999 the use of satellite and very high-frequency maritime communications systems (GMDSS) has made them obsolete. [...] (By that point meeting experience requirement for the First was very difficult.) [...] Currently, only one class of license, the Radiotelegraph Operator License, is issued. [...] This is granted either when the tests are passed or as the Second and First are renewed and become this lifetime license. [...] For new applicants, it requires passing a written examination on electronic theory and radiotelegraphy practices, as well as 16 WPM codegroup and 20 WPM text tests. [...] However, the code exams are currently waived for holders of Amateur Extra Class licenses who obtained their operating privileges under the old 20 WPM test requirement.|$|E

6000|$|An apology {{is perhaps}} {{needed for the}} neglect of {{contrast}} which is shown by presenting two consecutive stories of hangmen in such a small collection as the following.

His tale of disappointment used to cause some wonder why his ambition should have taken such an unfortunate form, but its nobleness was never questioned. In those days, too, there was still living an old woman who, for the cure of some eating disease, had been taken in her youth to have her 'blood turned' by a convict's corpse, in the manner described in 'The Withered Arm.' ...|$|E

Many fire departments in the United States use modified SUVs as their chief response vehicle. The large cargo area in the rear can be outfitted with radios, manuals, whiteboards, reference materials and other items which aid the incident commander in managing the incident resources.

George Kennan, whose enviable privilege it was to let the light in upon the misery of Siberian exile and to awaken the abhorrence {{of the world for}} Russian tyranny, was a native of Norwalk, where he grew up a telegraph operator. He worked at night and went to school by day, and when only nineteen, while one of the <b>chief</b> <b>operators</b> in Cincinnati, he applied for leave to join an expedition for laying a cable from Alaska to Siberia by way of Bering Strait. He was asked if he could get ready to start in two weeks, and he answered that he could get ready to start in two hours. He was appointed, and in this way he came to know the horrors which he afterwards studied more fully in a second visit to Siberia. He traveled fifteen hundred miles through that wintry prison of Russia, and saw and heard the sorrowful things which the despotism of the Czar has done to men who dare to love freedom.|$|R
