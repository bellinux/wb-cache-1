5|$|Animals such as chameleon, frog, {{flatfish}} such as {{the peacock}} flounder, squid and octopus actively change their skin patterns and colours using special chromatophore <b>cells</b> <b>to</b> resemble their current background, or, as in most chameleons, for signalling.

5|$|Another {{important}} role {{of the immune system}} is to identify and eliminate tumors. This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal <b>cells.</b> <b>To</b> the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune <b>cells</b> <b>to</b> attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{neutralizing}} {{activity of}} anti-HIV- 1 antibodies is typically measured in assays where cell-free virions enter reporter cell lines. However, HIV- 1 <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> <b>cell</b> transmission {{is a major}} mechanism of viral spread, {{and the effect of}} the recently described broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) on this mode of transmission remains unknown. Here we identify a subset of bNAbs that inhibit both cell-free and cell-mediated infection in primary CD 4 (+) lymphocytes. These antibodies target either the CD 4 -binding site (NIH 45 - 46 and 3 BNC 60) or the glycan/V 3 loop (10 - 1074 and PGT 121) on HIV- 1 gp 120 and act at low concentrations by inhibiting multiple steps of viral <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> <b>cell</b> transmission. These antibodies accumulate at virological synapses and impair the clustering and fusion of infected and target cells and the transfer of viral material <b>to</b> uninfected T <b>cells.</b> In addition, they block viral <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> <b>cell</b> transmission <b>to</b> plasmacytoid DCs and thereby interfere with type-I IFN production. Thus, only a subset of bNAbs can efficiently prevent HIV- 1 <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> <b>cell</b> transmission, and this property should be considered an important characteristic defining antibody potency for therapeutic or prophylactic antiviral strategies...|$|R
