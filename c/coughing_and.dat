5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. <b>Coughing</b> <b>and</b> vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{the brain}} (such as from a massive stroke, {{non-penetrating}} head injury, intoxication or poisoning) {{may result in a}} depressed level of consciousness. When this becomes severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the extrinsic muscles of the airway can obstruct the airway, impeding the free flow of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as <b>coughing</b> <b>and</b> swallowing may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of the airway and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.|$|E

One study estimated that 10 percent of the city's population suffered adverse health effects, such as stinging eyes, <b>coughing,</b> <b>and</b> respiratory distress. City health officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog. Another study found that the smog had shortened the lifespans of 366 people.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present {{case study}} reports {{a case of}} chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cough</b> syncope {{associated}} with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). Careful analysis of cough-related symptoms and ECG monitoring led to the suspicion of PVC-induced cough. A coincidence between PVCs <b>and</b> episodes of <b>cough</b> was also documented by a portable multichannel recorder. Moreover, Doppler echocardiography revealed a PVC-induced transient increase in the pulmonary artery blood flow. After exclusion of other possible aetiologies, complete relief of chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cough</b> syncope was achieved by radiofrequency ablation of the arrhythmogenic focus located in the right ventricular outflow tract. Premature ventricular complexes {{should be considered as}} a cause of chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cough</b> syncope <b>and</b> an interdisciplinary cooperation can lead to successful diagnosis and treatment of this condition...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cough</b> <b>and</b> cold {{medications}} that contain nasal decongestants, antihistamines, <b>cough</b> suppressants, <b>and</b> expectorants commonly are used {{alone or in}} combination in attempts to temporarily relieve symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection in children aged < 2 years. However, during 2004 – 2005, an estimated 1, 519 children aged < 2 years were treated in U. S. emergency departments for adverse events, including overdoses, associated with <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications. * In response to reports of infant deaths after such events, CDC and the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) investigated deaths in U. S. infants aged < 12 months associated with <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications. This report describes {{the results of that}} investigation, which identified deaths of three infants aged < 6 months in 2005, for which <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications were determined by medical examiners or coroners to be the underlying cause. The dosages at which <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications can cause illness or death in children aged < 2 years are not known. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved dosing recommendations for clinicians prescribing <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications do not exist for this age group. Because of the risks for toxicity, absence of dosing recommendations, and limited published evidence of effectiveness of these medications in children aged < 2 years, parents and other caregivers should not administer <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications to children in this age group without first consulting health-care provider and should follow the provider’s instructions precisely (1). Clinicians should use caution when prescribing <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications to children aged < 2 years. Moreover, clinicians should always ask caregivers about their use of over-the-counter combination medications to avoid overdose in children from multiple {{medications that}} contain the same ingredient...|$|R
5|$|TBI is {{frequently}} difficult to diagnose and treat. Early diagnosis {{is important to}} prevent complications, which include stenosis (narrowing) of the airway, respiratory tract infection, and damage to the lung tissue. Diagnosis involves procedures such as bronchoscopy, radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dysphonia (a condition where the voice can be hoarse, weak, or excessively breathy), <b>coughing,</b> <b>and</b> abnormal breath sounds. In the emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that the airway remains open. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a TBI.|$|E
5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, {{the upper}} class {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands. This meant that wives had to be subservient to parents-in-law. They were expected to have impeccable manners, including refraining from <b>coughing</b> <b>and</b> sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives could not leave their rooms or accept gifts from relatives without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead to physical abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them bathe, arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a strong emphasis on food preparation in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and high expectations for the taste and appeal of food.|$|E
5|$|Several {{barriers}} protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, {{and biological}} barriers. The waxy cuticle of most leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin {{are examples of}} mechanical barriers that are {{the first line of}} defense against infection. However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary tract. In the lungs, <b>coughing</b> <b>and</b> sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract. The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies {{indicate}} that chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production are associated with increased mortality and disease progression in COPD subjects. Our objective was to identify features associated with chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production in COPD subjects. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of data were obtained in a multicenter (17 university hospitals in France) cohort of COPD patients. The cohort comprised 433 COPD subjects (65 +/- 11 years; FEV(1), 50 +/- 20 % predicted). Subjects with (n = 321) and without (n = 112) chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production were compared. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between groups for age, FEV(1), body mass index, and comorbidities. Subjects with chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production had increased total mean numbers of exacerbations per patient per year (2. 20 +/- 2. 20 vs 0. 97 +/- 1. 19, respectively; p < 0. 0001), moderate exacerbations (1. 80 +/- 2. 07 vs 0. 66 +/- 0. 85, respectively; p < 0. 0001), and severe exacerbations requiring hospitalizations (0. 43 +/- 0. 95 vs 0. 22 +/- 0. 56, respectively; p < 0. 02). The total number of exacerbations per patient per year was the only variable independently associated with chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production. Frequent exacerbations (two or more per patient per year) occurred in 55 % vs 22 % of subjects, respectively, with <b>and</b> without chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production (p < 0. 0001). Chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production and decreased FEV(1) were independently {{associated with an increased}} risk of frequent exacerbations and frequent hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production are associated with frequent COPD exacerbations, including severe exacerbations requiring hospitalizations...|$|R
40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors {{are one of}} {{the first}} drugs of choice for the {{treatment}} of hypertension.

Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe <b>coughing</b> <b>and</b> vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours.

5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of IIH is headache, which occurs {{in almost all}} (92–94%) cases. It is {{characteristically}} worse in the morning, generalized in character and throbbing in nature. It {{may be associated with}} nausea and vomiting. The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure, such as <b>coughing</b> <b>and</b> sneezing. The pain may also be experienced in the neck and shoulders. Many have pulsatile tinnitus, a whooshing sensation in one or both ears (64–87%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse. Various other symptoms, such as numbness of the extremities, generalized weakness, loss of smell, and loss of coordination, are reported more rarely; none are specific for IIH. In children, numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrived at}} the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Carr {{requested}} a doctor for Williams, as he was feeling {{the combination of the}} chloral hydrate and alcohol he had drunk on the way from Montgomery to Knoxville. Dr. P.H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel; the porters had to carry Williams to the car, as he was <b>coughing</b> <b>and</b> hiccuping. At around midnight on Thursday January 1, 1953, when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia, Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat. Williams said he did not, and those are believed to be his last words. Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where he realized that Williams was dead. The filling station's owner called the chief of the local police. In Williams' Cadillac the police found some empty beer cans and unfinished handwritten lyrics.|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite {{the high}} use of {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medicines, {{little is known}} about Australia's <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medicines information needs. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify gaps in consumers' perceived knowledge and concerns, to better target consumer medicines information and improve quality use of medicines. Methods: We analysed cough-and-cold related enquiries from consumers who contacted an Australian national medicine call centre between September 2002 and June 2010. Results: Of 5503 <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold calls, female callers made up 86 % of the calls and 33 % were related to children. Questions most frequently related to drug-drug interactions (29 %). An analysis of narratives over an 18 -month period (248 calls) revealed 20 % of the calls concerned potentially clinically relevant interactions, particularly those involving psychotropic agents. Discussion: The potential for interactions with <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medicines purchased OTC is recognised by consumers. Patient information should address their concerns. Doctors should be aware of the common <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold interactions and communicate likely clinical symptoms to patients when prescribing medication to prevent potential harm...|$|R
