According to the electrical stresses that Current Transformers are typically subjected to, it was presumed that the cause of the possible damaged could be the high-frequency transients that take place during air disconnect switch operations. Therefore, with the aim of determining the presence of such electrical stress, field measurements were performed. A specially designed measuring system was utilized to accomplish this goal. Taking into account the difficulties normally encountered when measuring currents flowing through Current Transformers to ground, especially in terms of accuracy, it was decided to perform voltage measurements. Then, by determining the real frequency response of the CT in the range of interest, it was possible to achieve such currents by computer simulations.

Antibodies to AMB were raised in rabbits after administration of an AMB-bovine serum albumin conjugate. The enzy-matic tracer was obtained by coupling AMB via its amino group to acetylcholinesterase (EC 3. 1. 1. 7). These reagents {{were used for the}} development of a competitive immunoassay performed on microtitration plates. The limit of quantification was 100 pg/ml in plasma and 1 ng/g in tissues. The plasma assay was performed directly without extraction on a minimal volume of 0. 1 ml. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were in the range of 5 to 17 %, and the recoveries were 92 to 111 % for AMB added to human plasma. The assay was applied to a pharmacokinetic study with mice given AMB intraperitoneally at the dose of 1 mg/kg. The drug distribution in selected compartments (plasma, liver, spleen, lung, and brain) was monitored until 72 h after administration. In conclusion, our assay is at least 100 -fold more sensitive than previously described bioassays or <b>chromatographic</b> <b>determinations</b> of AMB and may be useful in studying the tissue pharmacokinetics of new AMB formulations and in drug monitoring in clinical situations.
