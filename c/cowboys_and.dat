5|$|Bone Sharps, <b>Cowboys,</b> <b>and</b> Thunder Lizards: A Tale of Edward Drinker Cope, Othniel Charles Marsh, and the Gilded Age of Paleontology (2005) is {{a graphic}} novel written by Jim Ottaviani and {{illustrated}} by the company Big Time Attic. The book tells a slightly fictionalized account of the Bone Wars, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry {{which led to a}} greater understanding of dinosaurs in the western United States.

5|$|Many of {{the rural}} ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing {{influence}} of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained {{control of the country}} outside Tombstone, {{due in large part to}} the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the <b>Cowboys</b> <b>and</b> rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.|$|E
5|$|The gunfight {{was not the}} end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and maimed in {{a murder}} attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, Cowboys fired from a dark alley through the glass door of a saloon, killing Morgan Earp. The {{suspects}} in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other <b>Cowboys</b> <b>and</b> were not indicted. Wyatt Earp, newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his own hands in a personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, who had received a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt's shooting of Frank Stilwell.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the general}} public of the United States was aware of oil {{production}} in Texas, the wealth that it generated in the state {{for the first three}} decades after Spindletop was largely unknown. Of the four most prominent oil businessmen in Texas at the end of World War II— Murchison, Cullen, Richardson, and Hunt— only three articles about them appeared in the New York Times during their lifetime, despite their philanthropy and influence in Washington D.C. Stereotypes about Texas in the American imagination generally revolved around <b>cowboys</b> <b>and</b> cattle.|$|E
5|$|When owner Robert Kraft {{purchased}} {{the team in}} 1994, he did so for $175 million. Since then, the Patriots have sold out every home game in both Foxboro Stadium and Gillette Stadium.

5|$|Each team is {{assigned}} one pick per round with the order based generally {{on the reverse}} order of finish in the previous season with {{the team with the}} worst record receiving the first draft slot. Exceptions to this are the Super Bowl participants from the previous season — the champion Baltimore Ravens were assigned the final draft slot and the runner-up New York Giants assigned the 30th slot in each round. The draft was broadcast on ESPN and ESPN2. Due to previous trades, the Dallas <b>Cowboys</b> <b>and</b> Tennessee Titans did not have selections in the first round. More than half of the players selected in the draft's first round (17 of 31) would eventually be elected to at least one Pro Bowl.|$|E

5|$|In Mitchell's {{first year}} of {{coaching}} at Alabama, the team compiled an 111 record and won the national championship {{in addition to the}} SEC championship. Over each of the next two seasons, they matched that 111 record, added two more SEC titles and finished inside the top-five in the polls. In 1976, which would be Mitchell's last with the team, they fell off a bit with a 93 record, but they still remained in the top-fifteen nationwide. Mitchell helped develop Leroy Cook who was a two-time All-America selection drafted in the 10th round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Dallas <b>Cowboys</b> <b>and</b> selected as one of two defensive ends on the All-time Alabama team named by Sports Illustrated in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the <b>Cowboys,</b> <b>and</b> the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the NFC East and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished {{on the outside looking in}} despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E
5|$|The Giants are {{currently}} {{owned and operated}} by John K. Mara and Steve Tisch—the sons of Wellington Mara and Bob Tisch. Mara had run the day-to-day operations under Bob Tisch's supervision in the years leading up to his father's death. Forbes magazine estimates the 2010 value of the team at $1.183 billion. This ranks them fourth in the 30 team league in terms of value. The value has steadily increased from $288 million in 1998, to the current value. The magazine estimated their revenue in 2004 at $175 million, of which $43 million came from gate receipts. Operating revenue was $26.7 million, and player salary was $97 million.
