5|$|Graveyard Mountain Home is {{the third}} studio album {{released}} under the name <b>Chroma</b> <b>Key</b> by American keyboardist Kevin Moore. It was released on November 8, 2004 by InsideOut Music. Moore originally started work on the album in 2003, planning to release a less electronica-influenced album than previous <b>Chroma</b> <b>Key</b> albums, but put it aside {{to work on the}} first OSI album. He then moved to Istanbul, Turkey, where he wrote Ghost Book, the soundtrack to the film Okul. Enjoying the experience of writing music to film, Moore scrapped his previous plans for the third <b>Chroma</b> <b>Key</b> album, instead writing an album as an alternate soundtrack to an already-existing film.|$|E
5|$|Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos {{originally}} intended to create a progressive metal supergroup while Fates Warning went on hiatus. He recruited Cynic & Gordian Knot Fretless Bass and Chapman Stickist Sean Malone and then-Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy {{to work on the}} project. Matheos then asked <b>Chroma</b> <b>Key</b> and ex-Dream Theater keyboardist Kevin Moore to contribute by adding keyboard arrangements to the music he had written. Moore instead heavily edited the music, changing the song structures and adding vocals. Matheos decided to pursue this new direction, sounding closer to <b>Chroma</b> <b>Key</b> than standard progressive metal, over his and Portnoy's original idea.|$|E
5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} <b>chroma</b> <b>key</b> blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. <b>Chroma</b> <b>key</b> was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E

An improvement of more than 300 % in performance over HLS based algorithms was achieved. The algorithm has been developed for use in an immersive virtual environment, which is also described here. Keywords: Virtual Reality, Immersive Telepresence, <b>Chroma</b> <b>Keying</b> 1 Introduction Compositing is a technique used when two images are combined so that some regions of the resulting image come from the first source image, while the rest comes from the second source image. A mask, in this context, describes which {{part of the first}} source image should remain. Several methods of generating such a mask exist; one that is often used in television productions is a technique known as <b>Chroma</b> <b>Keying.</b> With <b>chroma</b> <b>keying</b> the one image is recorded in a studio where the background is a uniform color, usually blue.

5|$|In September 2008, Moore posted {{an update}} on the <b>Chroma</b> <b>Key</b> website, stating that he and Matheos had been working on a third OSI album for several months. Portnoy was {{replaced}} by Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison and Matheos played bass on the album. Opeth vocalist and guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt and No-Man vocalist Tim Bowness wrote lyrics and sang on one track each.|$|E
5|$|Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos {{originally}} recruited Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy {{to work on}} {{a progressive}} metal album. When keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore (founder of <b>Chroma</b> <b>Key</b> and former Dream Theater member) joined the project, the musical direction of the album changed to become more focused on soundscapes and composition than musicianship. Sean Malone (of Cynic and Gordian Knot) and Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree) also performed on the album.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} OSI album, Office of Strategic Influence, was {{released}} in 2003, Jim Matheos and Kevin Moore returned to their respective projects. Matheos released the album FWX and toured with Fates Warning. Moore moved from Costa Rica to Istanbul, Turkey. In 2004, he released the third <b>Chroma</b> <b>Key</b> album, Graveyard Mountain Home, and wrote the soundtrack (released as Ghost Book) to the Turkish horror film Okul. Matheos and Moore both had holes in their schedules, so decided {{to work on a}} second OSI album.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the DCT {{compression}} stage, chroma subsampling {{is applied}} to the source video {{in order to reduce the}} amount of data to be compressed. Baseline DV uses 4:1:1 subsampling in its 60 Hz variant and 4:2:0 subsampling in the 50 Hz variant. Low chroma resolution of DV (compared to higher-end digital video formats) is a reason this format is sometimes avoided in <b>chroma</b> <b>keying</b> applications, though advances in <b>chroma</b> <b>keying</b> techniques and software have made producing quality keys from DV material possible.|$|R
5|$|Filming {{returned}} to the Exchange in Swansea to film two more scenes: The denouément of the episode was filmed on 28 July; and the pre-credits sequence on 30 July. The most important day of filming was on 31 July 2007: an evening location shoot of the party's arrival in London. Before filming commenced, Minogue covered her death scene above a <b>chroma</b> <b>key</b> mattress. The scene in London commenced filming at sunset in Cardiff city centre. For security concerns—specifically, protecting Minogue—the street was sealed off {{for the first time}} since the show's revival in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Ken Ralston and {{his team}} at Industrial Light & Magic were {{responsible}} for the film's visual effects. Using CGI techniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage. To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue. Archival footage was used {{and with the help of}} such techniques as <b>chroma</b> <b>key,</b> image warping, morphing, and rotoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.|$|E
5|$|OSI is an American {{progressive}} rock band, originally {{formed by}} Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos in 2002. <b>Chroma</b> <b>Key</b> keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore {{is the only}} other full-time member of the band. The collaboration may be considered a studio project, as its members and contributors write and track most of their material independently, sharing and developing tracks long-distance, only coming together {{at the end of}} the process for mixing and additional tracking. The band's name is a reference to the Office of Strategic Influence, a short-lived American government agency formed in 2001 to support the War on Terror through propaganda. The band has featured a number of guest musicians on its albums, including Sean Malone, Steven Wilson, Mikael Åkerfeldt, Joey Vera and Gavin Harrison.|$|E

40|$|Croma keying is {{the process}} of {{segmenting}} objects from images and video using color cues. A blue (or green) screen placed behind an object during recording is used in special effects and in virtual studios. The blue color is later replaced by a different background. Blue screen is an example of <b>chroma</b> <b>keying</b> where the <b>keying</b> signal is <b>chroma</b> difference. A new method for automatic keying using invisible signal is presented. The advantages of the new approach over conventional <b>chroma</b> <b>keying</b> include: (i) Unlimited color range for foreground objects. (ii) No foreground contamination by background color. (iii) Better performance in non uniform illumination. (iv) Features for generating refraction and reflection of dynamic objects. The method can be used in real-time and no user assistance is required. New design of Catadioptric camera and a single chip sensor for keying is also presented.

Obayashi desired the special effects to look unrealistic, as if a child created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen <b>chroma</b> <b>key</b> effect where the blue colored parts of her body would deteriorate on camera. The outcome {{of a lot of}} these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began at}} Leavesden Studios near London. Warner Bros. {{purchased}} Leavesden {{as a permanent}} studio site after previously renting space there for its production of the Harry Potter films. Though Liman intended to film the beach battle on location, the studio instead had a beach set built at the studio site. The set was surrounded by <b>chroma</b> <b>key</b> green screens, which the visual effects artists later used to extend the beach with plates shot at Saunton Sands in North Devon. It was intended for the battle scenes to be reminiscent of coastal battles during World War II such as the Invasion of Normandy and the Battle of Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|Riven {{combined}} the pre-rendered backgrounds with live action footage, {{in order to}} increase the player's immersion level. Riven was the first game in which any of its designers had directed live actors, and Vander Wende was apprehensive about their use. Rand Miller had to reprise his role of Atrus from Myst, even though he hated acting. All the actors were filmed with a blue screen as a backdrop, which was removed in post-production by <b>chroma</b> <b>key,</b> so that the actors would blend into the virtual environment. Real world stairs, doorways and studio lights had to be meticulously positioned on the live stage to match their CG equivalents. Some sequences were seamlessly cut together with morphing, to allow for partial variations due to the nonlinearity of the gameplay.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Sleepy Hollows 150 visual effects shots were handled by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), while Kevin Yagher supervised {{the human and}} creature effects. Framestore also assisted on digital effects, and The Mill handled motion control photography. In part {{a reaction to the}} computer-generated effects in Mars Attacks!, Burton opted to use as limited an amount of digital effects as possible. Ray Park, who served as the Headless Horseman stunt double, wore a blue ski mask for the <b>chroma</b> <b>key</b> effect, digitally removed by ILM. Burton and Heinrichs applied to Sleepy Hollow many of the techniques they had used in stop motion animation on Vincent—such as forced perspective sets.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} digitally, {{and almost all}} of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on <b>Chroma</b> <b>key</b> with the cave background inserted later.|$|E
5|$|Filming was set {{to begin}} in October 2003, but it was pushed back. Principal {{photography}} for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events began on November 10, 2003, using the sound stages and backlot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Director Brad Silberling avoided using too many digital or <b>chroma</b> <b>key</b> effects because he wanted the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a realistic environment. Olaf's mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and the ruins of the Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount back lot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount, production then moved to Downey Studios, a former NASA facility in Downey, California, for eight more weeks. Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery, as well as a newly constructed water tank complete with over one million gallons of water. The water tank was instrumental in filming scenes set at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Damocles Dock and Curdled Cave. Filming for A Series of Unfortunate Events ended on May 29, 2004.|$|E

5|$|The entire opening {{sequence}} of the film was shot in Bulgaria during the winter, but was meant {{to take place in}} tropical South Asia. Digital effects were used to remove the snow and deciduous trees present and replace them with tropical flora. The alterations required over 340 shots alone. The scene was further complicated by Jet Li's scheduling conflict, which meant the interior sets had to be shipped to Hong Kong, reassembled and shot with him there, and the exterior sets had to be digitally built and then merged with footage of Li shot on <b>Chroma</b> <b>key.</b> A fish tank in the opening was filled with digital eels based on South Asian river eels, but increased in size by three times, after the real fish died and sank to the bottom. The finale in the airport was another complex digital environment, shot in three entirely differently locations in two seasons, which were then merged to create one seamless location. When the trucks break through glass to exit the airport, the scene is entirely digital and was filmed on Chroma screens in the middle of Sofia. Numerous digital matte paintings were used to modify the winter Bulgarian terrain in different scenes to represent its intended location.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} Camera Tracking in virtual studio environment. The traditional camera tracking methods are vision-based or sensor-based. However, the <b>Chroma</b> <b>Keying</b> process in virtual studio requires the color cues, such as blue screen, to segment objects from mages and videos. It limits the application of vision-based tracking methods in virtual studio since the background could not provide enough feature information. Therefore, in our research, we would try to apply the SLAM (simultaneously localization and mapping) methodology from mobile robots to the camera tracking area. We describe a sensor-based SLAM extension algorithm for 2 D camera tracking in virtual studio. Also a technique call Map Adjustment is proposed to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. The simulation results would be given in the conclusion.
