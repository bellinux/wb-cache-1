5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style {{is that he is}} able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will <b>Carry</b> <b>Us,</b> classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will <b>Carry</b> <b>Us</b> provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E
5|$|The Ben Franklin Bridge {{was opened}} on July 1, 1926 and was {{designated}} to <b>carry</b> <b>US</b> 30 across the Delaware River. A parkway called the Camden-Atlantic City Parkway was planned in 1932 {{to connect the}} Ben Franklin Bridge southeast to Atlantic City; this was never built. After World War II, freeway connections were planned {{on both sides of}} the Ben Franklin Bridge. In Philadelphia, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the Vine Street corridor to the present-day Schuylkill Expressway in 1945. The North-South Freeway was proposed in New Jersey as a connection from the bridge south along the Route 42 corridor. In 1950, the city of Philadelphia began planning the construction of the Vine Street Expressway, which would run along a depressed alignment through the city.|$|E
50|$|For {{the most}} part, the U.S. Routes {{were the primary}} means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main {{exceptions}} were toll roads such as the Pennsylvania Turnpike and parkway routes such as the Merritt Parkway. Many of the first high-speed roads were U.S. Highways: the Gulf Freeway <b>carried</b> <b>US</b> 75, the Pasadena Freeway <b>carried</b> <b>US</b> 66, and the Pulaski Skyway <b>carried</b> <b>US</b> 1 and US 9.|$|R
25|$|The interstates are {{supplemented}} by roads constructed under the Appalachian Corridor system. Four Corridors are complete. Corridor D, <b>carrying</b> <b>US</b> 50, {{runs from the}} Ohio River, and I-77, at Parkersburg to I-79 at Clarksburg. Corridor G, <b>carrying</b> <b>US</b> 119, runs from Charleston to the Kentucky border at Williamson. Corridor L, <b>carrying</b> <b>US</b> 19, runs from the Turnpike at Beckley to I-79 near Sutton (and provides a short cut of about 40 miles and bypasses Charleston's urban traffic for traveler heading to and from Florida). Corridor Q, <b>carrying</b> <b>US</b> 460, runs through Mercer County, entering the state from Giles County, Virginia and then reentering Virginia at Tazewell County.|$|R
50|$|I-195 still <b>carries</b> <b>US</b> 6, now in both directions, from I-95 to {{the last}} {{interchange}} before Massachusetts. It also <b>carries</b> <b>US</b> 1A and US 44 over the Washington Bridge and its approaches, though the former has almost no signs.|$|R
5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will <b>Carry</b> <b>Us.</b> From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E
5|$|US 13 was {{designated}} through Maryland when the U.S. Highway System {{was established in}} 1926, running along existing roads. It formed {{a part of the}} Ocean Highway, a road that connected the New York City area to Florida, and still carries that name for much of its route in Maryland. Many realignments of the route occurred over the years. The route was realigned between Princess Anne and Fruitland in 1933 and between Westover and Princess Anne in 1935. Between 1938 and 1942, Salisbury Boulevard was built to <b>carry</b> <b>US</b> 13 through Salisbury; the route previously followed Camden Avenue and Division Street. In the 1950s, portions of the route were widened to a divided highway and a bypass of Delmar was built. US 13 was rerouted to bypass Princess Anne in 1959 and Pocomoke City in 1963. The remainder of US 13 in Maryland was widened into a divided highway in the 1960s. In 1973, construction began to build the limited-access Salisbury Bypass to the east of the city. US 13 was moved onto the completed Salisbury Bypass in 1981.|$|E
25|$|Some {{film critics}} {{believe that the}} {{assemblage}} of light versus dark scenes in Kiarostami's film grammar, such as in Taste of Cherry and The Wind Will <b>Carry</b> <b>Us,</b> suggests the mutual existence of life with its endless possibilities, and death as a factual moment of anyone's life.|$|E
60|$|And so we held on, gliding {{with the}} stream. It drove {{us to this}} bank, and it drove us to that bank, and it turned us, and whirled us; but yet it <b>carried</b> <b>us</b> on. Sometimes much too slowly; {{sometimes}} much too fast, but yet it <b>carried</b> <b>us</b> on.|$|R
50|$|The Memphis & Arkansas Bridge also <b>carries</b> <b>U.S.</b> Highways 61, 64, 70 and 79 from Memphis to West Memphis; it also <b>carried</b> <b>U.S.</b> Highway 63 {{prior to}} its {{truncation}} (and later rerouting) in Arkansas. The western terminus of Tennessee State Route 1 sits on the Tennessee-Arkansas boundary halfway across the bridge.|$|R

25|$|The Crescent City Connection (CCC), {{formerly}} the Greater New Orleans Bridge (GNO), refers to twin cantilever bridges that <b>carry</b> <b>U.S.</b> Highway 90 Business (US90 Bus.) over the Mississippi River in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. They are tied as the fifth-longest cantilever bridges in the world. Each span carries four general-use automobile lanes; additionally the westbound span has two reversible HOV lanes across the river.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Baneh, a Kurdish city in Iran. His family moved to Sanandaj in 1981. Ghobadi {{received}} a Bachelor of Arts in film directing from Iran Broadcasting College. After a brief career in industrial photography, Ghobadi began making short 8 mm films. His documentary Life In Fog won numerous awards. Bahman Ghobadi was assistant director on Abbas Kiarostami's The Wind Will <b>Carry</b> <b>Us.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1925 {{the postal}} service began {{awarding}} contracts to private companies. Western Air Express, the first private company to <b>carry</b> <b>U.S.</b> mail, began flying from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles via Las Vegas. Less {{than a year later}} Western Air Express would begin flying passengers along the same route. Western Air Express later became Western Airlines, which had a large hub in Salt Lake City.|$|E

25|$|The week of 1 April 1957 a Lockheed C-130 Hercules {{from the}} Air Force Operational Test Center at Eglin Air Force Base {{became the first}} {{turbo-prop}} aircraft to <b>carry</b> <b>U.S.</b> mail across the Atlantic. The C-130 {{was on its way}} to Evreux, France, where it was to be put through another phase of Employment and Suitability Testing by AFOTC. Stopping at Dover, Delaware, on the first leg of the Atlantic crossing, the Hercules took on 4,800 pounds of mail for servicemen overseas.|$|E
25|$|Symbols {{of death}} abound in The Wind Will <b>Carry</b> <b>Us,</b> with the scenery of the graveyard, the imminence {{of the old}} woman's passing, and the {{ancestors}} referred to early in the film by the character Farzad. Such devices prompt the viewer {{to reflect on the}} parameters of the afterlife and immaterial existence. The viewer is asked to consider what constitutes the soul, and what happens to it after death. In discussing the film, Kiarostami said that he is the person who raises questions, rather than answers them.|$|E
25|$|Kiarostami {{directed}} The Wind Will <b>Carry</b> <b>Us</b> in 1999, {{which won}} the Grand Jury Prize (Silver Lion) at the Venice International Film Festival. The film contrasted rural and urban views on the dignity of labor, addressing themes of gender equality {{and the benefits of}} progress, by means of a stranger's sojourn in a remote Kurdish village. An unusual feature of the movie {{is that many of the}} characters are heard but not seen; at least thirteen to fourteen speaking characters in the film are never seen.|$|E

25|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence to The Wind Will <b>Carry</b> <b>Us.</b> Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a thematic application of this central concept of presence without presence, through using such techniques, and by often referring to characters which the viewer does not see and sometimes not hear directly affects the nature and concept of space in the geographical framework in which the world is portrayed. Kiarostami's use of sound and imagery conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and/or audible, which Anderson believes emphasizes the interconnectedness and shrinking {{of time and space}} in the modern world of telecommunications.|$|E

25|$|And {{they told}} us, the Inquisitor {{would have us}} separated, because I was weak, and I should go into a cooler room; but Sarah should abide there. I {{took her by the}} arm, and said. The Lord hath joined us together, and wo be to them that should part us. I said, I rather chuse to dye there with my friend, than to part from her. He was smitten, and went away, and came no more in five weeks... they did not part us till ten Weeks after: But oh the dark clouds and the sharp showers the Lord did <b>carry</b> <b>us</b> through!

25|$|On September 23, 1974, a {{group of}} Pan Am {{employees}} published an advertisement in The New York Times to register their disagreement over federal policies which they felt were harming the financial viability of their employer. The ad cited discrepancies in airport landing fees, such as Pan Am paying $4,200 to land a plane in Sydney, while the Australian carrier, Qantas, paid only $178 to land a jet in Los Angeles. The ad also contended that the United States Postal Service was paying foreign airlines {{five times as much}} to <b>carry</b> <b>U.S.</b> mail in comparison to Pan Am. Finally, the ad questioned why the Export-Import Bank of the United States loaned money to Japan, France, and Saudi Arabia at 6% interest while Pan Am paid 12%.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1964 that I-345, {{extending}} I-45 north along the proposed Central Expressway bypass, was added as a proposed state highway. I-45 and I-345 were built and opened in the 1970s, with the final section, between Lamar Street (exit 283A) and the Central Expressway (exit 283B), opening on February 25, 1976. At the north end, before it merged into the Central Expressway (which continued to <b>carry</b> <b>US</b> 75), I-345 straddled the bridges over Bryan Street and Ross Avenue, the latter {{the location of the}} opening ceremonies in 1949. Because of their location, these two bridges were not replaced in the 1990s reconstruction of the North Central Expressway, and are the only surviving grade separations from the initial construction north from downtown.|$|E
