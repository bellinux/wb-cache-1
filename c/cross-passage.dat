2500|$|Work on the {{excavation}} of cross-passages {{between the two}} tunnels began in early 2015. Sixteen cross-passages were built to enable evacuation [...] of people from one tunnel to {{the other in the}} event of an emergency and to house tunnel operation equipment. Each <b>cross-passage</b> is around 11 metres long. The excavation was completed in December 2015.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 January 2015, both tunnels {{were closed}} {{following}} a lorry fire which filled the midsection of Running Tunnel North with smoke. Eurostar cancelled all services. [...] The shuttle train had been heading from Folkestone to Coquelles and stopped adjacent to <b>cross-passage</b> CP 4418 just before 12:30 UTC. [...] Thirty-eight passengers and {{four members of}} Eurotunnel staff were evacuated into the service tunnel, and then transported to France using special STTS road vehicles in the Service Tunnel. [...] The passengers and crew {{were taken to the}} Eurotunnel Fire/Emergency Management Centre close to the French portal.|$|E
50|$|Tan Office Farmhouse, with a <b>cross-passage</b> entry & jettied upper floor, it was rebuilt in the 16th {{century with}} two bays.|$|E
5|$|During {{construction}} of <b>cross-passages</b> {{for the two}} tunnels south of Roosevelt in 2016, a small sinkhole formed {{in the front yard}} of a house.|$|R
40|$|In case of {{a burning}} train {{stopping}} outside the rescue stations in the Gotthard Base Tunnel (GBT) the emergency ventilation system is used to provide a smoke-free environment in the opposite tube. The present paper discusses {{the performance of the}} emergency ventilation system with the simultaneous use of jet fans. In this way it is not a discussion of the superior, general safety concept, but it focuses exclusively on the relevant aspects with regard to a safe escape in {{case of a}}n incident train stopping near a portal. Calculations of the air flows in the tunnel system demonstrate that jet fans placed in tunnels near the portals are an efficient means to support the emergency ventilation system. The use of jet fans near the portals leads to 1. a more uniform level of flow velocity in the open <b>cross-passages</b> along the tunnel 2. increased air flow velocities in the open doors of <b>cross-passages,</b> above the value which is required to prevent smoke from penetrating into the non-incident tube 3. a quicker response of the air flows in the open doors of <b>cross-passages</b> to the ventilation 4. a lower sensitivity of the air flow in the open doors of <b>cross-passages</b> to remaining train traffic. ...|$|R
50|$|There are 19 {{emergency}} <b>cross-passages</b> (including {{the central}} adit) {{between the two}} tunnels every 500 m. These were bored and lined separately, a process completed in February 2014.|$|R
50|$|On 5 July 2007 a Central line {{train was}} derailed {{when it hit}} a roll of fire blanket, which had been blown out of a <b>cross-passage</b> between the two tunnels by the strong crosswinds.|$|E
50|$|The first {{electric}} mine railway in {{the world}} was developed by Siemens & Halske for bituminous coal mining in Saxon Zauckerode near Dresden (now Freital) and was being worked as early as 1882 on the 5th main <b>cross-passage</b> of the Oppel Shaft run by the Royal Saxon Coal Works.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to the changing specifications of the Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) for fire and disaster control, two single-track tunnels were now planned. The distance to a [...] "safe area" [...] (<b>cross-passage</b> or tunnel portal) could not exceed 500 metres and the two-tube tunnel would {{also need to be}} traffickable by road vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{passages}} {{in the terminal}} are the Metro-North Railroad upper level; the Northwest and Northeast passages; the <b>cross-passages</b> at 47th and 45th Streets; and the Metro-North Railroad lower level.|$|R
50|$|The twin tunnels are 15 m {{wide with}} 12 <b>cross-passages</b> and {{emergency}} walkways, and a portal building at each end. They were formed by blasting through granite and volcanic rocks.|$|R
50|$|The Koralm Tunnel {{itself will}} consist of two single track tubes with <b>cross-passages</b> every 500 m and an {{emergency}} station halfway its total length of 33 km. The construction of the tunnel {{is divided into three}} sections (from east to west): KAT1, KAT2 and KAT3.|$|R
50|$|Work on the {{excavation}} of cross-passages {{between the two}} tunnels began in early 2015.citation needed Sixteen cross-passages were built to enable evacuation of people from one tunnel to {{the other in the}} event of an emergency and to house tunnel operation equipment. Each <b>cross-passage</b> is around 11 metres long. The excavation was completed in December 2015.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} to the house would have opened into the <b>cross-passage,</b> typically (but not exclusively) situated at the low-end of the hall, being either part of the hall or separated from it by a full or partial partition. Due to later work, there are no extant remains indicating {{the location of the}} entrance, cross passage or indeed which of the two rooms had been the hall.|$|E
50|$|At the Mansion House, {{the layout}} of the ground floor of the Phase 1 {{building}} comprised two principal rooms within the main range: Hall and Parlour. The hall at this date was a large room in the medieval sense rather than the fairly small entrance hall that we would refer to now. The room was a public one with occupants and visitors arriving directly into it via a <b>cross-passage.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{distance between}} the two tunnels (track centres) is 26 m. The axis of the track lies 62 cm off-centre to create space on one side for an escape route. The two tunnels are connected by about 19 <b>cross-passages</b> at a spacing of approximately 500 m.|$|R
50|$|Each bore {{contains}} an unusual road layout, {{consisting of a}} single carriageway 6 m wide; just wide enough to allow an airport bus (Cobus 2700) to drive past another bus stopped {{at the side of}} the road. The two tunnels are linked by escape <b>cross-passages</b> at intervals of 100 to(-) 130 m.|$|R
50|$|All {{stations}} on {{the line}} have 4 emergency exits, and Majestic station has 18 emergency exits. Stations have been built to withstand zone III earthquakes. Bangalore {{is located in a}} zone II earthquake prone area. The underground tunnels are equipped with walkways to enable passengers to disembark from a train and walk to the nearest station in case of a technical failure. The underground section is also equipped with 5 <b>cross-passages</b> that will enable passengers to move between tunnels, in case one tunnel fills up with smoke. There are three tunnel <b>cross-passages</b> between Majestic and Sir M Visvesvaraya metro station, and one each between Vidhana Soudha and Central College, and Majestic and City Railway station. All stations were built with flame retardant materials, and also have 100,000 litres of water stored on-site to be used in case of a fire.|$|R
5000|$|Off {{the main}} {{hallway to the}} left are two bedrooms, but the doorways which once would have led from the hall into each bedroom have been bricked in and {{plastered}} (probably during the [...] conversion to two flats), {{and there is no}} longer any evidence in the skirting boards of where these doorways were located. At its western end the main hallway opens into a <b>cross-passage</b> which leads on the right to the service passage and on the left originally to a bedroom door - this also has been bricked-in and plastered.|$|E

50|$|Amongst other {{buildings}} of interest, the former school {{was built in}} 1862 for 24 children, but was closed by 1902. The building (a typical example of a Victorian school) {{was used as the}} Sunday school and now serves as the village hall. Opposite is a 16th-century hall house, later floored, the <b>cross-passage</b> blocked by a fireplace but with the frame of the original front door exposed. There are more timber-framed and plastered houses up the village towards the Saffron Walden road. A small brick bridge over the Cam, built in 1791 to replace an earlier sixteenth century one, forms the village's western boundary.|$|E
50|$|The Huddersfield Narrow Canal was {{purchased}} by the 'Huddersfield and Manchester Railway' in 1846. The canal tunnel proved most beneficial in assisting {{with the construction of}} the first railway tunnel at this location as no vertical shafts were needed in the construction and the canal was an easy way to help remove the large amount of spoil excavated. Several <b>cross-passages</b> were retained.|$|R
25|$|The {{fire was}} located between two <b>cross-passages</b> and teams of firefighters from both {{countries}} fought the fire {{for the next}} five hours. Each shift of firefighters only work in the running tunnel for short periods of time before returning to the service tunnel. The water supply was restricted, mainly due to leaking pipework in the south running tunnel and the number of jets was reduced until a Eurotunnel engineer reconfigured the valves.|$|R
50|$|The Oxford Circus fire {{occurred}} on Friday 23 November 1984 at 9.50pm at Oxford Circus station onthe London Underground. Oxford Circus station {{is in the}} heart of London's shopping district and is served by three deep-level tube lines: the Bakerloo line, Central line and Victoria line. The three lines are linked by a complex network of tunnels and <b>cross-passages</b> which all converge to a common booking hall situated beneath the junction of Oxford Street and Regent Street.|$|R
50|$|The house {{consists}} of a long rectangle divided by a cross passage. The west end is a large hall some 25 ft high. The east end {{consists of}} smaller rooms on two floors.The roof structure is substantial, of paired cruck beams with additional horizontal, vertical and diagonal bracing. One unusual feature is that the truss between the <b>cross-passage</b> and hall is an aisle truss, a form normally only found in much larger buildings such as barns and churches. This suggests the use of English craftsmen and {{is an indication of}} the status of the original inhabitants.|$|E
50|$|The farmhouses {{have the}} {{features}} of all Frisian houses: the walls are made of red brick and have a thatched roof and white or blue window frames and doors. The buildings, which recall the early medieval long houses, were originally relatively small and had an internal wooden frame. This meant that {{in the event that}} one of the huge coastal storms, that regularly batter the area, badly damaged the roof and walls, the internal structure continued to provide its occupants with some protection. In the Uthland houses, the livestock stall and living area were combined under one roof, but separated by a narrow <b>cross-passage.</b> The stall has a longitudinal passage with a door at the gable and only a small threshing place.|$|E
5000|$|Set in {{the grounds}} of Strand House is the jointly {{occupied}} two-storey timber-framed Crows Nest Cottage, built [...] the 17th century or earlier. It adjoins Strand House on the west. It has plaster infilling, a tiled roof and casement windows. Weatherboarding was used to re-face the north front. The house is a [...] "House with an Open Hall" [...] and consists of two bays 7.90 by 4.80 m and is in contracted form, incorporating a single bayed hall at one end with an overshot <b>cross-passage</b> and a standard servants area at the other. It shows {{a good example of}} close-studding, which was decorative framing used on the street-facing side of the building while the less decorative large panel framing was used on rear elevations. It was introduced into this part of Sussex from 1430 and became common from 1450.|$|E
2500|$|The tunnels are [...] {{internal}} diameter, {{except for}} the [...] curves, where they are [...] Each [...] long section of tunnel wall was formed with a cast iron ring, made from seven segments and a key piece at the top. [...] bolts connect all the segments. Between each section there was a creosoted timber strip [...] thick, and varying the thickness of this enabled the forward course of the tube to be varied, except in the sharpest curves where the segments were cast to form the curve. There are seven <b>cross-passages</b> between the twin tubes.|$|R
50|$|Port Authority of New York and New Jersey patrolmen in {{the tunnel}} east and west of the truck radioed in to advise of the {{blockage}} (8:48 a.m.) then to advise of the fire (8:56 a.m.). They assisted drivers to escape to the north tunnel through <b>cross-passages.</b> Tunnel staff entered the New Jersey portal to evacuate the occupants there and started to reverse vehicles out, while a works brigade crew drove the wrong way along the south tunnel and began fighting the fire {{at the site of}} the truck where it started.|$|R
50|$|The tunnels are 12 ft {{internal}} diameter, {{except for}} the 603 ft curves, where they are 12 ft. Each 20 in long section of tunnel wall was formed with a cast iron ring, made from seven segments and a key piece at the top. 1 in bolts connect all the segments. Between each section there was a creosoted timber strip 3/8 to 1/2 in thick, and varying the thickness of this enabled the forward course of the tube to be varied, except in the sharpest curves where the segments were cast to form the curve. There are seven <b>cross-passages</b> between the twin tubes.|$|R
50|$|The {{remainder}} of the main range usually comprised a private parlour {{in addition to the}} hall and <b>cross-passage.</b> All three parts of the main range would have extended across the full width of the building. The room to the east of the main range was a heated one, served by the substantial Phase 1 chimney stack shared with the service (east) wing. Although there is a stack in the same location at the western side of the house it is not clear due to surface finishes if this was original or later and the extant brickwork above the roof line is suggestive of a later date whether {{as a result of a}} rebuild or historic insertion is unclear. Due to the confirmed presence of the Phase 1 stack on the eastern side of the house, the room within the main range served by it will be referred to as the hall, the western counterpart as the parlour. In general terms, if there was only one heated principal room within a vernacular building of this date other than the kitchen it was usually the hall.|$|E
50|$|The longhouse {{consists}} of a long, single-storey gable-ended granite structure built lengthwise down the slope of a hill, with a central 'cross-passage' dividing it into two rooms, sometimes partitioned with a screen. The higher end of the building was occupied by the human inhabitants; their animals were tethered in the lower, especially during the cold winter months. The animal quarters, called the 'shippon' or 'shippen'; a word still used by many locals to describe a farm building used for livestock, were located down the slope to allow slurry to drain out through the end wall. In Wales, the upper end was known as pen uchaf, the lower end pen isaf and the passage penllawr meaning 'head of the floor'.Early longhouses {{would have had no}} chimney - the smoke from a central fire simply filtered through the thatched roof and the whole space was open to the rafters, without a ceiling, as in a medieval English hall, to benefit from the heat of the open peat or furze hearth. Windows were very small or non-existent, so the interior would have been dark. The <b>cross-passage</b> had a door at either end, and with both of these open a breeze was often created which made it an ideal location for winnowing. Later in the medieval period, separation from the animals was increased with the introduction of enclosed stone fireplaces and upper floors inserted to create private bedrooms, while the roofspace above the shippen was often used as a hayloft or store.|$|E
5000|$|The {{authors of}} the Buildings of England series {{describe}} {{the interior of the}} church as being [...] "atmospheric". [...] There is a west gallery beneath which is a narrow <b>cross-passage.</b> The seating is arranged as that of a college chapel, each side facing the middle, and consists of six ranks of box pews. In the middle of {{the north side of the}} church is a three-decker pulpit with a sounding board. The chancel arch incorporates medieval fabric. [...] On each side of the chancel arch is a painted text board, and there is a panel painted with the royal arms of George II opposite the pulpit. There is another painted panel, formerly a clock face, dated 1719. The font consists of an 18th-century bowl on an earlier stem. The east window contains stained glass to the memory of Mrs Gaunt who, according to the inscription, was [...] "the last female martyr burnt at Tyburn for the cause of the Protestant religion" [...] in 1685. [...] This window was made by Shrigley and Hunt in 1889. The other stained glass includes a window of 1925 designed by J. E. Nuttgens for Powell's depicting Saint Margaret of Scotland, and one by D. Cottier dated 1890 depicting Saint Cecilia. Also in the church is an 18th-century monument to members of the Fothergill family. [...] The two-manual pipe organ was made in 1891 by Harrison and Harrison. [...] In the tower are three bells, but these are no longer ringable; they date respectively from about 1530, from 1694, and from 1743.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of risk factors associated {{with the construction of}} excavated tunnel <b>cross-passages</b> in soft soils. The investigation focused on excavations where freezing technologies are used to provide temporary support. The relevant risk factors and their associated probabilistic data were gathered from elicitation of experts. A ranking of the most important factors was obtained for an on-going project: Sluiskil tunnel in the Netherlands. This was made possible by modelling the risk factors using Bayesian Belief Networks. Based on the modelling results the project has increased its awareness of the relevant risk factors in the construction of cross- passages and further optimized the associated mitigation measure...|$|R
50|$|The tunnel's twin bores {{are each}} {{approximately}} 1600 ft in length, 38 ft wide and 25 ft tall (as measured from the roadway {{to the top}} of the tunnel arch). A prominent feature of the tunnel is the noticeably inclined gradient of each bore and its associated roadway. Southbound traffic experiences a significant descending gradient inside the tunnel, while northbound traffic experiences a corresponding ascending gradient. <b>Cross-passages</b> occur every 265 ft allowing for five emergency ways in. Besides paved openings, the tunnel has traffic signals, lighting, message signs, carbon monoxide monitors, fire protection, and closed-circuit television systems to monitor traffic remotely at the Fort Smith highway department district headquarters.|$|R
2500|$|The {{motorway}} {{is designed}} to alleviate traffic congestion in the rapidly growing city, especially in the congested central business district and Fortitude Valley. The major benefit of the [...] toll road is that it bypasses 24 sets of traffic lights, potentially saving 15 minutes of travel time, and provides an additional Brisbane River crossing. The concrete road includes [...] of tunnel and 18 bridges. It has two lanes of traffic in each direction via parallel tubes. There are 41 <b>cross-passages</b> spaced every [...] in the tunnel for use in emergencies. Access from the southern end is via Shaftson Avenue, Ipswich Road and the Pacific Motorway. Northern connections include Lutwyche Road, the Inner City Bypass and the Airport Link tunnel.|$|R
