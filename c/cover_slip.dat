50|$|The {{cover glass}} often has several other functions. It holds the {{specimen}} in place (either {{by the weight}} of the <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> or, {{in the case of a}} wet mount, by surface tension) and protects the specimen from dust and accidental contact. It protects the microscope's objective lens from contacting the specimen and vice versa; in oil immersion microscopy or water immersion microscopy the <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> prevents contact between the immersion liquid and the specimen. The <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> can be glued to the slide so as to seal off the specimen, retarding dehydration and oxidation of the specimen. Microbial and cell cultures can be grown directly on the <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> before it is placed on the slide, and specimens may be permanently mounted on the slip instead of on the slide.|$|E
50|$|Unlike oil, {{water does}} not have the same or near identitical {{refractive}} value as the <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> glass, so a correction collar is needed to be able to variate for its thickness. Lens without correction collar generally are made for the use of a 0.17 mm <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> or for use without a coverslip (dipping lens).|$|E
40|$|Antibody against {{reovirus}} type I must partially purified and conjugated with {{fluorescein isothiocyanate}} (FITC). The FITC-labeled antibody was then conjugated with 125 I. A gamma globulin fraction of normal sera was similarly labeled with FITC {{followed by a}} 131 I label. The FITC + 125 I-labeled immune reagent was then mixed on an equal protein basis with the FITC + 131 I control reagent. This mixture was used to stain acetone-fixed reovirus-infected <b>cover</b> <b>slips.</b> After staining, the <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Infected <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> demonstrated characteristic reovirus immunofluorescence, whereas uninfected <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were negative. After visual examination, the <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were placed in tubes and counted in a two-channel gamma analyzer. By comparing the quantitative isotope data with the qualtitative information from immunofluorescence on a single preparation, {{it was possible to}} correlate antigen production sites with quantitative production values...|$|R

50|$|A <b>cover</b> <b>slip,</b> {{coverslip}} {{or cover}} glass {{is a thin}} flat piece of transparent material, usually square or rectangular, about 20 mm (4/5 in) wide and {{a fraction of a}} millimetre thick, that is placed over objects for viewing with a microscope. The object is usually held between the <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> and a somewhat thicker microscope slide, which rests on the microscope's stage or slide holder and provides the physical support for the object and slip.|$|E

50|$|The main {{function}} of the <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> is to keep solid specimens pressed flat, and liquid samples shaped into a flat layer of even thickness. This is necessary because high-resolution microscopes have a very narrow region within which they focus.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1888 Test Match at the Oval, George Lohmann {{took what}} Pardon thought was [...] "the finest {{of all the}} catches at <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> ever brought off by George Lohmann".

50|$|The {{polarization}} of the input beam (assumed to be collimated and monochromatic) can be chosen freely (linear, circular, or elliptic). Furthermore, a constant or Gaussian shaped input beam intensity profile can be assumed. On {{its way from}} the objective to the focus, the illumination light passes through up to three stratified optical layers, which allows the simulation of an immersion oil/air (layer 1) objective that focusses light through a glass <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> (layer 2) into the sample medium (layer 3). Each layer is characterized by its (constant) refractive index and thickness. PSF Lab can also simulate microscope objectives that are corrected for certain refractive indices and <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> thicknesses (design parameters). Thus, any deviations from the ideal imaging conditions for which the objective was designed for are properly taken into account.|$|E
30|$|The XPS {{analysis}} of the PEGylated <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> was done in comparison with two sets of control samples. One set of controls consisted of piranha treated and PEGylated silicon wafers and was used to confirm peak positions. The second set of controls consisted of glass <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> from intermediate steps of the processing, both after the HCl step and after the piranha step, respectively.|$|R
30|$|As a {{negative}} control, the ISO 10993 - 5 (International Standard Organization; ISO 10993 - 5 2009) recommends using Thermanox plastic <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> (NUNC™, Naperville, IL, USA) {{with a size}} of 6  cm 2 / 2  ml media. The Thermanox plastic <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were cut into small pieces, soaked in DMEM, and incubated under 5 % CO 2 at 37  °C for 24  h before testing.|$|R
30|$|The {{surfaces}} used to {{seal the}} observation chamber and for the motility analysis were either acid washed glass (AWG) <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> (Carl Roth GmbH) or <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> coated with FOTS or polyethyleneglycoltriethoxysilane (PEG). FOTS silane was coated on glass <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for 2  h at 80  °C [10]. Subsequently samples were rinsed with ethanol (p.A.) and dried with N 2 gas. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) triethoxysilane (PEG 2000 -urea) was synthesized according to previously published protocols [23]. Prior to coating, glass <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were activated by piranha solution (H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O 2  =  3 : 1). 0.25  mM PEG silane and 2.5  µM triethylamine were dissolved in dried toluene (p.A.). The activated glass <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were immersed in this solution and allowed to react for 48  h at 55  °C. Subsequently, the samples were rinsed with ethyl acetate (p.A.) and sonicated in ethyl acetate for 2  min and then rinsed again with ethyl acetate and methanol (p.A.). All surface coatings were characterized by ellipsometry, XPS, and contact angle goniometry. The AWG coverslips were prepared by immersion in 0.1  M HCl for 24  h, before washing extensively in deionised water and blowing dry in a stream of nitrogen. For the standard spore settlement assay, clean-room sealed Nexterion glass slides (Schott) were used as substrate. Slides were reacted with FOTS and PEG as supplied.|$|R
5000|$|One {{challenge}} among {{in vitro}} MEAs has been imaging them with microscopes that use high power lenses, requiring low working distances {{on the order}} of micrometers. In order to avoid this problem, [...] "thin"-MEAs have been created using <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> glass. These arrays are approximately 180 μm allowing them to be used with high-power lenses.|$|E
50|$|Immersion oils are {{transparent}} oils {{that have}} specific optical and viscosity characteristics necessary {{for use in}} microscopy. Typical oils used have an index of refraction around 1.515. An oil immersion objective is an objective lens specially designed {{to be used in}} this way. The index of the oil is typically chosen to match the index of the microscope lens glass, and of the <b>cover</b> <b>slip.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{may also}} {{be used in the}} {{laboratory}} as a biological slide stain. At this point, it is already blue, and a few drops are used on a water slide. The <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> is placed on top of the water droplet and the specimen in it, with the blue coloring mixed in. It is sometimes used to define cell walls or nuclei under the microscope.|$|E
50|$|Specimen was {{injected}} with (6-3H)-thymidine, {{and then the}} tissue was sacrificed, removed after 1 hour and quenched in liquid nitrogen. Then 4 µm cryostat sections were cut and mounted on clean <b>cover</b> <b>slips,</b> the <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were held with sections in cryostat, fixed in cold analar acetone for 10 minutes and the <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were rinsed in buffer-incubated in acid phosphate medium (15 minutes). Naphthol AS TR phosphate {{was used as the}} substrate and hexazonium paraosaniline as coupler. Again the sections were rinsed thoroughly in distilled water and the sections were dipped in autoradiography emulsion (I1ford L4 diluted 1:5). Preparations were exposed to be (0-4 °C) 2 to 3 weeks in dark room. The photographical slide was processed, counterstained in haematoxylin and mounted for microscopy.|$|R
30|$|All {{steps were}} {{performed}} {{in the same way}} for 5 batches of 4 <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> each. The term ‘batch’ is throughout the study consistently and exclusively used for the modified surfaces, successively named batch 1 – 5. The glass <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were first cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaning unit (Sonorex Digital DK 102 P from BANDELIN electronic GmbH & Co. KG; Berlin, Germany) at 50 °C and 100 % power for 20 min in a 20 % (v/v) solution of Extran® MA 01 and after a thorough wash in double distilled H 2 O (ddH 2 O) once more at 50 °C and 100 % power for 20 min in ddH 2 O. Subsequently, the <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were rinsed again in ddH 2 O and immersed into a freshly prepared 10 % solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and incubated overnight to resolve interfering surface ions, in particular sodium and potassium ions [15]. After a thorough wash with ddH 2 O, the <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were immersed into a freshly prepared piranha solution (30 % hydrogen peroxide: 95 % sulphuric acid 1 : 2) at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. This treatment ‘activates’ the surface by covering it with hydroxyl groups [16]. The <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were washed extensively with ddH 2 O and blow dried in a nitrogen flow just before the PEGylation step. The one-step PEGylation of the surface was performed as described [7]. In short, dry toluene was added to a reaction flask under a nitrogen atmosphere and the dry and activated <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were placed in the toluene. An amount of approximately 0.5 mg of mPEG 2000 -urea-triethoxysilane per ml of toluene was added, corresponding to 0.25 mM. Triethylamine was then added under nitrogen atmosphere in an amount of 253 nl per ml of toluene (2.5 μM). Approximately 1 μl of ddH 2 O per 10 ml of toluene was added to the inner wall of the reaction flask to aid the reaction (personal communication with Yvonne Schön, MPI Stuttgart, Germany). The reaction flask was closed and incubated at 80 °C overnight. The next day, after cooling the flask to RT, the <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were directly immersed into ethyl acetate and washed twice in ethyl acetate and three times in methanol. After a sonication in methanol for 2 min at 100 %, the <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were dried in a stream of nitrogen.|$|R
30|$|To {{evaluate}} inactivation {{of dried}} spores on glass <b>cover</b> <b>slips,</b> spore cultures were mixed (200 rpm) in 1 : 1 EtOH:H 2 O for 4 hours, {{and after the}} final centrifugation, the spore suspension was diluted to an OD 600 of 1.0 (~ 108 CFU mL- 1). 100 μL of spore suspensions of both B. subtilis ATCC 6051 and B. pumilus SAFR- 032 were each deposited onto three sterile microscope slide cover slips; these <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were allowed to dry {{at room temperature for}} 24 h in a laminar air flow chamber. After drying, the <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were exposed to a fine mist of stabilized chlorine dioxide solution at 47 or 187 μg/mL concentration for less than one second. The ClO 2 -treated samples were undisturbed for a desired duration (10 min, 60 min, or 24 h) in a laminar air flow chamber. <b>Cover</b> <b>slips</b> were transferred to a 50 mL Falcon® tube containing 10 mL 0.1 mol L- 1 sodium thiosulfate to neutralize remaining active chlorine dioxide on the <b>cover</b> <b>slips.</b> The tubes containing the thiosulfate solution and <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were placed in an ultrasonic water bath (Ultrasonic Cleaner B- 220, Branson Cleaning Equipment, Shelton, CT) for 2 minutes to dislodge the spores, followed by vigorous vortex mixing for 10 seconds (previously used in removal of B. cereus spores from metal coupons) (Tauveron et al. 2006). The resulting spore suspensions were serially diluted with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 8 g L- 1 NaCl, 0.2 g L- 1 KCl, 1.44 g L- 1 Na 2 HPO 4, 0.24 g L- 1 KH 2 PO 4, pH 7.4) and 100 μL portions were spread on TSA plates. Plates were incubated at 37 °C to observe spore viability and the colonies counted after 48 h.|$|R
50|$|Vapor {{diffusion}} can {{be performed}} in either hanging-drop or sitting-drop format. Hanging-drop apparatus involve a drop of protein solution placed on an inverted <b>cover</b> <b>slip,</b> which is then suspended above the reservoir. Sitting-drop crystallization apparatus place the drop on a pedestal that is separated from the reservoir. Both of these methods require sealing of the environment so that equilibration between the drop and reservoir can occur.|$|E
50|$|The hjärta & smärta EP is an EP made by Swedish {{rock band}} Kent, {{released}} in 2005. The {{production of the}} EP was kept secret and it was announced just one month before its release. The CD and <b>cover</b> <b>slip,</b> in contrast to Kent's previous release Du & jag döden, are both almost completely white. As of 2007, the album had sold 40,000 copies.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> {{is often}} {{glued to the}} {{microscope}} slide, in order to seal off the specimen from contamination and decay. A number of sealants are in use, including commercial sealants, laboratory preparations, or even regular clear nail polish, depending on the sample. A solvent-free sealant {{that can be used}} for live cell samples is [...] "valap", a mixture of vaseline, lanolin and paraffin in equal parts.|$|E
30|$|Microscopic {{investigation}} of the NFAP-specific antifungal effect was carried out on A. nidulans FGSC A 4 and A. nidulans actin-GFP conidia (105 conidia/mL) which were immobilised on <b>cover</b> <b>slips,</b> and incubated in CM at 37 °C (or at 30 °C in case of A. nidulans actin-GFP strain) for 16  h. For the {{investigation of}} the short-time antifungal effect, <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were treated with CM supplemented with sublethal concentration of NFAP (25  µg/mL) for 30 and 60  min at 37 °C (or at 30 °C in case of A. nidulans actin-GFP strain). CM without NFAP was used as control. To reveal the long-time antifungal effect <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were incubated in the presence of NFAP for 16  h at 37 °C (or at 30 °C in case of A. nidulans actin-GFP strain).|$|R

50|$|In a dry mount, the {{simplest}} kind of mounting, {{the object is}} merely placed on the slide. A <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> may be placed on top to protect the specimen and the microscope's objective {{and to keep the}} specimen still and pressed flat. This mounting can be successfully used for viewing specimens like pollen, feathers, hairs, etc. It is also used to examine particles caught in transparent membrane filters (e.g., in analysis of airborne dust).|$|E
50|$|The {{thickness}} of the <b>cover</b> <b>slip</b> is crucially important for high-resolution microscopy. Typical biological microscope objectives are designed for use with No. 1.5 cover slips (0.17 mm thickness). Mount is used to attach the cover glass to the slide. The use of cover slips that deviate from this intended thickness will result in spherical aberration {{and a reduction in}} resolution and image intensity. Specialty objectives may used to image specimens without coverslips, or may have correction collars that permit a user to accommodate for alternative coverslip thickness.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the potential of a PEG-layer to prevent surface interactions of PBMC, PEGylated glass <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were prepared. We decided to use mPEG 2000 -urea since it has been identified to be the optimal PEG coating for SiO 2 -wafers by Blümmel et al. [7]. PEG modified <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle goniometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM). PBMC were isolated from blood donations and time-laps videos of PBMC on the PEGylated surfaces were recorded and analysed.|$|R
