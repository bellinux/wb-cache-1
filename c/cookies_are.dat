5|$|Tahini <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> an Israeli origin cookies made of tahini, flour, {{butter and}} sugar and usually topped with pine nuts.|$|E
25|$|Before any procedures, the oreo <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> {{frozen for}} 3 hours {{and the oil}} is {{preheated}} to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. After that, the buttermilk pancake mix is stirred with {{the water in a}} mixing bowl. The oreo <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> dipped in the mixture, making sure the oreo is fully covered with the batter. The coated oreo <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> then dropped into hot oil until the cookies turn golden brown. The <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> removed from the oil and placed on a sheet pan with paper towels for draining the excessive oil. In the meantime, the tops of the fried oreos are dusted with confectioners sugar.|$|E
25|$|McDonaldland <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> {{traditionally}} {{available and}} {{are similar to}} animal crackers, except {{the shapes of the}} <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> of Ronald McDonald, Grimace, Birdie the Early Bird, and the Hamburglar, among other McDonaldland characters. In fact, they are manufactured by Keebler, and are just re-branded animal crackers (Elfin Crackers or Our Family Animal Crackers). In Australia, the McDonaldland <b>Cookies</b> <b>are</b> manufactured by Arnotts and are sold in McDonald's restaurants for $1.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cookies</b> <b>were</b> made in {{the shape}} of animals (called [...] "bulls") and other <b>cookies</b> <b>were</b> {{made in the}} form of a circle with a bird shown on it (called [...] "years"). Together, these <b>cookies</b> <b>were</b> hung from the ceiling.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> a light golden {{color and}} studded with golden pine nuts (also called pignoli). Made with almond paste, the <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> moist, soft and chewy beneath the pine nuts. Often it is formed in a {{crescent}} shape; otherwise it <b>is</b> round. This <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> a popular Italian holiday treat, especially at Christmas. Because both almond paste and pine nuts are relatively expensive, and this cookie uses {{substantial amounts of}} both, this <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> a luxury food.|$|R
50|$|A zombie <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> a <b>cookie</b> that <b>is</b> {{automatically}} recreated {{after being}} deleted. This {{is accomplished by}} storing the cookie's content in multiple locations, such as Flash Local shared object, HTML5 Web storage, and other client-side and even server-side locations. When the <b>cookie's</b> absence <b>is</b> detected, the <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> recreated using the data stored in these locations.|$|R
25|$|Line arrows {{are used}} to point towards the nearest exit, and <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> used to {{indicate}} use of a line {{by a team of}} divers.|$|E
25|$|Flash <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> unlike HTTP {{cookies in}} a sense that they are not {{transferred}} from the client back to the server. Web browsers read and write these cookies and can track any data by web usage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cookies</b> <b>are</b> seen so {{negatively}} {{because they}} are not understood and go unnoticed while someone is simply surfing the Internet. The idea that every move one makes while on the Internet is being watched, would frighten most users.|$|E
5000|$|Rumors that fortune <b>cookies</b> <b>were</b> {{invented in}} China {{are seen as}} false. [...] In 1989, fortune <b>cookies</b> <b>were</b> {{reportedly}} imported into Hong Kong and sold as [...] "genuine American fortune cookies". [...] Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune <b>cookies</b> <b>were</b> considered [...] "too American".|$|R
5000|$|Another {{version of}} the <b>cookies</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} called TMNT Sandwich Cremes. It consisted of vanilla or chocolate cookies sandwiched together like an Oreo. The <b>cookies</b> <b>were</b> shaped like the turtles.|$|R
50|$|The {{last three}} books are Coco Caramel and Sweet Honey and Fortune <b>Cookie.</b> Coco Caramel <b>was</b> {{released}} in June 2013, Sweet Honey {{was released in}} 2014 and Fortune <b>Cookie</b> <b>was</b> released in June 2015. Fortune <b>Cookie</b> <b>is</b> the last book in the series.|$|R
25|$|Cookies do have {{benefits}} {{that many people}} may not know. One benefit is that for websites that one frequently visits that requires a password, cookies make it so {{they do not have}} to sign in every time. A cookie can also track one's preferences to show them websites that might interest them. Cookies make more websites free to use without any type of payment. Some of these benefits are also seen as negative. For example, one of the most common ways of theft is hackers taking one's user name and password that a cookie saves. While a lot of sites are free, they have to make a profit some how so they sell their space to advertisers. These ads, which are personalized to one's likes, can often freeze one's computer or cause annoyance. <b>Cookies</b> <b>are</b> mostly harmless except for third-party cookies. These <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> not made by the website itself, but by web banner advertising companies. These third-party <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> so dangerous because they take the same information that regular cookies do, such as browsing habits and frequently visited websites, but then they give out this information to other companies.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{web sites}} have not {{generally}} made the user explicitly {{aware of the}} storing of cookies, however tracking cookies and especially third-party tracking <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories — a privacy concern that prompted European and US lawmakers to take action in 2011. Cookies can also have implications for computer forensics. In past years, most computer users were not completely aware of cookies, but recently, users have become conscious of possible detrimental effects of Internet cookies: a recent study done has shown that 58% of users have at least once, deleted cookies from their computer, and that 39% of users delete cookies from their computer every month. Since <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> advertisers' main way of targeting potential customers, and some customers are deleting cookies, some advertisers started to use persistent Flash cookies and zombie cookies, but modern browsers and anti-malware software can now block or detect and remove such cookies.|$|E
25|$|Up to 28 {{varieties}} of Girl Scout <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> offered. The same cookies may be sold under different names by different bakeries, {{with the choice}} of bakery determining the name. There has been no move to standardize names. The merger of many councils (from 312 to 109) following the August 2006 reorganization resulted in many councils changing bakeries, thus causing some confusion at that time.|$|E
5000|$|A zombie <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> any HTTP <b>cookie</b> that <b>is</b> recreated after deletion, such as by Evercookie.|$|R
50|$|Unique user {{counts for}} {{websites}} are typically counted by using cookies. When a browser visits a website, the website checks {{for the existence}} of a particular cookie. If the <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> present, the <b>cookie</b> value <b>is</b> captured. If the <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> not present, the website will create a cookie.|$|R
50|$|A {{black-and-white}} cookie, or half-and-half <b>cookie,</b> <b>is</b> a soft, sponge-cake-like shortbread {{which is}} iced on one half with vanilla fondant, {{and on the}} other half by chocolate fondant. This <b>cookie</b> <b>was</b> created in Germany.|$|R
25|$|Girl Scout <b>Cookies</b> <b>are</b> cookies sold by Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) {{as one of}} {{its major}} fundraisers for local Scout units. Members of the GSUSA have been selling cookies since 1917 to raise funds. Girls who {{participate}} can earn prizes for their efforts. There are also troop incentives if the troop as a whole does well. As of 2007, sales were estimated at approximately 200 million boxes per year.|$|E
25|$|Girl Scout <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> made {{by large}} {{national}} commercial bakeries under license from Girl Scouts of the USA. The bakers {{licensed by the}} organization may change from year to year, though this is not common. In 2008 the licensed companies were Little Brownie Bakers (LBB), a subsidiary of Keebler, {{which is owned by}} Kellogg's; and ABC Bakers, a subsidiary of Interbake Foods, which is owned by George Weston Limited.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cookies</b> <b>are</b> often {{associated}} with pop-up windows because these windows are often, but not always, tailored to a person’s preferences. These windows are an irritation because they are often hard to close out of because the close button is strategically hidden in an unlikely part of the screen. In the worst cases, these pop-up ads can take over the screen and while trying to exit out of it, can take one to another unwanted website.|$|E
50|$|In most English-speaking {{countries}} outside North America, {{including the}} United Kingdom, {{the most common}} word for a crisp <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> biscuit. The term <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> normally used to describe chewier ones. However, in many regions both terms are used.|$|R
50|$|A Ranger <b>Cookie</b> <b>is</b> {{an improvised}} {{confection}} created {{through the use}} of MRE condiments. The <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> created by baking sugar and coffee creamer over a heat source. Depending on the MRE variant, other ingredients can be added to the cookie.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>cookies</b> <b>was</b> not widely {{known to the}} public at the time. In particular, <b>cookies</b> <b>were</b> accepted by default, and users were not notified of their presence. The general public learned about cookies after the Financial Times published an article about them on February 12, 1996. In the same year, cookies received a lot of media attention, especially because of potential privacy implications. <b>Cookies</b> <b>were</b> discussed in two U.S. Federal Trade Commission hearings in 1996 and 1997.|$|R
25|$|Girl Scouts sell {{cookies to}} relatives, friends, neighbors, {{and others in}} their town or city. In recent years, because of safety concerns, an {{increased}} emphasis {{has been placed on}} cookie booths, where girls sell from tables in public areas under the supervision of adult troop leaders, rather than door-to-door. Many councils offer the option for customers to sponsor boxes of cookies to be sent to U.S. servicemen and women. <b>Cookies</b> <b>are</b> also available online.|$|E
25|$|Features of Dillo include bookmarks, tabbed browsing, {{and support}} for JPEG, PNG (including alpha transparency), and GIF images. Partial support for CSS was {{introduced}} in release 2.1. Settings such as the default fonts, background color, downloads folder, and home page are customizable through configuration files. <b>Cookies</b> <b>are</b> supported but disabled by default due to privacy concerns. While most web browsers retain the web cache and history after the program is closed, Dillo automatically clears them to improve both privacy and performance.|$|E
25|$|When some users {{choose to}} disable HTTP cookie to reduce privacy risks as noted, {{new types of}} cookies were invented: since <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> advertisers' main way of {{targeting}} potential customers, and some customers were deleting cookies, some advertisers started to use persistent Flash cookies and zombie cookies. In a 2009 study, Flash cookies {{were found to be}} a popular mechanism for storing data on the top 100 most visited sites. Another 2011 study of social media found that, “Of the top 100 web sites, 31 had at least one overlap between HTTP and Flash cookies.” However, modern browsers and anti-malware software can now block or detect and remove such cookies.|$|E
50|$|The Common Domain <b>Cookie</b> <b>is</b> {{a secure}} browser cookie scoped {{to the common}} domain. For each browser user, this cookie stores a history list of {{recently}} visited IdPs. The name and value of the <b>cookie</b> <b>are</b> specified in the IdP Discovery Profile (SAMLProf).|$|R
50|$|Camp <b>Cookie</b> <b>is</b> in Glocester, RI.|$|R
50|$|Putri salju <b>cookie</b> <b>is</b> {{a typical}} {{delicacy}} for festive occasions and major holidays, such as Lebaran (Eid ul-Fitr), Natal (Christmas) and Imlek (Chinese New Year). Putri salju <b>cookie</b> <b>are</b> usually sold in air-tight plastic or glass jars in traditional markets, bakeries, pastry shops and supermarkets.|$|R
25|$|In 2012 and 2013, Google reached two {{settlements}} over tracking consumers online {{without their}} knowledge after bypassing privacy settings in Apple’s Safari browser. The first was settlement in August 2012 for $22.5 million with the Federal Trade Commission—the largest civil penalty the F.T.C. has ever obtained for {{a violation of}} a Commission order. The second was a November 2013 settlement for $17 million with 37 states and the District of Columbia. In addition to the fines, Google agreed to avoid using software that overrides a browser's cookie-blocking settings, to avoid omitting or misrepresenting information to consumers about how they use Google products or control the ads they see, to maintain for five years a web page explaining what <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> and how to control them, {{and to ensure that}} the cookies tied to Safari browsers expire. In both settlements Google denied any wrongdoing, but said it discontinued circumventing the settings early in 2012, after the practice was publicly reported, and stopped tracking Safari users and showing them personalized ads.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2017, Amazon {{launched}} {{a line of}} snack foods under the name Wickedly Prime. The products, such as chips and <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> only available to Amazon Prime members.|$|E
2500|$|Native sweets and delicacies like pastillas, turonnes de casuy, buro, are {{the most}} sought after by Filipinos {{including}} {{a growing number of}} tourists who enjoy authentic Kapampangan cuisine. The famous cookie in Mexico, Pampanga, Panecillos de San Nicolas, which is known as the mother of all Philippine cookies, is made here, famously made by Lillian Borromeo. [...] The <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> made with arrowroot, sugar, coconut milk and butter and are blessed in Catholic parishes every year on the feast of San Nicolas Tolentino. [...] The <b>cookies</b> <b>are</b> believed to have a healing power and bestow good luck and are sometimes crumbled into rice fields before planting.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cookie</b> <b>was</b> {{featured}} in Midwest advertisements, {{such as the}} [...] "Save the Cookie" [...] campaign {{in opposition to the}} proposed and failed AirTran takeover. The <b>cookie</b> <b>was</b> served during professional baseball games at Kauffman Stadium, as well as Bucks basketball and Admirals hockey games at Milwaukee's Bradley Center.|$|R
5000|$|Alistair <b>Cookie</b> <b>is</b> <b>Cookie</b> Monster's {{alter ego}} when hosting [...] "Monsterpiece Theater." [...] Created as a spoof of the {{original}} Masterpiece Theatre host Alistair Cooke, Alistair <b>Cookie</b> <b>is</b> basically <b>Cookie</b> Monster in an English smoking jacket and ascot tie, although Cooke was neither a pipe smoker nor did he wear a smoking jacket on Masterpiece Theatre. Alistair Cookie introduced viewers to a spot of culture while relaxing in a well-stuffed armchair. Though seemingly more sedate and urbane, Alistair <b>Cookie</b> <b>is</b> still a <b>Cookie</b> Monster, devouring baked goods, props—and in the revamped opening in the 1990s, noisily consuming cookies over the theme, while offering judicious comments on the texture.|$|R
5000|$|Cookie: <b>Cookie</b> <b>is</b> {{a female}} pink squirrel, and is charming {{as well as}} beautiful. She is the {{operator}} of the control tower and changes her voice {{to that of a}} mature woman over the voice box. Boris is also her adoptive brother. <b>Cookie</b> <b>is</b> the desire of Ned and Fed's romantic dreams.|$|R
