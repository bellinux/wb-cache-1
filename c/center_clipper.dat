40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [93]- 94) In telecommunication, {{the echo}} canceler using an adaptive filter {{is the most}} effective technique for controlling echoes. Because the precision of speech detection significantly affects how the echo path is modeled, this thesis presents the structures of two echo cancelers and two speech detectors. Of the two echo cancelers, one is based on echo path loss (EPL) of 6 dB and the other uses two different echo path models. The speech detectors using a three variable-length windows technique are implemented as the far-end speech detector. Double-talk detectors based on EPL and echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) are also developed and evaluated. Different adaptation algorithms on the adaptive filter are discussed. The normalized partial block least-mean-square (NPBLMS) algorithm is discussed and compared with the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) algorithm. The results show that the former algorithm achieves a better performance. The <b>center</b> <b>clipper</b> is also introduced and implemented to compress the residual echo. The overall programs have been implemented on the digital signal processor TMS 320 C 54 x, where the partial maximum algorithm is also developed for the echo canceler in order to save more computation on DSP program.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{acknowledged that the}} presence of additive and convolutional noise and speech level variations can seriously deteriorate the performance of a speech recognizer. In case an auditory model is used as the acoustic front-end, it turns out that compensation techniques such as spectral subtraction and log-spectral mean subtraction can be outperformed by time-domain techniques operating on the band-pass filtered signals which are supplied to the haircell models. In [1] we showed that additive noise could be removed effectively by means of <b>center</b> <b>clippers</b> put in front of the haircell models. This technique, which was called linear noise magnitude subtraction (NMS), is further improved in this paper. The nonlinear NMS proposed here outperforms the linear one, especially for low Signal-to-Noise Ratios. To compensate for speech level variations and convolutional noise, we have adopted the same filosophy: remove the effects before the signal is supplied to the haircell models. This is accomplished by introducing normalization gains in front of the haircell models. It is shown that this loudness mean normalization (LMN) technique when used in combination whith NMS offers a highly robust speech representation...|$|R
5000|$|During a 2006 game, Reggie Evans grabbed Los Angeles <b>Clippers</b> <b>center</b> Chris Kaman in the {{testicles}} in {{an attempt}} to gain a position advantage. Kaman immediately pushed Evans to the floor and later said, [...] "I felt I got a little violated by another man." [...] However, Kaman ultimately decided not to press assault charges against Evans. Evans was fined $10,000 and a flagrant foul-two for his actions.|$|R
25|$|The Clippers won {{the first}} overall pick in the 1998 Draft Lottery and {{selected}} center Michael Olowokandi from University of the Pacific. The team had a 0–17 start and finished with a 9–41 record in the shortened 1998–99 season. They were led by second-year forward Maurice Taylor, who averaged 16.8 points per game, and won the fourth overall pick in the following draft, which co-incided with their move to the Staples <b>Center.</b> The <b>Clippers</b> would draft Lamar Odom, and then hired former All-Star (and Los Angeles native) Dennis Johnson as an assistant coach, as well as Hall of Fame former Laker great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to help tutor Olowokandi during his second-year. Johnson remained an assistant coach {{until the middle of}} the 2002–03 season, when he took over as head coach. Abdul-Jabbar remained only one season, detailing a lack of improvement in Olowokandi.|$|R
40|$|An {{objective}} empirical analysis {{technique is}} employed {{to investigate the}} extent to which satellite-obtained measurements (GOES IR and TOVS data) of a tropical cyclone and its environment can be used to predict cyclone motion. The paper describes the procedure used to process the satellite derived data in order to optimize their possible predictive value, the technique used in developing the regression algorithms, and the results of testing these algorithms using the Lachenbrach and Mickey (1968) procedure. The data were examined alone and in conjunction with available nonsatellite climatological and persistence variables for each storm. These predictors are similar to those used in the National Hurricane <b>Center</b> (NHC) <b>CLIPPER</b> model. The performances obtained using the Nichols Research Corporation CLIPPER model and the NHC CLIPPER model are compared, using homogeneous data sets for the comparisons. Major differences in results were found to be related to differences in the models...|$|R
5000|$|The 1999-2000 NBA {{season was}} the Clippers' 30th {{season in the}} National Basketball Association, and their 16th season in Los Angeles. During the offseason, the Clippers {{acquired}} Derek Anderson from the Cleveland Cavaliers, and began playing in their new arena, the Staples <b>Center.</b> The <b>Clippers</b> are co-tenants with their crosstown rival, the Los Angeles Lakers. The team continued to struggle under head coach Chris Ford, as he was replaced with interim Jim Todd after 45 games, while Troy Hudson was released as the team signed free agent Jeff McInnis. However, the Clippers then suffered a 17-game losing streak {{in the final two}} months of the season, finishing last place in the Pacific Division with a league worst record of 15-67. Top draft pick Lamar Odom provided a bright spot as he averaged a solid 16.6 points per game, and made the All-Rookie First Team.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{game that}} season between the two teams won by the Clippers, tempers flared and seven {{technical}} fouls were called. Although it was a home game for the Clippers at Staples, Clippers fans were still outnumbered by Lakers fans. In a heated rematch won by the Lakers, ESPN wrote, [...] "If the Staples co-tenants didn't have a rivalry before game, they have one now." [...] Paul was upset after the game that Lakers forward Pau Gasol touched him on the head. [...] "...don't touch {{the top of my}} head like I'm one of your kids", warned Paul. Some Clippers in 2012 denied that a rivalry existed. Griffin offered that [...] "a rivalry has to be evenly matched, and this one hasn't been over the years." [...] <b>Clippers</b> <b>center</b> DeAndre Jordan said the Lakers [...] "are proven. They have more championships. They have Hall of Famer players. We're still a young team." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{being one}} of the {{youngest}} squads in the NBA, the Grizzlies are rivals with the Los Angeles Clippers. The Grizzlies and Clippers have been rivals since the 2011-12 season, when the Clippers eliminated the Grizzlies {{in the first round of}} the 2012 NBA Playoffs 4 games to 3. The Grizzlies returned the favor in the 2012-13 season, eliminating the Clippers in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs 4 games to 2. There have also been violent scuffles between the players, mainly between the Grizzlies Zach Randolph and the Clippers Blake Griffin. The Grizzlies are also the first team to draw an ejection on Clippers guard Chris Paul after he elbowed Marc Gasol in the ribs in the closing minutes of Game 6. When asked about a rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, <b>Clippers</b> <b>center</b> DeAndre Jordan stated, [...] "I don't think it'll ever be a rivalry. You guys the media want it to be, though. I would say Memphis more than the Lakers. I hate every other NBA team in the league. If anybody our rival, I'd say Memphis." [...] Although the two teams never met in the 2014 playoffs, they still engaged in close, heated matchups in the 2014-15 season. In a Grizzlies home game against the Clippers, the crowd was given flip-flop sandals designating Clippers players as [...] "floppers".|$|R
50|$|In {{basketball}} {{a player}} {{may choose to}} make a pass or shot with the weaker hand. NBA stars Kobe Bryant, Kyrie Irving, Carlos Boozer, David Lee, John Wall, Derrick Rose, Chandler Parsons, Andrew Bogut, Lonzo Ball, John Henson and Michael Beasley, and Jerryd Bayless are ambidextrous players. Bogut and Henson are both stronger in the post with their left-handed hook shot than they are with their natural right hands. Brothers Marc and Pau Gasol can make hook shots with either hand while the right hand is dominant for each. Bob Cousy, a Boston Celtics legend was forced to play with left hand in high school when he injured his right hand, thus making him effectively ambidextrous. Mike Conley is left-handed, but has preferred to shoot floaters right handed, as he does everything else right-handed off the court, Ben Simmons and Luke Kennard are also natural right-handers shooting left-handed. Tristan Thompson is a natural left-hander, and was a left-handed shooter, but has shot right-handed since the 2013-2014 season. He does perform left-handed hook shots more often. LA <b>Clippers</b> <b>center</b> DeAndre Jordan who is left-handed, shoots {{with his left hand}} but has been known to dunk with his right hand, spin clockwise in his 360 dunks, and shoot right handed hook shots more accurately and from further out. Los Angeles Lakers center Roy Hibbert shoots his hook shots equally well with either hand. Oklahoma City Thunder left-handed point guard Derek Fisher used to dunk with his right hand in his early years. Candace Parker, forward for the WNBA Sparks team, also has equal dominance with either hand. Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant shoots with either hand, although his right hand is dominant: due to an injury to the right hand, he was forced to shoot with his left. Paul George, Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter are all noted to be right-handed, but rotates clockwise for dunks, but Carter is able to also spin anticlockwise, as he did during high school. McGrady also spins anti-clockwise for his baseline dunks. Larry Bird, LeBron James, Paul Millsap, Russell Westbrook, Danny Ainge and Gary Payton shoot right-handed, but do almost everything left-handed off the courts, but Bird sometimes would have stretch in games where he would only shoot left-handed running hook shots, cross passes and layups. Ronnie Price, however has a tendency to dunk with his left hand, but he is a right-handed shooter. Josh McRoberts is known to be a left handed shooter but does everything with his right hand such as his famous dunks. Ivica Zubac is a right handed shooter, but can shoot hook shots with both hands, and is more accurate with his left handed hooks.|$|R
