40|$|Solar energy can be {{utilized}} by, either, thermal conversion, or electrical conversion, of solar radiation. Utilization of solar energy by thermal conversion method, is of low cost, but it requires high density of solar radiation. Electrical conversion method, {{on the other}} hand, is expensive, {{but it does not}} need high density of solar radiation. One of the most important applications of thermal conversion of solar energy, is absorption refrigeration. As there are many factors affecting the process of solar refrigeration, a lot of research work must be carried out, before deciding an optimum design of solar refrigeration systems, which utilize solar energy at a low cost. The main objective of this research is to design and construct an apparatus which can be used, as a test rig, by research students, to carry out experiments, regarding the performance of solar absorption refrigeration systems. The apparatus has been designed and constructed so as to be used indoors. One of the many different factors which affect the performance of solar absorption refrigeration systems, has been chosen, to test the apparatus, for functioning.

A decrease in the <b>condenser</b> <b>temperature</b> by 12 °C, in case of an evaporator temperature of Tevap = 7 °C the COP was increased by 57 %, while for Tevap = 13 °C the COP was increased by 41 % and for Tevap = 17 °C the COP was increased by 34. 4 %, respectively.

Our aims were to compare the efficacy of different types of condensers and to test the influence of <b>condensing</b> <b>temperature</b> on condensate composition. MethodsBreath condensates from 12 healthy persons were collected in two settings: (1) by using three condensers of different type (EcoScreen, R-Tube, Anacon) and (2) by using R-Tube condenser either cooled to − 20 or − 70 °C. Condensate pH at standardised CO 2 level was determined; protein content was measured by the Bradford method and leukotrienes by EIA. ResultsBreath condensates collected using EcoScreen were more alkaline (6. 45 ± 0. 20 vs. 6. 19 ± 0. 23, p< 0. 05 and 6. 10 ± 0. 26, p< 0. 001) and contained more protein (3. 89 ± 2. 03 vs. 2. 65 ± 1. 98, n. s. and 1. 88 ± 1. 99 μg/ml, p< 0. 004) as compared to the other devices. Only parameters obtained with R-Tube and Anacon correlated. <b>Condensing</b> <b>temperature</b> affected condensate pH (5. 99 ± 0. 20 at − 20 °C and 5. 82 ± 0. 07 at − 70 °C, p< 0. 05) but not protein content.
