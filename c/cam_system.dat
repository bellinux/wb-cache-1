2500|$|Unpopulated {{boards are}} usually bare-board tested for [...] "shorts" [...] and [...] "opens". A short is a {{connection}} between two points {{that should not be}} connected. An open is a missing connection between points that should be connected. For high-volume production a fixture or a rigid needle adapter makes contact with copper lands on the board. The fixture or adapter is a significant fixed cost and this method is only economical for high-volume or high-value production. For small or medium volume production flying probe testers are used where test probes are moved over the board by an XY drive to make contact with the copper lands. There is no need for a fixture and hence the fixed costs are much lower. The <b>CAM</b> <b>system</b> instructs the electrical tester to apply a voltage to each contact point as required and to check that this voltage appears on the appropriate contact points and only on these.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of short}} cutters {{is a key}} feature of 5 -axis machining. It {{significantly}} reduces the deflection of the tool, results in a better surface quality, prevents reworking and reduces immensely the number of electrode erosions. At {{the same time there}} are increasing requirements placed on <b>CAM</b> <b>systems.</b> Collision control and collision avoidance in particular are complex and time consuming tasks. The knowledge of a collision for a given point and tilt angle is important but useless if the collision cannot be avoided. The automated collision avoidance of a cutterpath, while keeping the machine dynamics and the respect of the given limitations, are strong challenges for today’s <b>CAM</b> <b>systems.</b> Although 5 -axis milling machines and <b>CAM</b> <b>systems</b> with 5 -axis capabilities have existed for many years, it is fairly recent that the two have been useful for the manufacture of Molds and Dies. Challenges facing 5 -axis CAM programmers involve more than just making collision free 5 -axis CAM cutterpaths. Users must constantly consider surface finishes. They must be aware of machine run-times, and how seemingly small options during programming can make significant differences in actual versus theoretical run times. Programmers must consider not only cutterpath calculation times, but also collision checking calculation times, in relation to all programming times. 1...|$|R

Transfer of model data between tools is often through neutral Boundary Representation (B-Rep) formats such as STEP which transfer model geometry only. B-Rep formats do not preserve modelling information and design intent added by high level tools (such as design-by-feature and parametric information captured by CAD systems), and omit information about significant model features from other engineering contexts (e. g. analysis and manufacturing). Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) technologies have been suggested as a solution to engineering tool integration issues and while they {{have been shown to be}} successful in integrating CAD / <b>CAM</b> <b>systems,</b> they have limited application to CAE tools.
