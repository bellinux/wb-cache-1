5|$|When the Achaeans {{arrived at}} Argos for an assembly, Cleomenes <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> Tegea to meet them. However, Aratus—who had reached an {{agreement}} with Antigonus—demanded that Cleomenes present 300 hostages to the Achaeans and enter the city alone, or approach the city with all his forces. When this message reached Cleomenes, he declared {{that he had been}} wronged and once again declared war on the Achaeans.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E
5|$|News of the Donner Party's {{fate was}} spread eastward by Samuel Brannan, an elder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and journalist, who {{ran into the}} salvage party as they <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the pass with Keseberg. Accounts of the ordeal first reached New York City in July 1847. Reporting on the event across the U.S. was heavily {{influenced}} by the national enthusiasm for westward migration. In some papers, news of the tragedy was buried in small paragraphs despite the contemporary tendency to sensationalize stories. Several newspapers, including those in California, wrote about the cannibalism in graphic exaggerated detail. In some print accounts, {{the members of the}} Donner Party were depicted as heroes, and California a paradise worthy of significant sacrifices.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} notion of the -coalescent of Pitman (1999) to the spatial setting. The {{partition}} elements of the spatial Λ-coalescent migrate in a (finite) geographical space and may only coalesce if located at the same site of the space. We characterize the Λ-coalescents that <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> infinity, in an analogous way to Schweinsberg (2000). Surprisingly, all spatial coalescents that <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> infinity, also <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> infinity in a uniform way. This enables us to study space-time asymptotics of spatial Λ-coalescents on large tori in d> 3 dimensions. Our results generalize and strengthen those of Greven et al. (2005), who studied the spatial Kingman coalescent in this context. Comment: 29 page...|$|R
5|$|Shortly after Monitor withdrew, Virginia had {{run aground}} {{at which time}} Commander Jones <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the spar deck {{only to find the}} gun crews not {{returning}} fire. Jones demanded to know why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder was low and precious and given Monitors resistance to shot after two hours of battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition. Virginia soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk, believing that Monitor had withdrawn from battle. Greene, now in command, did not pursue Virginia and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect Minnesota, an action for which he was later criticized.|$|E
5|$|The nominal gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) of Uttar Pradesh grew {{at an annual rate}} of 8 to 12 percent between 2002–03 and 2006-07. When Mayawati began her five-year tenure as chief minister from May 2007, the average annual state GDP growth rate between 2007–08 and 2010-11 shot up to 17 percent. In financial year 2011, UP’s state GDP was predicted to grow by 11 per cent. Thus, UP’s nominal GDP growth in these four years (2007–11) was almost the same as what the entire country clocked in that period. State’s per capita income went up by 136 per cent from about Rs 11,000 in 2007 to Rs 26,000 in 2011. UP continued to be one of the few states with a revenue surplus and Mayawati has used this surplus to reduce the state’s fiscal deficit from 4 percent of state GDP in 2007-08 to a budgeted figure of 2.97 per cent for the financial year 2011. Mayawati also ensured that the state’s indebtedness <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> 43 percent of state GDP in 2007-08 to 32 percent in 2011-12. Mayawati in her five years added about 4,000 MW of generation capacity to the state’s power sector. Mayawati also planned to create 7,000 MW more generation capacity by the end of 2012 for achieving her target is to make state a power-surplus state by 2017 for which the state is already executing power projects with a total capacity of 10,000 MW.|$|E

The other branch that <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> Cao Jiwu was through his other student, Dai Longbang. The latter passed the art into the Dai clan, which had made many changes to it, mixing it with several arts and skills that had already existed in the Dai family. The art remains in the Dai clan to this day, but has also spread elsewhere in China and around the world.|$|E

25|$|While Dragging Canoe and his warriors {{turned their}} attentions to the Cumberland, the Shawnee began raiding {{settlements}} in Upper East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, the latter by now having become Washington County. In particular they targeted those along the Clinch and Holston Rivers and in Powell's Valley. These Shawnee <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> their {{homes on the}} Ohio River {{by way of the}} Warriors' Path through the Cumberland Gap. Their attacks continued, along with occasional forays by McGillivray's Upper Muscogee, even after sporadic raids by the Cherokee renewed, until they began to focus all their attention on the Northwest Indian War.|$|E

Nevertheless, it {{was involved in a}} number of significant engagements throughout July as patrols came into contact with pockets of resistance and small Japanese force's attacked the battalion's observation posts before orders to cease aggressive actions <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> higher command in early August.

25|$|By the {{following}} morning the city of Carrara was surrounded by soldiers {{under the command of}} General Nicola Heusch. A state of siege had been proclaimed by the Crispi government on January 16, 1894. Among those threatened with arrest were many quarry workers, who responded by declaring a general strike. Instead of going to work, they <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the mountains and gathered around the military barracks where hundreds of prisoners had already been detained. Troops were then ordered to amass and, as soon as the crowd came near enough, they fired. Eleven deaths resulted, as well as numerous other casualties. (Other sources mention 8 people killed and 13 wounded). Armed bands dispersed into the mountains pursued by troops.|$|E
25|$|The {{macroeconomic}} measures worked {{wonders for}} production. GDP shot up 9.5 percent in 1986 and a further 7.7 percent in 1987. Manufacturing output and construction both increased {{by more than}} one-fourth in these two years. An even greater surprise was that agricultural production per capita went up, running counter to its long downward trend. And the rate of inflation <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> 163 percent in 1985 to 78 percent in 1986, although it edged back up to 86 percent in 1987. In response to stronger market conditions and perhaps also to growing confidence that Peru's economic problems were at last being attacked successfully, private fixed investment went up by 24 percent in 1986, and capital flight went down.|$|E
