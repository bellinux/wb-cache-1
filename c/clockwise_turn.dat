25|$|Lütjens' tactics proved {{useful in}} two respects. After the Hood battle, he steamed {{directly}} at his pursuers, forcing them away, while his heavy cruiser escaped out of radar range. On 25 May, his 52nd birthday, despite constant action and exhaustion, {{he ordered a}} clever manoeuvre. He ordered full speed and then a three-quarter <b>clockwise</b> <b>turn</b> once his pursuers had reached the extremis of their radar range. The British cruisers had been performing zigzags to avoid German U-boats they {{believed to be in}} the vicinity. At the outer edge of their port turn, they would be at the limit of their radar's range. This allowed him to escape the enemy radar, steam in the opposite direction, and then once behind them steam across their wake and avoid enemy attempts to regain contact.|$|E

500|$|As {{moved into}} the Australian region, Rewa began to move in a long arc to the {{northwest}} {{and then to the}} north, and on 13January, both the JTWC and the Papua New Guinea National Weather Service reported that the system had re-intensified into a tropical cyclone around Papua New Guinea's southern islands. Later that day, Rewa executed a sharp <b>clockwise</b> <b>turn</b> near Tagula Island and started to move towards the southeast and the BoM's area of responsibility while gradually intensifying further. During 15January, the BoM reported that the system had re-intensified into a category 3severe tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become equivalent to a category 1hurricane again. Later that day, the system started to rapidly intensify as an upper level trough approached the system. During the next day the JTWC reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 230km/h (145mph). The BoM then reported later that day, that Rewa had peaked with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 205km/h (125mph), which made it a category 5severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After it had peaked in intensity the system recurved towards the south-southwest, and started to gradually weaken. By 18January the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened into a tropical storm, while throughout that day the BoM assessed Rewa as a category 3severe tropical cyclone. During the next day, the BoM reported that Rewa had weakened into a category 2tropical cyclone as it recurved and started to move towards the south-east about 265km (165mi) to the east of Mackay, Queensland. Over {{the next couple of days}} the system moved towards the south-southeast along the Queensland coast while maintaining its intensity. During 21January, the BoM and the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened below cyclone strength, as the system moved back into the South Pacific basin for the third and final time. Rewa's remnants were last noted late on 23January, by New Zealand's Metservice, bringing heavy rain to New Zealand, while dissipating over water about [...] to the east of Wellington, New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|A turn {{restriction}} routing can {{be obtained}} by prohibiting {{at least one of the}} four possible <b>clockwise</b> <b>turns</b> and at least one of the four possible anti-clockwise turns in the routing algorithm.

50|$|Logic behind turn {{restriction}} routing {{derives from}} a key observation. A cyclic acquisition of channels {{can take place}} only if all the four possible <b>clockwise</b> (or anti-clockwise) <b>turns</b> have occurred.

40|$|Asymmetrical turning {{behavior}} is an established indicator of asymmetrical dopaminergic activity and {{thought to be}} a manifestation of hemispatial neglect. We set out to find converging support for the hypothesis that cortisol modulates frontal dopaminergic asymmetrical activity, and hence dopaminergically mediated approach behaviors, by studying the effect of cortisol administration on turning behavior in healthy subjects. Both when our subjects attempted to rotate through a target angle (twice 360 degrees) in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction with reduced sensory input, cortisol induced a relative <b>clockwise</b> <b>turning</b> bias. Furthermore, this effect interacted with scores on novelty seeking, a putative indicator of individual differences in dopaminergic function: subjects scoring higher on novelty seeking demonstrated a smaller or no increase after cortisol administration in their <b>clockwise</b> <b>turning</b> bias. The results provide converging support for the hypothesis that cortisol modulates frontal dopaminergic asymmetrical activity. As we discuss, they further point to the possible involvement of the insula in cortisol effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
