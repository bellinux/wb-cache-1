40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} results of a qualitative research project investigating an approach to composition instruction in a high school social studies course that is based on the Upanishadic concept of tat tvam asi (you are that). Research for this study was conducted while I taught a section of Non-West History to high school juniors and seniors. This dissertation addresses the issues involved in the teaching of writing in a high school social science course. Specifically it focuses on the issues involved when a teacher attempts to construct a class that engages students to read and write in ways that promote empathic understanding of the other. To make this argument, I collected data in the Non-West History courses that I taught in 2012. The data consists largely of writing prompts I gave students dealing with literature we read and films we watched as well as their written responses. This dissertation argues that writing in a social science class should not be limited to research papers and essay tests. Further, this dissertation agues (citing the work of Jeremy Rifkin, J. Krishnamurti, Carl Rogers, Rollo May, Thomas Merton, and S. Radhakrishnan) that writing assignments should also be given that promote the empathic awareness that the self is the other. Further, I will offer a <b>counter</b> <b>notion</b> that writing in Social Studies classes should not be just about 2 ̆ 2 conveying information 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 demonstrating knowledge 2 ̆ 2 (cf. Kiuhara et al. 150). Instead, writing should be used to give students the opportunities to creatively develop new insights about their place in the world. Thus, this dissertation concludes by proposing a new model for the teaching of writing in a high school social science course...|$|E

Students were exposed to nine different, high-quality, picture books of various genres (including multicultural texts) and asked to select one to own. A mixed subgroup of students had the texts read to them during read aloud sessions, but the majority made selections based on surface-level text structures. Results indicate that Hispanic and non-Hispanic students were more alike than different in their preferences. An overwhelming majority selected informational, rather than narrative books. This finding <b>counters</b> <b>notions</b> that young readers prefer stories and desire books that mirror them in culturally pertinent ways...|$|R

In this essay, I examine the ways that the bodies and memories of the Kamehameha colonists became fertile grounds for re-membering masculinities, a type of gendered memory work that facilitates the formation of group subjectivities through the coordination of personal memories, historical narratives, and bodily experiences and representations. The colonists embodied a Hawaiian- American masculinity that allowed a wide range of interlocutors and audiences to make (sometimes divergent) claims to racialized citizenship and gendered belonging. Their experiences spoke to the predicament of Hawaiian men working in and against US colonialism, and thus they enabled a collective re-membering of Hawaiian masculinities that helped <b>counter</b> <b>notions</b> of Hawaiian men’s laziness, marginality, and absence, both in the political economy of the territory and the present-day movements for self-determination and decolonization...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{argue for a}} more {{explicitly}} geographical insight into the currently dominant theme of transnationalism in studies of contemporary international migration. Although space is not the exclusive concern of geographers, the latter have a more intense engagement with space and its many attendant notions – distance, borders, geometries and spatialities of mobility, power etc. – than other social-science disciplines. The rise in interest in the transnational activities of international migrants in the 1990 s coincided with the ‘spatial turn’ across the social sciences which popularised a flexible, liquid notion of space. Transnational activities provided the ideal empirical support for those wishing to contest firmly territorialised notions of states and power, {{and a range of}} spatial metaphors became popular in association with migration. Over the last decade geographers have built on established critiques of spatial metaphors to try to <b>counter</b> <b>notions</b> of freefloating transnational spaces, without artificially pinning them down. This paper reviews this expanding literature with the aim of locating important sites of state control of transnational activities and identifying a ‘power geometry’ of transnational space. These sites of control are conceptualised through Harvey’s grid of spatial practices and illustrated with examples from our research around the Mediterranean. We select three essential elements of such a power geometry: territory, mobility and technology – each of which is related to both space and the borders that separate space into territories of residence, confinement, crossing, and control...|$|R
40|$|Un-registered Affects” is an {{experimental}} project {{in search of}} an alternative/meta-methodology for architectural and landscape practices of siting, based in notions of “haptic history” and “haptic geography,” that proceeds through an archiving of affective and ephemeral aspects of site derived from an embodied experience of landscape. Taking two peri-urban sites in Mississauga linked together by the Credit River, I create an alternative archive for the temporal, intangible, and fleeting narratives contained in these sites, re-presenting them as a “spatial archive” to <b>counter</b> <b>notions</b> of “the cleared site” (Burns) with a model of land as record and dwelling (Ingold), and with Indigenous ontology and knowledge that land is sacred, “alive and thinking” (Watts). I argue for a re-linking of these impermanent archives to siting practices, to reconnect the body to the layered histories of land and place. Merging distant and proximal histories, my installation places Aboriginal and ‘newcomer’ narratives into relation. The histories of the land include the death of agriculture, immigrant passage/settlement, and Anishinaabe cultivation around the Credit River. 	This is an artistic exploration of tensions: between architectural/mechanical models of precision and measurement, while setting these against the poetic nature of the landscape. My installation counters architectural and colonial clearing of place as a tabula rasa by engaging in processes of surveying, sampling, preserving and archiving land, in anticipation of its imminent erasure. This project is thus a cross-disciplinary exploration of architecture, landscape, geography, and artistic practice...|$|R
5000|$|Kenneth Warren's What Was African American Literature? {{argues that}} black American writing, as a literature, {{began with the}} {{institution}} of Jim Crow legislation and ended with desegregation. In order to substantiate this claim, he cites both the societal pressures to create a distinctly black American literature for uplift {{and the lack of}} a well formulated essential notion of literary blackness. For this scholar, the late 19th and early 20th centuries de jure racism crystallized the canon of African-American literature as black writers conscripted literature as a means to <b>counter</b> <b>notions</b> of inferiority. During this period, “whether African American writers acquiesced in or kicked against the label, they knew what was at stake in accepting or contesting their identification as Negro writers.” He writes that “absent white suspicion of, or commitment to imposing, black inferiority, African American literature would not have existed as a literature” Warren bases part of his argument on the distinction between [...] "the mere existence of literary texts" [...] and the formation of texts into a coherent body of literature. For Warren, it is the coherence of responding to racist narratives in the struggle for civil rights that establishes the body of African-American literature, and the scholar suggests that continuing to refer to the texts produced after the civil rights era as such is a symptom of nostalgia or a belief that the struggle for civil rights has not yet ended.|$|R
