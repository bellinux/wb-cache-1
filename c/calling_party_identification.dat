40|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is {{the future}} for voice {{communication}} and, by using a unique IP infrastructure as the common transport platform, it brings invaluable benefits such as deployment cost reduction, ease of management, ubiquitous coverage and convergence of data and voice together. On the other side, VoIP introduces new security vulnerabilities, since it comes with completely different operational and security settings than the old telephone network: the physical location of clients is not fixed and great flexibility is required to provide enhanced mobile services. Furthermore, the integration with wireless LANs, with their inherent security weaknesses, introduces the need of new security features: the payloads of voice packets should be protected during conversations and no-replay as well as user authentication must be ensured on and end-to-end basis. The above concerns are actually the major barrier that may prevent the wide deployment of VoIP technologies, and coping with them is a truly challenging task. Consequently, we developed a novel hybrid framework for enhanced end-to-end security in the new generation SIP-empowered VoIP environments, based on the introduction of proven technologies such as digital signatures and efficient streamline encryption to enforce <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> <b>identification,</b> privacy, no-replay and non-repudiation throughout the whole IP Telephony system. All the security mechanisms used have been carefully chosen so that no systematic method is known to break the framework in realistic times and the overall voice quality will not be affected.

40|$|Most {{examinations}} of the sociodemographic group foundations of political <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> and <b>party</b> coalitions in the United States rely on national samples (e. g., the National Election Studies). Therefore, {{they fail to}} consider (a) state-to-state variation in the group components of <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> and <b>party</b> coalitions and (b) how state context structures this variation. We rely on media exit polls from the 1988, 1992, and 1996 elections to examine group influences on <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> and <b>party</b> coalitions across the large states. Although there are common threads across the nation in Democratic and Republican support, we find significant state-to-state variation {{in the nature of}} group influences on <b>party</b> <b>identification.</b> For many sociodemographic characteristics, group size conditions the importance of the characteristic for <b>party</b> <b>identification,</b> a finding consistent with a contextual theory of political behavior. A group’s size and the partisan loyalty of its members interact to determine a group’s importance to coali-tion building in a state. <b>Party</b> <b>identification</b> remains central to the study of American politi-cal behavior.

40|$|To compare <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> cross-nationally in Europe, we need {{to analyse}} both {{individual}} and contextual characteristics that influence individuals during processes of learning and socialisation. Although numerous papers on the strength and occurrence of <b>party</b> <b>identifications</b> in Western European countries were published, a comprehensive cross-national analysis of <b>party</b> <b>identifications</b> in Europe has not been carried out yet. The thesis aims at testing the explanatory power of individual characteristics such as interest in politics, contextual variables such as polarisation and the intermediate level characteristic party family on the individual strength of <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> across 27 European countries. Comparable ESS data are {{used to examine the}} strength of <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> of nearly 60, 000 European citizens. The ordered logistic multilevel regression analysis reveals that individual or level 1 characteristics prove to have the strongest positive effect on partisan strength, among those interest in politics, trust and cognitive mobilisation. Contextual variables like polarisation, fragmentation and maturity of democracy exhibit important yet slightly weaker influence. Accordingly, highly polarised societies and party systems in Europe as well as highly fragmented party systems foster strong <b>party</b> <b>identifications.</b> <b>Party</b> family, however, plays only a minor role in explaining partisan strength. In conclusion, <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> is a widespread feature in both Eastern and Western Europe that is triggered by the same factors in both parts. Hence, <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> is a concept widely understood and internalised by European citizens, thus making it a suitable and convenient tool for the study of political attitudes among the general public.

5000|$|Some {{researchers}} view <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> as [...] "a form {{of social}} identity", {{in the same way}} that a person identifies with a religious or ethnic group. This identity develops early in a person's life mainly through family and social influences. This description would make <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> a stable perspective, which develops as a consequence of personal, family, social and environmental factors. Other researchers consider <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> to be more flexible and more of a conscious choice. They see it as a position and a choice based on the continued assessment of the political, economic and social environment. <b>Party</b> <b>identification</b> can increase or even shift by motivating events or conditions in the country.|$|R
40|$|The {{notion that}} electors acquire an {{enduring}} allegiance {{to a political}} party has guided the study of voting behaviour and elections in western democracies for almost three decades. Yet when used outside the United States, where the concept was developed, <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> has been greeted with less unanimous enthusiasm. For Canadian scholars, debate over the concept revolves primarily around (1) the empirical independence of <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> and the vote and (2) the stability of such attachments. Indeed, this debate has occupied much of the efforts of previous analysts in Canada. In this thesis, we reexamine the conventional wisdom about <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> in Canada by looking at two questions. First, are <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> and the vote distinguishable empirical referents in Canada? And secondly, how can we account {{for changes in the}} <b>party</b> <b>identifications</b> of Canadians? Thus, the first question seeks to address the property of independence, and the second, the property of stability. The first hypothesis is that the <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> and the vote are not the same thing, but differ by the impact of short-term forces that contradict partisan attachments. This hypothesis is supported—for all types of partisans, the differences between vote and <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> can be understood, at least in part, as a function of short-term forces. The second hypothesis is that levels of stability and change in <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> are related to individual party images. That is, when these “mental pictures” of the parties serve to reinforce past <b>party</b> <b>identification,</b> identifications will be stable. On the other hand, when these images are in conflict with the party one identified with in the past, there is a smaller likelihood that the individual will remain a stable identifier. We test this hypothesis in two ways. The first relates image of one’s own party to patterns of change and stability in identification, while the second correlates the relative image of all three parties with patterns of partisan stability. In both analyses the patterns that emerge are generally consistent with the expectations derived from the hypothesis. All partisans are more likely to change their <b>party</b> <b>identifications</b> when their images of the parties are in conflict with past party attachments. However, when party images reinforce past identifications, identifications are likely to endure...|$|R
40|$|<b>Party</b> <b>identification</b> {{and core}} {{political}} values are central {{elements in the}} political belief systems of ordinary citizens. Are these predispositions related to one another? Does <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> influence core political values or are partisan identities grounded in such values? This article draws upon theoretical works on partisan information processing and value-based reasoning to derive competing hypotheses about whether partisanship shapes political values or political values shape partisanship. The hypotheses are tested by using structural equation modeling techniques to estimate dynamic models of attitude stability and constraint with data from the 1992 – 94 – 96 National Election Study panel survey. The analyses reveal that partisan identities are more stable than the principles of equal opportunity, limited government, traditional family values, and moral tolerance; <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> constrains equal opportunity, limited government, and moral tolerance; and these political values do not constrain <b>party</b> <b>identification.</b> <b>Party</b> <b>identification</b> and core political values repre-sent {{two of the most}} central and enduring predis-positions lying within the political belief systems of ordinary citizens. <b>Party</b> <b>identification</b> represents a sense of emotional attachment to a political party rooted in the social images of the parties (Campbell et al. 1960; Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2002).

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} between the decline of Materialism and the decline of <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> in the United States. Whereas the phenomenon was analyzed in many Western European nations and it was shown that post-materialism has affected the parties overseas research in the United States is very limited. The question of this work is if the end of materialism will also {{bring an end to the}} traditional parties. After careful analysis the clear answer is no. Although post-materialism clearly affects <b>party</b> <b>identification,</b> it does not affect the strength of <b>party</b> <b>identification.</b> The two phenomena, the decrease in materialism and the decrease in <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> cannot be seen as directly related. Another underlying question of this work was how to improve models to predict <b>party</b> <b>identification,</b> the strength of <b>party</b> <b>identification,</b> and split ticket voting. An analysis of 20 years of American voting behavior in presidential elections shows that combining traditional variables, such as income or age with newer ideas such as post-materialism results in the best models. Four different models (two traditional models using demographics, one model using media usage variables, one model using post-materialism) were tested and generally the traditional models worked better than the new models. Another observation was, however, that the explanatory value of these models was decreasing over time. The best model was a fifth model combining the most effective variables from models one through four which shows that traditional variables are still valuable tools but it is important to also look at new ways to analyze <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> and voting behavior. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, a new {{direction}} has been taken {{in the study of}} economics and politics. Researchers have begun to focus on the role of prospective economic evaluations. The research presented here applies the prospective model to changes in partisanship. Regardless of the time period examined, these prospective economic evaluations exert an important influence on <b>party</b> <b>identification.</b> Individuals change their partisanship in response to their expectations concerning the ability of the parties to provide financial prosperity. These findings indicate that previous examinations of the electorate have understated the rationality of the populace, and, accordingly, previous theories of political behavior are in need of revision. Over the past thirty years, political scientists have conducted a good deal of research on the stability of <b>party</b> <b>identification.</b> The American Voter (Campbell et al., 1960) argues that partisanship is highly stable; only 20 % of those surveyed report changing their <b>party</b> <b>identification</b> during their lifetime.
