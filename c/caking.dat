5|$|Serous {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes}} up 5–10% of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in postmenopausal women with atrophied endometrium and black women. Serous endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the peritoneum (seen as omental <b>caking)</b> or the lymphatic system. Histologically, it appears with many atypical nuclei, papillary structures, and, in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas, rounded cells instead of columnar cells. Roughly 30% of endometrial serous carcinomas also have psammoma bodies. Serous carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers; they can spread outside the uterus without invading the myometrium.|$|E
25|$|The {{ammonium}} nitrate, needed {{either as}} fertilizer or an explosive, was manufactured in Nebraska and Iowa {{and shipped to}} Texas City by rail before being loaded on the Grandcamp. It was manufactured in a patented process, mixed with clay, petrolatum, rosin and paraffin wax to avoid moisture <b>caking.</b> It was also packaged in paper sacks, then transported and stored at temperatures that increased its chemical activity. Longshoremen reported the bags were warm to the touch before loading.|$|E
25|$|Huge {{quantity}} of imported coal {{is being used}} in pulverised coal-fired power stations. Raw biomass {{can not be used}} in the pulverised coal mills as they are difficult to grind into fine powder due to <b>caking</b> property of raw biomass. However biomass can be used after Torrefaction in the pulverised coal mills for replacing imported coal. North west and southern regions can replace imported coal use with torrefied biomass where surplus agriculture/crop residual biomass is available. Biomass power plants can also get extra income by selling the Renewable Purchase Certificates (RPC).|$|E
25|$|CT {{scanning}} {{is preferred}} {{to assess the}} extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though magnetic resonance imaging can also be used. CT scanning can also be useful for finding omental <b>caking</b> or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a chest x-ray is used to detect metastases in the chest or pleural effusion. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a barium enema, which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. Positron emission tomography, bone scans, and paracentesis are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results. However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present. A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform mammography or an endometrial biopsy (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. Vaginal ultrasonography is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations. However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.|$|E
60|$|Dragged into Stubb's {{boat with}} blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine <b>caking</b> in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily {{strength}} did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom for a time, lying all crushed {{in the bottom}} of Stubb's boat, like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.|$|E
60|$|It {{was high}} time, for I now {{began to be}} {{tortured}} with thirst. The glow of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the sea-water that fell and dried upon me, <b>caking</b> my very lips with salt, combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight that {{changed the nature of}} my thoughts.|$|E
60|$|Upon this {{occasion}} of removing my ammunition, I {{was obliged to}} open the barrel of powder which I took {{up out of the}} sea, and which had been wet; and I found, that the water had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every side, which, <b>caking</b> and growing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask; and this was an agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind; I also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.|$|E
60|$|We {{were glad}} to find at Noacolly that our {{observations}} on the progression westwards of the Burrampooter (see chapter xxvii) were confirmed {{by the fact that}} the Megna also is gradually moving in that direction, leaving much dry land on the Noacolly side, and forming islands opposite that coast; whilst it encroaches on the Sunderbunds, and is cutting away the islands in that direction. This advance of the fresh waters amongst the Sunderbunds is destructive to the vegetation of the latter, which requires salt; and if the Megna continues its slow course westwards, the obliteration of thousands of square miles of a very peculiar flora, and the extinction of many species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else, may ensue. In ordinary cases these plants, etc., would take up their abode on the east coast, as they were driven from the west; but such might not be the case in this delta; for the sweeping tides of the east coast prevent any such vegetation establishing itself there, and the mud which the eastern rivers carry down, becomes a <b>caking</b> dry soil, unsuited to the germination of seeds.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, {{the next}} day I came {{provided}} with six large candles of my own making (for I made very good candles now of goats' tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick, using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles;) and going into this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have said, almost ten yards; which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. When I had got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave; the wall reflected an hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles. What {{it was in the}} rock, whether diamonds, or any other precious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be, I knew not. The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or grotto of its kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a small loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof: the only difficulty in it was the entrance; which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things which I was most anxious about to this place; particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz. two fowling-pieces, for I had three in all, and three muskets, for of them I had eight in all: so I kept at my castle only five, which stood ready-mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence; and were ready also to take out upon any expedition. Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I happened to open the barrel of powder, which I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and I found that the water had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every side, which, <b>caking,</b> and growing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell; so that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask: this was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind: I also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.|$|E

50|$|<b>Caking</b> {{properties}} must {{be considered}} when designing and constructing bulk material handling equipment. Powdered substances {{that need to be}} stored, and flow smoothly at some time in the future, are often pelletized or made into pills. Anti <b>caking</b> agents are also commonly added to control <b>caking.</b>|$|E
50|$|Usually <b>caking</b> is undesirable, but {{is useful}} when {{pressing}} powdered substances into pills or briquettes. Granular materials {{can also be}} subject to <b>caking,</b> particularly those that are hygroscopic such as salt, sugar, and many chemical fertilizers, because {{of the effects of}} moisture on grain surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Factors {{involved}} {{in the degree of}} <b>caking</b> include the substance's particle surface chemistry, particle size and particle-size distribution, particle shape, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. <b>Caking</b> also depends on any pressure on the powdered substance, and how long the substance has been stored.|$|E

50|$|Lloyd Hall {{is often}} falsely {{credited}} with the original invention of Seifert's process. However, Hall took {{a leading role in}} developing the patent after it was sold to Griffith Laboratories, adding hygroscopic agents such as corn sugar and glycerine to inhibit <b>caking</b> of the powder. Most of his patents in meat curing dealt with either preventing <b>caking</b> of the curing composition, or remedying undesired effects caused by the anticaking agents.|$|E
50|$|Tricalcium {{phosphate}} {{is used in}} powdered spices as an anticaking agent, e.g. {{to prevent}} table salt from <b>caking.</b> It {{is also found in}} baby powder and toothpaste.|$|E

50|$|An {{anticaking}} agent is an additive placed in powdered or granulated materials, such as table salt or confectionaries {{to prevent the}} formation of lumps (<b>caking)</b> and for easing packaging, transport, and consumption.|$|E
50|$|Commercial onion powders are {{prepared}} using dehydration, freeze-drying, vacuum-shelf drying and flow drying. Some commercial onion powders are irradiated as treatment against potential microbial contamination. It readily absorbs water upon contact, so commercial varieties may be packaged {{in airtight containers}} with a liner atop the container. Onion powder with a moisture content of 4-5 percent is prone to <b>caking</b> when stored in warmer environments, with increased temperatures corresponding to a shorter time for the occurrence of <b>caking.</b> Of general acceptance is that commercial onion powder is around ten times stronger in flavor compared to fresh onion.|$|E
50|$|Mud cake (also mudcake) is {{the layer}} of {{particulates}} from drill mud coating (<b>caking)</b> {{the inside of a}} borehole after the suspension medium has seeped through a porous geological formation. Similar to filter cake.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{freshwater}} {{diatomaceous earth}} {{is used in}} agriculture for grain storage as an anticaking agent, {{as well as an}} insecticide. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a feed additive to prevent <b>caking.</b>|$|E
50|$|Physically, the <b>caking</b> process {{involves}} {{electrostatic attraction}} or {{the formation of}} weak chemical bonds between the particle surfaces. This gives the bulk substance the strength to crack and collapse abruptly, to form vertical surfaces, and so on.|$|E
50|$|Since TBZC is {{neutral and}} water-insoluble, it has {{excellent}} palatability and very low interactions with other {{ingredients in a}} food mixture compared to zinc chloride, zinc sulfate or chelated forms of the metal. It also avoids the problems with <b>caking.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Podgrodnensko-Surazhevsky coal-bearing {{region is}} located close to Vladivostok. The stocks of the Podgrodnensky deposit are {{estimated}} to be a total of 19.6 million tons. The coal is hard coal. By the output of the volatile substances and the <b>caking</b> ability the coal is hard (non-bituminous). Maintained by the Podgorodenka mine of the Artyomugol Association.|$|E
50|$|Folk plays such as Hoodening, Guising, Mummers Play and Soul <b>Caking</b> are {{generally}} verse sketches performed in countryside pubs in European countries, private houses or the open air, at set {{times of the}} year such as the Winter or Summer solstices or Christmas and New Year. Many have long traditions, although they are frequently updated to retain their relevance for modern audiences.|$|E
50|$|In radiology, omental cake is sign {{indicative}} of an abnormally thickened greater omentum. It refers to infiltration of the omental fat by material of soft-tissue density. Typically, it {{is caused by}} infiltration of metastatic tumours arising from the stomach, ovary, or colon. It can also result from tuberculous peritonitis. Another cause is lymphoma, in which omental <b>caking</b> is usually associated lymphadenopathy.|$|E
50|$|Huge {{quantity}} of imported coal {{is being used}} in pulverised coal-fired power stations. Raw biomass is not suitable {{for use in the}} pulverised coal mills as they are difficult to grind into fine powder due to <b>caking</b> problem. However 100% biomass can be fired after Torrefaction in the pulverised coal mills for replacing imported coal. Torrefied biomass plants can be integrated with existing pulverised coal-fired power stations using the available hot flue gas as heat source. Cofiring dry biomass up to 20% heat input with coal is also possible directly in pulverised coal-fired power stations without facing <b>caking</b> problem. North west and southern regions can replace imported coal use with biomass where surplus agriculture/crop residue biomass is burnt in the fields causing pollution problems. As traditional use of biomass is being replaced by LPG at faster pace, biomass burning in agriculture fields would become major source for causing higher level air pollution.|$|E
50|$|The Cerrejón Formation {{contains}} extensive coal seams {{that are}} mined primarily at the Cerrejón mine.
