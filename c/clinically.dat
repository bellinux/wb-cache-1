5|$|The WHO 2008 {{classification}} of {{acute myeloid leukemia}} attempts to be more <b>clinically</b> useful and to produce more meaningful prognostic information than the FAB criteria. Each of the WHO categories contains numerous descriptive subcategories {{of interest to the}} hematopathologist and oncologist; however, most of the <b>clinically</b> significant information in the WHO schema is communicated via categorization into one of the subtypes listed below.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis is {{typically}} diagnosed <b>clinically,</b> {{based on a}} person's signs and symptoms. Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter management of the condition.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans is {{difficult}} to diagnose <b>clinically</b> as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as hip dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|Paralytic {{poliomyelitis}} may be <b>clinically</b> suspected {{in individuals}} experiencing acute onset of flaccid paralysis {{in one or}} more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss.|$|E
5|$|Plath was <b>clinically</b> {{depressed}} {{for most}} of her adult life, and was treated multiple times with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). She committed suicide in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Sociologist Susan J. Palmer {{said that}} Cristini, a nurse, {{diagnosed}} Raël as <b>clinically</b> depressed after he appeared at her doorstep in 1987, burnt {{out from the}} tasks he carried out within the movement.|$|E
5|$|The Brezhnev-era Soviet regime became {{notorious for}} using {{psychiatry}} {{as a means}} of silencing dissent. Many intellectuals, religious figures, and sometimes commoners protesting their low standard of living were ruled to be <b>clinically</b> insane and confined to mental hospitals.|$|E
5|$|At least 30% of TBI are not {{discovered}} at first; this number {{may be as}} high as 50%. In about 10% of cases, TBI has no specific signs either <b>clinically</b> or on chest radiography, and its detection may be further complicated by concurrent injuries, since TBI tends to occur after high-energy accidents. Weeks or months may go by before the injury is diagnosed, even though the injury is better known {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal <b>clinically</b> effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|In the 1934 novel I, Claudius by English writer Robert Graves, Caligula is {{presented}} as being a murderous sociopath from his childhood, who became <b>clinically</b> insane early in his reign. At the age of only seven, he drove his father Germanicus to despair and death by secretly terrorising him. Graves's Caligula commits incest with all three of his sisters and is implied to have murdered Drusilla.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid has no <b>clinically</b> {{significant}} effect on most Gram-negative bacteria. Pseudomonas and the Enterobacteriaceae, for instance, are not susceptible. In vitro, it is active against Pasteurella multocida, Fusobacterium, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella, Bordetella, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, and moderately active (having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains of 8mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae. It has also been used to great effect as a second-line treatment for Capnocytophaga infections.|$|E
5|$|Medical imaging is not {{routinely}} {{needed as}} it is expensive and does not typically change how plantar fasciitis is managed. When the diagnosis is not <b>clinically</b> apparent, lateral view x-rays of the ankle are the recommended imaging modality to assess for other causes of heel pain such as stress fractures or bone spur development.|$|E
5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. <b>Clinically,</b> their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used <b>clinically</b> as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E
5|$|Preoccupations are {{thoughts}} {{which are}} not fixed, false or intrusive, but have an undue prominence in the person's mind. <b>Clinically</b> significant preoccupations would include thoughts of suicide, homicidal thoughts, suspicious or fearful beliefs associated with certain personality disorders, depressive beliefs (for example that one is unloved or a failure), or the cognitive distortions of anxiety and depression.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clinical presentation}} of RRMS is the <b>clinically</b> isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack {{of a single}} symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of demyelination but the patient does not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Treatment with interferons or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases {{the risk of developing}} clinical definite MS.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies contain unique {{chemical}} compounds that {{are derived from}} phenylpropanoids. The compounds, named squarrosidine and pinillidine, inhibit the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the crystallization of uric acid in the joints, a main cause of gouty arthritis, and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used <b>clinically</b> to reduce this side effect. The natural function of these compounds may be to quench reactive oxygen species produced by plants as a defensive response to fungal infection.|$|E
5|$|The mildest form of hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is difficult to}} detect <b>clinically,</b> but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of {{hepatic encephalopathy}} is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being awake at night). The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E
5|$|The term minimal {{encephalopathy}} (MHE) {{is defined}} as encephalopathy that {{does not lead to}} <b>clinically</b> overt cognitive dysfunction, but can be demonstrated with neuropsychological studies. This is still an important finding, as minimal encephalopathy has been demonstrated to impair quality of life and increase the risk of involvement in road traffic accidents.|$|E
5|$|The term {{rumination}} {{is derived}} from the Latin word ruminare, which means to chew the cud. First described in ancient times, and mentioned in the writings of Aristotle, rumination syndrome was <b>clinically</b> documented in 1618 by Italian anatomist Fabricus ab Aquapendende, who wrote of the symptoms in a patient of his.|$|E
25|$|Diethylstilbestrol is a nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} that is {{no longer}} used medically. It {{is a member of the}} stilbestrol group. Other stilbestrol estrogens that have been used <b>clinically</b> include benzestrol, dienestrol, dienestrol acetate, diethylstilbestrol dipropionate, fosfestrol, hexestrol, and methestrol dipropionate. Chlorotrianisene, methallenestril, and doisynoestrol are nonsteroidal estrogens structurally distinct from the stilbestrols that have also been used <b>clinically.</b>|$|E
25|$|The venom of Uroplectes lineatus is <b>clinically</b> {{important}} in dermatology.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>clinically</b> {{significant}} pathologies involving astrocytes include astrogliosis and astrocytopathy.|$|E
25|$|When {{administered}} orally, placebos have <b>clinically</b> meaningful effects {{with regard}} to lower back pain.|$|E
25|$|A {{positive}} screen warrants an antibody panel/investigation {{to determine}} if it is <b>clinically</b> significant. An antibody panel consists of commercially prepared group O red cell suspensions from donors that have been phenotyped for antigens that correspond to commonly encountered and <b>clinically</b> significant alloantibodies. Donor cells may have homozygous (e.g. K+k−), heterozygous (K+k+) expression or no expression of various antigens (K−k−). The phenotypes of all the donor cells being tested are shown in a chart. The patient's serum is tested against the various donor cells. Based on the reactions of the patient's serum against the donor cells, a pattern will emerge to confirm the presence {{of one or more}} antibodies. Not all antibodies are <b>clinically</b> significant (i.e. cause transfusion reactions, HDN, etc.). Once the patient has developed a <b>clinically</b> significant antibody it is vital that the patient receive antigen-negative red blood cells to prevent future transfusion reactions. A direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) is also performed as part of the antibody investigation.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms cause <b>clinically</b> {{significant}} {{impairment in}} social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning.|$|E
25|$|The active {{metabolites}} of buprenorphine are {{not thought}} to be <b>clinically</b> important in its central nervous system effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clinically,</b> IHC {{is used in}} {{histopathology}} for {{the diagnosis}} of specific types of cancers based on molecular markers.|$|E
25|$|Normal {{activities}} of daily living (ADL) assessed both <b>clinically</b> and on a standardized scale (as described below).|$|E
25|$|For {{patients}} with vWD scheduled for surgery and cases of vWD disease complicated by <b>clinically</b> significant hemorrhage, human-derived medium purity factor VIII concentrates, which also contain von Willebrand factors, {{are available for}} prophylaxis and treatment. Humate P, Alphanate, Wilate and Koate HP are commercially available for prophylaxis and treatment of vWD. Monoclonally purified factor VIII concentrates and recombinant factor VIII concentrates contain insignificant quantity of vWF, so are not <b>clinically</b> useful.|$|E
25|$|During mediumistic trances, electroencephalograms {{showed that}} Chico Xavier {{presented}} common characteristics of epilepsy, but <b>clinically,</b> {{he was never}} epileptic.|$|E
25|$|Indometacin {{has also}} been used <b>clinically</b> to delay {{premature}} labor, reduce amniotic fluid in polyhydramnios, and to close patent ductus arteriosus.|$|E
25|$|Autopsy studies {{indicate}} that 6-25% of the U. S. population have small pituitary tumors. Forty percent of these pituitary tumors produce prolactin, but most are not considered <b>clinically</b> significant. <b>Clinically</b> significant pituitary tumors affect the health of approximately 14 out of 100,000 people. In non-selective surgical series, this tumor accounts for approximately 25-30% of all pituitary adenomas. Some growth hormone (GH)–producing tumors also co-secrete prolactin. Microprolactinomas are much more common than macroprolactinomas.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin E/{{thalassemia}}: {{common in}} Cambodia, Thailand, {{and parts of}} India, it is <b>clinically</b> similar to β thalassemia major or thalassemia intermedia.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin S/thalassemia: {{common in}} African and Mediterranean populations, is <b>clinically</b> similar to sickle-cell anemia, with the {{additional}} feature of splenomegaly.|$|E
25|$|Typically, ADEM {{appears in}} {{children}} following an antigenic challenge and remains monophasic. Nevertheless, ADEM does occur in adults, {{and can also}} be <b>clinically</b> multiphasic.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{culture or}} {{immunofluorescence}} staining {{may be used}} to differentiate herpes simplex from herpes zoster in cases that are difficult to distinguish <b>clinically.</b>|$|E
