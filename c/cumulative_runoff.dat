40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to measure and model the runoff for different soils classes at different rainfall intensities (30, 60 and 120 Â mmÂ h- 1) in Southern Brazil. A portable rainfall simulator with multiple nozzles was used to simulate these rainfall intensities. For each soil, the initial time and runoff rate, rainfall characteristics (total, duration and intensities), surface slope, crop residue amount and cover percentage, soil densities (bulk and particle), soil porosity (bulk, macro and micro), textural fractions (clay, silt and sand), and the initial and saturated soil water content were measured. The runoff measured was compared to Smith's modified and Curve Number (USDA-SCS) models. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> losses were 67, 45 and 27 % of the total rainfall, for a Rhodic Paleudalf, Typic Quartzipsamment and Rhodic Hapludox, respectively. An inverse relationship was observed between initial runoff and the runoff rate, independently of the soil surface and rainfall conditions. Increasing rainfall intensity decreased the time to runoff and increased runoff rate. The Smith's modified model overestimated the <b>cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> by about 4 %. The Smith's modified model presented a better estimate for both higher and lower rainfall intensities (120 and 30 Â mmÂ h- 1). The SCS Curve Number model overestimated the <b>cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> by about 34 %. This large overestimate is probably due to that the model did {{not take into account}} the soil tillage system used in the field by farmers, particularly for irrigated conditions. The combination of high porosity, low bulk density and presence of crop residue on soil surface decreased runoff losses, independently of the soil texture class. Smith's modified model better estimated the surface runoff for soil with a high soil water content, and it was considered satisfactory for Southern Brazil runoff estimations. The SCS Curve Number model overestimated the <b>cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> and its use needs adjustments particularly for no-tillage management system.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Controlling runoff {{and soil}} erosion are {{important}} for maintaining soil productivity and reducing off-site impairment due to sediment and nutrient enrichment. Previous {{research has shown that}} crop residue and polyacrylamide (PAM) can reduce runoff and soil erosion. We compared the combined effects of surface residue and PAM on runoff soil loss, and phosphorus loss from sprinkler irrigated soil in the laboratory. We hypothesized that surface residue would enhance the effectiveness of sprinkler-applied PAM by allowing PAM to stabilize the soil surface with less disturbance by water drops. Steel boxes (1. 5 m long, 1. 2 m wide, and 0. 2 m deep) were filled with Roza loam (fine, smectitic, mesic xerertic Haplocambids) and irrigated at 80 mm h- 1 for 15 min. Wheat straw was applied for two separate tests (70 % and 30 % straw cover). The PAM was applied at 0, 2 or 4 kg ha- 1 during the first irrigation, followed by two water-only irrigations. Applying PAM to straw-covered soil controlled runoff, erosion, and phosphorus losses equally or better than using either PAM or straw alone. The 70 % straw cover reduced <b>cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> for the three irrigations 75 to 80 % compared to 30 to 50 % reduction with PAM alone. Polyacrylamide alone or 30 % surface cover alone produced similar results, both reducing <b>cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> 10 to 20 % compared to untreated bare soil. Since runoff, erosion and phosphorus loss were reduced when PAM and surface residue were used individually and to a greater extent when used together, management choices should depend on overall costs and control needed to meet water quality and production goals...|$|E

A goal of this research was the development of a tool using NPS modelling capability and GIS tools. The ANSWERS 2000 model and SPANS GIS software were selected for integration. Using the advanced SPANS operation and EASI script language, the ANSWERS 2000 model was integrated into the latest version of SPANS GIS (Explorer ver. 7). Integration of these two software packages provided assistance in creating and handling the extensive input and output data for models, evaluating of model output, and delineating of critical areas. A sensitivity analysis of the ANSWERS model was performed on thirteen parameters to determine their effects on runoff ANSWERS 2000 was found to be most sensitive to depth of soil horizon, silt and clay contents of soil texture, and solar radiation. Four years of runoff predictions by the model were analysed using observed data.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{estimate}} the direct runoff from storm rainfalls and to simulate peak discharges occurred in a headwater catchment in Hong Kong. With application of the straight line method, inflection point method and one parameter filter method, the baseflow volumes are separated, and the direct runoff volumes are computed for the storms occurred in the headwater catchment during the period from 2007 to 2010. Totally, there are 20 storm events to be analyzed, and the associated runoff coefficients are computed. Among three methods, one parameter method is the most suitable one to provide the baseflow separation and direct runoff volumes, and the result by using the method shows that average direct runoffs contribute about 63 % of flood peak discharges, and the direct runoff ratios are less than 38 %. To further explore the direct runoff features, direct runoff hydrographs are simulated and analyzed by using regression method, runoff coefficient method and SCS method.

A spatial model is presented to predict the yearly flooding extent of the Waza-Logone floodplain based on <b>cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> in the catchment area and estimations of the soil moisture prior to the flooding. Observations of flooding extent were based on thresholding 16 -day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) shortwave infrared (SWIR) images. The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method was used to calculate <b>cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> within the Logone catchment area based on rainfall estimates (RFEs) for Africa. MODIS SWIR images acquired prior to the flooding were used as indicators for soil moisture. The mean observed flooding extent of the Waza-Logone floodplain during the period 2000 - 2005 was 6747 km 2 {{with a standard deviation}} of 1838 km(2). Multiple regression analysis was performed to create a predictive model forecasting flooding extent 1. 5 months in advance with a coefficient of determination (R- 2) equal to 0. 957.

A floodwater distribution map was created for this subregion model, allowing determination where the flooding occurs for an estimated flood size. The average additional error caused by the mapping procedure was 138 km(2), which is relatively small compared to an average flooded area of 3211 km(2) for the Waza subregion.

The aim of the experiments was to ascertain whether cumulative soil erosion is proportional to the area of soil exposed to raindrop detachment under the condition of constant and uniform precipitation. The surface area exposed to rain splash erosion was adjusted by placing rock fragments onto the surface of identically prepared soil in laboratory flumes. The laboratory results showed that the eroded cumulative mass depended on the <b>cumulative</b> <b>runoff,</b> and that soil erosion was proportional to the soil surface area exposed to raindrops, in situations where an initially dry, plowed and smoothed soil surface was ensured. The results showed that this relationship was controlled to a smaller extent by the soil's initial moisture content, bulk density and soil surface characteristics. When the initial conditions were more complex, soil erosion was proportional to the area exposed only at steady state. Then, sediment concentrations during {{the first part of the}} erosion event were instead more sensitive to the initial state of the soil surface, whereas at steady state it was observed that the concentrations of eroded sediments were controlled mainly by the effective rainfall and area exposed to raindrops. Previously published field data on rain splash soil erosion were analyzed to ascertain whether the same behavior was evident under field conditions. For this case it was found that rain splash erosion is in general not proportional to the area exposed. In contrast to the controlled laboratory experiments, the field experiments were characterized by non-uniform initial surface roughness, surface soil aging and heterogeneous rock fragment size and spatial distribution.

Despite its enormous potential of water resources, Ethiopia is suffering {{from a lack of}} water availability and threatened by the consequences of climate change. Well-considered planning to develop these resources is crucial. However, very few observational runoff data exist for this type of environments. Especially runoff data for catchments at the intermediate scale (100 - 10, 000 km 2) are lacking. This study assesses the runoff from 10 medium-sized catchments in the Geba river basin, a subcatchment of the Nile in the semi-arid degraded northern Ethiopian highlands. Flow depth records were automatically obtained every 10 minutes during the rainy seasons (July-September) of 2004 - 2007 and converted to continuous <b>runoff</b> discharge records. <b>Cumulative</b> annual <b>runoff</b> depths (46 - 395 mm) are mainly correlated with rainfall depth. Estimated runoff coefficients (9 - 47 %) and are negatively correlated with the areal fraction of limestone outcrops in the catchments, indicating runoff transmission losses. Throughout the rainy season, increases in runoff depth and runoff coefficient were observed, which is partly attributed to an increase in baseflow throughout the season. The majority of the runoff occurs during flash floods, i. e. relatively short runoff events with often very high peak discharges. Characteristics of these floods are discussed with some examples, including an exceptionally large flood.

Four cores were taken from the flood delta, and standard grainsize analysis techniques employed to establish the composition and characteristics of the sediments. Together with survey work and other ancillary information, these twci techniques enable description of the sedimentation changes and the present sediment dynamics on the flood tide delta.

40|$|Areas {{affected}} by land degradation in Sub-Saharan West Africa between 1982 and 2012 are identified using time-series analysis of vegetation index data derived from satellites. The residual trend (RESTREND) of a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series {{is defined as}} the fraction of the difference between the observed NDVI and the NDVI predicted from climate data. It has been widely used to study desertification and other forms of land degradation in drylands. The method works on the assumption that a negative trend of vegetation photosynthetic capacity is an indication of land degradation if it is independent from climate variability. In the past, many scientists depended on rainfall data as the major climatic factor controlling vegetation productivity in drylands when applying the RESTREND method. However, the water that is directly available to vegetation is stored as soil moisture, which is a function of <b>cumulative</b> rainfall, surface <b>runoff,</b> infiltration and evapotranspiration. In this study, the new NDVI third generation (NDVI 3 g), which was generated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (NASA-GSFC GIMMS) group, was used as a satellite-derived proxy of vegetation productivity, together with the soil moisture index product from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and rainfall data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU). The results show that the soil moisture/NDVI pixel-wise residual trend indicates land degraded areas more clearly than rainfall/NDVI. The spatial and temporal trends of the RESTREND in the region follow the patterns of drought episodes, reaffirming the difficulties in separating the impacts of drought and land degradation on vegetation photosynthetic capacity. Therefore, future studies of land degradation and desertification in drylands should go beyond using rainfall as a sole predictor of vegetation condition, and include soil moisture index datasets in the analysis.

40|$|The Whanganui and Waikato river {{catchments}} have {{somewhat different}} degrees {{of exposure to the}} westerly wind systems. It is of interest to determine whether the two regions have similar times of occurrence of any concurrent shifts in river discharge and rainfall, with particular reference to mean value changes. Concurrent rainfall and runoff shifts are indicative of climatic variation but catchment land use changes (which will influence only discharge change) have also been occurring in both catchments, particularly with respect to forest planting or forest clearance. This thesis gives a summary of both climatic and land use change effects within the two catchments. If it happens that both catchments have similar climatic change-points then the data can be combined to provide a more robust framework for future water right specifications in both regions. Also, any similar responses to land use change may enable some degree of anticipation as to how future land use changes might lead to similar discharge responses. Change-points in river and rainfall time series flows were determined by an objective approach to detect breaks of slope in cumulative mass plots. Using repeated least squares fitting of piecewise linear segments, time points of maximum difference are determined as measured by the minimum least-squares in 2 -segment fitting. Randomisation of time ordering of the original data was then employed to check that changes in the cumulative plots were statistically significant. Many significant but minor shifts were detected but a number of the shifts shown evidently in the rainfall and <b>runoff</b> <b>cumulative</b> mass plots. A set of change-points due to land management impacts were identified as discharge changes in the absence of concurrent rainfall changes. Rainfall-runoff linear relationship changes associate with changes in discharge time series. Change-points in rainfall and runoff times were detected at 44 flow gauges and 59 rainfall sites. There is some indication of a degree of natural geographic grouping with spatial correlation of times of discharge change. The times of the detected changes tend to cluster, with similar times for the same sign of change toward either greater or lower values of rainfall and discharge. The alternation of positive and negative signs is interesting as it was found 1981 and 1998 were times of negative shifts, while 1988 and 1994 / 1995 were times of positive shifts. Almost over the whole Waikato and Whanganui region, the changes in rainfall and runoff appears to relate to El Nino and La Nino events, which is of practical interest for water right considerations. The driver of the shifts in rainfall pattern was found to be the changes in high rainfall events, which can change the rainfall-runoff linear relationship in some areas. The land use component of some of the shifts was evaluated also and found only in 10 of the 44 flow gauges. The type of the land-use can be categorized into three groups: hydropower diversion, flood control system and afforestation. Within the study catchments, the impact of hydropower diversion is more significant than the other two types. With regards to the Whanganui catchments, the operation of the Tongariro power scheme from 1973 decreased low-flow by 89 % in the Wahkapapa River and around 42 % and 26 % of the flow in the Whanganui River at Pariaka and Te Maire respectively. In the Whanganui catchments, the impact of farmland and native forest on river discharge was compared and farmland in the Ongarue catchment reduced flow much more than the native forest in the upper Whanganui catchment. The relationship of the high flow (Q 90) in the two catchments is quite close to the ratio relationship of the catchment area, however, the relation of the low flows in the two catchments is fairly different and exceeds much more than the 0. 75 ratio relationship of the catchment area...|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating soil {{degradation}} processes. In temperate climate regions, soil erosion rarely assumes excessive proportions. In the management of forest soil, the potential erosion threat drastically increases with an increase in climate aridity. Water erosion is particularly favored by parent materials of low water permeability and by soils derived from such materials. In theMediterranean and sub-Mediterranean area of Croatia, these are primarily flysch, marl and Werfen schists. These materials show good physical weathering properties, thus providing a rich source of erosion material. As a rule, the soil formed from such parentmaterial is of silty-clayey to clayey texture, and has a relatively low infiltration capacity. The soil unprotected by vegetation (burned sites) manifests particularly devastating forms of water-induced erosion. In the past 50 years, flysch terrains of Istria have been subjected to a series of technical, biological and biological- technical treatments aimed at preventing water erosion and recovering the eroded soils. An experimental (research) site was set up in Abrami near Buzet for the purpose of monitoring erosion processes and rehabilitation effects of different biological-technical and biological methods of eroded area recovery. The effects of the treatments on soil properties in the research site are in the form of progressive pedogenetic processes. Asynergy of the effects of recovery methods and different natural conditions (relief, vegetation) in the experimental site is particularly well reflected in erosion indicators, such as the production of erosion sediment (erosion production), and to a lesser extent, the surface flow index. For this reason, research in this work focuses primarily on soil properties and erosion production dynamics. From the geological-lithological aspect, the research site of Abrami is made up of Eocene flysch composed of alternate layers of light grey marl and dark lime sandstone, i. e. thinner or thicker interbeds of sandy limestone. The climate is sub-Mediterranean. The mean annual temperature is 12 °C and the mean annual precipitation is 975 mm. The natural potential vegetation in the localities is represented by the community of hop hornbeam and autumn moor grass. Established in 1956 on the slope exposed to highly pronounced erosion processes, the research site has an area of 23. 46 ha. Aseries of technical and biological erosion recovery measures had been undertaken in the site by 1963 for the purpose of investigating their applicability in practice. Technical activities included the construction of step-like terraces, of the bench terrace type (»gradoni«), and contour rustic walls. Avariety of plant material was planted and seeds of different plant species were sown in the area (Table 1). Several control plots were also established in parts of the Abrami site, where either no treatment was applied or the seedlings were planted into the planting holes. Six plots intended for the measurement of erosion sediment production were established in 1969, followed by research into the quantitative erosion indicators, which started in 1970 (Table 1). After an interruption in 1977, measurements were resumed in 1997 and 1998 (two plots) and in 1999 (three plots). Erosion indicators have continuously been measured since 2000; however, measurements in plot I (plot I was omitted from this research due to its specific features) have been performed by means of terrestrial photogrammetry. The seventh plot was established in 2004, and has been the subject of measurements since 2005. This work encompasses measurement data from 2005, 2006 and 2007. The research includes plots II, III, IV,V, aswell asVI and VII. The soil and organic residues were sampled in the immediate surroundings of the erosion-measuring plots. Next to the plots in which no technical recovery measures were undertaken, a pedological profile was opened and the soil was sampled by horizons. Some smaller plots of 50 x 50 cm were used to sample the forest floor in 3 points next to the plots (near the top, in the middle of the slope and near the bottom). Undisturbed soil from the depth of 0 - 5 cm was cylinder-sampled in these smaller plots. The soil profiles next to the terraced plots were not sampled. The forest floor was sampled in small 50 x 50 cm plots, particularly those established on the slopes and on the top of the bench terraces. After the removal of the forest floor, the soil in the small plots was sampled with a probe (disturbed soil) to a 10 cmdepth, and with a cylinder (undisturbed soil) to a 5 cmdepth. The granulometric soil composition was determined according to HRN ISO 11277 : 2004, the pH according to HRN ISO 10390 : 2005, the CaCO 3 content according to HRN ISO 10693 : 2004, organic carbon (TOC) according to HRN ISO 10694 : 2004, porosity according to HR ISO 11508 and 11272 2004, water retention capacity according to HRN ISO 11461 : 2001, air capacity according to HRN ISO 11580 and 11272 : 2004, and soil water permeability according to HRN ISO 17312 : 2005. Measurements of erosion parameters were based on the <b>cumulative</b> measurement of <b>runoff</b> and erosion sediment for each particular rain event (in some cases several rain events were measured cumulatively). Water with eroded particles was determined in the field by measuring water levels in retention basins and/or tubs. The total quantity of erosion sediment in the collected waterwas determined according to theHRNISO 4365 standard. Rain events were registered in the site itself with a pluviograph within the meteorological station of Abrami. In converting the erosion production mass into volume, the average erosion sediment density was assumed to be 1. 2 Mg m- 3. Statistical analyses (descriptive statistics, correlations, t-test) were performed with STATISTICA 7. 1 software. Research into soil physiography in the site did not show any significant differences between the samples, regardless of sampling depths (the pHinwater suspension is between 7. 7 and 7. 9),which indicates long-term erosion impacts, that is, the homogeneity of the material. The soil in plot II does not have a developed humus-accumulative horizon. It is a strongly skeletal eutric regosol with a discontinued layer of the forest floor (the layer contains 1, 531 kg ha– 1 of dry organic matter). The soil in the surface 0. 5 cmismoderately porous (48. 4 %), with moderatewater capacity (37 %) and low water permeability (Table 2). In plots II and III (one immediately next to the other) the soil is eutric cambisol, with a depth of č 90 cm. The depth of the humus-accumulative horizon is only 2 – 4 cm,which reflects the erosion impact in the past. The slightly-to-moderately porous soil has relatively low water permeability (Table 2). In plot V the soil is eroded eutric cambisol with a discontinued A-horizon. This is shallower and texturally lighter soil than the soil in plots III andVII. In terms of granulometric composition, the soil is silty loam. Water permeability is very fast in the surface 5 cm. In plots IV and VI, the soil in the surface 10 cm is of silty-clayey texture, both on the slopes and the terraces. On the terraces of these plots the soil ismore compacted and the forest floor accumulation is higher, but water permeability is lower than on the slopes of the bench terraces. The annual precipitation amount ranged from 908 mm in 2005, over 979 mm in 2006, to 1. 167 mm in 2007. During 2005, the least precipitation occurred in the first annual quarter (< 100 mm), while in the other 3 quarters the amount of precipitation was very similar. During 2006 and 2007, precipitation amounts by quarters were almost identical: most rainfall occurred in the 1 st, followed by the 3 rd quarter, and the least occurred in the 4 th quarter (Fig. 5). Measurements of surface runoff and erosion production show that the most severe erosion occurred in plot II (Fig. 5). In the early 1970 s, the annual erosion production in this plot amounted to over 500 m 3 km- 2, while during the three-year measurement period it came to between 47. 9 and 65. 3 m 3 km- 2. More than half of the erosion production took place in the 3 rd annual quarter. Of other plots, distinct production is manifested by plot V and plot VII (Fig. 5 and 6). In the three remaining plots, the annual erosion production is considerably lower and does not exceed 0. 5 m 3 km- 2. There is no significant difference in the dynamics of annual production, except that erosion extremes occurred in plot IV in 2007, which coincides with the extremes in plots II and V. The lowest surface runoff coefficient was identified in plot III and the highest in plot II. Themean annual runoff coefficient in plot II ranges between 0. 052 and 0. 076, and the maximal comes to as much as 0. 397. This suggests a very low infiltration capacity of precipitation water. Namely, in this plot the soil is shallow regosol of silty texture (72 % of silt) and of very poor water permeability capacity (k= 0. 04 m/day). Erosion production in plots IV andVI is very low (Fig. 5). Overall biomass production in plot VI is lower than in plot IV, while the quantity of forest floor is similar to that in plot II. On the other hand, better developed trees of black pine and a very dense layer of ground vegetation in plot IV are responsible for higher leaf litter quantities: 3, 312 kg ha- 1 on the slopes of the bench terraces and 4, 144 kg ha- 1 on the terraces. It was found that erosion production was lower in the plots with higher organic matter content (in the forest floor and the mineral part of the soil). All these point to a series of mutual impacts, which synergistically determine the rate and intensity of erosion in these plots. This is explained by lower erosion sediment production in Plot IV in comparison with plots V and VI, although the terrain in plot IV has a much steeper slope. On the other hand, it is evident that, compared to plot V in which only biological recovery measures were applied, the application of technical recovery measures in plots IV and VI resulted in a much earlier reduction of erosion intensities. According to the results of research, the application of biological-technical recovery measures increases soil permeability and the soil organic matter content in proportion to the steepness of the terrain. The steeper the terrain, the higher the content is. In this climatic region, the most erodible period occurs in the 3 rd quarter of the year. Erosion production in the terrain recovered with biological-technical measures is very low, regardless of the distribution and intensity of precipitation; on the other hand, biological recovery itself, without any technical measures, results in much weaker erosion control...|$|R

The analyses focused on 61 historical hazard events with the timing of debris flow initiation and rainfall duration to burst debris-flow characteristics recorded. A combination of averaged rainfall intensity and duration is a more practical index for debris-flow monitoring than critical or threshold rainfall intensity. Because, the outburst timing of debris flows correlates closely to the peak hourly rainfall and the forecasting of peak hourly rainfall reached in a meteorological event could be a valuable index for real-time debris-flow warning...|$|E

The influence of ICs is stronger in a dry or wet-to-dry climate regime that covers the northern and western interior regions during the late fall to early summer. In particular, ICs may dominate the forecast skill for up to three months or even six months during late fall and winter months, probably due to the low precipitation value and variability in the dry period. In contrast, CFs become more important for most of southern China or during summer months. The impact of ICs on SM forecasts tends to cover larger domains than on CR forecasts. These findings will greatly benefit future work that will target efforts towards improving current forecast levels for the particular regions and forecast periods...|$|E

This study proposes {{an extension of}} Viglione et al.  (2010 a) analytical framework to represent the dependence of catchment flood response to the different runoff generation processes. The analytical framework is compared to simulations from a distributed hydrologic model. A large number of rainfall–runoff events from three catchments of Tar River basin in North Carolina are used to illustrate the analytical framework. Specifically, the framework is used to estimate three flood event characteristics (<b>cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> volume, centroid, and spreadness of hydrograph) through three corresponding framework parameters: the rainfall excess and the mean and variance of catchment response time. Results show that, under the smooth topographic setups of the study area, the spatial and/or temporal correlation between rainfall and runoff generation are insignificant to flood response; delay in flood response due to runoff generation and routing are of equal importance; {{the shape of the}} flood is mainly controlled by the variability in runoff generation stage but with non-negligible contribution from the runoff routing stage. Sensitivity tests show that the framework's main error source is the systematic underestimation of the flood event's centroid and spreadness, while the random error is relatively low...|$|E
40|$|Vodna erozija tla jedan je od najrazornijih procesa degradacije zemljišta. U gospodarenju šumskim zemljištemmoguća opasnost od erozije uvelike se povećava s povećanjem aridnosti klime. Vodnoj eroziji osobito pogoduju slabo vodopropusni supstrati i tlo koje iz njih nastaje, kao što je fliš. Flišna erodirana zemljišta dosta su rasprostranjena u Istri, gdje smo i proveli ovo istraživanje. Na poligonu za istraživanje erozije Abrami (kod Buzeta) na 6 pokusnih ploha istražili smo svojstva tla i tijekom 3 godine (2005., 2006. i 2007.) mjerili količinu oborine i produkciju erozijskoga nanosa. Na dvjema plohama prije 50 godina provedena je biološko-tehnička sanacija erozije, na jednoj su provedene biološke mjere, dvije su bile kontrolne (jedna na blagom nagibu i s autohtonom degradiranom šumskom vegetacijom, a druga, jako erodirana, na strmom nagibu). Jedna ploha na blagom nagibu uspostavljena je 2004. godine – iskrčena je sva drvenasta vegetacija. Godišnja je količina oborine bila između 908 mmu 2005. godini, preko 979 mmu 2006. godini do 1 167 mmu 2007. Više od polovice erozijske produkcije odvija se u 3. kvartalu godine. Istraživanja su pokazala da se biološkotehnič kom sanacijom povećava vodopropusnost tla i sadržaj organske tvari u tlu, to više što je strmije zemljište. Pokazalo se da je na zemljištu saniranom biološko-tehničkim mjerama vrlo niska erozijska produkcija, bez obzira na raspored i intenzitet oborine, a sama biološka sanacija, bez tehničkih mjera, rezultira značajno slabijim utjecajem na suzbijanje erozije.

40|$|A novel {{quantitative}} cellular automata (CA) {{model that}} simulates and predicts hillslope runoff and soil erosion caused by rainfall events {{was developed by}} integrating the local interaction rules and the hillslope surface hydraulic processes. In this CA model, the hillslope surface was subdivided {{into a series of}} discrete spatial cells with the same geometric features.

The amounts of interchanged water and sediment were computed using the Chezy-Manning formula and the empirical sediment transport equation. The water and sediment discharged from the open boundary cells were considered as the runoff and the sediment yields over the entire hillslope surface. Two hillslope soil erosion experiments under simulated rainfall events were carried out. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> and sediment yields were measured, respectively. Then, the CA model was applied to simulate the water and soil erosion for these two experiments.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on a {{previously}} eroded Oxic Paleustalf in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria {{to determine the extent}} of soil degradation under mound tillage with some herbaceous legumes and residue management methods. A series of factorial experiments {{was carried out}} on 12 existing runoff plots. The study commenced in 1996 after a 5 -year natural fallow. Mound tillage was introduced in 1997 till 1999. The legumes - Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), Mucuna pruriens and Pueraria phaseoloides - were intercropped with maize in 1996 and 1998 while yam was planted alone in 1997 and 1999. This paper covers 1997 - 1999. At the end of each year, residues were either burned or mulched on respective plots. Soil loss, runoff, variations in mound height, bulk density, soil water retention and sorptivity were measured. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> was similar among interactions of legume and residue management in 1997 (57 - 151 mm) and 1999 (206 - 397 mm). However, in 1998, <b>cumulative</b> <b>runoff</b> of 95 mm observed for Mucuna-burned residue was significantly greater than the 46 mm observed for cowpea-burned residue and the 39 - 51 mm observed for mulched residues of cowpea, Mucuna and Pueraria. Cumulative soil loss of 7. 6 Mg ha(- 1) observed for Mucuna-burned residue in 1997 was significantly greater than those for Pueraria-mulched (0. 9 Mg ha(- 1)) and Mucuna-mulched (1. 4 Mg ha(- 1)) residues whereas in 1999 it was similar to soil loss from cowpea treatments and Pueraria-burned residue (2. 3 - 5. 3 Mg ha(- 1)). There were no significant differences in soil loss in 1998 (1 - 3. 2 Mg ha(- 1)) whereas Mucuna-burned residue had a greater soil loss (28. 6 Mg ha(- 1)) than mulched cowpea (6. 9 Mg ha(- 1)) and Pueraria (5. 4 Ms ha(- 1)). Mound heights (23 cm average) decreased non-linearly with cumulative rainfall. A cumulative rainfall of 500 mm removed 0. 3 - 2. 3 cm of soil from mounds in 1997, 3. 5 - 6. 9 cm in 1998 and 2. 3 - 4. 6 cm in 1999, indicating that (detached but less transported) soil from mounds was far higher than observed soil loss in each year. Soil water retention was improved at potentials ranging from - 1 to - 1500 kPa by Mucuna-mulched residue compared to the various burned-residue treatments. Also, mound sorptivity at - 1 cm water head (14. 3 cm h(- 1 / 2)) was higher than furrow sorptivity (8. 5 cm h(- 1 / 2)), indicating differences in hydraulic characteristics between mound and furrow. Pueraria-mulched residues for mounds had the highest sorptivity of 17. 24 cm h(- 1 / 2), whereas the least value of 6. 96 cm h(- 1 / 2) was observed in furrow of Mucuna-burned residue. Pueraria phas eoloides was considered the best option for soil conservation on the previously eroded soil, cultivated with mound tillage. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
