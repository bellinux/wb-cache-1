30|$|The {{mechanisms}} of PC can be largely classified into static <b>power</b> <b>control</b> and dynamic <b>power</b> <b>control.</b> A static <b>power</b> <b>control</b> allocation assigns <b>power</b> levels to the nodes {{that do not}} change frequently over time, unless there are drastic changes in the network topology. On the other hand, with dynamic <b>power</b> <b>control</b> strategies, every node changes its power level for transmission frequently over the time. Such changes can be made on per link, per destination, per TDMA slot or per packet basis. The Static <b>power</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms are simpler and more robust but often result in suboptimal performance due to their inefficient adaptation of changing traffic demands and dynamic wireless conditions. Static <b>power</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms can be further classified into uniform range <b>power</b> <b>control</b> and variable range <b>power</b> <b>control</b> [23].|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} in analyzing the reverse link capacity performance of cellular CDMA systems employing successive interference cancellation (SIC). Due to the <b>controlled</b> <b>power</b> disparity present in such systems previous methods cannot precisely model their inter-cell interference. We first introduce a novel model which allows the accurate analysis and evaluation of the inter-cell interference of cellular CDMA systems with <b>controlled</b> <b>power</b> disparity. Its validity is verified by means of theoretical analysis and computer simulations. Secondly, by using this new inter-cell interference model, a theoretical analysis of the CDMA reverse link capacity is presented. In terms of evaluation results, {{we focus on the}} performance improvements SIC offers as compared to single user detection (SUD). Analytical results complemented by equivalent computer simulated performance evaluation results have shown that SIC significantly increases the reverse link capacity of cellular CDMA systems operating in realistic <b>controlled</b> <b>power</b> disparity environments.
