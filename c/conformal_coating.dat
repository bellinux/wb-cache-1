Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. With the advent of polymeric materials, various uses for these materials have been discovered in the quest to best utilize their unique characteristics. One property that a few polymers possess is hydrophobicity, that is water repelling. Consequently, one particular use for hydrophobic materials is in the area of corrosion protection. When applied as a coating material, hydrophobic polymers, theoretically, should provide excellent protection against corrosive environments. In order to ascertain the performance of hydrophobic materials in corrosion service, metallic substrates of aluminum, copper, and steel were coated with a hydrophobic <b>coating</b> termed <b>conformal</b> and subjected to a variety of intensive analytical examinations including Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, realtime field studies, and scanning electron microscopy. To be able to gage the relative performance of the <b>conformal</b> <b>coat,</b> it is necessary to test similar uncoated metallic substrates as well as similar substrates treated with a nonhydrophobic corrosion preventative coat. This will allow direct comparisons to be made between the <b>conformal</b> <b>coat</b> and other commercially available coating products while allowing for an uncoated substrate to act as a baseline reference (i. e. a control). The results of these experiments showed that the performance of conformal as a preventative measure against corrosion were below expectations, especially in comparison to other commercially available non-hydrophobic coatings. This is most likely due to inadequate adhesion at the polymer-metallic substrate interface. Preliminary results show that improvements in the adhesive capabilities {{through the use of a}} base coating result in significant improvements in corrosion resistance...|$|R

40|$|A whisker from a {{tin plated}} part was {{blamed for the}} loss of a {{commercial}} spacecraft in 1998. Although pure tin finishes are prohibited by NASA, tin plated parts, such as hybrids, relays and commercial off the shelf (COTS) parts, are something discovered to have been installed in NASA spacecraft. Invariably, the assumption is that a <b>conformal</b> <b>coat</b> will prevent the growth of, or short circuits caused by, tin whiskers. This study measures the effect a Uralane coating has on the initiation and growth of tin whiskers, on the ability of this coating to prevent a tin whisker from emerging from the coating, and on the ability to prevent shorting. A sample of fourteen brass substrates (1 inch by 4 inches by 1 / 16 inch) were plated by two separate processes: half of the specimens were 'bright' tin plated directly over the brass substrate and half received a copper flash over the brass substrate prior to 'bright' tin plating. Each specimen was coated on one half of the substrate with three bi-directional sprays of Uralane 5750 to a nominal thickness of 25 to 75 micrometers (1 to 3 mils). Several specimens of both types, Cu and non-Cu flashed, were placed in an oven maintained at 50 C as others' work suggests that this is the optimal temperature for whisker formation. The remaining specimens were maintained at room ambient conditions. The surfaces of each specimen have been regularly inspected using both optical (15 to 400 x power) and Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM). Many types of growths, including needle-like whiskers, first appeared approximately three months after plating on the non-conformally coated sides of all specimens. At four months, 4 to 5 times more growth sites were observed on the coated side; however, the density of growth sites on the non-conformally coated side has since increased rapidly, and now, at one year, is about the same for both sides. The density of growth sites is estimated at 90 /sq mm with 30 percent of the sites growing whiskers (needle-like forms) with the potential to cause short circuit bridging. The average growth rate of the needle-like whiskers on the non-conformally coated areas is about 130 micrometers per year with some outliers reaching 800 micrometers after one year. It is more difficult to make growth measurements under the <b>conformal</b> <b>coat.</b> As yet no whiskers have been observed to penetrate through the coating surface, however, a number of tin nodules appear on the verge of breaking through the thinner regions of the coating surface. These domes are developing sharper and sharper tips, as if a growing whisker is about to push its way through a tough skin. Our observations are that the specimens with copper flash show a much lower density of nucleation sites and significantly slower whisker growth compared to the specimens that have only bright tin plating over brass. The specimens kept at room temperature have a higher whisker density than those stored at 50 C. This is an unexpected result and does not agree with the published findings of others. All of the whiskers originate from small surface defects (thin, tiny scratches) that appear over the entire surface of each specimen...|$|R

30|$|Both blue- and redshifts of {{resonant}} modes {{are observed}} in the rolled-up Y 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 tubular microcavity during a <b>conformal</b> oxide <b>coating</b> process.

The redshift is due to the increase of the wall thickness and corresponding light confinement enhancement. On the other hand, desorption of water molecules by heating leads to a blueshift. The balance of these two factors produces the observed bi-directional shift of the modes while they both contribute to promoted quality factor after coating.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{cellular}} {{case study}} includes quantitative {{estimates of the}} extent to which cells contributed to overall benefits. At Hughes Ground Systems Group (Fullerton, Calif.), producing circuit cards for defense equipment, the first cell, which began as a pilot project with 15 volunteers, was launched in 1987. One month later a second cell began, and by 1992 all production employees, numbering about 150, had been integrated into seven cells. Prior to cells, circuit card cycle time, from kit release to shipment to the customer, had been 38 weeks. After the cells had taken over the full production sequence (mechanical assembly, wave solder, thermal cycle, and <b>conformal</b> <b>coat),</b> cycle time had fallen to 30.5 weeks, of which production manager John Reiss attributed 20 weeks to use of a [...] "WIP chart system" [...] by the cell teams and the other 10.5 weeks to the cellular organization itself. Later, when it seemed that the cells were overly large and cumbersome, cell sizes were shrunk by two-thirds, resulting in “micro cells” that cut cycle time by another 1.5 weeks. Finally, by adopting certain other improvements, cycle times had decreased to four weeks. Other improvements included reducing work-in-process inventory from 6 or 7 days to one day and percent defective from 0.04 to 0.01 Switching from a functional (job-shop) layout to cells often costs has a minus net cost, inasmuch as the cell reduces costs of transport, work-in-process and finished inventory, transactions, and rework. When large, heavy, expensive pieces of equipment (sometimes called “monuments” in lean lingo) must be moved, however, the initial costs can be high to the point where cells are not feasible.|$|R
