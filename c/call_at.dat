5|$|Coach {{services}} {{running through}} Sheffield are operated by National Express {{and to a}} lesser extent Megabus, part of the Stagecoach Group. National Express services <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Sheffield Interchange, Meadowhall Interchange and Meadowhead Bus Stop. Megabus services only <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Meadowhall. National Express services 564, 560, 350, 320, 310 and 240 <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Sheffield, as do others on a less frequent basis. The 560/564 service is a direct connection to London Victoria Coach Station via Chesterfield and Milton Keynes, operating 12 times a day in both directions. The 350 and 240 services connect Sheffield to Manchester Airport and Heathrow/Gatwick Airports respectively. Two Megabus services, the M12 and M20, <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Sheffield en route to London from Newcastle upon Tyne and Inverness respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} six {{platform}}s. All trains <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Waterloo East and most <b>call</b> <b>at</b> London Bridge except for during peak hours, when trains from Charing Cross (AM) or to Charing Cross (PM) {{will not stop}} until the opening of London Bridge's new platform 6.|$|E

5|$|Eurostar trains do not {{currently}} <b>call</b> <b>at</b> , {{originally intended to}} be the London stop for the regional Eurostars. This was to be reviewed following the 2012 Olympics. However, in 2013, Eurostar claimed that its 'business would be hit' by stopping trains there.|$|E
5|$|Harbour ferry services, {{operated}} by Bristol Ferry Boats and Number Seven Boat Trips, <b>call</b> <b>at</b> a landing {{stage in the}} Floating Harbour outside the station. The service links Bristol Bridge, St Augustine's Reach in the City Centre, the SS Great Britain, and Hotwells.|$|E
5|$|Several London bus routes, {{including}} 1, 4, 26, 59, 68, 171, 176, 188, 507, 521 and RV1 {{all stop}} at Waterloo. Some buses <b>call</b> <b>at</b> stops {{by the side}} of the station on Waterloo Road, others at Tenison Way, a short distance from the Victory Arch.|$|E

5|$|The four {{tracks are}} served by two island platforms; {{northbound}} trains <b>call</b> <b>at</b> the western platform and southbound trains the eastern platform, providing cross-platform interchange between the two routes.|$|E
5|$|The {{route through}} the station will be busier from December 2014 to 2018 as Thameslink trains serving London Bridge will be {{diverted}} via Herne Hill– an additional four trains per hour in both directions. This {{is due to}} the redevelopment of London Bridge that will temporarily close it to Bedford-Brighton trains. The additional trains will not <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Herne Hill; they will run fast between London Blackfriars and East Croydon. It would not be possible for the 12-car peak trains to <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Herne Hill as the platforms are too short and it would not be viable to use selective door operation as the carriages not on the platforms would foul the junctions.|$|E
5|$|After storms, the Beagle reached Montevideo on 26 July 1832, {{and took}} {{observations}} for the chronometers. An attempt to <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Buenos Aires for information was thwarted by officials, then FitzRoy agreed {{a request for}} ship's crew (and Darwin) to briefly occupy a Montevideo fort to dispel a revolution. On 22 August, after taking soundings in Samborombón Bay, the Beagle began survey work down the coast from Cape San Antonio.|$|E

5|$|By now, the War of the Spanish Succession {{had broken}} out, and news of its {{declaration}} reached Benbow on 7 July. He detached Whetstone and six ships to search off Port St Louis in Hispaniola for a French squadron under Admiral Jean du Casse, which he believed would <b>call</b> <b>at</b> the port on his voyage to Cartagena, {{and from there}} he might raid English and Dutch shipping. After Whetstone had left, Benbow took his squadron and sailed for Cartagena, anticipating that either he or Whetstone would find Du Casse and bring him to battle.|$|E
5|$|Ceremonies came to {{surround}} many memorials; many memorials were formally opened or unveiled in public ceremonies, {{while others were}} used for recurring ceremonies on commemorative days. Memorials in Britain and France were typically opened in civic ceremonies involving local dignitaries, veterans and the next-of-kin of fallen servicemen. Some memorials acquired daily ceremonies; in 1928 it became customary to play the Last Post bugle <b>call</b> <b>at</b> the Menin Gate memorial each evening, for example, and this practice spread to many other similar memorials in France.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, local councillors from Kent and Pas-de-Calais {{announced}} {{they were in}} talks to establish a frequent local rail service between the regional stations along the route. Trains would leave Lille and stop at Calais, Ashford and Stratford before reaching London St Pancras. Currently, Ashford and Calais have an infrequent service and Eurostar trains do not <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Stratford. The initiative is part of Calais' branding {{as part of the}} UK in order to benefit from the 2012 London Olympics but is supported {{on both sides of the}} channel to bring in more commuters.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} also {{serviced}} by the Museumsline 100, a bus line that <b>calls</b> <b>at</b> several important museums throughout town. Moreover, the night service N40 <b>calls</b> <b>at</b> Odeonsplatz.|$|R
25|$|After <b>calls</b> <b>at</b> Newport and Milford Haven, Cyclops {{returned}} to deep ocean service. She left Milford Haven on 19 July, joining Convoy OB 186 which then dispersed in the North Atlantic on 22 July. She <b>called</b> <b>at</b> Durban 22–31 August and Aden 14–19 September. There she joined Convoy BN 5, which {{was en route}} from Bombay to Suez. She passed through the Suez Canal, <b>called</b> <b>at</b> Port Said, and reached Alexandria on 30 September. She left Alexandria on 19 October, <b>called</b> <b>at</b> Haifa in Mandatory Palestine and got back to Alexandria on 25 October.|$|R

5|$|In March 1965, a NOTAM {{was issued}} of changes {{had been made}} into the {{arrangements}} for light aircraft crossing the Channel. These changes were partly to avoid conflict with traffic flying into Lydd (Ferryfield). Non-radio aircraft could use the route between Hythe and Ambleteuse. Non-radio aircraft were advised to <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Lympne before crossing. On 11 July, one of Skyways Coach Air's Avro 748s crashed on landing at Lympne.|$|E
5|$|Most bus {{services}} {{are provided by}} First West of England or Crosville Motor Services. All services <b>call</b> <b>at</b> stops in the Regent Street and Big Lamp Corner area, including some stops in the adjacent High Street. Some town services and those to Sand Bay, Wells, Burnham-on-Sea and Bristol Airport start from or run via the main railway station. The service to Sand Bay is sometimes operated by an open top bus. National Express and Bakers Dolphin operate long distance coach services, mostly from the coach terminal in Locking Road Car Park which {{is close to the}} railway station.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{soon learned}} that no ship was likely to <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Godthaab until the {{following}} spring, though {{they were able to}} send letters back to Norway via a boat leaving Ivigtut at the end of October. He and his party therefore spent the next seven months in Greenland, hunting, fishing and studying the life of the local inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|On 30 September 1868, De Soto was resold to her {{original}} owners, {{now known as}} Livingston, Fox & Co. After a thorough reconditioning, she was returned to service as a commercial steamship, operating on her old route between New York and New Orleans with a port of <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Havana. She maintained a monthly service on this route for another two years.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Betelgeuse was to <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Sines, Portugal, {{to lighten}} the load of the ship, but poor weather {{conditions}} prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. Plans were further frustrated at Leixões, where a ship had run aground across the harbour entrance, preventing Betelgeuse from berthing there to discharge her cargo. Betelgeuse was then instructed to sail for Whiddy Island, Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Otherwise, {{their stay}} in Paris {{was filled with}} well-wishers who came to <b>call</b> <b>at</b> the hotel. Queen Victoria sent her chargé d'affaires to present him with the Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George. After days of visitors, which {{included}} world dignitaries and representatives of two different Masonic lodges, Kalākaua and friends attended a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Aida. He was given {{a tour of the}} headquarters of Le Figaro, and visited the Société de géographie. On August 15, the royal group, which now included Hoffnung, left on the evening train, bound for Portugal and Spain.|$|E
