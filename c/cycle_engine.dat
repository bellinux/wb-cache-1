25|$|In 1876, Nikolaus Otto {{patented}} the Otto <b>cycle</b> <b>engine.</b> It was a {{four-stroke cycle}} gas {{internal combustion engine}} with intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes. one of Otto's more than 25 patents on this engine was later challenged and overturned {{in order to allow}} Daimler and Maybach to produce their high speed engine.|$|E

25|$|In 1876, Otto {{developed}} a gaseous fuel, compressed charge four-stroke cycle, (also {{known as the}} Otto <b>Cycle)</b> <b>engine</b> after 14 years of effort, a system characterized by four piston strokes (intake, compression, power, and exhaust). Otto intended that his invention would replace the steam engines predominant in those years, even though his engine was still primitive and inefficient.|$|E
25|$|Daimler had {{developed}} the first liquid petroleum vehicle in 1885 and Carl Benz {{had developed}} the first purpose built automobile using a 2 <b>cycle</b> <b>engine</b> {{of his own}} design a few months later. Daimler never met Carl Benz {{during the period of}} invention. In 1896 Daimler (DMG) sued Benz & Cie for violating his 1883 patent on hot tube ignition. Daimler won and Benz had to pay royalties to DMG. Daimler did not meet Carl Benz while they were in court in Mannheim. Later at the founding of the Central European Motor Car Association Daimler and Benz still did not speak to each other.|$|E
25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine tuned for LPG fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which {{is by far the}} greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An Atkinson <b>cycle</b> <b>engine</b> uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high expansion ratio {{is also one of the}} two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow.|$|E

50|$|In {{four-stroke}} <b>cycle</b> <b>engines</b> {{and some}} two-stroke <b>cycle</b> <b>engines,</b> the valve timing {{is controlled by}} the camshaft. It can be varied by modifying the camshaft, or it can be varied during engine operation by variable valve timing. It is also affected by the adjustment of the valve mechanism, and particularly by the tappet clearance. However, this variation is normally unwanted.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Atkinson <b>cycle</b> piston <b>engine</b> {{allowed the}} intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle {{to occur in}} a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto <b>cycle</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the design and testing period the absence of a suitable, serially produced light aircraft engine was a concern and the wing was therefore mounted so that it could be moved fore and aft to allow for the varying centre of gravity positions resulting from engines of different weight. [...] A glider version was contemplated though not finally used. [...] Instead, the flight programme began with the L20 powered by the [...] Harley-Davidson motor <b>cycle</b> <b>engine</b> used in the L15. [...] By mid 1925 this had been replaced with a new engine, the [...] air-cooled, flat twin Mercedes F7502a, which Klemm had persuaded Daimler's engine group to design and build for the light aircraft market. The cost of flying the L20 was low as its cruise fuel consumption was only 63 mL/km (45 mpg). From 1926 the uprated [...] Mercedes F7502b was fitted. [...] The F7502 was central {{to the success of the}} L20, though it suffered from repeated rocker arm failures.|$|E
