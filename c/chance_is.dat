5|$|The {{panel is}} rich in Christian iconography, which {{reflects}} the shift in religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century, exemplified by the Devotio Moderna movement. The painting is devotional; its iconography clearly juxtaposes Old and New Testament imagery, conveying themes of punishment and redemption, against the belief that a second <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> available through the birth of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Maternal age {{affects the}} chances of having a {{pregnancy}} with Down syndrome. At age 20, the <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> one in 1441; at age 30, it is one in 959; at age 40, it is one in 84; and at age 50 it is one in 44. Although the probability increases with maternal age, 70% of children with Down syndrome are born to women 35 {{years of age and}} younger, because younger people have more children. The father's older age is also a risk factor in women older than 35, but not in women younger than 35, and may partly explain the increase in risk as women age.|$|E
5|$|Television's {{debut album}} Marquee Moon, {{released}} in 1977, is frequently {{cited as a}} seminal album in the field. The no wave movement that developed in New York in the late 1970s, with artists such as Lydia Lunch and James <b>Chance,</b> <b>is</b> often treated as the phenomenon's U.S. parallel. The later work of Ohio protopunk pioneers Pere Ubu is also commonly described as post-punk. One {{of the most influential}} American post-punk bands was Boston's Mission of Burma, who brought abrupt rhythmic shifts derived from hardcore into a highly experimental musical context. In 1980, Australia's Boys Next Door moved to London and changed their name to the Birthday Party, which evolved into Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Led by the Primitive Calculators, Melbourne's Little Band scene would further explore the possibilities of post-punk. Later alternative rock musicians found diverse inspiration among these post-punk predecessors, as they did among their new wave contemporaries.|$|E

25|$|The psi {{assumption}} — The {{assumption that}} any statistical deviation from <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> evidence for telepathy is highly controversial. Strictly speaking, a deviation from <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> only evidence that either {{this was a}} rare, statistically unlikely occurrence that happened by chance, or something was causing a deviation from chance. Flaws in the experimental design are a common cause of this, and so the assumption {{that it must be}} telepathy is fallacious.|$|E

To get the cash, Chance persuades Vukovich to aid him in robbing Thomas Ling, a man whom Ruth previously told <b>Chance</b> <b>is</b> bringing $50,000 cash to purchase stolen diamonds. Chance and Vukovich intercept Ling {{at the train station}} and seize the cash in an industrial area. Ling's cover people follow them, though, open fire and accidentally shoot Ling. Chance and Vukovich try to evade them through the streets, freeways and even one of the flood control channels, before a final escape by going the wrong way on the freeway. The next day, the end of their daily briefing includes an FBI bulletin that Ling was its undercover agent, kidnapped, robbed and murdered while on a sting operation. Only a generic description of the assailants and their vehicle is given. While Chance and Vukovich did not kill Ling, Vukovich is nonetheless consumed by guilt, while <b>Chance</b> <b>is</b> apathetic and focused solely on getting Masters. Unable to persuade Chance to come clean about their role in Ling's death, Vukovich meets with Grimes, who advises him to turn himself in and testify against Chance in exchange for a lighter sentence. Vukovich refuses to implicate his partner.|$|E
