5|$|During the Battle of Dunkirk, many Allied {{ships were}} lost to Ju 87 attacks as the British Operation Dynamo sought to {{evacuate}} British and French armies from the pocket. The French destroyer Adroit was sunk on 21 May 1940, {{followed by the}} paddle steamer <b>Crested</b> <b>Eagle</b> on 28 May. The French Channel-steamer Côte d'Arzur (3,047) followed. The Ju 87s operated to maximum effectiveness when the weather allowed. RAF fighter units were held back and Allied air cover was patchy at best. On 29 May the Royal Navy destroyer H.M.S.Grenade was severely damaged by a JU 87 attack within Dunkirk's harbour, and subsequently sank. The French destroyer Mistral was crippled by bomb damage the same day. Jaguar and Verity were badly damaged while the trawlers Calvi and Polly Johnson (363 and 290 tons) disintegrated under bombardment. The merchant ship Fenella (2,376 tons) was sunk having taken on 600 soldiers. The attacks brought the evacuation to a halt for a time. The rail ships Lorina and Normannia (1,564 and 1,567 tons) were sunk also. By 29 May, the Allies had lost 31 vessels sunk and 11 damaged. On 1 June the Ju 87s sank the Skipjack (815 tons) while the destroyer Keith was sunk and Basilisk was crippled before being scuttled by Whitehall. Whitehall was later badly damaged and along with Ivanhoe, staggered back to Dover. Havant, commissioned for just three weeks, was sunk and in the evening the French destroyer Foudroyant sank after a mass-attack. Further victories against shipping were claimed before nightfall on 1 June. The steamer Pavon was lost while carrying 1,500 Dutch soldiers {{most of whom were}} killed. The oil tanker Niger was also destroyed. A flotilla of French minesweepers were also lost—Denis Papin (264 tons), the Le Moussaillon (380 tons) and Venus (264 tons).|$|E
25|$|Car {{production}} was initially suspended in September 1939 following {{the outbreak of}} war in Europe, but was later resumed and production of the 12/70, <b>Crested</b> <b>Eagle,</b> Speed 25, and 4.3Litre continued well into 1940. The car factory was severely damaged on 14 November 1940 {{as a result of}} several bombing raids on Coventry by the German Luftwaffe, although ironically the armaments factory suffered little damage. Much valuable cutting gear and other equipment was lost and car {{production was}} suspended {{for the duration of the}} war, only resuming during the latter part of 1946. Despite this, Alvis carried out war production on aircraft engines (as sub-contractor of Rolls-Royce Limited) and other aircraft equipment in its shadow factories.|$|E
2500|$|The new seal {{consisted}} of the traditional Marine Corps Eagle, Globe, and Anchor emblem in bronze; however, an American bald eagle replaced the <b>crested</b> <b>eagle</b> depicted on the 1868 emblem, and is depicted with wings displayed, standing upon the western hemisphere of the terrestrial globe, and holding in his beak a scroll inscribed with the Marine Corps motto [...] "Semper Fidelis" [...] with the hemisphere superimposed on a fouled anchor.

2500|$|The first die {{depicts a}} {{relatively}} crude <b>crested</b> <b>eagle,</b> thin-legged and somewhat awkward. [...] There is no fruit on the olive branch, and the engraver added a border of acanthus leaves. [...] Depicting an eagle with a crest is typical in heraldry, but {{is at odds}} with the official blazon of the seal which specifies a bald eagle (which have no crests). [...] The blazon does not specify the arrangement of the stars (which were randomly placed in Thomson's sketch) nor the number of points; the engraver chose six-pointed stars (typical of English heraldry), and arranged them in a larger six-pointed star. [...] No drawing made by the engraver has ever been found, and it is not known if Thomson provided any.|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} Marine Corps emblem is the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor, sometimes abbreviated [...] "EGA". Adopted in {{its present}} form in 1868 by Commandant Jacob Zeilin, it derives partially from ornaments worn by the Continental Marines and the British Royal Marines, and is usually topped with a ribbon reading [...] "Semper Fidelis". The original eagle was a <b>crested</b> <b>eagle</b> found in the Americas, not the bald eagle that appears in the current emblem. The eagle stands on the Western Hemisphere and holds in its beak a scroll bearing the motto [...] "Semper Fidelis", though the scroll is sometimes omitted from uniform insignia. An anchor fouled with rope stands behind the globe, and while it generally points to the left, it can be found reversed when paired so that the anchors continually face the other. The eagle stands for a proud country, the globe signifies worldwide service, and the fouled anchor signifies naval tradition.|$|E
6000|$|Japan Birds Recurring in Distant Areas.--The most {{interesting}} {{feature in the}} ornithology of Japan is, undoubtedly, the presence of several species which indicate an alliance with such remote districts as the Himalayas, the Malay Islands, and Europe. Among the peculiar species, the most remarkable of this class are,--the fruit-pigeon of the genus Treron, entirely unknown in China, but reappearing in Formosa and Japan; the Hypsipetes, whose nearest ally is in South China {{at a distance of}} nearly 500 miles; and the jay (Garrulus japonicus), whose near ally (G. glandarius) inhabits Europe only, at a distance of 3,700 miles. But even more extraordinary are the following non-peculiar species:--Spizaetus orientalis, a <b>crested</b> <b>eagle,</b> inhabiting the Himalayas, Formosa, and Japan, but unknown in Southern or Eastern China; Ceryle guttata, a spotted kingfisher, almost confined to the Himalayas and Japan, though occurring rarely in Central China; and Halcyon coromanda, a brilliant red kingfisher inhabiting Northern India, the Malay Islands to Celebes, Formosa, and Japan. We have here an excellent illustration of the favourable conditions which islands afford both for species which elsewhere live further south (Halcyon coromanda), and for the preservation in isolated colonies of species which are verging towards extinction; for such we must consider the above-named eagle and kingfisher, both confined to a very limited area on the continent, but surviving in remote islands. Referring to our account of the birth, growth, and death of a species (in Chapter IV.) it can hardly be doubted that the Ceryle guttata formerly ranged from the Himalayas to Japan, and has now almost died out in the intervening area owing to geographical and physical changes, a subject which will be better discussed when we have examined the interesting fauna of the island of Formosa. {400} ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Crested</b> Serpent <b>eagle</b> (Spilornis cheela) is a {{bird of prey}} {{found in}} the {{tropical}} rain forest in Thailand. The Shikra (Accipiter badius) is a sparrow hawk and common resident in Thailand. Blood samples from 9 <b>Crested</b> Serpent <b>eagles</b> and 12 Shikras were obtained from September 2010 to November 2014. They were clinically healthy and negative for blood parasites detectable by light microscopy and molecular techniques (partial cytochrome b gene for avian malaria and partial 18 S rRNA gene for trypanosome). Cytochemical staining (Sudan black B, peroxidase, α-naphthyl acetate esterase, and β-glucuronidase) and transmission electron microscopy were performed. Hematological results were reported as the mean ± standard deviation and median. Heterophils were the most prevalent leukocytes in the <b>Crested</b> Serpent <b>eagle,</b> but in the Shikra, lymphocytes were the most prevalent leukocytes. In the Shikra, some vacuoles were observed in the cytoplasm of the eosinophils. All blood cells in both types of raptors stained positively for β-glucuronidase but negatively for peroxidase. The ultrastructure of heterophils showed more clearly differentiate long rod granules in <b>Crested</b> Serpent <b>eagle</b> and spindle-shaped granules in Shikra. The ultrastructure of the eosinophils in the <b>Crested</b> Serpent <b>eagle</b> revealed varied electron-dense, round-shaped granules with round, different electron-dense areas in the centers of some granules, which differed from the structure reported for other raptors. These quantitative results may be useful for clinical evaluations of <b>Crested</b> Serpent <b>eagles</b> and Shikras that are undergoing rehabilitation for release...|$|R

50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>eagle</b> may avoid direct {{competition}} with the harpy eagle by taking generally smaller prey. Birds may comprise a larger portion of the diet for crested than they do for harpys. Birds such as jays, trumpeters and guans have been observed to be predated at fruiting trees and male cocks-of-the-rock have been predated while conspicuously performing at their leks. However, the <b>crested</b> <b>eagle</b> is certainly a powerful avian predator {{in its own right}} and most studies have indicated they are primarily a predator of small mammals. Often reflected in the diet are small monkeys, such as capuchin monkeys, tamarins, and woolly monkeys. Other mammalian prey may include numerous arboreal rodents as well as opossums and kinkajous. Various studies have also pointed to the abundance of snakes (both arboreal and terrestrial varieties) and other reptiles (principally lizards) in its prey base, but the relative frequency of different types of prey apparently varies greatly on the individual level. The <b>crested</b> <b>eagle</b> seems to be a still-hunter, as it has been observed perched {{for long periods of time}} while visual scanning the forest around them.|$|E

50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>eagle</b> {{has a large}} head, {{an effect}} {{enhanced}} by the often extended feather crest of its name. It has bare legs, with a sizable tarsus length of 10.3 to 11.2 cm. The tail is fairly long, measuring 34 to 43 cm in length. The wings are quite short for the eagle's size but are broad and rounded. Forest-dwelling raptors often have a relatively small wingspan in order to enable movement within the dense, twisted forest environments. The wing chord measures 42.5 - 48.5 cm. The plumage of the <b>crested</b> <b>eagle</b> is somewhat variable. The head, back and chest of most adults are light brownish-gray, with a white throat and a dark spot on the crest and a small dark mask across the eyes. There are also various dark morphs where the plumage is sooty-gray or just blackish in some cases. The distinctive juvenile <b>crested</b> <b>eagle</b> is white {{on the head and}} chest, with a marbled-gray coloration on the back and wings. They turn to a sandy-gray color in the second year of life. Dark morph juveniles are similar but are dark brownish-gray from an early age. In flight, crested eagles are all pale below except for the grayish coloration on the chest.|$|E
