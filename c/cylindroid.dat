30|$|Finally, the {{bacterial}} preferential behavior {{against the}} released aspartate concentration {{from breast cancer}} patients and healthy donors were investigated. The aspartate concentrations of 0.11 and 0.17  mM were chosen for health donors and cancer cell patients, respectively [13]. As shown in Fig.  4 c, S. typhimurium showed strong positive chemotactic response toward the concentration gradient of aspartate at the cancer patient level (t tests, n =  6, mean ± SEM, *: < 0.001). This result shows {{the possibility that the}} concentration gradients of released aspartate from tumor can be crucial for targeting the tumor by S. typhimurium. Moreover, these results are reasonable as comparing with in vitro experiment by using tumor <b>cylindroids</b> model and S. typhimurium which individual chemoreceptors were knockout [1]. The results showed that the aspartate receptor initiated chemotaxis toward tumor <b>cylindroids,</b> the serine receptor initiated penetration, and the ribose/galactose receptor directed S. typhimurium toward necrosis. Previously, we demonstrated that the S. typhimurium showed more strong response toward the aspartate than to the ribose/galactose [2], the results altogether, therefore, the aspartate could be the one of the essential role for targeting S. typhimurium to the specific tumors.|$|R

40|$|Heterogeneous tumor microenvironments {{reduce the}} {{efficacy}} of cancer therapeutics because associated heterogeneous tumor cell populations respond differently to treatments. Tumor cells develop altered metabolism to meet the increased energy demand for rapid proliferation and cell survival in unfavorable microenvironments. Using 13 C-isotope labeling and flux analysis, intracellular metabolism of tumor cells in nutrient-limited and hypoxic microenvironment was quantified using in vitro 3 -dimensional tumor model, spheroids. The effects of, hypoxia-inducible-factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α), a factor promoting cell survival in hypoxic microenvironments, on cell growth and metabolism were investigated by using spheroids of wild type and HIF- 1 α-null cells. Quiescent cells in the inner region of spheroids have reduced carbon flux through the biosynthetic pentose phosphate and pyruvate carboxylase pathways. Cell survival and intracellular metabolism were not different between wild-type and HIF- 1 α-null tissues. These suggest that the metabolic microenvironment {{should be taken into}} account in the development and clinical application of HIF- 1 α targeted therapies. ^ A microscopy technique was developed to measure cellular DNA and RNA contents in 3 -dimensional tumor model using thin <b>cylindroids</b> and acridine orange staining. This technique identified heterogeneous cell populations and their distribution in <b>cylindroids</b> and will be useful to determine the effectiveness of chemotherapies on different cell populations. Inefficient interstitial transport hampers {{the efficacy of}} tumor therapeutics against cells distant from blood vessels, including quiescent and hypoxic cells. Gold nanoparticles have a great potential as drug vehicles due to their unique size and functionality. For clinical applications, surface charge affecting transport and cellular uptake should be carefully tuned for efficient delivery. Intercellular diffusion and cellular uptake/release of cationic and anionic gold nanoparticles in <b>cylindroids</b> were measured. A descriptive mathematical model based on diffusion-coupled reaction system was developed to determine the parameters governing intercellular diffusion and cellular uptake/release of gold nanoparticles. Cationic gold nanoparticles were better for fast cellular uptake and negative nanoparticles were advantageous for intercellular diffusion. ^ These studies demonstrate the heterogeneity in cell metabolism, populations, and transport of nanoparticles in 3 -dimensional tumor model and their therapeutic implications. Because distinctive biological and biochemical characteristics collectively define tumor physiology, these results will be valuable for the development and clinical applications of cancer therapeutics. ...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) data in {{the industrial}} measurement field is becoming increasingly popular because of the rapid development of laser scanning techniques based on the time-of-flight principle.

In this study, a mathematical uncertainty evaluation model for the diameter measurement of standard <b>cylindroid</b> components has been proposed and applied to a 3 D laser radar measurement system (LRMS). First, a single-point error ellipsoid analysis for the LRMS was established. An error ellipsoid model and algorithm for diameter measurement of <b>cylindroid</b> components was then proposed based on the single-point error ellipsoid. Finally, four experiments were conducted using the LRMS to measure the diameter of a standard cylinder in the laboratory.

40|$|Most {{chemotherapeutics}} fail {{to treat}} solid tumors because they cannot reach beyond regions proximal to {{blood vessels and}} are ineffective against quiescent tumor cells. Motile Salmonella typhimurium, being able to penetrate tumor tissue and chemotax towards distant tumor regions, provides an attractive drug delivery system that could break these therapeutic barriers. This dissertation focuses on two studies using genetic engineering and treatment supplement to upgrade Salmonella tumor-targeting for better therapeutic efficacy. ^ It has previously been shown in tumor <b>cylindroids</b> that Salmonella lacking ribose chemoreceptors (Trg) primarily localized in tumor quiescence.

40|$|Intravenously {{delivered}} cancer drugs face transport limitations at {{the tumor}} site and cannot reach {{all parts of}} tumors at therapeutically effective concentrations. Transport limitations also prevent oxygen from distributing evenly in tumors resulting in hypoxia, which plays {{a critical role in}} cancer progression. In this dissertation, I present the development of micro-devices that mimic transport limitations of drugs and nutrients on three dimensional tumor tissues, enable visualization and quantification of the ensuing gradients, and enable simple analysis and mathematical modeling of obtained data. To measure the independent effects of oxygen gradients on tumor tissues, an oxygen delivery device that used microelectrodes to generate oxygen directly underneath three-dimensional tumor <b>cylindroids</b> was developed. Supplying oxygen for 60 hours eliminated the necrotic region typically found in the center of <b>cylindroids.</b> Dead cells were observed moving away from the location of oxygen delivery. These measurements show that oxygen gradients are an important determinant of cell viability and rearrangement. Another micro-device was developed to mimic the delivery and systemic clearance of therapeutic agents. This microfluidic device consisted of cuboidal tumor tissue subjected to continuous medium perfusion along one face. The device was used to measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of the accumulation of therapeutic bacteria in tumors. Suspensions of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli strains were delivered to tumor tissues for 1 hour. Bacterial motility strongly correlated (R 2 = 99. 3 %) with the extent of tissue accumulation. Based on spatio-temporal profiles and a mathematical model of motility and growth, bacterial dispersion was found to be necessary for deep penetration into tissue. These results show that motility is critical for effective distribution of bacteria in tumors. The microfluidic device was further used to mimic the delivery and clearance of equal concentrations of doxorubicin and liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (Doxil). A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model incorporating mechanisms of tissue-level diffusion and binding was developed and experimental data was fit to this model. Doxorubicin was found to have the optimal diffusivity and binding for maximizing therapeutic effect. Doxil was severely limited by low intratumor drug release. These results show that in-vitro models mimicking tissue-level transport limitations more accurately predict the therapeutic response of drugs. ...|$|R

I had {{to figure out how to}} model each line such that the shape's geometric parameters were satisfied and the surface would still be ruled. Using the equations and specific points on the surface, I developed a method to make the parametric CAD models of each shape with the lines on the ruled surface. With this approach, anyone with basic SolidWorks skills can model these shapes to meet their preferences, whether it is a matter of size, resolution of lines or curvature.

30|$|The general {{procedure}} for preparing a printing sample is as follows. First, the 3 D numerical model was transited to the STL files. Second, the STL files {{were put into}} the Objet Studio software to create a 3 D model. To distinguish different components of the heterogeneous model, each component, such as matrix and gravel, was put in independent STL files. From this, the Objet Studio software automatically assembled the whole model {{in accordance with the}} location coordinates of the parts. Third, the material properties were accordingly assigned to the matrix and particles in line. Using the Objet Studio, we were able to set the additional printing parameters, such as the material properties of contact surfaces and the thickness of supporting materials, in order to finalize the printing setup. In this study, we adopted the transparent photopolymer Vero Clear to print the matrix, and white RGD to print the gravel. In the hydrofracturing experiment, an open hole was required to inject water that would fracture the sample. Therefore, the light type lattice supporting material Fullcure 705 was employed to form the open hole without fillings. The supporting material features low-transparency, loose structure, low intensity, and can be physically removed or washed through high-pressure water easily after the sample is prepared. In the end, all the data of the model were transmitted to the 3 D printer. Consequently, two types of <b>cylindroid</b> samples were printed, which are shown in Fig.  2 c and denoted as type (i) and (ii). The samples were 54  mm in diameter and 108  mm in length. A 4 -mm-diameter vertical hole was left {{at the center of the}} sample with a length of 54  mm.

This finding represents the first record of endonuclear symbiotic bacteria in a metazoan species. The bacteria reach the host ovarian cells by crossing the tunica propria. The ultrastructural morphology of the bacteria closely resembles that of cytoplasmic symbionts found in other insect orders (such as Dictyoptera and Homoptera) and their presence {{does not appear to}} be correlated with bacteriocytes (or mycetocytes) as in the more primitive termite Mastotermes darwiniensis (Isoptera: Mastotermitidae). The endonuclear symbionts, as well as the cytoplasmic ones, are enveloped by a plasma membrane, by a cell wall typical of Gram-negative bacteria and by a perisymbiotic membrane, the last two separated by an outer periplasmic space. In some of the endonuclear symbionts, however, the perisymbiotic membrane is lacking. Different kinds of inclusions, apparently unrelated to mesosomes, are visible within the endonuclear symbionts. A wide array of vesicles is found in the outer periplasmic space and inside the host chromatin, in close proximity to bacteria. Some vesicles apparently originate tram the outer layer of bacterial cell wall and are freed in the host chromatin by a further process of budding and vesiculation of the perisymbiotic membrane. These observations support the hypothesis of product exchanges between endosymbionts and the host cell. The presence of endonucIear symbionts (also seen in the act of dividing within the nucleus) does not apparently affect the meiotic processes or cause host cell degenerations, although a less dense chromatin, aggregates of granular material, thin <b>cylindroid</b> bodies and bundles of microfibrils are indeed observed within the nucleoplasm.
