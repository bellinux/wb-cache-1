40|$|The {{technical}} features of solid-electrode batteries (e. g., high energy density, relatively low capital cost ($/kWh)) and flow batteries (e. g., long cycle life, design flexibility) are highly complementary. It is therefore extremely desirable to integrate their advantages {{into a single}} storage device for large-scale energy storage applications where lifetime cost ($/kW-h/cycle) is an extremely important parameter. Here, we demonstrate a non-Li-based-flow battery concept that replaces the aqueous solution of redox-active molecules found in typical redox flow batteries with suspensions of hydrophilic carbon particles (“solid suspension electrodes”) coated <b>with</b> <b>earth-abundant</b> redox-active <b>metals.</b> The solid suspension electrodes charge by depositing <b>earth-abundant</b> redox-active <b>metals</b> onto the carbon particle suspension, which are then stripped during discharge operation. The electrical contact to the solid suspension electrodes is fed through fixed redox-inert hydrophobic carbon current collectors through “contact charge transfer” mechanism. The hydrophobicity of the current collectors prevents direct plating of redox-active metals onto their surfaces. The above concept was successfully used to demonstrate several non-Li-based battery chemistries including zinc–copper, zinc–manganese oxide, zinc–bromine, and zinc–sulfur, providing a pathway for potential applications in medium and large-scale electrical energy storage...|$|R

In this thesis, catalytic systems <b>with</b> <b>earth-abundant</b> <b>metal</b> catalysts such as molybdenum(VI) and hypervalent iodine complexes were developed to selectively break down lignin models into lower molecular weight chemicals under mild conditions. Due {{to the complexity of}} lignin, simple lignin model substrates (A to E), representing common linkages in lignin, were used to investigate the catalytic activity/selectivity of these catalysts. With the molybdenum catalysts [7 – 11]/SPC/Adogen® 464 system (SPC = sodium percarbonate), oxidation of simple β- 1 model compound A in acetonitrile showed primarily C-H bond cleavage to form the ketone product, benzoin methyl ether, whereas the Cα-Cβ bond cleavage product, methyl benzoate, was obtained by switching the reaction solvent to benzonitrile. Preference for generating the Cα-Cβ bond cleavage product, i. e. benzaldehyde, can also be achieved with other early to middle transition metal catalysts using H 2 O 2 (aq) as the terminal oxidant. Stoichiometric amounts of hypervalent iodine/Lewis acid systems [20 a-c] were able to selectively cleave Cα-Cβ bonds to aldehydes with both simple β- 1 model compound A and β-O- 4 model compound C. In contrast, other lignin model compounds with different linkages were unable to be oxidized to a great extent using these Mo- or iodine-based complexes. The catalytic activity and selectivity of the reported vanadium complexes, copper salts and non-metal system 1 - 5 on non-volatile organosolv (NVO) lignin was investigated under basic condition. Details of the depolymerisation of lignin were determined by using Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and the two-dimensional NMR technique, quantitative HSQC (q-HSQC) spectroscopy.
