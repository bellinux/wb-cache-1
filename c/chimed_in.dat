25|$|Starting in December 2010, {{controversy}} erupted {{over the}} plans for two permanent gallery spaces: for the Jewish suffering during the Holocaust and for the injustices experienced by the Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Organizations like the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC), Canadians for Genocide Education, the German-Canadian Congress, the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association (UCCLA) {{and thousands of other}} Canadians have been protesting this perceived elevation of the suffering of one or two communities above all others. The experiences and issues of these other groups are addressed thematically in the remaining galleries. With regard to atrocities, other advocacy groups have also <b>chimed</b> <b>in</b> to protest a perceived over-emphasis on the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, Field and Stream {{magazine}} {{put into}} writing what {{was already a}} well-known fact. The Irish Setter was disappearing {{from the field and}} an outcross would be necessary to resurrect the breed as a working dog. Sports Afield <b>chimed</b> <b>in</b> with a similar call for an outcross. Ned LaGrande of Pennsylvania spent a small fortune purchasing examples of the last of the working Irish Setters in America and importing dogs from overseas. With the blessing of the Field Dog Stud Book, he began an outcross to red and white field champion English Setters. The National Red Setter Field Trial Club was created to test the dogs and to encourage breeding toward a dog that would successfully compete with the white setters. Thus the modern Red Setter was born and the controversy begun.|$|E

On a {{pitch that}} was quicker than the Test strip, Bangladesh looked all at sea against {{the pace of}} Lee and Gillespie. They soon crashed to 4/19 and never recovered, {{eventually}} bowled out for 105 in the 34th over. Only three batsmen managed double figures as the pace duo took seven wickets between them.

500|$|Her church trial {{took place}} at the Boston meeting house on two {{consecutive}} Thursdays in March 1638. [...] Hutchinson was accused of numerous theological errors of which only four were covered during the first day, so the trial was scheduled to continue the following week, when Wilson took an active part in the proceedings. [...] During this second day of interrogation a week later, Hutchinson read a carefully written recantation of her theological errors. [...] Had the trial ended there, she would have likely remained in communion with the church, with the possibility of even returning there some day. [...] Wilson, however, did not accept this recantation, and he re-opened a line of questioning from the previous week. [...] With this, a new onslaught began, and when later given the opportunity, Wilson said, [...] "... your errors...is the slightinge of Gods faythfull Ministers and contenminge and cryinge down them as Nobodies." [...] Hugh Peter <b>chimed</b> <b>in,</b> followed by Thomas Shepard, and then Wilson spoke again, [...] "I cannot but reverence and adore the wise hand of God...in leavinge our sister to pride and Lyinge." [...] Then John Eliot made his statement, and Wilson resumed, [...] "Consider how we cane...longer suffer her to goe on still in seducinge to seduce, and in deacevinge to deaceve, and in lyinge to lye!" ...|$|E
500|$|King Edward, in his [...] "Device of the Succession", {{settled the}} Crown on his cousin once removed, Jane Grey, {{bypassing}} his half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth. After Edward's death on 6July 1553 the Duke of Northumberland undertook {{the enforcement of}} the King's will. The envoys of the Holy Roman Empire and France were sure of the plan's success. Jane was reluctant to accept the Crown: She gave in after remonstrances by an assembly of nobles, including her parents and in-laws; Guildford <b>chimed</b> <b>in</b> with a lovelier approach, with [...] "prayers and caresses". On 10July Jane and Guildford made their ceremonial entry into the Tower of London. Residing in there, Guildford wanted to be made king; according to her own later account, Jane had a long discussion about this with Guildford, who [...] "assented that if he were to be made king, he would be so by me, by Act of Parliament". But then, Jane would agree only to make him Duke of Clarence; Guildford replied {{that he did not want}} to be a duke, but king. When the Duchess of Northumberland heard of the argument she became furious and forbade Guildford to sleep any longer with his wife. She also commanded him to leave the Tower and go home, but Jane insisted that he remain at court at her side.|$|E
500|$|Marrara Oval {{became the}} 89th Test venueand the eighth in Australia. On {{a slow and}} low drop-in pitch airlifted from Melbourne {{a month before the}} match, Australia won the toss and elected to field. Bangladesh {{collapsed}} and were bowled out for 97 within three hours, with only Mohammad Ashraful (23) and Khaled Mahmud (21) providing resistance. [...] All four Australian bowlers <b>chimed</b> <b>in,</b> as Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee took three wickets apiece. McGrath and Jason Gillespie surpassed the duo of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall as Australia's most successful opening-bowling combination. Bangladesh's shot selection did not impress coach Dav Whatmore who said, [...] "A few players presented their wickets and that's just the area we're trying to improve." [...] Australia initially struggled {{to come to terms with}} the pitch, falling to 2/43 when Ricky Ponting was dismissed for 10. Darren Lehmann started the carnage, scoring his second Test century (110). Steve Waugh then became only the second player after Gary Kirsten to score a century against all Test playing nations. Upon reaching the milestone, he promptly declared Australia's innings on 7/407. Only Bangladesh's fastest bowler, Mashrafe Mortaza proved threatening, taking three wickets for 74 runs (3/74) in 23 overs. After the days play, Lehmann said, [...] "It was hard work out there. They stuck to their guns pretty well, they put it in the right areas and made it tough to score runs." [...] When asked about becoming only the second batsman to score a hundred against all nine Test-playing nations, Waugh said: ...|$|E

500|$|Walsh {{appeared}} and {{explained to the}} committee that Congress had previously authorized a commission to work with state and local authorities in planning for observances which were {{to be held in}} December 1920 on the 300th anniversary of the Mayflower landing, and were also to occur the following summer. Although events were to be held elsewhere in Massachusetts, and even outside the state, the focus would be on Plymouth, with the beautification of the area around Plymouth Rock a major goal. The commission had recommended the issuance of commemorative stamps, and also a federal appropriation, {{but it was not until}} Walsh saw a committee report for the Maine Centennial piece listed on a House document that he came up with the idea of a commemorative coin for the anniversary. [...] This had been done in the past for the World Columbian Exposition of 1893, Walsh recalled, and Ohio's William A. Ashbrook <b>chimed</b> <b>in</b> (incorrectly) that a coin had been issued for the Jamestown Exposition of 1907. [...] Walsh stated that more were being asked for (500,000) than for the Alabama coin because of the great interest in the celebration; he suggested that to increase regional interest, the coins be struck at all the mints (Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco). [...] Ashbrook felt the number to be issued excessive, he suggested 300,000 as more appropriate, and Walsh consented. Missouri's William L. Nelson moved that the committee approve the amended bill, and this carried. Vestal issued a report on behalf of his committee on March 26, 1920, indicating his committee's support for the bill once amended.|$|E
500|$|Differing from Survivor in that {{previously}} Beyonc√© {{had taken an}} active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and <b>chimed</b> <b>in</b> the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyonc√©, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads‚Äîwhich they considered people cannot sing with. Beyonc√© elaborated [...] "We {{wanted to make sure that}} the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance." [...] As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: [...] "All of us have been in three different places... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007‚Äì08 led to renewed scrutiny and {{criticism of the}} hypothesis. Market strategist Jeremy Grantham stated flatly that the EMH {{was responsible for the}} current {{financial crisis}}, claiming that belief in the hypothesis caused financial leaders to have a [...] "chronic underestimation of the dangers of asset bubbles breaking". Noted financial journalist Roger Lowenstein blasted the theory, declaring [...] "The upside of the current Great Recession is that it could drive a stake through the heart of the academic nostrum known as the efficient-market hypothesis." [...] Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker <b>chimed</b> <b>in,</b> saying it's [...] "clear that among the causes of the recent financial crisis was an unjustified faith in rational expectations [...] market efficiencies." [...] "By 2007‚Äì2009, you had to be a fanatic to believe in the literal truth of the EMH", noted one financial analyst.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the tower}} {{was not yet}} finished, the bell was mounted in New Palace Yard. The first bell was transported to the tower on a trolley drawn by sixteen horses, with crowds cheering its progress. During the bell's testing, it cracked beyond repair and a {{replacement}} had to be made. The bell was recast on 10 April 1858 at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry as a 13¬Ωton (13.76-tonne) bell. This was pulled [...] up to the Clock Tower‚Äôs belfry, a feat that took 18 hours. It is [...] tall and [...] diameter. This new bell first <b>chimed</b> <b>in</b> July 1859; in September it too cracked under the hammer. According to the foundry's manager, George Mears, the horologist Denison had used a hammer {{more than twice the}} maximum weight specified. For three years Big Ben was taken out of commission and the hours were struck on the lowest of the quarter bells until it was repaired. To make the repair, a square piece of metal was chipped out from the rim around the crack, and the bell given an eighth of a turn so the new hammer struck in a different place. Big Ben has chimed with a slightly different tone ever since, and is still in use today with the crack unrepaired. Big Ben was the largest bell in the British Isles until [...] "Great Paul", a 16¬æton (17tonne) bell currently hung in St Paul's Cathedral, was cast in 1881.|$|E

2500|$|The 2007 AFC Asian Cup {{was another}} facet of {{sporting}} politics. The victorious Iraq national football team came out despite ethnic factionalism {{in their country}} and an invasion by the American military to win the biggest Asian football tournament. Following a previous round win, Iraqi military spokesman Brigadier General Qassim Moussawi {{said they wanted to}} stop [...] "terrorists, Sunni extremists and criminals from targeting the joy of the people." [...] There was controversy after the Iraqi captain Younis Mahmoud said he [...] "dared not return to his homeland because of the conditions created by the U.S. occupation." [...] President Jalal Talabani said it was disappointing they couldn't celebrate at home with the fans. Yet many hailed the victory as a show of unity. Iraq's Brazilian coach Jorvan Vieira signified the importance of the win in saying [...] "This is not just about football...this is more important than that...This has brought great happiness to a whole country. This is not about a team, this is about human beings." [...] Likewise, Saudi coach H√©lio dos Anjos <b>chimed</b> <b>in</b> that [...] "Iraq deserved to win today...They were very motivated and we knew the whole world was supporting this team." [...] Likewise, the American leadership also came out in praise of the Iraqi win. However, Iraqi midfielder Ahmed Manajid said that if he was not playing for his country he would have fought in his native Fallujah against U.S. forces. He was one of several players who criticised then-U.S. president George W. Bush for using the team's success in his campaign speeches.|$|E

Although Lawler won by submission, the Anonymous Raw General Manager reversed the decision and disqualified Lawler, claiming that Austin had [...] "overstepped his authority". He appeared on Raw the following night with the cast from Tough Enough, while also getting into an altercation with The Miz and Alex Riley. On the June 6 episode of Raw, Austin appeared live alongside old rival Vince McMahon to declare Andy Leavine as the winner of Tough Enough.

However, the Anonymous Raw General Manager <b>chimed</b> <b>in</b> and the Anonymous Raw General Manager's ringside mouthpiece Michael Cole announced that since Austin had abused his authority as referee, The Miz and R-Truth had won via disqualification. Austin did not take kindly to the Anonymous Raw General Manager overturning his decision and Cole also received a Stone Cold Stunner, which was followed with another Attitude Adjustment courtesy of Cena. Austin and Cena closed the show, celebrating with a beer bash. Austin appeared as the special guest General Manager on the [...] "WWE All-Stars" [...] episode of Raw.
