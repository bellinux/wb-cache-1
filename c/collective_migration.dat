40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying <b>collective</b> <b>migration,</b> or the coordinated {{movement of}} a population of cells, are not well understood despite its ubiquitous nature. As a means to investigate <b>collective</b> <b>migration,</b> we consider a wound healing scenario in which a population of cells fills in the empty space left from a scratch wound. Here we present a simplified mathematical model that uses reaction-diffusion equations to model <b>collective</b> <b>migration</b> during wound healing {{with an emphasis on}} cell movement and its response to both cell signaling and cell-cell adhesion. We use the model to investigate the effect of the MAPK signaling cascade on cell-cell adhesion during wound healing after EGF treatment. Our results suggest that activation of the MAPK signaling cascade stimulates <b>collective</b> <b>migration</b> through increases in the pulling strength of leader cells.

The roles of substrate stiffness and confinement on <b>collective</b> <b>migrations</b> have been investigated in recent years, however few studies have addressed how geometric shapes influence <b>collective</b> cell <b>migrations.</b> Here, we address {{the hypothesis that the}} relative position of a cell within the confinement influences its motility. Monolayers of two types of epithelial cells [...] MCF 7, a breast epithelial cancer cell line, and MDCK, a control epithelial cell line [...] were confined within circular, square, and cross-shaped stencils and their migration velocities were quantified upon release of the constraint using particle image velocimetry. The choice of stencil geometry allowed us to investigate individual cell motility within convex, straight and concave boundaries. Cells located in sharp, convex boundaries migrated at slower rates than those in concave or straight edges in both cell types. The overall cluster migration occurred in three phases: an initial linear increase with time, followed by a plateau region and a subsequent decrease in cluster speeds. An acto-myosin contractile ring, present in the MDCK but absent in MCF 7 monolayer, was a prominent feature in the emergence of leader cells from the MDCK clusters which occurred every ~ 125 μm from the vertex of the cross. Further, coordinated cell movements displayed vorticity patterns in MDCK which were absent in MCF 7 clusters. We also used cytoskeletal inhibitors to show the importance of acto-myosin bounding cables in <b>collective</b> <b>migrations</b> through translation of local movements to create long range coordinated movements and the creation of leader cells within ensembles.

By interfering with two key features of <b>collective</b> <b>migration,</b> (1) having neighboring cells and (2) adhering to them, we show that individual mesendoderm cells are capable of normal directed migration when moving as single cells but require cell-cell adhesion to participate in coordinated and directed migration when moving {{as part of a}} group.

Although the majority of such events occur with cells moving as a group, called <b>collective</b> cell <b>migration,</b> mechanics of <b>collective</b> cell <b>migrations</b> has not been understood well compared to a single cell migration. Mechanical interactions between cells and their surroundings have been demonstrated to regulate cell migration. One of such interactions is the induction of traction forces by acto-myosin dynamics within cells to their local environment, as it has been reported that cells alter the magnitude of traction forces depending on the stiffness of attaching substrates. In connection with cell migration, it has also been demonstrated the importance of substrate stiffness during cell migration using microfabricated substrates consisting of arrays of micropillars.

40|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>migration</b> {{depends on}} cell-cell {{interactions}} between neighbors {{that contribute to}} their overall directionality, yet the mechanisms that control the coordinated migration of neurons remains to be elucidated. During hindbrain development, facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) undergo a stereotypic tangential caudal migration from their place of birth in rhombomere (r) 4 to their final location in r 6 / 7. FBMNs engage in collective cell migration that depends on neuron-to-neuron interactions to facilitate caudal directionality. Here, we demonstrate that Cadherin- 2 -mediated neuron-to-neuron adhesion is necessary for directional and <b>collective</b> <b>migration</b> of FBMNs. We generated stable transgenic zebrafish expressing dominant-negative Cadherin- 2 (Cdh 2 ΔEC) driven by the islet 1 promoter. Cell-autonomous inactivation of Cadherin- 2 function led to non-directional migration of FBMNs and a defect in caudal tangential migration. Additionally, mosaic analysis revealed that Cdh 2 ΔEC-expressing FBMNs are not influenced to migrate caudally by neighboring wild-type FBMNs due to a defect in collective cell migration. Taken together, our data suggest that Cadherin- 2 plays an essential cell-autonomous role in mediating the <b>collective</b> <b>migration</b> of FBMNs...|$|E

Although the deformation of a stiffer cell or matrix causes larger movement-resisting forces, at the same time a larger stiffness can also promote cell migration due to a feedback between forces, deformations, and deformation speed that is mediated by the acto-myosin contractile machinery of cells.

Analysis of mutations in two exostosin glycosyltransferase genes (extl 3 and ext 2) revealed that loss of heparan sulfate (HS) chains results in a failure of <b>collective</b> cell <b>migration</b> due to enhanced Fgf ligand diffusion and loss of Fgf signal transduction. Consequently, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated ectopically, resulting in the subsequent loss of the chemokine receptor cxcr 7 b. Disruption of HS proteoglycan (HSPG) function induces extensive, random filopodia formation, demonstrating that HSPGs are involved in maintaining cell polarity in collectively migrating cells.

Stress-induced motion propagates into the monolayer as well as along the monolayer boundary to generate increasingly larger clusters of coordinately migrating cells that move faster with enhanced alignment of velocity and stress.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying activation of cortical myosin to stimulate single cell movement, and the relationship between the mechanisms that drive single cell locomotion and those that mediate <b>collective</b> cell <b>migration</b> of epithelial sheets are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that p 114 RhoGEF, an activator of RhoA that associates with non-muscle myosin IIA, regulates <b>collective</b> cell <b>migration</b> of epithelial sheets and tumor cell invasion. Depletion of p 114 RhoGEF resulted in specific spatial inhibition of myosin activation at cell-cell contacts in migrating epithelial sheets and the cortex of migrating single cells, but only affected double and not single phosphorylation of myosin light chain. In agreement, overall elasticity and contractility of the cells, processes that rely on persistent and more constant forces, were not affected, suggesting that p 114 RhoGEF mediates process-specific myosin activation. Locomotion was p 114 RhoGEF-dependent on Matrigel, which favors more roundish cells and amoeboid-like actinomyosin-driven movement, but not on fibronectin, which stimulates flatter cells and lamellipodia-driven, mesenchymal-like migration. Accordingly, depletion of p 114 RhoGEF led to reduced RhoA, but increased Rac activity. Invasion of 3 D matrices was p 114 RhoGEF-dependent under conditions that do not require metalloproteinase activity, supporting a role of p 114 RhoGEF in myosin-dependent, amoeboid-like locomotion.

40|$|AbstractCollective cell {{movements}} are integral to biological {{processes such as}} embryonic development and wound healing and also have {{a prominent role in}} some metastatic cancers. In migrating Xenopus mesendoderm, traction forces are generated by cells through integrin-based adhesions and tension transmitted across cadherin adhesions. This is accompanied by assembly of a mechanoresponsive cadherin adhesion complex containing keratin intermediate filaments and the catenin-family member plakoglobin. We demonstrate that focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a major component of integrin adhesion complexes, is required for normal morphogenesis at gastrulation, closure of the anterior neural tube, axial elongation and somitogenesis. Depletion of zygotically expressed FAK results in disruption of mesendoderm tissue polarity similar to that observed when expression of keratin or plakoglobin is inhibited. Both individual and <b>collective</b> <b>migrations</b> of mesendoderm cells from FAK depleted embryos are slowed, cell protrusions are disordered, and cell spreading and traction forces are decreased. Additionally, keratin filaments fail to organize at the rear of cells in the tissue and association of plakoglobin with cadherin is diminished. These findings suggest that FAK is required for the tension-dependent assembly of the cadherin adhesion complex that guides <b>collective</b> mesendoderm <b>migration,</b> perhaps by modulating the dynamic balance of substrate traction forces and cell cohesion needed to establish cell polarity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Neurons are {{dynamically}} {{coupled with}} each other through neurite-mediated adhesion during development. Understanding the collective behavior of neurons in circuits is important for understanding neural development. While a number of genetic and activity-dependent factors regulating neuronal migration have been discovered on single cell level, systematic study of <b>collective</b> neuronal <b>migration</b> has been lacking. Various biological systems are shown to be self-organized, {{and it is not}} known if neural circuit assembly is self-organized. Besides, many of the molecular factors take effect through spatial patterns, and coupled biological systems exhibit emergent property in response to geometric constraints. How geometric constraints of the patterns regulate neuronal migration and circuit assembly of neurons within the patterns remains unexplored. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We established a two-dimensional model for studying <b>collective</b> neuronal <b>migration</b> of a circuit, with hippocampal neurons from embryonic rats on Matrigel-coated self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). When the neural circuit is subject to geometric constraints of a critical scale, we found that the collective behavior of neuronal migration is spatiotemporally coordinated. Neuronal somata that are evenly distributed upon adhesion tend to aggregate at the geometric center of the circuit, forming mono-clusters. Clustering formation is geometry-dependent, within a critical scale from 200 µm to approximately 500 µm. Finally, somata clustering is neuron-type specific, and glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons tend to aggregate homo-philically. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate self-organization of neural circuits in response to geometric constraints through spatiotemporally coordinated neuronal migration, possibly via mechanical coupling. We found that such <b>collective</b> neuronal <b>migration</b> leads to somata clustering, and mono-cluster appears when the geometric constraints fall within a critical scale.

The use of in vitro cell lines to model these processes are widely used and help to shed light upon the mechanisms that lead to tumorigenesis. Here we use two such models: the human mammary epithelial cell line HMT- 3522 and ex vivo mouse mammary primary culture epithelial organoids. The HMT- 3522 cell line provides an encapsulated system to study cancer progression, however detailed ultrastructural analyses of this cell line are lacking. To study <b>collective</b> cell <b>migration</b> we used the murine ex vivo epithelial "organoid" system, which upon growth factor stimulation undergoes branching morphogenesis. Growth of these systems in 3 D cell culture {{is an important component}} in understanding the highly dynamic and complex processes of EMT and <b>collective</b> cell <b>migration.</b> High resolution imaging via transmission electron microscopy and three dimensional scanning electron microscopy provide a way to discern ultrastructural features of both <b>collective</b> cell <b>migration</b> and EMT. 	Electron microscopy imaging of the HMT- 3522 S 1 cell line, grown in 3 D to form acini, demonstrated an abundance of membrane protrusions at all interior lateral and apical surfaces. Furthermore, these acinar structures were determined to have a semi-polarized state as defined by the appearance of a basement membrane, but lack all hallmarks of apical polarization. Three dimensional imaging of the membrane protrusions revealed they have a variety of lengths and an interdigitated nature. Determining this semi-polarized state to be more representative of a transitive tissue state, we sought to image the transient terminal end bud (TEB) of organoids undergoing branching morphogenesis. Ultrastructural analysis of in vivo murine mammary gland and ex vivo un-stimulated organoids revealed nearly identical tissue organization, with typical apico-basal polarity and almost no intercellular membrane protrusions. However, data of the stimulated organoids and specifically the TEB revealed a semi-polarized state of the cells very similar to the HMT- 3522 S 1 acini, with prolific membrane protrusions. Hypothesizing these membrane protrusions were aiding in normal <b>collective</b> cell <b>migration,</b> we investigated whether disruption of actin polymerization via drug treatments within the TEB would recapitulate the ultrastructure of the tumorigenic cell line HMT- 3522 T 4 - 2.

We demonstrate that Gyc 76 C and downstream cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (DG 1) function in the gland and surrounding mesoderm to control invagination, <b>collective</b> <b>migration</b> and lumen shape. Loss of gyc 76 C resulted in glands that failed to invaginate, complete posterior migration and had branched lumens. Salivary gland migration defects of gyc 76 C mutant embryos were rescued by expression of wild-type gyc 76 C specifically in the gland or surrounding mesoderm, whereas invagination defects were rescued primarily by expression in the gland. In migrating salivary glands of gyc 76 C mutant embryos, integrin subunits localized normally to gland–mesoderm contact sites but talin localization in the surrounding circular visceral mesoderm and fat body was altered. The extracellular matrix protein, laminin, also failed to accumulate around the migrating salivary gland of gyc 76 C mutant embryos, and gyc 76 C and laminin genetically interacted in gland migration.
