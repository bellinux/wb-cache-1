5|$|Lead can <b>cause</b> <b>severe</b> {{damage to}} the brain and kidneys and, ultimately, death. By {{mimicking}} calcium, lead can cross the blood-brain barrier. It degrades the myelin sheaths of neurons, reduces their numbers, interferes with neurotransmission routes, and decreases neuronal growth.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2011 review, {{there have}} been few studies on the {{efficacy}} of Proactiv. A 2011 Consumer Reports study compared Proactiv with two less expensive types of benzoyl peroxide, AcneFree and OXY Maximum, and found all three to be equally effective. The US Food and Drug Administration warned in 2014 that over-the-counter acne treatments can <b>cause</b> <b>severe</b> irritation, as well as rare but life-threatening allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Aphasia is {{the result}} of damage to the brain's {{language}} centres affecting production, comprehension, or both, and can <b>cause</b> <b>severe,</b> chronic language impairment. Individuals with aphasia often communicate using a combination of speech, gestures, and aided communication; the proportion of each may change as the person recovers, and depends on the context and the individual's skills.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cryogenic}} liquid, {{liquid nitrogen}} {{can be dangerous}} by causing cold burns on contact, although the Leidenfrost effect provides protection for very short exposure (about one second). Ingestion of liquid nitrogen can <b>cause</b> <b>severe</b> internal damage.

5|$|Gastrointestinal upset can <b>cause</b> <b>severe</b> discomfort; it is {{most common}} when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{influenza}} can <b>cause</b> <b>severe</b> illness including primary viral pneumonia {{or secondary}} bacterial pneumonia. The obvious symptom is trouble breathing.

5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically harmless. However, ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and animal life. It can <b>cause</b> <b>severe</b> damage to the digestive system, and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood.|$|E

5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can <b>cause</b> <b>severe</b> injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating {{decaying}} {{leaves and}} other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, {{and a small}} minority are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses where they can <b>cause</b> <b>severe</b> damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves {{with a variety of}} chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} can also <b>cause</b> <b>severe</b> third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency {{of oil to}} stick to the skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E
