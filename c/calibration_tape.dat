50|$|In 1972 (Jay) John G. McKnight {{was laid}} off from Ampex, as was (Tony) Antonio Bardakos, who was making the {{calibration}} tapes for Ampex at the time. Along with Ed Seaman (also an ex-Ampex employee), McKnight and Bardakos decided to start their own <b>calibration</b> <b>tape</b> business, and thus Magnetic Reference Lab (MRL) was born in 1972.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with the}} [...] "B" [...] system, correct {{matching}} of the compression and expansion processes is important. The calibration {{of the expansion}} (decoding) unit for magnetic tape uses a flux level of 185 nWb/m, which is the level used on industry <b>calibration</b> <b>tapes</b> such as those from Ampex; this is set to 0 VU on the tape recorder playback and to Dolby Level on the noise reduction unit. In the record (compression or encoding) mode a characteristic tone (Dolby Tone) generated inside the noise reduction unit is set to 0 VU on the tape recorder and to 185 nWb/m on the tape.|$|R
5000|$|On {{some high}} end {{consumer}} equipment, Dolby calibration control is included: for recording, a reference tone at Dolby level may be recorded for accurate playback level calibration on another transport; at playback, the same recorded tone should produce the identical output, {{as indicated by}} a Dolby logo marking at 0 VU on the VU meter(s). (In consumer equipment Dolby Level is defined as 200 nWb/m; <b>calibration</b> <b>tapes</b> were available to assist correct level setting.) For accurate off-the-tape monitoring during recording on 3-head decks, both processes must be employed at once, and circuitry provided to accomplish this is marketed under the rubric [...] "Double Dolby".|$|R

40|$|While recent {{advances}} in instrumentation permit routine determination of elemental carbon concentrations in atmospheric aerosol samples, historical data on elemental C concentrations are absent. Two methods are available for the estimation of an historical data base for elemental C concentrations: <b>calibration</b> of reflectance-based <b>tape</b> samplers and analysis of archived high volume sampler filters. These methods are described and applied {{to the problem of}} reconstructing an historical data base for elemental C concentrations in Los Angeles. Twenty-four year average elemental C concentrations at seven monitoring sites in the Los Angeles area are estimated to range from 6. 4 μg m^(− 3) at Downtown Los Angeles to 4. 5 μg m^(− 3) at West Los Angeles. At most monitoring sites studied, elemental C concentrations were lower in recent years than during the late 1950 s and early 1960 s...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Self-inflating bags (SIB) remain {{widely used}} for {{neonatal}} resuscitation. Insufflation pressures from SIB {{are difficult to}} assess and can be inadequate. Ventilation monitoring improves pressure control, but is not accessible to most resuscitators. Small spring manometer or a pressure line to a needle and dial manometer can be connected through a side port on the SIB. Those devices are cheap and easily available, but their efficacy needs to be assessed. Observation of the manometer could also {{be considered as a}} distraction, with increased risk of leak or inadequate insufflation rate. We therefore aimed to evaluate the effect of mechanical manometers on the quality of insufflations with a SIB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants to the Belgian Pediatric Society meeting were invited to ventilate a manikin with a 300 ml SIB. The leak-free manikin was modified with a flow-meter at tracheal level connected to a neonatal test lung. Participants had to aim for a 25 mbar pressure and a rate of 40 - 60 during 3 sequences of 45 seconds. A spring (S), a dial (D) manometer or nothing (N) was added to the SIB in random sequence. Pressure data from the SIB and flow data from the manikin were obtained through a ventilation monitor. Peak pressure (PIP), tidal volume (VTi), and insufflations rate (RR) were calculated for each breath. Theoretical leak was evaluated by subtracting real from theoretical volumes derived from a leak free <b>calibration</b> (<b>taped</b> facemask). Data were analyzed with ANOVA and posthoc Bonferroni. RESULTS Five neonatologists (Neo), 15 pediatricians (Ped) and 11 residents ventilated the manikin for a total of 5279 insufflations. Manometer use was associated with an increase in PIP (N: 17 +- 6 mbar; S: 18 +- 4 mbar*; D: 19 +- 4 mbar*#) [*p<. 05 vs N; #:p<. 05 vs S]. Changes in VTi (N: 3 +- 1 ml; S: 3. 1 +- 1 ml*; D: 3. 2 +- 1 ml*) and RR (77 - 82 bpm) were small. Leak did not increase. The effect of manometer use on PIP, VTi and leak was more important with Neo (PIP-N: 16 +- 7 mbar; S and D: 20 +- 4 mbar*) and Ped. With residents, no change occurred in PIP (~ 17 mbar), Vti (2. 9 ml) or leak (31 - 35 %). However, for first sequences of ventilation, manometer use was associated with higher PIP (N: 12 +- 4 mbar; S: 16 +- 3 mbar*; D: 20 +- 4 mbar*#), VTi (N: 2 +- 1 ml; S: 3 +- 0. 8 ml*; D: 3. 3 +- 1 ml*#) and lower leaks (N: 38 +- 16 %; S: 27 +- 12 %*; D: 34 +- 13 %*#). This observation for first sequences was found in all 3 categories of providers. CONCLUSIONS Bag and mask ventilation remains difficult. In this model, the addition of a manometer is associated with improved pressures and VTi, and with decreased theoretical leak. This effect is predominant for initial (“naïve”) ventilation with a dial manometer, and is also related to operator experience. Small, inexpensive manometers have the potential to improve SIB ventilation of newborn infants. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Materials and Instruments 1. An electric tape, double-wired and graduated in feet, tenths and hundredths of feet. Electric tapes commonly are mounted on a hand-cranked and powered supply reel that contains space for the batteries and some device (“indicator”) for signaling when the circuit is closed (fig. 1). 2. An older model electric tape, also known as an “M-scope, ” marked at 5 -foot intervals with clamped-on metal bands (fig. 2) {{has been replaced by}} newer, more accurate models.
