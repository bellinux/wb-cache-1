It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual?

25|$|Arthur's lack of {{employment}} becomes {{a huge problem}} for him in 1986 when his daughter, Michelle, announces her engagement to Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt). Desperate to give his daughter a wedding that the family <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of,</b> Arthur decides to take money from the Walford residents' Christmas Club savings scheme {{that he has been}} running. However, with Christmas fast approaching, Arthur realises that he will have to do something to explain the lack of money in the account to everyone that contributed. Arthur announces to the members that he has withdrawn the money, then stages a fake burglary at his house and tells the police that the Christmas Club money has been stolen. However, Arthur's attempts to make the robbery look legitimate fail, and the police soon realise that Arthur is the culprit. When questioned by the police, he confesses and after his arrest he becomes severely morose, withdrawn and depressed. This culminates in Arthur finally having a nervous breakdown on Christmas Day and smashing his living room in a violent rage. By early 1987, Arthur has become so despondent that he is admitted to hospital. He returns the following spring to stand trial for the theft of the Christmas Club money. Despite Arthur having the whole community behind him, he is sent to prison for 28 days. After his release, he makes things worse by borrowing money from a loan shark.|$|E

500|$|At {{the halfway}} point of the season, with the Blue Jackets barely into double digit wins with an 11–25–5 record, worst in the league, and sitting 20 points out of playoff position, Columbus fired Arniel. He was {{replaced}} by Assistant Coach Todd Richards on an interim basis. Richards had previously coached the Minnesota Wild. He recorded his first coaching victory for the Blue Jackets in his second game, a 4–3 win over the Phoenix Coyotes. The change in coaching did not change {{the fortunes of the}} team, as they reached the All-Star break with a 13–30–6 record. At the break, Blue Jackets' owner John P. McConnell sent out a letter to fans stating his understanding of their frustration. He added that action would be taken around the trade deadline, the Entry Draft and free agency to take the team in a new direction. When speaking of the season, McConnell stated [...] "disappointing is not a strong enough word" [...] and that he was committed to giving fans a team of which they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of.</b> He also thanked them for their dedication and passion, while reiterating that the team goal was to [...] "win consistently and compete for the Stanley Cup." [...] Days later, a 250-person protest occurred outside of Nationwide Arena. Fans were upset with the Blue Jackets' management and were calling for changes at the top. The same day the fans protested, it was announced that the franchise would host the 2013 All-Star Game. Columbus was without a representative for the 2012 All-star Game, but Ryan Johansen represented the club as a rookie participant in the Super Skills Competition. In the competition, Johansen participated in the Allstate Insurance NHL Breakaway Challenge, a shootout themed event judged by the fans. He received just 1% of the vote and finished last.|$|E

Former United player Alan Cork was installed as his assistant, Cork had worked as Adams' assistant at Fulham, Swansea, Leicester and Coventry. The fourth manager at the club that season, he brought in Dave Bassett in a consultancy role after finding managing the club a bigger task than he had previously assumed. As Adams explained: [...] "When you're manager at Port Vale you probably get three calls a day and one of those is from the wife asking me what time I'm coming home for my tea." [...] His honeymoon period dissipated quickly, as United failed to win in his first eleven games in charge (four draws and seven defeats) and slipped into 23rd spot after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3–2 to fellow relegation strugglers Scunthorpe United. Adams told the press that [...] "The fans were singing 'you're not fit to wear the shirt', I cannot disagree with them. That is as disappointing a result as I have ever had in my career." [...] It took three months before he achieved his first win. The victory came on 8 March 2011 (his fourteenth game in charge), as his side came from behind to beat Nottingham Forest 2–1. Sheffield United were relegated to League One at the end of the season, finishing six points short of safety. Adams and United parted company after a meeting with owner Kevin McCabe. McCabe stated that he wished to initiate a [...] "clean sweep at the top and start afresh"; whilst Adams said that whilst he was [...] "very, very disappointed with the decision...

2500|$|I Do Bidoo Bidoo {{is a dream}} {{project of}} Unitel Productions' big boss, Tony Gloria who is also behind {{successful}} movies like Working Girls and Crying Ladies. He also revealed that the film has been developed and finished for 5 years. The idea came up when he saw Mamma Mia! on the broadway more than 10 years ago. When Gloria noticed that the songs of APO were revived by various bands and became hits anew, he felt their songs would be great for a movie as it spans many generations, so he talked to APO member, Jim Paredes and signed them up to a contract. The contract expired two times before the project has been finalized. According to him, {{he knows that the}} Filipino audience is ready for this kind of musical extravaganza on the big screen, especially when the music comes very close {{to the heart of the}} Filipino just like the songs of Jim Paredes, Boboy Garovillo and Danny Javier who are collectively known as the Apo Hiking Society. Mr. Gloria, whose vision is shared, nurtured and upheld by Unitel’s new President Ms. Madonna Tarrayo, added, “I wanted to give back something we <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> - for the Filipino, by the Filipino.” The film is written and directed by the award-winning Chris Martinez who ably used APO Hiking music to move the story forward and punctuate pivotal scenes with the same.

2500|$|The {{division}} {{landed in}} Normandy, {{near the city}} of Caen, on 13 June 1944, just a week after the D-Day landings (delayed by six days due to storms in the English Channel), and deployed west of Caen in preparation for Montgomery's upcoming offensive, Operation Epsom. O'Connor's VIII Corps, with the 11th Armoured and 43rd (Wessex) Divisions, in addition to the 15th Division, under command, was given the role of attacking between Caen and Tilly-sur-Seulles, crossing the river Odon and advance to the river Orne. MacMillan's division, with each of his brigades being supported by a Churchill tank equipped regiment of the 31st Tank Brigade, was {{to play a major role}} and his plan was for the 46th and 44th Brigades to capture the villages of Cheux on the right and Saint-Mauvieux on the left. This would allow the 227th Brigade to pass through and seize the bridges across the Odon at Gavrus and Tourmaville. However, the Normandy bocage countryside was ideal for defence, and, despite strong artillery support, the 44th and 46th Brigades encountered heavy resistance on 26 June, the first day of the operation. On the evening of the following day, the 2nd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (of 227th Brigade), ignoring the threat to their flanks, dashed to the Tourmaville bridge, which the battalion captured intact. The battalion had created a small bridgehead, allowing elements of the 11th Armoured Division to pass through and seize Hill 112, beyond the Odon river. The battalion then captured the Gavrus bridge but immediately came under heavy attack. The [...] "Scottish Corridor", which the Argylls' bridgehead across the river Odon marked the end, and which was now 2,500 yards wide, forced O'Connor, the corps commander, to send in reinforcements to hold it. The operation, although unsuccessful in its objective of penetrating as far as the Orne, it had drawn in the Germans' armoured reserves. MacMillan's division was relieved and sent to a more peaceful area, where the division, which had sustained some 2,300 casualties, including 288 killed, began to re-equip and absorb battle casualty replacements. Despite the very heavy losses, the division was believed by MacMillan's superiors to have performed very well, with Montgomery on 3 July sending him a message stating [...] "I would like to congratulate you personally, and the 15th Division as a whole on the very fine performance put up during the past week's fighting. The Division went into battle for the first time in this war, but it fought with great gallantry and displayed a fine offensive spirit. Scotland can feel pride in the 15th (Scottish) Division and the whole Division <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> itself".
