25|$|The {{required}} <b>capacitance</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{is determined}} by the particular application. Electrolytic capacitors that are often used for filtering and bypassing capacitors do not need narrow tolerances because they are not used for accurate frequency applications, such as for oscillators.|$|E
25|$|Tantalum capacitors, {{like most}} other {{electronic}} components and if enough space is available, have imprinted markings to indicate manufacturer, type, electrical and thermal characteristics, and date of manufacture. But most tantalum capacitors are chip types so the reduced space limits the imprinted signs to <b>capacitance,</b> <b>tolerance,</b> voltage and polarity.|$|E
25|$|The {{percentage}} of allowed deviation of the capacitance from the rated value is called <b>capacitance</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The actual capacitance value must {{be within the}} tolerance limits, or the capacitor is out of specification. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a letter code for each tolerance is specified in IEC/EN 60062.|$|E

25|$|The rated {{capacitance}} {{is the value}} for which the capacitor has been designed. The actual capacitance of film capacitors depends on the measuring frequency and the ambient temperature. Standardized conditions for film capacitors are a measuring frequency of 1nbsp&kHz and a temperature of 20nbsp&°C. The percentage of allowed deviation of the capacitance from the rated value is called <b>capacitance</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The actual capacitance value of a capacitor should be within the tolerance limits, or the capacitor is out of specification.|$|E
