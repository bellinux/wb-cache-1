Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One tabloid of <b>cascara</b> <b>sagrada.</b> Life might be so. It {{did not move}} or touch him {{but it was something}} quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly season. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat certainly. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now. Begins and ends morally. Hand in hand. Smart. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cascara</b> <b>Sagrada</b> {{was used}} by Native Americans for centuries, and was {{accepted}} into medical practice in the United States in 1877, and by 1890 had replaced the berries of the European buckthorn (R. cathartica) as a commonly used laxative. It was the principal ingredient in many commercial, over-the-counter laxatives in North American pharmacies until 9 May 2002, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a final rule banning the use of aloe and <b>Cascara</b> <b>Sagrada</b> as laxative ingredients in over-the-counter drug products. Use of <b>Cascara</b> <b>Sagrada</b> {{has been associated with}} abdominal pain and diarrhea; it is also potentially carcinogenic. Another study in 1999 states it is not carcinogenic. [...] Aloe emodin one of the constituents of <b>Cascara</b> <b>Sagrada,</b> is present in Aloe Vera and may increase the carcinogenicity of some kinds of radiation, but have a marked anti-viral effect in vitro against both herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and 2.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2003 the FDA also {{responded to}} a {{petition}} (CP27) that was filed in August 2002 in which the FDA stated that [...] "the agency does not find {{that the benefits of}} using <b>cascara</b> <b>sagrada</b> laxative ingredients outweigh the risks" [...] and that the data contained in petition CP27 [...] "do not {{rule out the possibility that}} <b>cascara</b> <b>sagrada</b> preparations are genotoxic and/or carcinogenic." ...|$|E

5000|$|In July 2003, the FDA {{responded to}} a citizen's {{petition}} filed against the May 2002 final ruling banning the use of <b>cascara</b> <b>sagrada</b> in OTC laxatives [...] by the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA) and International Aloe Science Council (IASC) (June 2002, CP25) and subsequent data submissions that occurred in October 2002 (SUP14) and December 2002 (SUP15)). [...] In this letter the FDA stated that the American Herbal Products Association Botanical Safety Handbook (1997), the one cited to the FDA in CP25, contained only general information similar to information they already had in 1975. Upon further evaluation of all submitted information it found inadequate support for the petition that <b>cascara</b> <b>sagrada</b> should be {{generally recognized as safe}} and effective for OTC use as a laxative.|$|E

Sword ferns, common in the region, were picked each year by several hundred people to be processed into medicine.

It has a marked anti-viral effect in vitro against both herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and 2.|$|E
5000|$|In John Steinbeck's novel East of Eden, Kate uses it {{to murder}} Faye and inherit her whorehouse. Faye is {{poisoned}} {{with a combination of}} first strychnine (unsuccessfully) and then two drops of croton oil, on a salad of home-canned beans, mimicking accidental botulism poisoning. To allay suspicion, Kate also poisons herself with <b>cáscara</b> <b>sagrada</b> which gives the same cathartic symptoms, but to a non-fatal degree. [...] Steinbeck also alludes to croton oil in In Dubious Battle, chapter 7.|$|E
5000|$|Spanish conquerors {{exploring}} the Pacific Northwest in the 1600s came across many Native peoples using {{the bark of}} R. purshiana as a laxative. They gave it the name [...] "Sacred Bark" [...] (<b>cáscara</b> <b>sagrada)</b> in honor of its effectiveness. By 1877 the U.S. pharmaceutical company Parke-Davis was producing cascara preparations, and soon afterwards cascara products were being exported overseas to European markets. The explosion of the cascara industry caused great damage to native cascara populations during the 1900s, {{as a result of}} overharvesting.|$|E

5000|$|Standardization {{of purity}} and dosage is not {{mandated}} in the United States, but even products {{made to the}} same specification may differ {{as a result of}} biochemical variations within a species of plant. Plants have chemical defense mechanisms against predators that can have adverse or lethal effects on humans. Examples of highly toxic herbs include poison hemlock and nightshade. They are not marketed to the public as herbs, because the risks are well known, partly due to a long and colorful history in Europe, associated with [...] "sorcery", [...] "magic" [...] and intrigue. Although not frequent, adverse reactions have been reported for herbs in widespread use. On occasion serious untoward outcomes have been linked to herb consumption. A case of major potassium depletion has been attributed to chronic licorice ingestion., and consequently professional herbalists avoid the use of licorice where they recognize that this may be a risk. Black cohosh has been implicated in a case of liver failure.Few studies are available on the safety of herbs for pregnant women, and one study found that use of complementary and alternative medicines are associated with a 30% lower ongoing pregnancy and live birth rate during fertility treatment. Examples of herbal treatments with likely cause-effect relationships with adverse events include aconite, which is often a legally restricted herb, ayurvedic remedies, broom, chaparral, Chinese herb mixtures, comfrey, herbs containing certain flavonoids, germander, guar gum, liquorice root, and pennyroyal. Examples of herbs where a high degree of confidence of a risk long term adverse effects can be asserted include ginseng, which is unpopular among herbalists for this reason, the endangered herb goldenseal, milk thistle, senna, against which herbalists generally advise and rarely use, aloe vera juice, buckthorn bark and berry, <b>cascara</b> <b>sagrada</b> bark, saw palmetto, valerian, kava, which is banned in the European Union, St. John's wort, Khat, Betel nut, the restricted herb Ephedra, and Guarana.|$|E

It {{plays a key role}} not only in metabolism and disposition of exogenous toxins or therapeutic agent, but also in the biochemical reaction. Many times liver is damaged due to overdose of drugs and alcohol consumption. Chemical driven liver damage is called hepatotoxicity. Chemical agents such as synthetic (CCl 4, galactosamine, lithocholic acid and anti-tuberculosis drugs), natural (microcystins) and herbal remedies (<b>Cascara</b> <b>sagrada)</b> can also induce hepatotoxicity. Such damaged liver will lead to many pathological conditions like hepatitis, cholestasis, steatosis, granuloma etc. Hepatoprotection or antihepatotoxicity is the ability to prevent damage to the liver...|$|E
