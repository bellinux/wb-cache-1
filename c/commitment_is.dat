Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) become involved in the investigation when Mostow insists that he was possessed during the killings; his claims are given credence when another murder occurs after his arrest. Mostow draws a gargoyle and claims it made him kill. The agents meet with Patterson who has spent three years on the case. Mulder knows Patterson from his time in the Investigative Support Unit at Quantico. Their relationship is tense, and Patterson is skeptical of Mulder's theories. Mulder and Scully go to Mostow's studio and discover a hidden room full of gargoyle sculptures, finding corpses within them.|$|E

25|$|After {{evaluating}} AA's {{literature and}} observing AA meetings for sixteen months, sociologists David R. Rudy and Arthur L. Greil {{found that for}} an AA member to remain sober {{a high level of}} <b>commitment</b> <b>is</b> necessary. This <b>commitment</b> <b>is</b> facilitated by a change in the member's worldview. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of transcendence in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious worldview that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension {{is an integral part of}} AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a quasi-religious organization.|$|E

25|$|Charles Taylor, in his 2007 book A Secular Age, {{showed the}} {{historical}} role of deism, leading {{to what he}} calls an exclusive humanism. This humanism invokes a moral order, whose ontic <b>commitment</b> <b>is</b> wholly intra-human, with no reference to transcendence. One of the special achievements of such deism-based humanism is that it discloses new, anthropocentric moral sources by which human beings are motivated and empowered to accomplish acts of mutual benefit. This is the province of a buffered, disengaged self, which is the locus of dignity, freedom and discipline, and is endowed with a sense of human capability. According to Taylor, by the early 19th century this deism-mediated exclusive humanism developed as an alternative to Christian faith in a personal God and an order of miracles and mystery.|$|E

As a consequence, the broader semantics helps in modelling different types of contracts: gratuitous promises, unilateral contracts, bilateral contracts, and forward contracts. The semantics of higher-order <b>commitments</b> <b>is</b> useful in deciding whether to sign an agreement or not, due to a larger variety of protocols and contracts. ...|$|R

25|$|Drifting {{competitions}} {{are judged}} based on line, angle, speed, style and show factor. Line involves taking the correct line, {{which is usually}} announced beforehand by judges. The show factor is based on many things, such {{as the amount of}} smoke, how close the car is to the wall or designated clipping point, and the crowd's reaction. Angle is the angle of a car and more importantly the turned wheels in a drift, speed is the speed entering a turn, the speed through a turn, and the speed exiting the turn; faster is better. Style is scored on a combination of a rate-to-angle during the initiation, how fluid the car looks through the course, and how committed the driver is through the course. The rate-to-angle is how quickly during initiation or Furidashi (ÊåØ„ÇäÂá∫„Åó:starting point) and transitions or Furikaeshi (ÊåØÊõø„Åó:transfer) a car gets to its sliding angle. Fluidity is how smoothly a driver maneuvers their car around the course, taking into account the amount of correction that a driver applies through the turn(s), and the smoothness with which the car transitions from one corner to the next. <b>Commitment</b> <b>is</b> about how much throttle the driver applies, and the confidence and dedication the driver shows when approaching track edges and barriers. That is the quicker the driver is able to come to angle, the more speed and angle they can carry through the course, the fewer corrections they apply through the course and the closer they drive to the track edges or barriers, the higher the style score.|$|E
500|$|<b>Commitment</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} {{characteristic of the}} ethicist. Commitments are made by being {{an active participant in}} society, rather than a detached observer or outsider. The ethicist has a strong sense of responsibility, duty, honor and respect for his friendships, family, and career. Judge Vilhelm uses the example of marriage as an example of an ethical institution requiring strong commitment and responsibility. Whereas the aesthete would be bored by the repetitive nature of marriage (e.g. married to one person only), the ethicist believes in the necessity of self-denial (e.g. self-denying unmitigated pleasure) in order to uphold one's obligations. Kierkegaard had Judge William speak again in his 1845 book Stages on Life's Way. Here he described the enemies the single individual faces when trying to make a commitment, probability and the outcome.|$|E
