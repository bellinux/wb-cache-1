40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to present results of basic {{mechanical}} properties research of high-density polyethylene and polyamide 6 filled with two kinds of mined coal particles. Because composites with carbon are expected to poses low electric resistance also surface resistivity was measured. Design/methodology/approach: Dependences of tensile strength, elongation at break, impact strength, ball hardness and surface resistivity on volume content of mined coal in polymeric matrix are measured and discussed. Findings: Introduction of mined <b>coal</b> <b>fine</b> particles to polyethylene did not cause significant changes in tensile strength, while the same property of polyamide composites decreased significantly. Brinell ball hardness of all polyethylene and polyamide composites increased almost proportionally to coal content. Pronounced lowering of deformability (elongation at break) with increasing coal content was observed for all formulations. Also impact strength significantly decreased after mined coal filling. Significant lowering of surface resistivity was noticed especially for coal-polyamide composites. Research limitations/implications: Obtained results showed that mined <b>coal</b> <b>fine</b> particles can be applied as a filler of thermoplastic polymers but poor adhesion between polymer matrix and filler particles was achieved. Additional research on mined <b>coal</b> <b>fine</b> particles modification by coupling agents is needed to develop better adhesion. Practical implications: Obtained results showed that mined <b>coal</b> <b>fine</b> particles can be applied as a filler of thermoplastic polymers but poor adhesion between polymer matrix and filler particles was achieved.

2500|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered with the Mark I Cell was that its performance was reduced if the feed rate to the cell varied, which was a common occurrence arising from normal fluctuations in operating concentrators. This problem was resolved by recycling some of the tailings to the cell feed via an external splitter box called an [...] "External Recycle Mechanism" [...] or [...] "ERM" [...] box separate to the flotation cell. Thus, when {{the production of the}} feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased {{as a result of a}} fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence feed pressure, to the cell. This had the added benefit of giving a proportion of the tailings (typically 40%) a second pass through the system, which resulted in higher recoveries. In <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> flotation, this allowed a single Cell to achieve the same recovery of combustibles as had previously been achieved in some two-stage Cell systems.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT) The {{costs of}} {{cleaning}} <b>fine</b> <b>coal</b> are substantially {{higher than those}} of cleaning coarse coal. Therefore, many many coal companies in the U. S. choose to discard <b>fine</b> <b>coal</b> (150 micron x 0) by means of 6 -inch diameter hydrocyclones. The cyclone overflows are stored in <b>fine</b> <b>coal</b> impoundments, which create environmental concerns and represent loss of valuable national resources. The major component of the high costs of cleaning <b>fine</b> <b>coal</b> is associated with the difficulty in <b>fine</b> <b>coal</b> dewatering. Therefore, the availability of efficient of <b>fine</b> <b>coal</b> dewatering methods will greatly benefit companies In the present study, three different novel dewatering aids have been tested. These include Reagents W (RW), Reagent U (RU), and Reagent V (RV). These reagents are designed to increase the contact angles of the coal samples to be dewatered, which should help decrease the Laplace pressure of the water trapped in filter cake and, hence, increase dewatering rate. They were tested on i) the fresh coal samples from Consolidation Coal Corporation’s Buchanan Preparation Plant, ii) a composite drill core sample from the Smith Branch Impoundment, Pinnacle Mine Mining Company, and iii) a blend of coal...|$|R

50|$|Skakel {{began his}} career as a {{railroad}} shipping clerk earning $8 a week. While employed by the railroad, he noticed the price volatility of <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> for coke, which is a byproduct of producing more-in-demand forms of coal. At most times, the coal mining companies were forced to store the coke or pay to have it disposed of in rivers. Skakel came up with an idea to purchase the coke from coal companies. In May 1919, Skakel and two partners put up $1,000 and established The Great Lakes Coal & Coke Company. The company would purchase the coke from coal companies and then reprocessed the coke into clean carbon which was used to produce aluminum. By 1929, Skakel had become a multi-millionaire. The business eventually grew into The Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, which became the one of the largest privately held corporations in the United States. After Skakel's death in 1955, his sons George Jr. (who also died in a plane crash, in 1966) and James III took over the business.|$|E

50|$|Densified coal as an ostensibly ‘new’ product {{emanating from}} brown coal was first {{identified}} by Dr R.B.

The mine operator identified that hardened bitumen-like road surfaces formed naturally and spontaneously after heavy trucks churned up brown <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> with moisture from rainfall when the trucks entered and left the mine. In {{the days that followed}} a rain event the road surfaces at the mine would harden like tarmac and no longer absorb water. Dr Johns and colleagues identified a process of low-mechanical shear had occurred where brown coal mixed {{with a small amount of}} moisture and subject to low-level mechanical shear had triggered a natural exothermic reaction process within the coal leading to the expulsion of its moisture content. The process fundamentally alters the micro chemical bonds within the coal, naturally reducing moisture content to around 11 per cent; boosting calorific value over 5600 kcal/kg; and creating a new ‘densified coal’ product that is hydrophobic, no longer prone to spontaneous combustion, and readily transportable.|$|E
