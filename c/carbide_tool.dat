The coating materials studied were titanium carbonitride (TiCN), titanium nitride (TiN), chromium nitride (CrN), and titanium nitride/aluminum nitride (TiN/AlN), which were synthesized on the P 30 carbide substrate. The aim is to investigate the effect of coating materials and cutting speeds on the wear characteristics of the coated carbide tools. Cutting tests were performed when turning wood-chip cement board at cutting speeds of 30, 40, 50 and 60 m/s, a depth of cut of 1 mm, and a feed of 0.05 mm/rev.
