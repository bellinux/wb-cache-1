Subsequently, he pursued his Ph.D. work in bio{{chemistry and}} molecular {{biology at the}} Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin Dahlem in which Heinz-Günter Wittmann was department head. While determining the primary structures of several E. coli ribosomal proteins, he developed manual micro-methods for isolating peptides using two-dimensional separation on cellulose thin layer plates (instead of using a series of <b>chromatography</b> <b>columns)</b> followed by dansyl-Edman degradation. This reduced the required protein material by one to two orders of magnitude towards the 100 nMol range. This method was shortly thereafter superseded by automated protein sequencing operating in the low picoMol range.|$|E

500|$|Ribonucleases (or RNases) are {{enzymes that}} {{catalyze}} the hydrolysis of ribonucleic acid (RNA), and collectively {{they play a}} critical role in many biological processes. A RNase from R.virescens was shown to be biochemically unique amongst seven edible mushroom species in several ways: it has a co-specificity towards cleaving RNA at poly A and poly C, compared to the monospecific RNases of the others; it can be adsorbed on <b>chromatography</b> <b>columns</b> containing DEAE–cellulose as the adsorbent; it has a pH optimum of 4.5, lower than all other species; and, it has a [...] "distinctly different" [...] N-terminal amino acid sequence. The mushroom contains a unique laccase enzyme that can break down several dyes used in the laboratory and in the textile industry, such as [...] bromothymol blue, eriochrome black T, malachite green, and reactive brilliant blue. Laccases are being used increasingly in the textile industry as environmental biocatalysts for the treatment of dye wastewater.|$|E
2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of capillary electrophoresis separations is typically {{much higher than}} the {{efficiency of}} other separation techniques like HPLC. [...] Unlike HPLC, in capillary electrophoresis there is no mass transfer between phases. [...] In addition, the flow profile in EOF-driven systems is flat, rather than the rounded laminar flow profile characteristic of the pressure-driven flow in <b>chromatography</b> <b>columns</b> as shown in figure 5. As a result, EOF does not significantly contribute to band broadening as in pressure-driven chromatography. [...] Capillary electrophoresis separations can have several hundred thousand theoretical plates.|$|E
2500|$|In HPLC, {{typically}} 20 μl of {{the sample}} of interest are injected into the mobile phase stream delivered by a high pressure pump. The mobile phase containing the analytes permeates through the stationary phase bed in a definite direction.The components of the mixture are separated depending on their chemical affinity with the mobile and stationary phases. The separation occurs after repeated sorption and desorption steps occurring when the liquid interacts with the stationary bed. The liquid solvent (mobile phase) is delivered under high pressure (up to 400 bar or 300.000 torr) into a packed column containing the stationary phase. The high pressure is necessary to achieve a constant flow rate for reproducible chromatography experiments. Depending on the partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, the components {{of the sample}} will flow out of the column at different times. The column is the most important component of the LC system and is designed to withstand the high pressure of the liquid. Conventional LC columns [...] are 100–300mm long with outer diameter of 6.4mm (1/4 inch) and internal diameter of 3.0-4.6mm. [...] For applications involving LC-MS, the length of <b>chromatography</b> <b>columns</b> can be shorter (30–50mm) with 3-5 μm diameter packing particles. In addition to the conventional model, other LC columns are the narrowbore, microbore, microcapillary, and nano-LC models. These columns have smaller internal diameters, allow for a more efficient separation, and handle liquid flows under 1 ml/ min (the conventional flow-rate). [...] In order to improve separation efficiency and peak resolution, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) can be used instead of HPLC. This LC variant uses columns packed with [...] smaller silica particles (~1.7 μm diameter) and requires higher operating pressures in the range of 310.000 to 775.000 torr (6000 to 15000 psi).|$|E

2500|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} (ESI) is {{a technique}} that involves using high voltages to create an electrospray, or a fine aerosol created by the high voltages. ESI sample preparation can be very important {{and the quality of}} results can be heavily determined by the characteristics of the sample. ESI experiments can be run on-line or off-line. In on-line measurements the mass spectrometer is connected to a liquid chromatograph and as the samples are separated they are ionized into the mass spectrometer by the ESI system; sample preparation is actually performed before the LC separation. In off-line measurements, the analyte solution is applied directly to the mass spectrometer by a spray capillary [...] Off-line sample preparation has many considerations, such as the fact that the capillary used allows for the application of volumes in the nanoliter range, which can contain a concentration too small for analysis of many compounds, such as proteins. An additional problem can be loss of ESI signal due to interference between the analyte sample and background components. Unfortunately, {{it has been shown that}} sample preparation itself can only slightly alleviate this problem which is due more to the nature of the analyte itself than the preparation. In ESI the principle problem comes not from reactions in the gas phase but rather from problems involving the solution phase of the droplets themselves. Issues can be due to non-volatile substances remaining in the drops, which can change the efficiency of droplet formation or droplet evaporation, which in turn affects the amount of charged ions in the gas phase that ultimately reach the mass spectrometer. These problems can be fixed in multiple ways, including increasing the amount of concentration of analyte compared to matrix in the sample solution or by running the sample through a more extensive chromatographic technique before analysis. An example of a chromatographic technique that can aid in signal in ESI involves using 2-D liquid chromatography, or running the sample through two separate <b>chromatography</b> <b>columns,</b> giving better separation of the analyte from the matrix.|$|E
