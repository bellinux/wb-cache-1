40|$|The {{process of}} {{negotiating}} <b>common</b> <b>access</b> states in dynamic coalitions that comprise tens of autonomous domains sharing hundreds of resources is time-consuming and error-prone if performed {{without the benefit}} of automated tools. This process is also repetitive since, during the lifetime of a dynamic coalition, member domains must undertake the task of negotiating <b>common</b> <b>access</b> states multiple times as domains leave and new ones join the coalition. To define and verify the correctness of tools for automated negotiation, we develop a formal state-transition model of the process of negotiating a <b>common</b> <b>access</b> state. We extend an existing Role Based Access Control (RBAC) language to illustrate a wide variety of negotiation constraints and present a resolution procedure for verifying the satisfaction of such constraints in the state-transition model...|$|R
