40|$|Detecting local {{adaptation}} and its spatial scale {{is one of}} the most important questions of evolutionary biology. However, recognition of the effect of local selection can be challenging when there is considerable environmental variation across the distance at the whole species range. We analyzed patterns of local adaptation in emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, at two spatial scales, small (inter-population distance less than one km) and large (inter-population distance more than 50 km) using several approaches. Plants originating from four distinct habitats at two geographic scales (<b>cold</b> <b>edge,</b> arid edge and two topographically dissimilar core locations) were reciprocally transplanted and their success over time was measured as 1) lifetime fitness in a year of planting, and 2) population growth four years after planting. In addition, we analyzed molecular (SSR) and quantitative trait variation and calculated the QST/FST ratio. No home advantage was detected at the small spatial scale. At the large spatial scale, home advantage was detected for the core population and the <b>cold</b> <b>edge</b> population in the year of introduction via measuring life-time plant performance. However, superior performance of the arid edge population in its own environment was evident only after several generations via measuring experimental population growth rate through genotyping with SSRs allowing counting the number of plants and seeds per introduced genotype per site. These results highlight the importance of multi-generation surveys of population growth rate in local adaptation testing. Despite predominant self-fertilization of T. dicoccoides and the associated high degree of structuring of genetic variation, the results of the QST - FST comparison were in general agreement with the pattern of local adaptation at the two spatial scales detected by reciprocal transplanting...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{technique}} for reducing the overhead of collecting path profiles {{in the context of}} a dynamic optimizer. The key idea to our approach, called Targeted Path Profiling (TPP), is to use an edge profile to simplify the collection of a path profile. This notion of profileguided profiling is a natural fit for dynamic optimizers, which typically optimize the code in a series of stages. TPP is an extension to the Ball-Larus Efficient Path Profiling algorithm. Its increased efficiency comes from two sources: (i) reducing the number of potential paths by not enumerating paths with <b>cold</b> <b>edges,</b> allowing array accesses to be substituted for more expensive hash table lookups, and (ii) not instrumenting regions where paths can be unambiguously derived from an edge profile. Our results suggest that on average the overhead of profile collection can be reduced by half (SPEC 95) to almost two-thirds (SPEC 2000) relative to the Ball-Larus algorithm with minimal impact on the information collected. 1...|$|R

40|$|In present fusion devices, the H-mode is {{the most}} {{promising}} operational regime. It {{is characterized by a}} very hot core and a much <b>colder</b> <b>edge.</b> This is due to the presence of an edge transport barrier. In this thin zone located {{at the edge of the}} plasma, the turbulent flux is strongly reduced. However, this barrier is unstable and exhibits quasi-periodic relaxation oscillations. In this work, we study the control of these relaxations by resonant magnetic perturbations. We perform 3 D turbulence simulations to investigate the influence of these magnetic perturbations (MP) on the barrier relaxations. In particular, we present two configurations created respectively by a multiple harmonic MP and a single harmonic MP. We find that stabilization of the relaxation oscillations can be achieved with both single and multiple harmonic MP. However, with the single harmonic MP, the energy confinement is always degraded whereas with the multiple harmonic MP, the confinement can be maintained.

Furthermore, confining the flow with a constant pressure wall, or impressing a favorable pressure gradient on the coaxial flow, acts to reduce the severity of the centerline adverse pressure gradient created by the swirl decay. A simple scalar eddy viscosity model, including a potential core formulation, is shown to described the behavior of weak swirling flow in the far region but is only in fair agreement with observations in the near region. The effects of swirl on a burning hydrocarbon jet exhausting into a cold coaxial stream are shown to be intensified by the reduction of the density due to combustion.

50|$|The final {{piece of}} the puzzle, thermal transpiration, was theorized by Osborne Reynolds in an {{unpublished}} paper that was refereed by Maxwell, who then published his own paper which contained {{a critique of the}} mathematics in Reynolds's unpublished paper. Maxwell died that year and the Royal Society refused to publish Reynolds's critique of Maxwell's rebuttal to Reynolds's unpublished paper, as it was felt that this would be an inappropriate argument when one of the people involved had already died. Reynolds found that if a porous plate is kept hotter on one side than the other, the interactions between gas molecules and the plates are such that gas will flow through from the cooler to the hotter side. The vanes of a typical Crookes radiometer are not porous, but the space past their edges behaves like the pores in Reynolds's plate. On average, the gas molecules move from the cold side toward the hot side whenever the pressure ratio is less than the square root of the (absolute) temperature ratio. The pressure difference causes the vane to move, cold (white) side forward due to the tangential force of the movement of the rarefied gas moving from the <b>colder</b> <b>edge</b> to the hotter edge.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA 2 -D {{rectangular}} cavity {{subject to}} a horizontal temperature gradient imposed on its upper boundary induces a naturally convective flow, leading to two surprising results. First, at large Rayleigh numbers (Ra) two boundary layers appear driving the flow {{in such a way}} that heat is removed from the cold part of the fluid and released into the hot region of the fluid, generating a dynamical ''heat pump''. Second, a narrow region of pulsating oscillatory flow appears in the vicinity of the boundary layer which is at the vertical wall adjoining the <b>cold</b> <b>edge</b> of the upper boundary. These pulsations occur when Ra exceeds a critical value, Rac, and are associated with large downward and upward vertical flows that appear simultaneously near this vertical wall. The rest of the cavity is principally a ''dead'' cold region with weak flows. This region is the heat source of the heat pump. It occupies the main part of the cavity which progressively gets colder while the horizontal thermal boundary layer progressively gets hotter with increasing Ra. We explain the physics of these phenomena via numerical calculations that employ a spectral Chebyshev method. It is shown, for the first time, that the curve of Rac versus the aspect ratio is non-monotonic. It is also shown that the fundamental frequency of the oscillations, x, increases monotonically with the aspect ratio o...|$|R

40|$|In June 1987 the geostropic flow in {{the coastal}} {{transition}} zone off northern California (between 50 and 150 km off the coast from Point Reyes to just north of Cape Mendocino) was dominated by a well-defined, southward-meandering current. Three vertical sections are presented that show the hydrographic structure of the current down to 100 m {{and its relationship to}} the distribution of phytoplankton biomass. The sections show that the geostrophic adjustment brought cold, saline, deep water up to the surface on the low steric height, or cold side of the flow, and that this upwelled water supported a relatively large diatom biomass (chlorophyll-a concentrations between 1 and 10 mg m- 3). We present particle size spectra and photomicrographs of the phytoplankton that show that the diatom biomass was dominated by chain-forming species (e. g., Skeletonema costatum, Chaetoceros spp., Thalassiosira spp., and Rhizosolenia alata, but also a single-celled Actinocyclus sp.). Photosynthetic light response measurements reveal that these diatom communities were capable of high photosynthetic rates (Pmax between 5 and 25 mg C mg Chla- 1 h- 1). Although most of the diatoms were located in cold, slow-moving water on the low side of the current, some were being carried downstream.

40|$|Temperature is {{the most}} {{important}} factor driving the <b>cold</b> <b>edge</b> distribution limit of temperate trees. Here, we identified the minimum temperatures for root growth in seven broad-leaved tree species, compared them with the species’ natural elevational limits and identified morphological changes in roots produced near their physiological cold limit. Seedlings were exposed to a vertical soil-temperature gradient from 20 to 2 °C along the rooting zone for 18 weeks. In all species, the bulk of roots was produced at temperatures above 5 °C. However, the absolute minimum temperatures for root growth differed among species between 2. 3 and 4. 2 °C, with those species that reach their natural distribution limits at higher elevations also tending to have lower thermal limits for root tissue formation. In all investigated species, the roots produced at temperatures close to the thermal limit were pale, thick, unbranched and of reduced mechanical strength. Across species, the specific root length (m g− 1 root) was reduced by, on average, 60 % at temperatures below 7 °C. A significant correlation of minimum temperatures for root growth with the natural high elevation limits of the investigated species indicates species-specific ther- mal requirements for basic physiological processes. Although these limits are not necessarily directly causative for the upper distribution limit of a species, they seem to belong to a syndrome of adaptive processes for life at low temperatures. The anatomical changes at the cold limit likely hint at the mechanisms impeding meristematic activity at low temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Superthermal E ×B {{rotation}} {{can provide}} magne-tohydrodynamic stability and enhanced confinement to axisym-metric mirrors. However, the rotation speed {{has been limited}} by phenomena at end electrodes. A new prediction is that rotation might instead be produced using a magnetic ripple and alpha particle kinetic energy, in {{an extension of the}} alpha channeling concept. The interaction of alpha particles with the ripple results in visually interesting and practically useful orbits. Index Terms—Magnetic confinement, plasma devices, plasma simulation, plasma waves. AXISYMMETRIC mirrors have many potential advantagesas fusion reactors including high beta, steady-state op-eration, and a simple coil configuration [1]. The major issues that must be overcome by axisymmetric mirrors are magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) stability and excessive parallel energy loss. Both of these may be addressed by inducing superthermal E ×B rotation, which provides MHD stability through veloc-ity shear and increases axial confinement by the centrifugal force [2]–[4]. In past experiments, the rotation has been pro-duced by electrodes in the mirror throat, and these electrodes limited the rotation speed to the Alfven critical ionization velocity (CIV) [2], [5], [6]. However, rotation might best be produced by waves rather than electrodes, allowing the CIV limit to be overcome [7]. The method of driving rotation with waves is an extension of the alpha channeling effect in tokamaks [8]. In alpha channel-ing, waves are injected which create a diffusion path connecting the hot core of the plasma to the <b>cold</b> <b>edge.</b> That is, there is coupled diffusion in energy and position. As alpha particles interact with the wave, they diffuse radially and may eventually exit at the outer edge. Because the radial diffusion is related to diffusion in energy by the wave properties, alpha particles can be made to exit at low energy, transferring their energy to the wave. The wave energy can then be used for heating ions or other purposes [9]...|$|R
40|$|Studies of MORB {{have shown}} that the oceanic upper mantle is heterogeneuos. The nature, {{distribution}} and scale of these heterogeneities are still a matter of debate. Short-wavelength chemical variability has been observed along mid-ocean ridges. Melt inclusions show isotopic and chemical variabilty within a single basalt sample and even within a single olivine grain. The distance along axis affected by the ridge-transform intersection (RTI) <b>cold</b> <b>edge</b> effect is proportional to slip rate and offset length. Numerical calculations show a strong decrease of crustal production as a ridge approaches a transform. When the amount of melt produced is small, the capability of melt to aggregate and to mix in magma chambers {{on the way to the}} surface is low; therefore, the chemical and isotopic signatures of preaggregated melts can be detected. These predictions make long-offset RTI's potential areas to detect chemical variability in the mantle through the study of MORB. Basalts sampled in the equatorial Atlantic along a ridge segment south of the Romanche RTI (ERRS), show an increase in trace element variability within a single dredge haul, with wavelengths comparable to that observed in suites of melt inclusions. This variability implies that melt transport beneath the ERRS is inefficient at mixing melts and suggests melt transport in channelized systems that limit interaction between melt and solid. The correlation between trace element and isotopic enrichement suggests that most of the chemical variability is probably due to source heterogeneity. Melt transport preserves correlations present in the source, suggesting channels nucleation in the deepest part of the molten region just within melting heterogeneities. Correlations will be probably destroyed if channel networks cross source heterogeneities.

40|$|Lower hybrid (LH) {{waves in}} the {{frequency}} range 1 to 10  GHz are used to heat and to drive current in a tokamak. A crucial issue for the future devices is the coupling of the wave power from the launching structure, the grill, to the plasma. A related problem is the formation of hot spots on the grill limiters and other components that are magnetically connected to the grill region. A probable explanation for these asymmetric heat loads is the parasitic absorption of the LH power. In parasitic absorption, the short-wavelength modes are absorbed by electrons within a very short distance {{in front of the}} grill. The <b>cold</b> <b>edge</b> electrons (Te ∼  25  eV) may reach energies up to 2  keV through stochastic acceleration in the electric field in front of the lower hybrid grill. The particle-in-cell (PIC) technique {{is one of the most}} popular methods of kinetic simulations of plasmas. In PIC codes, a spatial grid is used to describe the field quantities, while the particles move in the continuous space. The field and particle motion are solved self-consistently. The advantage of the PIC codes is that they take into account the kinetic effects and the non-linearities of the problem. They also give the deposition profiles unlike pure test particle simulations. In this thesis, the use of PIC codes has been extended to a whole new branch of applications, the near-field of the LH grill. During the work, the grill model used in the electrostatic PIC code has been developed. The parasitic absorption and the generation of fast electrons in front of the waveguide mouth have been explored. The absorption and the heat load on the grill limiter increases with the edge density, the edge temperature and the launched power density. A weak indication of a power threshold was observed. The simulation results can explain experimental observations in Tore Supra.

The present work explores the applicability of damage mechanics models to this problem. In conjunction with a plausible failure criterion the Gologanu-Leblond model, which is based on non-spherical ductile void growth, is able to predict edge cracking and the characteristic zigzag damage pattern {{on the edge of the}} rolled sheet. The experimental determination of the model parameters remains a challenging task, since the stress and strain history at the edge of a rolled sheet is substantially different from the situation in a tensile test, and also from that in other conventional laboratory tests...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} aims at {{providing}} {{a complete picture}} of the various propagation scenarios that a statistically stationary turbulent premixed flame may possibly undergo. By explicitly splitting the scalar turbulent flux between its gradient and counter-gradient contributions, the scalar governing equation is rewritten as an ordinary differential equation in the phase space. Then, {{an analysis of the}} characteristic equations {{in the vicinity of the}} reactants and products side is carried out. The domain of existence of the propagation velocity is then determined and positioned over the relevant Bray number range. It is shown in particular that when a counter-gradient transport at the <b>cold</b> leading <b>edge</b> of the flame is dominant, there still exists a possibility of observing a steady regime of propagation. This conclusion is compatible with recent experimental data and observations based on the analysis of direct numerical simulations. © 2011 V. A. Sabel'nikov and P. Bruel...|$|R
5000|$|The Patriots and Panthers both {{played against}} the AFC South and NFC East {{in the regular}} season. The Patriots lost to the Washington Redskins 20-17 in Week Four but swept {{the rest of the}} NFC East and the entire AFC South; the Patriots shut out Dallas in bitter <b>cold</b> and <b>edged</b> the Giants in the rain while {{hammering}} Philly following the infamously erroneous [...] "They hate their coach" [...] quote from Tom Jackson; the Patriots also edged the Titans, Houston in overtime, and former division rival Indianapolis in shootouts while routing Jacksonville (which, like Carolina, had entered the NFL in 1995) in the regular season, and then edged the Titans and hammered the Colts in the playoffs. The Panthers had less success, going 6-4 against the two divisions, losing to the Titans and Houston while defeating Jacksonville and the Colts, and defeating Washington and the Giants while losing to Philadelphia and Dallas in the regular season, then routing the Cowboys and edging the Eagles in the playoffs.|$|R
