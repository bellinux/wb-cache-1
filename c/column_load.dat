50|$|As the {{axial load}} on a {{perfectly}} straight slender column with elastic material properties is increased in magnitude, this ideal column passes through three states: stable equilibrium, neutral equilibrium, and instability. The straight column under load is in stable equilibrium if a lateral force, applied {{between the two}} ends of the column, produces a small lateral deflection which disappears and the column returns to its straight form when the lateral force is removed. If the <b>column</b> <b>load</b> is gradually increased, a condition is reached in which the straight form of equilibrium becomes so-called neutral equilibrium, and a small lateral force will produce a deflection that does not disappear and the column remains in this slightly bent form when the lateral force is removed. The load at which neutral equilibrium of a column is reached is called the critical or buckling load. The state of instability is reached when a slight increase of the <b>column</b> <b>load</b> causes uncontrollably growing lateral deflections leading to complete collapse.|$|E

Such joints may develop different potential failure modes such as crushing of the concrete of the slab (due to <b>column</b> <b>loading),</b> bending or punching shear failures (due to slab loading). The paper {{presents the results of}} a test series on 9 full-scale slabs (250 mm thick) loaded to simulate simultaneously <b>column</b> and slab <b>loading.</b> The ratio between the loads was varied from moderate to fairly large <b>column</b> <b>loading.</b> The experimental results confirm a strong interaction between <b>column</b> and slab <b>loads</b> with unexpected increases on the punching shear strength as <b>column</b> <b>loads</b> are larger than the uniaxial compressive strength of the slab.

40|$|AbstractPractical {{effects of}} advance {{chromatin}} removal on performance of protein A affinity chromatography were evaluated using a caprylic acid-allantoin-based extraction method. Lacking this treatment, {{the practice of}} increasing loading residence time to increase capacity was shown to increase host protein contamination of the eluted IgG. Advance chromatin extraction suspended that compromise. Protein A ligand leakage from <b>columns</b> <b>loaded</b> with chromatin-extracted harvest was half the level observed on protein A <b>columns</b> <b>loaded</b> with non-extracted harvest. <b>Columns</b> <b>loaded</b> with chromatin-extracted harvest were cleaned more effectively by 50 – 100 mM NaOH than <b>columns</b> <b>loaded</b> with non-extracted harvest that were cleaned with 250 – 500 mM NaOH. Two protein A media with IgG capacities in excess of 50 g/L were loaded with chromatin-extracted harvest, washed with 2. 0 M NaCl before elution, and the eluted IgG fraction titrated to pH 5. 5 before microfiltration. Host protein contamination in the filtrate was reduced to < 1 ppm, DNA to < 1 ppb, protein A leakage to 0. 5 ppm, and aggregates to 1. 0 %. Caprylic acid and allantoin were both reduced below 5 ppm. Step recovery of IgG was 99. 4 %. Addition of a single polishing step reduced residual protein A beneath the level of detection and aggregates to < 0. 1 %. Overall process recovery including chromatin extraction was 90 %...|$|R
50|$|The PLGen module {{stands for}} the virtual model {{generator}} or the pre-processor of the PLPAK. It mainly changes any structural drawing to {{what is called the}} “virtual model”. Modeller can import structural drawings from DXF CAD files or can draw then directly using the CAD capabilities of the PLGen. The virtual model looks very similar to the original structural drawing. The PLGen mainly define the structure using series of objects. These objects are classified into one of three categories: the geometrical objects (single slab and openings), the loading objects (<b>column</b> <b>load,</b> wall load, load patch, load assembly) and the supporting objects (column, wall, wall assembly, soil support, beam). Using such objects the modeler can define all elements in the building slab. It has to be noted that the virtual model represents the actual slab shape (not like the centre-line model of the finite element method). Columns and walls are represented by the actual cross section shape. The PLGen can also input the numerical models of each object such as the number of boundary elements for each segments, the discretization of the beam-slab contact areas, etc. Load cases only (i.e. no load combinations) are defined in the PLGen module. Material properties are also defined herein. The below Figure demonstrates the graphical user interface of the PLGen module.|$|E

The short columns with square section were cyclically deflected along their principal axes and their diagonals to produce biaxial bending-shear under uniaxial loadings. The results from 10 tests were considered.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} high strength concrete to concrete-encased composite frame building based on an experimental program. The work emphasized joints behavior under reverse cyclic loading caused by earthquakes to provide information for seismic design. To investigate the internal mechanisms and seismic performance, cyclic loading tests were carried out on five half-scale interior joints. Two design variables were addressed in the research: concrete strength and axial <b>column</b> <b>load.</b> Frame joints performance including crack pattern, failure mode, deformation, ductility, strain distribution, and energy dissipation capacity was investigated. It was found that all joint specimens behaved in a manner with joint panel shear failure. Using high strength concrete increased the joint strength and had relatively {{little effect on the}} stiffness and ductility. The axial <b>column</b> <b>load</b> helped the joint strength by better mobilizing the outer part of the joint, but it had an obvious influence on the ductility and energy-dissipating capacity, which can be improved by providing enough transverse reinforcement. A typical crack pattern was also provided which can well reflect mechanical character and damage process. This research should contribute to the future engineering applications of high strength concrete to concrete-encased composite structure...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Structural <b>column</b> <b>loads</b> are {{supported}} by either shallow spread footings or deep foundations. While design analyses should always avoid a catastrophic or bearing capacity failure, {{it is usually the}} unsatis-factory performance due to excessive settlement that controls the design. <b>Column</b> <b>loads</b> and subsurface condi-tions can vary across the project’s site. Often engineers recommend a general bearing pressure for spread footings or a constant tip elevation for deep foundations based on what they consider to be the worst-case scenario. Ironically, while they think that they are being safe, the over designed foundations will have mini-mal settlement, while the “worst case scenario ” foundations may settle the amount predicted by the engineers. With this design approach, differential settlement occurs. Over designed foundations provide poorer perform-ance and cost more. The approach presented here requires that the foundations for each column be individu-ally designed based on the load and subsurface conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|Disproportionate {{collapse}} {{occurs when}} the removal of load bearing members (one or more <b>columns,</b> or <b>load</b> bearing walls) causes localized structural damage which leads to further loss of load bearing members and, ultimately, {{to the collapse of}} whole or part of the structure. The accidental load, carried by the removed column can be transferred to nearby columns either by beam action or by catenary action. Simple connections such as fin plate, double angle web cleat and flexible end plate connections are routinely assumed to be com-pliant with the tying force design method, which aims to ensure that <b>column</b> <b>loads</b> are redistributed via cate-nary action in the event of damage. This is feasible only if the joints have sufficient ductility as well as tensile strength. Semi-rigid and rigid connections redistribute the <b>column</b> <b>loads</b> through beam action, provided that the connections have sufficient rotation capacity. This investigation demonstrates that the beam-column joints (simple and semi-rigid connections) in many designs have insufficient ductility to successfully bridge dam-aged columns. In simple (nominally pinned) connections, a couple can develop between beam flange and col-umn due to insufficient joint ductility. The resulting prying action is shown to cause early joint fracture and subsequently to lead to progressive failure. In semi-rigid connections, the beam remains elastic and the con-nections plastify, leading to early joint failure...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{approach to}} simulate the staged failure mechanism of corrosion-affected beam-column subjected to ultimate or seismic load using a simplified, non-linear, finite element model is proposed. The instantaneous axial and flexural rigidities at the sectional level are transferred to the element level, establishing the instantaneous structure stiffness at each load step. The approach efficiency and accuracy are verified through comparison with available experimental and analytical results. The proposed approach is numerically stable in all studied cases. It is found that the staged failure mechanism of the columns subjected to quasi-static load and cyclic load up to failure can be simulated with high accuracy. It is also found that corrosion-induced damage results in a large drop of the <b>column</b> <b>load</b> and displacement capacities, and a large shrinkage in the hysteretic relationship, which indicates similar drop in the energy absorption capacities of the beam-columns.
