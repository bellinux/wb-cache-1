5|$|After he was {{released}} from active duty, Basilone returned home and worked as a truck driver in Reisterstown, Maryland. After driving trucks for a few months, he {{wanted to go back to}} Manila and believed he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> there faster by serving in the Marines than in the Army.|$|E
5|$|But at {{that same}} moment this thought came into my mind. Don't let me find him! If only I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> rid of this dead weight, so that I could use all my {{strength}} to struggle for my own survival, and only worry about myself. Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.|$|E
60|$|Then {{began the}} descent. The morning star was setting, the east grew grey with light. Oh! <b>could</b> we <b>get</b> {{there before the}} dawn? <b>Could</b> we <b>get</b> there before the dawn? That is what my horse's hoofs beat out to me.|$|R

5|$|His serious remarks <b>could</b> <b>get</b> him {{in trouble}} as well. Some of his public utterances in 1913, {{in which he}} {{appeared}} to advocate radical ideas {{in regard to the}} inheritance of property, caused much criticism.|$|E
5|$|Hornsby {{was born}} in Winters, Texas, the last of Ed and Mary (Rogers) Hornsby's six children. When Hornsby was two years old, his father died of unknown causes. Four years later, the {{surviving}} Hornsbys moved to Fort Worth, Texas, so Hornsby's brothers <b>could</b> <b>get</b> jobs in the meat packing industry to support the family.|$|E
25|$|With {{significantly}} less {{money to go}} around, businessmen <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> new loans and <b>could</b> not even <b>get</b> their old loans renewed, forcing many to stop investing. This interpretation blames the Federal Reserve for inaction, especially the New York Branch.|$|R

5|$|In court Denning {{preferred}} to let counsel talk on {{for as long}} as they wanted to so that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a grasp of the situation without wading through irrelevant court papers; to prevent them going on too long he sat quietly and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the railroad in St. Louis helped spread the fortune and initialize much of this industrial success. With {{the completion of the}} Municipal Railroad System, St. Louis' manufacturers <b>could</b> <b>get</b> their products to consumers on the East Coast much faster than before.|$|E
5|$|Ale were {{believed}} {{to be able to make}} men insane; in eastern Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan. When people encountered an ala on a road or field, they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E
2500|$|During the Mongol Invasion of Hungary (1241–1242), {{the invaders}} <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> {{close to the}} castle: Kadan ruled Mongol warriors <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> through the {{surrounding}} marshes because of flooding caused by melting [...] snow. In the 13th–15th centuries, the town prospered, and several palaces were built. In the 14th century, Székesfehérvár was surrounded by city walls.|$|R
60|$|This, with a shot-gun, I {{positively}} {{declined to}} do. Even if I {{had had a}} rifle, I suggested that she might swerve. For a few moments we remained nonplussed. I <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> to Euphemia at all, and she <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> to me unless she released her bird, and this she {{was determined not to}} do.|$|R

5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age. The usage of {{juvenile}} soldiers was not rare in World War I; {{children of the}} time were under the absolute authority of adults and generally were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the military leaders took whoever they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> their hands on, at the less organised start of the war. In the Red Guards there was the chance for salary and food.|$|E
5|$|Golem Arcana was {{announced}} in July 2013 in a blog post on developer Harebrained Schemes' website. The blog post indicated that the studio would return to Kickstarter to fund the game, and {{that most of the}} studio's staff would continue to work on their other project, Shadowrun Returns, while a few would be split off to work on Golem Arcana. The Kickstarter campaign was launched on 10 September 2013 and ran until 15 October 2013, with a funding goal of $500,000. Backers <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the base game by pledging at the $55 Kickstarter reward tier.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield then {{enrolled}} at Stanford University, where he obtained a master's degree {{in political science}} in 1948. He returned to Salem and Willamette after Stanford and began working as {{an assistant professor in}} political science.

5|$|In addition, {{some circles}} within the US State Department viewed Arafat as an able diplomat and {{negotiator}} who <b>could</b> <b>get</b> support from many Arab governments at once. An example of that, {{we find in}} March 1973 that Arafat tried to arrange for a meeting between the President of Iraq and the Emir of Kuwait in order to resolve their disputes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Leonard, Raj, and Howard {{attempt to}} solve their Comic-Con problem by {{illegally}} buying scalped tickets. After arranging for a scalper to come to Leonard's apartment, they begin to get worried, remembering Sheldon's warning that they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> charged for petty theft, then have to disclose the crime in the future. When the scalper is heard arriving, they quickly turn off the lights and stay silent.|$|E
5|$|Nevada was refloated on 12 February 1942 and {{underwent}} temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor so she <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to Puget Sound Navy Yard for a {{major overhaul}} and modernization. This was completed in October 1942, and it changed the old battleship's appearance so she slightly resembled a South Dakota from a distance. Her 5"/51s and 5"/25s were replaced with sixteen 5"/38 caliber guns in new twin mounts. Nevada then sailed for Alaska, where she provided fire support from 11–18 May 1943 for the capture of Attu.|$|E

5|$|Other risks {{associated}} with the crinoline were that it <b>could</b> <b>get</b> caught in other people's feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or be caught by sudden gusts of wind, blowing the wearer off their feet. In 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, caught her hoop while climbing over a stile, and was left with the entirety of her crinoline and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the game's {{mechanisms}} for contacting players grew more complex. Players were sent messages via email, called on their cell phones, and travelled to arranged meetings between players and characters. The game culminated by inviting {{players of the}} game to visit one of four cinemas where they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{a chance to play}} Halo 2 before its release and collect a commemorative DVD.|$|E
5|$|Paulet was {{something}} of an eccentric. On one occasion, while his ship was moored at Spithead, he asked his admiral for permission to take leave to visit London. This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> in his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart {{and went off to}} London anyway.|$|E
