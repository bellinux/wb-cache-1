30|$|While {{enforceability}} and latitude {{concern the}} power boundaries of meta-organizations, information access and fast decision making, as further attributes of arbitration governance, are decisive for establishing {{the boundary of}} competence of a meta-organization (Santos and Eisenhardt 2005). Regarding the access to business information, arbitration reflects the attributes of {{a board of directors}} rather than of ordinary courts. The board of directors of a <b>classical</b> <b>organization</b> usually consists of managers with expertise in the industry of the organization, who are able to evaluate business-related information while judges in ordinary courts are legal experts. Expertise in the meta-organization’s industry provides arbitrators with the competence to assess business-related information more accurately than only legal expertise would permit. Moreover, because of the confidentiality of arbitration the parties are able to share trade secrets and to use them for their argumentation. In front of an ordinary court this information, in contrast, cannot be presented as evidence since this would endanger the meta-organization’s trade secrets. Therefore, the information competences of an arbitrator are quite similar to those of internal governance institutions, such as the board of directors. On the other hand, just like a public court the arbitrator has no direct control over the intellectual property rights of a meta-organization. That is different from a <b>classical</b> <b>organization,</b> where the board has not only access to all kinds of information but also may execute the residual right of control on pieces of information which are vested in patents, trademarks and the like.|$|E

30|$|This dispute {{resolution}} requires two attributes to be feasible. Firstly, {{decisions of the}} arbitrator must be enforceable, comparable {{to the board of}} directors of a <b>classical</b> <b>organization.</b> An arbitration court, as an example, issues an award that is enforceable in ordinary court according to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Rewards (“New York Convention” from 1958). Secondly, the arbitrator must be able to observe internal information of the meta-organization, such as the members’ effort levels. If this is not the case, the third party has not the necessary information to reach an appropriate decision. If these two characteristics are met by the arbitrator, then he is able to resolve conflicts within the meta-organization by issuing a binding decision award.|$|E

30|$|Not {{only is the}} meta-organization free {{to choose}} the desired dispute {{resolution}} but also the appointed arbitrator has ample leeway. This latitude in the decision-making allows the arbitrator to decide in favor of what he believes are the business interests of the meta-organization. In an analogous manner {{the board of directors}} in a <b>classical</b> <b>organization</b> is only bound by basic internal rules and the rather fundamental rules of corporate law. The business judgment rule gives the board considerable discretion in defining the business strategy and hence preserving the organization’s sphere of influence over time. In this respect, the latitude attribute indicates that arbitration lies within the power boundaries of meta-organizations and hence is a central element of the organizational architecture.|$|E

This brief overview argues that <b>classical</b> <b>organization</b> theory 1 has much to offer, although the role of organizations in natural resource and environmental management raise peculiar issues of time-horizon problems and complexity issues for which organization theory has not been systematically applied. Six specific problems are the targets for explanation: 1. Doctrine truncation. Policies and practices are often guided by decision rules that deviate from the balanced approach needed to pursue sustainable development, defining this term as the simultaneous pursuit of inter-generational equity, intra-generational equity, and respect for natural systems.

Three characteristics of such a process of inquiry are proposed as requirements for the resolution of mutual inhibition: social context, setting and proximity.

On the other hand, it seems that consultants are being placed under increasing pressure with regard to the effectiveness of their work. Smoothing the consultant-client interface (CCI) is suggested as a way to improve consultants' performance. This paper considers CCI dynamics from four different theoretical perspectives: <b>Classical</b> <b>Organization</b> Theories, Human Resource and Sociological Theories, New Institutional Economic Theories and System Theories. Their general theoretical concepts are first applied to CCI and then, on this basis, practical approaches to smooth CCI friction are elaborated. Taken as a whole, these different perspectives are intended to offer a range of alternative approaches - which it may then be possibly to integrate - to provide an orientation on how to act at the hot spot of management consulting...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the interplay between {{multiple}} modes of valuation. The paper engages {{with the question of}} how a valuation device intersects with the working values of an organization. While the many studies of valuation practices have drawn attention to the pervasive effects of valuation devices, only a few studies have taken into account the fact that many spaces, including organizations, are already filled with practices and ideas that constitute what is valuable. Revisiting <b>classical</b> <b>organization</b> theory, this paper shows that organizations comprise multiple, more - or less - integrated modes of valuation. Empirically, the paper draws on an ethnographic study of Lean management at a children's hospital, which is presented through analytical snapshots. The paper suggests that an organizational turn is relevant for valuation studies, as this fi rst allows an analytical expansion to include less 'deviced' valuations, contributes to the ongoing culture vs. device debate offering an alternative to the causal analysis of devices and effects without making the 'ineffable culture' what makes or breaks the causality...|$|E

They offer an alternative for system theories of organization, which are rather abstract of nature and do not pay attention to the agent level. In contrast, <b>classical</b> <b>organization</b> theories offer a rather rich source of inspiration for developing multi-agent models because of their focus on the agent level. This paper studies the plausibility of theoretical choices in the construction of multi-agent systems. Multi-agent systems have to be plausible from a philosophical, psychological, and organizational point of view. For each of these points of view, alternative theories exist. Philosophically, the organization can be seen from the viewpoints of realism and constructivism. Psychologically, several agent types can be distinguished. A main problem in the construction of psychologically plausible computer agents is the integration of response function systems with representational systems. Organizationally, we study aspects of the architecture of multi-agent systems, namely topology, system function decomposition, coordination and synchronization of agent processes, and distribution of knowledge and language characteristics among agents. For each of these aspects, several theoretical perspectives exist. ...|$|E
