5|$|Although <b>couples</b> <b>are</b> {{starting}} {{to use condoms}} during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E

Worf again helps the Ferengi; using a special device {{implemented}} by Dax, Worf {{is able to}} control Quark's body movements from an adjacent holosuite and help Quark defend himself with a bat'leth. Although the device temporarily malfunctions, he ultimately defeats the bodyguard. The scene concludes with Grilka and Quark alone and enamored with one another. Worf opines to Jadzia that Quark is unworthy of such a great Klingon woman, and she counters that Worf's interest in Grilka is superficial, asserting that there are better options awaiting him. Observing that Worf still fails to see the subtext in her hints, Dax initiates an aggressive romantic encounter. In the next scene, both <b>couples</b> <b>are</b> shown in the infirmary; Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) treats their wounds and quickly deduces {{the source of their}} injuries.|$|E
