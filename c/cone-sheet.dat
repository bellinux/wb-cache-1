40|$|The Palaeogene Ardnamurchan central igneous complex, NW Scotland, was a {{defining}} {{place for the}} development of the classic concepts of <b>cone-sheet</b> and ring-dyke emplacement and has thus fundamentally influenced our thinking on subvolcanic structures. We have used the available structural information on Ardnamurchan to project the underlying three-dimensional (3 D) <b>cone-sheet</b> structure. Here we show that a single elongate magma chamber likely acted as the source of the <b>cone-sheet</b> swarm(s) instead of the traditionally accepted model of three successive centres. This proposal is supported by the ridge-like morphology of the Ardnamurchan volcano and is consistent with the depth and elongation of the gravity anomaly underlying the peninsula. Our model challenges the traditional model of <b>cone-sheet</b> emplacement at Ardnamurchan that involves successive but independent centres in favour of a more dynamical one that involves a single, but elongate and progressively evolving magma chamber system.

40|$|The Tertiary dyke-swarm of the Mourne area {{consists}} principally {{of basic}} and intermediate dykes and an inclined, composite <b>cone-sheet</b> surrounding the Mourne Mountain granites. The basic dykes are of two types: alkali basaltic dykes {{on the one}} hand, and the tholeiitic on the other. The alkali basaltic dykes make their appearances {{in the northern part}} of the swarm, while the tholeiitic types are mainly confined to the middle and southern parts. The tholeiitic series of the Mourne dyke-swarm form a differentiated sequence from olivine-tholeiites to granophyres, containing augite and sparse Ca-poor pyroxene and olivine in the basic rocks. Plagioclase is the sole feldspar phase in these rocks. The differentiated rocks of this series are typified by iron-enrichment (to tholeiitic andesites - "icelandites"). There are many textural variations within the rocks of the Mourne tholeiitic series, from medium-grained ophitic dolerites to very fine-grained spherulitic variolites and tachylytes. The origin of the basaltic parent magma and mechanism of differentiation are discussed. The ratios of various chemically determined oxides and trace element distributions indicate possible measures of parent-daughter relationships of rocks believed to represent magmas in the Mourne dyke-swarm. The chemistry of the alkali basalts of the Mourne area is related to magma generation at greater depths than in the case of tholeiitic basalts of the same swarm. A correlation is made between the alkali basalts of the Mourne area and those of the Killough-Ardglass dyke-swarm. The simultaneous intrusion of acid and basic magmas and the nature of the composite minor intrusions in the Mourne area are discussed; and a geochemical difference between the <b>cone-sheet</b> granophyres and the Eastern Mourne granites is demonstrated. The presence of sparse gabbroic xenoliths in the basic dykes of the Mourne area is related to a deep-seated gabbro formation beneath the Mourne Mountain granites and supports the geophysical evidence (Cook and Murphy, 1952). The other acid xenoliths contained in the intermediate dykes of the Mourne swarm are also described in detail...|$|E
40|$|Magma {{transport}} {{through the}} Earth's crust occurs dominantly via sheet intrusions, such as dykes and <b>cone-sheets,</b> and {{is fundamental to}} crustal evolution, volcanic eruptions and geochemical element cycling. However, reliable methods to reconstruct flow direction in solidified sheet intrusions have proved elusive. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) in magmatic sheets is often interpreted as primary magma flow, but magnetic fabrics can be modified by post-emplacement processes, making interpretation of AMS data ambiguous. Here we present AMS data from <b>cone-sheets</b> in the Alno carbonatite complex, central Sweden. We discuss six scenarios of syn- and post-emplacement processes that can modify AMS fabrics and offer a conceptual framework for systematic interpretation of magma movements in sheet intrusions. The AMS fabrics in the Alno <b>cone-sheets</b> are dominantly oblate with magnetic foliations parallel to sheet orientations. These fabrics may result from primary lateral flow or from sheet closure at the terminal stage of magma transport. As the <b>cone-sheets</b> are discontinuous along their strike direction, sheet closure is the most probable process to explain the observed AMS fabrics. We argue that these fabrics may be common to <b>cone-sheets</b> and an integrated geology, petrology and AMS approach {{can be used to}} distinguish them from primary flow fabrics...|$|R
40|$|Abundant cone sheets {{form one}} of the last magmatic stages in the Tertiary central complex on the Scottish {{peninsula}} of Ardnamurchan and can be grouped into a younger inner and an older outer suite relative to a gabbro intrusion. Most of the <b>cone-sheets</b> consist of tholeiitic to transitional basalt with MgO contents between 7. 5 % and 4 %, although more evolved rocks also occur (to 0. 5 % MgO). The mafic samples are slightly enriched in the light rare earth elements (Chondrite-normalized La/Sm ∼ 1. 1), the enrichment increases in the more evolved rocks. The compositional variation of the basaltic rocks is mainly due to crystal fractionation of olivine and clinopyroxene at depths of ∼ 10 km but trace elements show simultaneous assimilation of Archean Lewisian granulite crust. The andesitic to rhyolitic lavas formed by fractional crystallization from the contaminated basaltic magma coupled with assimilation of Proterozoic Moine metasediments at uppermost crustal levels. The occurrence of composite <b>cone-sheets</b> with basaltic and rhyolitic parts and mixtures between these magmas implies that the melts ascended successively but within a short period of time.

The felsic rocks are trachytes and phonolites generated within the second main stage of the volcanic activity that lasted about four million years. Three consecutive felsic episodes are distinguished: the first occurred between 14. 5 Ma and 13. 5 Ma, the second between 13. 6 Ma and 12. 0 Ma, and the third and last between 12. 0 Ma and 10. 4 Ma.

40|$|The twin summits of Preshal More and Preshal Beg, near Talisker, Isle of Skye, {{comprise}} the erosional {{remnants of a}} thick (at least 120 m) compound olivine tholeiite lava, or flow field, that ponded in palaeo-valleys within the Palaeocene lava field of west-central Skye. This unique flow field constitutes the Talisker Formation and is the youngest preserved extrusive unit of the Skye Lava Field. The lava inundated a complex of palaeo-valleys incised into the higher stratigraphical levels of the existing lava field, and remnants of the original sedimentary fill of these valleys still exist, the Preshal Beg Conglomerate Formation. The lava displays spectacularly well-developed two-tier (colonnade-entablature) columnar joint sets that formed {{as a consequence of}} slow, uninterrupted cooling through its base and sidewalls, aided by groundwater circulation and water ingress (from displaced drainage) directed into the lava's interior by master-joint systems. Intrusive phenomena developed at both the base and the top of the lava and there is evidence for the existence of subsurface feeder tubes. The tholeiitic composition of the Talisker Formation lava contrasts with the transitional, mildly alkaline characteristics of the remainder of the (older) lavas of Skye Lava Field. In broad terms, the Talisker Formation lava is compositionally very similar to the suite of <b>cone-sheets</b> emplaced into the oldest of the four intrusive centres that {{comprise the}} Skye Central Complex – the Cuillin Intrusive Centre – together with a high proportion of the Skye regional dyke swarm. The stratigraphical position, field relationships and compositional characteristics of the lava indicate that it was erupted and emplaced as an intracanyon-style flow field during the early shield-building stage in the growth of the (tholeiitic) Cuillin Volcano, which post-dates the main Skye ‘plateau’ Lava Field. Although the remnant outcrops are detached from their likely source area through erosion, this tholeiitic lava provides the first direct evidence linking the central complexes of the British Palaeogene Igneous Province and their eruptive products...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{an account of}} an {{investigation}} into the structure, petrology and mineralogy of a small Tertiary intrusive centre in the Vididalur-Vatnsdalur area near the north coast of Iceland. The area concerned lies in the Tertiary area west of the neovolcanic zone. In upper Tertiary times the extrusion of flood basalts in the area studied was locally interrupted by the building of a central volcano characterized by distinctive basalts, andesites and pyroclastics, some of which interfingered with contemporaneously extruded flood basalts. The first episode of this central volcanic activity, of which only the top is seen in the area studied, was subsequently buried by the transgressing flood basalts, and slow downsagging occurred in parts of the area along the prevailing north to north-northeast fracture system. A second central volcanic episode produced basalt, andesite and rhyolite extrusions and some pyroclastics in the northeastern part of the area following the flood transgression. Injection of thin basic dykes proceeded parallel to the two phases of central activity and continued during a final episode in which thin pale grey basalts similar to the Lower Pleistocene to Recent flows elsewhere in Iceland were extruded on to the irregular central volcano land surface. Two phases of intrusive activity proceeded parallel to the extrusive activity, the older More deeply eroded First Phase products being emplaced in the time interval during which the older flood basalts buried the newly extruded earlier central volcano lavas. A consecutive Second Phase of intrusive activity proceeded simultaneously with the second central volcanic episode and its less deeply eroded products show many similarities to the contemporaneous extrusions. These First and Second Phase intrusions are probably the upper apophyses of larger bodies concealed at depth. The intrusions which form {{the main part of the}} study are concentrated about an intrusive/extrusive centre in northern Vididalsfjall, and consist of coarse- and fine-grained basic to acid series, ranging in the First Phase from olivineeucrites (bytownite cumulates) through gabbros (labradorite cumulates), hybrid diorite and intermediate-acid hybrid types to acid granophyres. The First Phase was initiated by the intrusion of the eucrites and a dense swarm of tholeiitic <b>cone-sheets</b> centred on a focus about 5 km below northern Vididalsfjall. Commingling of the simultaneously available diorite and granophyre magma later in the First Phase resulted in the formation of small volumes of acid-intermediate hybrid rocks. The Second Phase intrusive activity is expressed as small high-level intrusions and began with a new supply of olivinetholeiite magmas which was injected along cone-fractures to form a late set of high-level <b>cone-sheets</b> centred on a focus about 2 km below northern Vididalsfjall. Cogenetic bytownite cumulates were emplaced as small high-level intrusions, but coarse-grained rocks and acid rocks of Second Phase age are rare in the area studied. iii. A broad aureole of hydrothermally altered rocks surrounds northern Vididalsfjall and smaller alteration zones surround other smaller regions cut by vents and intrusions; these altered and injected zones are taken to represent the eruptive channels at the core of the Vididalur-Vatnsdalur volcano. The intrusive rocks are all plagioclase-pyroxene-ore assemblages with or without olivine, alkali feldspar and quartz, and the First Phase types show a gradation from basic rocks bearing calcic plagioclase and magnesian augite to acid rocks containing sodic plagioclase anorthoclase and ferrian augite. The Second Phase rocks show broad petrographic similarity to those of the First Phase but coarse-grained intermediate and acid types are not found, and the basic rocks are richer in olivine than corresponding First Phase types. All the rocks examined show textural and mineralogical evidence of a high degree of fractionation and rapid final cooling at high crustal levels; the plagioclase of phenocryst rims and groundmasses is in a high-temperature structural state, the calcium-rich pyroxenes have immature exsolution textures, the olivines are strongly zoned and interstitial glassy or salic material is abundant. Many of the acid minor intrusions contain tridynlite paramorphed by quartz. Chemical analyses of 14 Vididalur-Vatnsdalur rocks show that they are low in alumina, combined alkalis and magnesia, and are relatively rich in iron, and titania, as are other Tertiary Icelandic tholeiites, with soda present in greater quantity than potash. The analyses of these basic intermediate and acid rocks fit on the iron-enriched trend for tholeiites (Nockolds a. nd AlIen, 1956) which suggests that the First and Second Phase sequences may have originated by -contiriuous fractionation of basic tholeiitic uuterinl. However there is little direct evidence of a tholeiite fractionation origin for the First Phase granitic acid rocks, and the presence of a few small veins of remelted acid material at some localities casts doubt on a fractionation origin for these granophyres and granites of the Vididalur-Vatnsdalur area...|$|R
40|$|The aplite - pegmatitic {{field of}} Arga {{represents}} a pegmatoidic system, spatially or genetically {{related to the}} evolution of the diapiric pluton of Serra de Arga which is formed by a two mica granite, specialized in Sn and Li and emplaced in Silurian metasediments. The spatial link between the aplite -pegmatites and the granite has a cartographic expression and evolves in time with the variations of the interference trajectories between the regional deformation phase, D n + 1, a possible equivalent of the D_ 3 (ribeiro, 1994), and the diapiric evolution of the pluton. The field is a major regional division that can be structurally subdivided into swarms. The swarms are differentiated by the size, shape, internal structures, deformation, and the frequency and local occurrence of the aplite - pegmatites. They show a chronology of emplacement that is related to precise phases of the interfering evolution between diapirism and the regional deformation. The aplite - pegmatite body is the elementary unit of the spatial organizations and simultaneously the place where the construction processes of the structures and paragenes is take place. The internal structural arrangements always shows a relationship between the crystallization and the deformation, expressed geometrically, and can be deduced through a detailed structural analysis. Associating the structural analysis, at several levels of organizations, in the swarms and bodies, it is possible to verify that the field is spatially subdivided into occurrence sectors of aplite - pegmatites, differentiated in the process of emplacement. With the distance to the pluton, the sectors and the bodies that occur in them, are the following: -Proximal Sectors - they include the granite contact and the intra-granitic and peri granitic bodies of the sill type, radial veins and some rare <b>cone-sheets.</b> - Adjacent Anti form Sectors - {{there are only a few}} aplite-pegmatitic outcrops, due to the erosion of the sill and to the lack of tectonic support to the emplacement. - Distal Sectors - they contain the exo-granitic sills more distant from the Arga granite and contain several veins placed in conjugated fractures (crossed veins) [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|International audienceIgneous sheet intrusions, such as dykes and cone sheets, {{represent}} various geometries of magma channels throughthe crust. In many volcanoes, they coexist as {{parts of}} complex plumbing systems and are likely fed by commonsources. How they form is fundamental regarding volcanic hazards, but yet no dynamic model simulates and predictssatisfactorily the diversity of sheet intrusions observed in volcanic systems. Here we present scaled laboratoryexperiments that reproduced dyke and cone sheet intrusion geometries under controlled conditions. Combined to aparametric study, a dimensional analysis shows that two dimensionless numbers 1 and 2 govern the formationof these intrusions. 1 is geometrical and describes the geometry of the magma source; 2 is dynamical and comparesthe local viscous stresses in the flowing magma to the host-rock strength. Plotting our experiments againstthese two numbers results in a phase diagram evidencing a dyke and a <b>cone-sheet</b> field, separated by a sharp transitionthat fits a power law. This result shows that dykes and cone sheets correspond to two distinct physical regimesof magma emplacement in the Earth’s crust. Cone sheets preferentially form when their source is shallow relativeto their size, when the magma influx (or viscosity) is large, or when the host rock is weak. In addition, both dykesand cone sheets may form from the same source, the shift from one regime to the other being then controlled bymagma dynamics, i. e. different values of 2. We compare our phase diagram to geological data and show that theextrapolated empirical dyke-to-cone sheet transition predicts the occurrence of dykes and cone sheets in variousnatural volcanic settings. This study thus provides a unified dynamic model of sheet intrusions emplacement andcaptures fundamental mechanisms of magma transport in the Earth’s crust...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInclined cone-sheets and {{sub-vertical}} dykes {{constitute the}} two principal types of magmatic sheet intrusionsproduced by volcanic systems. In active volcanic systems, the emplacement of sheet intrusions causes measurablesurface deformation, which is analyzed through geodetic models. Geodetic model output is classically the shape ofunderlying intrusions causing the surface deformation, however, {{the results of}} these models are not testable as thesubsurface intrusion is not accessible. Such test would only be doable with a physical system in which both (1) thesurface deformation pattern and (2) the 3 D shape of the underlying intrusion are known. In addition, establishedgeodetic models only consider static magma intrusions, and do not account for emplacement and propagationprocesses. This would require combined good time- and space-resolution, which is not achievable with classicalgeodetic monitoring systems. We present a series of analogue models that may be a way of accurately linking surface deformation to theunderlying intrusions and associated emplacement processes. We systematically varied depth of intrusion, thecohesive properties of the silica powder representing the country rock and the velocity of injected magma. The pressure of the intruding vegetable oil was measured through time, and the model surface topography wasmonitored. The low viscosity magma was simulated by molten vegetable oil, which solidified after intrusion; thesolidified intrusion was then excavated and its shape was measured. By linking the development of the surfaceuplift in height, area, and volume with the pressure data from the onset of intrusion until the time of eruption,we identify characteristic laws of surface deformation. First results indicate that the pattern of uplift over timevaries, depending on whether deformation is caused by a dyke- or a cone-sheet-shaped intrusion. The results fromall experiments may enable us to distinguish the two intrusion types using surface deformation data alone. Inaddition, the different signatures of surface deformation patterns associated with dykes and cone sheets providestrong insights into their contrasting emplacement regimes: dykes mainly inject as open fractures, whereas localshear deformation is likely to control <b>cone-sheet</b> emplacement. This key can then be applied to presently activevolcanic areas where surface deformation is monitored...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSubvertical dykes and {{inclined}} cone-sheets {{represent the}} two main types of magmatic sheet intrusions in volcanic systems. Despite their coexistence in the same volcanoes and seemingly common source, the intrusion dynamics of dykes and cone sheets has often been addressed through distinct models, such that we cannot predict under which condition {{either of the two}} forms. We present a series of scaled laboratory experiments that reproduce the emplacement of sheet intrusions into the brittle crust. A cohesive silica flour was used as model crust, and some vegetable oil as a low viscosity magma. The experiments comprised the injection of the oil at constant flow rate into the flour through an inlet. Through 46 experiments, we varied independently the depth (h) and the diameter (d) of the inlet, as well as the injection velocity (v). Our experiments produced sheet intrusions exhibiting either dyke or cone sheet morphologies. Dykes were characterized by a sub-vertical, slightly elliptic shape that often split into two branches to form a "boat"- shaped intrusion at very shallow depths. Cone sheets resembled inverted cones with rims that flattened from depth to the surface. Some of experiments produced hybrid intrusions with a dyke-like lower part feeding complex conical sheet intrusion higher up. Combining our systematic parametric study with a dimensional analysis, we show that the formation of dykes and cone sheets is controlled by two dimensionless parameters. One is geometrical (1 = h=d) and the other is dynamical (2 = v=Cd), where is the viscosity of the vegetable oil and C the flour cohesion. In a plot of 1 vs. 2, the experiments organise into two distinct fields, separated by a transition line that can be described by a power law. The hybrid intrusions produced in our experiments fall along the transition line in between the dyke and <b>cone-sheet</b> regimes. These results show that at high 1 values, dykes are favoured and originate from magma sources that are relatively deep in relation to their size. In contrast, cone sheets preferentially form from shallow sources and are favoured at large 2 values, i. e. for fast injection rates. These results compare fairly well to relevant geological data from magmatic sheet intrusions in various geological settings. Cone sheet and dyke emplacement can thus be explained by a single, unified mechanical model for sheet intrusions...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the Tertiary igneous rocks found within an area some twenty square miles in extent on the south-east side of the Skye central intrusion complex. The Tertiary rocks include basic lavas, a small intrusion of granophyre, the margin of the Cuillin Gabbro, and numerous minor intrusions. Extrusive rocks occupy an area of some seven square miles, and have an aggregate thickness of about 1, 000 feet. The greater part of the sequence consists of alkaline olivine basalts, but there is also one horizon of trachybasalt and thin group of picritic flows. Pyroclastic rocks are rare, being limited to one small agglomerate vent and an isolated lens of tuff. It has been found possible to divide the sequence into several mappable units based on groups of flows possessing common petrographical features. The laves which lie within half a mile of the Cuillin Gabbro have been metamorphosed by that intrusion, while an outer zone of lower temperature alteration includes the whole of the strathaird lava outcrop. Within the thermal aureole a narrow zone of pyroxene hornfels along the contact with the Gabbro is followed outwards by a broader zone charaterized by the presence of an actinolitic amphibole. Within this pyroxene hornfels zone the lavas have been thoroughly recrystalized to high temperature mineral assemblages, but within the amphibolezone equilibrium was only locally attained, and many of the lavas still posses much of their original texture and mineralogy. The transition from unmetamorphed lava to pyroxene hornfels was not accomplished by independently under its own particular pressure-temperature conditions. On the basis of both chemical and petrographical evidence it is considered probable that a small amount of silica was added to {{at least some of the}} lavas during metamorphism. The internal structure and composition of the Cuillin Gabbro do not come within the provenence of this thesis, but some attention has been given to the relationships between the Gabbro and its country rocks, especially in the neighbourhood of camasunary. In this latter area there is an extensive development of basic minor instructions pre-dating the Gabbo, and metamorphosed in a similar manner to the nearby lavas. Most of these small intrusions are emplaced into Torridonian sandstones, which locally extend up to several hundred feet from the contact, the Torridonian shows clear evidence of having been partially melted by the high temperatures induced by the intrusion of gabbro magma, and many of the early intrusions are veined and broken into fragments by the mobilized material. The vein material is chemically more basic in composition than the sediments from which it was derived, partly due to reaction with the basic minor intrusions. Parallel to the contact of the Cuillin Gabbro, in Strathaird, there is a series of irregularly shaped outer-ops of granphyre which are thought to be parts of a single intrusion exposed in the vicinity of its roof. The granophyre is fine-grained, is unusual in containing paramorphs after tridymite, and differs chemically from other Skye granitic rocks. Through there is sometimes a well-defined, chilled margin, many of the contacts against sedimentary rocks are complex and highly xenolithin. The granophyre post-dates the Cuillin Gabbro, but is earlier than the large granitic intrusions which lie to the north and north-east of the areas. One of the most impressive features of the local geology is the great profusion of north-west dykes, all but a few of which are basic in composition. Most of the dykes are later date than the Cuillin Gabbro, but their distribution shows that they are closely related to that centre. Other minor intrusions include a few acid and basic skills which are, in general, of earlier date then the dyke swarm, while basic <b>cone-sheets</b> occur in the vicinity of the Cuillin Gabbro and are later than most of the north-west dykes. In Strathaird, erosion to a relatively deep level allows the structural relationships between lavas, intrusions, and pre-Tertiary sediments to be more easily examined than elsewhere in Syke. Most of the sediments are of Jurassic age, and these rest uncon-formably on Torridonian sandstones. There were several phases of warping in Mesozic times, but the main period of deformation occurred after the outpouring of the lavas and gave rise to large arcuate folds. It is believed that these folds are one result of the stresses set up by the intrusion of the Cuillin Gabbro...|$|R
40|$|Ras ed Dom and Abu Dom are two anorogenic ring-complexes, of Triassic age, emplaced {{into the}} Precambrian gneisses {{of the central}} Bayuda Desert in {{northern}} Sudan. The two complexes are closely similar lithologically and are composed of early-formed subaluminous syenites, and later peralkaline syenites and granites. The intrusions are emplaced as sub-volcanic stocks and ring-dykes and both complexes are partly girdled by acid <b>cone-sheet</b> swarms. Minor occurrences of acid volcanic rocks are also present. Ras ed Dom is a striking example of a migrating ring-complex, and in it the focus of magmatism migrated eastwards, and declined in strength, with time. Field relations indicate that the sequence early syenite -> alkali syenite -> alkali granite constitutes a recurrent fractionation Series in the complexes. The early syenites occasionally contain early-formed plagioclase, but in general the suite is typically hypersolvus. Feldspar bulk compositions cluster close to Or 38 Ab 62, and the most calcic composition (An 7 mol%) is from an early syenite. Pyroxenes in the subaluminous units are zoned from cores of ferrohedenbergite to rims of aegirine-augite, and are enclosed within later ferroedenite. Amphiboles in the peralkaline rocks range from ferrorichterite through arfvedsonite compositions to riebeckite. Late aegirine typically replaces alkali amphibole, especially in the granites. Aenigmatite is an additional mafic phase {{in some of the}} syenites. Minor late albite is common in the peralkaline rocks. The principal cryptic variation in the mafic phases is the substitution of Na and Fe{sup] 3 + for Mg, Ca and Fe[sup] 2 +. Major element variation in the rocks supports the proposed fractionation sequence, and it is apparent that the main changes with fractionation are enrichment in SiO[sub] 2 and Fe[sub] 2 O[sub] 3 relative to FeO, together with an increase in alkalinity due to A 1 [sub] 2 O[sub] 3 depletion relative to the alkalies. Relations to alkali-rich analogues of the 'granite system' confirm a magmatic origin, and trends in terms of SiO[sub] 2 - A 1 [sub] 2 O[sub] 3 - (Na[sub] 2 O + K[sub] 2 O) suggest that fractionation of alkali-feldspar is the major process {{in the evolution of the}} rock-series. Major depletions in Sr and Ba support this hypothesis, as does the variation in Rb/Sr ratios. In common with other alkaline provinces the Bayuda rocks exhibit strong enrichment in incompatible elements such as Zr, Nb, Rb, Y and the LREE group. Concentrations are highest in the granites and this may reflect in part the overprinting by late sodic residual fluids. Partial REE trends are characterised by LREE enrichment, and are consistent with a cogenetic origin for the rocks. The parental melt is believed to have been similar in composition to the early syenites, and is considered to have been generated by lower crustal partial melting. Ras ed Dom and Abu Dom, together with some eighteen or so similar ring-complexes in the Bayuda area, belong to the Younger Granite Association which occurs widely throughout the Sudan, and shows many features in common with the Nigerian Younger Granite province...|$|E

Centre 2 saturated and oversaturated syenites. Centre 3 undersaturated foyaites and ijolites. Centre 4 saturated (high potassic) shonkinites, minettes, biotite-pyroxenites. Centre 5 silico-carbonatite and carbonatite, sovite and dolomite carbonatite. Centre 1 is located to the northeast of the main lake. It is composed of an outer diorite, and a later inner gabbro, layered intrusion, surrounded by arcs of olivine-magnetite-pyroxenite, and syenite intruded along a marginal ring fracture. Both the diorite and the gabbro possess broad wall-rock zones in rapid gradational contact with central laminated differentiates. The diorite lacks significant cryptic variation, but the gabbro is divided into anorthositic and gabbroic series showing the crystal accumulation of olivine, apatite and calcic plagioclase towards {{the base of the}} intrusion. The operation of continuous convection currents is evidenced by the radial dip of the lamination and the winnowing of the mafic minerals. Stronger intermittant currents in the gabbro are evidenced by radial trough banding, and rhythmic banking. The olivine-magnetite-pyroxenites are composed of olivine Fo 66 andndash; 68, clinopyroxene Ca 44. 6 Mg 55. 8 Fe 9. 6, magnetite and ilmenite in the approximate modal proportions 19 andnbsp;: 59 andnbsp;: 17 andnbsp;: 5. Minor barkevikite, biotite and apatite occur as an alkaline matrix. Quenching to magnetite-pyroxenite at the margins, remobilization of the contact granite or gabbro, and comparison of the modal composition with the field boundaries in the synthetic system ol-cpx-iron oxide demonstrate that these rocks crystallized from an ultramafic magma containing a small percentage of olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts. A temperature of intrusion of 1100 andndash; 1200 ° is deduced. Although no descriptions of comparable rocks have been found these are regarded as the alkaline, ilmenite-rich, equivalents of the Alaskan-type zoned ultramafic intrusions. Centre 2 spans the northern half of the lake. It contains two concentric ring dykes of quartz syenite to the south, and two quartz free syenites around the margin of centre 1. The intrusion of these syenites followed an episode of transcurrent faulting which bisected centre 1. Mineralogically and in geochemistry the syenite series forms a continuation of the gabbro-diorite series, and spans the transitions pyroxene-alkali amphibole, and plagioclase andrarr; alkali feldspar (An 52 andrarr; An 28 andrarr; Or 38). A few late syenite dykes are peralkaline, and include aegirine bearing comendites. Centre 3 occupies the southern half of the lake. It is dominated by a 3. 4 andtimes; 2. 1 km body of pegmatitic foyaite rimmed by chilled vertically laminated foyaite, and 10 andndash; 100 m of zoned fenite, A finer grained more mafic foyaite covers Bigspruce and Littlespruce islands. Both foyaites are composed of cryptoperthite Or 66, nepheline Ne 69, and aegirine and show a differentiation into feldspathic, nephelinic, and ijolitic horizons with low angle contacts, and a concentric distribution. This form is interpreted in terms of the preferential crystal settling of feldspar plates in the absence of convection currents. Both the foyaites show a chill composition lying within the low temperature "foyaite sink" in the system Qtz-Ne-Ks. Breccia pipes of sodic ijolite transitional into cancrinite foyaite are marginal to the carbonatite pegmatite focus of Bigspruce island. A possible origin through breccia-fluid exchange reactions involving the loss of K 2 O and SiO 2 in the presence of abundant H 2 O and Na 2 CO 3 is suggested. High potassic rocks occur predominantly within a subsiduary complex 5 km to the southeast of the lake, but identical types occur in close association with the carbonatites. They are composed of pyroxene, olivine, biotite, oxide, apatite and cryptoperthite Or 50, with a maximum feldspar content of circa 50 %. The shonkinite forms dykes and breccia pipes of similar form and composition to those of the Navajo area, Arizona. The biotite-pyroxenites also form pipes, are transitional into shonkinite through the loss of feldspar, and are surrounded by zoned fenites. They are closely comparable to the stock of Libby, Montana, and to the "O. B. P. " nodules found in the East African potassic provinces. Comparisons of the volume and composition of the fenite, pyroxenite and shonkinite are used to show that the biotite-pyroxenite may have originated from the shonkinite through the loss of normative feldspar to the wall rock in a fluoride-rich aqueous fluid phase. Both the foyaite and pyroxenite fenites resemble those of Fen, Alno and Chishanya, with concentric zones of aegirine-perthite-syenite, arfvedsonite-albite-quartz-syenite and biotite microgranite. The principal geochemical changes are the transfer of silica into the microgranite, and the transfer of feldspar with similar Kandnbsp;: Na, ratio to the foyaite or "shonkinite" magma into the syenites. The carbonatites of centre 5 outcrop within two cone sheet and radial dyke foci of dolomitic and calcitic composition respectively. The dolomite focus lies {{on the east side of}} the lake within a fault bound structure. It consists of a central breccia plug of biotite-ankerite carbonatite surrounded by inwardly dipping sheets of dolomite defining a focus and#x 2271; 300 m deep. The silicate content of the rock and iron content of the dolomite decrease away from the centre. There is a complete transition within these rocks from calcite bearing biotite-peridotite to carbonatite. On the basis of these replacement reactions a temperature of intrusion of 500 andndash; 560 °C is deduced. The sovite focus lies on the west side of Bigspruce island. It shows a well-defined radial dyke and <b>cone-sheet</b> distribution of silicate-calcite pegmatites associated with Fe, Ti, Ca, Nb, R. E., CO 2, H 2 O, Cl metasomatism. Multiple fracturing and intrusion within these pegmatites shows a sequence of:- Aegirine + magnetite + calcite; Biotite + magnetite + calcite + pyrochlore; Biotite + calcite + bastnasite. Biotite carbonatite, fluorite carbonatite, and bastnasite carbonatite occur as peripheral satellite bodies. Mineral textures in the carbonatites give evidence of chilling, quenching and the crystal settling of apatite within the magmas. The close similarity of the trace element content and volatile content support the derivation of the carbonatites from the high potassic parent magma. The Sr 87 / 86 ratio of 0. 7020 from the calcite and dolomite supports a mantle derivation for this parent. Within the exposed rock types three main differentiation trends may be distinguished. These are - Alkali gabbro andndash; alkali diorite andndash; syenite andndash; quartz syenite-comendite. Alkali gabbro andndash; rhomb syenite andndash; sanidine syenite andndash; foyaite. Biotite peridotite andndash; shonkinite andndash; biotite pyroxenite. The geochemical series 1 and 2, as illustrated by the Caandnbsp;: Naandnbsp;: K and Mgandnbsp;: Feandnbsp;: Alk diagrams, more closely resemble those of the Gardar province than those of the Oslo or Monteregian provinces but show a lesser degree of iron enrichment, and a greater enrichment in soda relative to Ca and K. These differences are thought to be due to the early disappearance of olivine as a fractionating phase, and to the dominating influence of feldspar fractionation in both series. Although both the saturated and undersaturated trend may ultimately be derived from the same parent and the composition of the magnetite-pyroxenite shows that it is related, the potassic series is believed to be derived from a distinct high potassic peridotitic parent of mantle origin. The differentiation of these magmas is believed to have taken place simultaneously in a series of independent magma chambers located within the prism of shattered rock at the intersection of a system of N-S and E-W transcurrent faults. The intrusion of the derived magmas was closely related to movement on the N-S fault system. On a regional scale the complex is located at the centre of a dome of granitic rocks close to the border between the Slave and Bear provinces. The age of the complex at 1820 andnbsp;m. y. is similar to the age of uplift of the neighbouring Snare orogenic belt. At the present time these rocks form the oldest known alkali-carbonatite centre. </p...|$|E
