30|$|Only {{a handful}} of studies have {{examined}} the impact of <b>computerized</b> <b>administration</b> of low-stakes RBAs on university student performance. In Bonham’s 2008 research into college astronomy courses, he drew a matched sample from students who completed the in-class and outside-of-class surveys. He concluded that {{there was no significant difference}} between unproctored CBT and PPT data collection. However, examining Bonham’s results reveals that there was a small but meaningful difference in the data. The results indicated that the online concept inventory scores were 6 % higher than the in-class scores on the posttest. For these data, 6 % is an effect size of approximately 0.30. While this difference is small, lecture-based courses often have raw gains below 20 %; a 6 % difference would therefore skew comparisons between data collected with CBT and PPT assessment conditions. Therefore, the results of the study do not clearly show that low-stakes tests provide equivalent data when collected in class with PPTs or outside of class with CBTs.|$|E

The question that rises is whether these implementations may introduce some technology-specific effects {{to be considered in}} neuropsychological evaluations. Two core aspects have been investigated in this work: the efficacy of tests and the clinical ecology of their administration (the ability to measure real-world test performance), specifically (1) the testing efficacy of a computerized test when response to stimuli is measured using a touch-screen compared to a conventional mouse-control response device; (2) the testing efficacy of a computerized test with respect to different input modalities (visual versus verbal); and (3) the ecology of two computerized assessment modalities (touch-screen and mouse-control), including preference measurements of participants. Our results suggest that (1) touch-screen devices are suitable for administering experimental tasks requiring precise timings for detection, (2) intrinsic nature of neuropsychological tests should always be respected in terms of stimuli presentation when translated to new digitalized environment, and (3) touch-screen devices result in ecological instruments being proposed for the <b>computerized</b> <b>administration</b> of neuropsychological tests {{with a high level of}} preference from elderly people...|$|E

This task, which requires reproduction of a sequence of movements by tapping blocks as demonstrated by an examiner, is widely used {{as a representative of}} visuospatial attention and working memory. The aim was to validate a computerized version of the Corsi Task (e-Corsi) by comparing recall accuracy 000353417000003 to that on the standard task. Forty university students (Mage = 22. 9 years, SD = 2. 7 years; 20 female) performed the standard Corsi Task and the e-Corsi on an iPad 3. Results showed higher accuracy in forward reproduction on the standard Corsi compared with the e-Corsi, whereas backward performance was comparable. These divergent performance patterns on the 2 versions (small-to-medium effect sizes) are explained as a result of motor priming and interference effects. This finding implies that computerization has serious consequences for the cognitive concepts that the Corsi Task is assumed to assess. Hence, whereas the e-Corsi was shown to be useful with respect to administration and registration, these findings also stress the need for reconsideration of the underlying theoretical concepts of this task...|$|E

Valid assessment procedure of children’s motor activity is therefore a very important issue. The current study aims to validate the Triaxial Accelerometry for Preschoolers (3 AAP), a method using the measurement of children’s wrist acceleration as a way to estimate their motor activity. Method: Data were collected from a community sample of 226 preschoolers and from a sample of 32 preschoolers clinically referred for externalizing behavior concerns. The participants’ motor activity was assessed using a triaxial accelerometer (a sensor worn on the wrist) in three different conditions of assessment, i. e. at school, in a lab session and during a <b>computerized</b> task <b>administration.</b> Results: The 3 AAP variables, i. e. the peak, the mean level, the intra-individual variability, and the median of motor activity as well as the percentage of time spent in the lower range and conversely in the higher range of motor activity, were highly intercorrelated and normally distributed. They were significantly correlated with externalizing behavior-related scales from the CBCL, the SDQ and the UCG, and low correlations were reported with internalizing behavior-related scales from the same instruments. Test-retest correlations after a 10 -week interval were moderate to high.

Since changes in executive function (EF) are contingent upon age and may compromise assessment accuracy, psychiatric patients and normal controls were compared in terms of cognitive decline rates. EF is measured with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), that has adapted several standard cognitive tests for <b>computerized</b> <b>administration</b> and scoring. Objectives Specification of the relation between psychopathology, cognition and aging. Aims Cross sectional examination of the age related executive changes in a sample of adults with a history of psychiatric illness using the CANTAB. Methods A total of 406 patients (18 - 72 years), diagnosed with (a) affective disorders (N= 153), (b) substance related disorders (N= 112), (c) personality disorders (N= 82), or (d) pervasive developmental disorders (N= 59), completed CANTAB executive function tests of working memory (SWM), strategic planning (SOC) and set shifting (IED). Test performances were compared with those of 52 healthy adults. Results Both in the patient groups and the healthy participants, similar rates of executive decline were found. Conclusions The present research indicates that the decline of executive skills in populations with psychiatric conditions does not exceed the age related executive changes typically seen in healthy aging adults. Still, compared with the latter, patients seem to earlier reach the critical threshold at which functional deficits emerge, notwithstanding the comparable decline rates.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{determine}} if providing patient specific Quality of Life (QL) information to clinic staff before a clinic appointment improved patient care in a lung cancer outpatient clinic. Patients were sequentially assigned to either a usual care control group or the experimental group, which completed a computerized version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C 30 questionnaire in order to provide the clinic staff with QL information prior to the clinic appointment. The control group completed the EORTC QLQ-C 30 paper version after the clinic appointment. Outcome measures were patient satisfaction, the degree to which issues identified on the QL questionnaire were addressed in the appointment, and a chart audit, which measured charting of QL issues and actions taken by the clincian relating to QL. In the experimental group, more QL issues identified by the patient on the EORTC QLQ-C 30 were addressed during the clinic appointment than in the control group. As well, marginally more categories were charted and a trend towards more actions being taken was seen in the experimental group.

In this algorithm, number of words and latency were used to compute an examinee 2 ̆ 7 s mean working rate on items from a particular content area of the test. This rate was then used in conjunction with the word count of later items of similar format from the same content area to compute an expected latency on these items. If the examinee spent less than a fraction of this latency on a particular item, the response was flagged and rescored as a not reached item. The algorithm was developed using Sample 1 data, and evaluated using Sample 2 data. Item Response Theory (IRT) calibrations, using PC-BILOG 3, were completed on both the original data and the rescored data, and the standard errors associated with the item and person parameter estimates before and after using the rescoring algorithm were compared and contrasted. ^ Analyses of the original and rescored data revealed that, in general, across the three content areas, rescoring using the proposed algorithm did not result in improvements in the precision with which the IRT a-, b-, c-, and person parameter estimates were measured. ...|$|R
