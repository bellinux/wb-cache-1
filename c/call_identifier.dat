30|$|If {{the mobile}} host (MH) moves during an SIP session, meanwhile, the SIP user agent (UA) sends an SIP re-INVITE request message {{to each one}} of its {{corresponding}} hosts (CHs). In this message, the MH includes its original SIP user identifier and its new IP address in order to inform the corresponding host where it wants to receive future SIP messages [1, 10]. The re-INVITE message, triggered by the SIP UA at the new location, also uses the same <b>call</b> <b>identifier</b> as in the original call setup. Moreover, the c (connection) field of the SDP header contains {{a description of the}} session in order to redirect the data traffic flow towards its new location.|$|E
40|$|Although {{wild bird}} {{watching}} {{has been a}} popular leisure activity, it {{is often the case}} that people have no idea about what kind of bird species they see or hear. To help people learn to identify bird species, this study proposes an automatic bird sound identification system. Considering bird vocalization can be generally divided into two categories, namely call and song, the proposed system is built upon a two-stage identification framework. The first stage performs call/song classification. If an unknown sound clip is classified as a call, it is then handled by a <b>call</b> <b>identifier</b> in the second stage; otherwise, it is handled by a song identifier. Both identifiers use two acoustic features, timbre and pitch, to determine which of the bird species the sound clip belong to. In using timbre features, bird sounds are converted into Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and their first derivatives and then analyzed using Gaussian mixture models. In using pitch feature, we convert bird sounds into MIDI note sequences and then use bigram models to analyze the dynamic change information of the notes. Our experiments, conducted using a data-base including twenty common bird species in the Taipei urban area, show that the pro-posed system can achieve 90. 4 % accuracy...|$|E

Research on segregation of immigrant groups is increasingly turning its attention from residential areas toward other important places, such as the workplace, where immigrants can meet and interact {{with members of the}} native population. This article examines workplace segregation of immigrants. We use longitudinal, georeferenced Swedish population register data, which enables us to observe all immigrants in Sweden for the period 1990 - 2005 on an annual basis. We compare estimates from ordinary least squares with fixed-effects regressions to quantify the extent of immigrants' self-selection into specific workplaces, neighborhoods, and partnerships, which may bias more naïve ordinary least squares results. In line with previous research, we find lower levels of workplace segregation than residential segregation. The main finding is that low levels of residential segregation reduce workplace segregation, even after we take into account intermarriage with natives as well as unobserved characteristics of immigrants' such as willingness and ability to integrate into the host society. Being intermarried with a native reduces workplace segregation for immigrant men but not for immigrant women. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E

Therefore, we shall demonstrate how certain concepts which we shall <b>call</b> <b>identifiers</b> of the landscape and landscape quality indicators reveal themselves as important tools to help us to migrate from the analysis phase to the project synthesis. These concepts allow to integrate different space analysis dimensions: morfological, behavioural and sensorial, which are relevant to the aprehension of free public spaces conceived in essence as mutant spaces, and allowing the designer to conduct an interpretative analysis and also to value the intervention contexts...|$|R

A study at The Long Island Jewish-Hillside Medical Center showed {{that a majority of}} its surgical DRGs would be unprofitable under the proposed reimbursement scheme. This study was undertaken to develop a method of allowing the hospital to group patients with each DRG that would show a difference in hospital charges and be clinically meaningful to surgeons. The study implementors tested the hypothesis that entities <b>called</b> <b>identifiers,</b> arbitrarily chosen as mode of admission [emergency (+ER vs. nonemergency (-ER) ] and presence (+T) or absence (-T) of blood transfusion, would show a difference in charges (mean hospital charge exclusive of physician fees) within a DRG. Nine hundred five patients in nine DRGs encompassing general surgery, thoracic surgery, cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedics, urology, and head and neck surgery were studied. For ER identifier, eight of nine DRGs were found to be positive (greater than 20 % difference in charges between positive and negative identifier); for T identifier, all DRGs (9) were positive. These findings demonstrate that these identifiers may enable teaching institutions to disaggregate each DRG and, in this way, propose more equitable reimbursement rates...|$|R

5000|$|In human languages, {{including}} English, {{number is}} a syntactic category, along with person and gender. The quantity is expressed by identifiers, definite and indefinite, and quantifiers, definite and indefinite, {{as well as}} by three types of nouns: 1. count unit nouns or countables; 2. mass nouns, uncountables, referring to the indefinite, unidentified amounts; 3. nouns of multitude (collective nouns). The word ‘number’ belongs to a noun of multitude standing either for a single entity or for the individuals making the whole. An amount in general is expressed by a special class of words <b>called</b> <b>identifiers,</b> indefinite and definite and quantifiers, definite and indefinite. The amount may be expressed by: singular form and plural from, ordinal numbers before a count noun singular (first, second, third...), the demonstratives; definite and indefinite numbers and measurements (hundred/hundreds, million/millions), or cardinal numbers before count nouns. The set of language quantifiers covers [...] "a few, a great number, many, several (for count names); a bit of, a little, less, a great deal (amount) of, much (for mass names); all, plenty of, a lot of, enough, more, most, some, any, both, each, either, neither, every, no". For the complex case of unidentified amounts, the parts and examples of a mass are indicated with respect to the following: a measure of a mass (two kilos of rice and twenty bottles of milk or ten pieces of paper); a piece or part of a mass (part, element, atom, item, article, drop); or a shape of a container (a basket, box, case, cup, bottle, vessel, jar).|$|R
