500|$|Johnson's wing was {{the first}} to be {{stationed}} on French soil following the invasion. [...] With their radius of action now far extended compared to the squadrons still in Britain, the wing scored heavily through the summer. On 21 August 1944, Johnson was leading No. 443 Squadron on a patrol over the Seine, near Paris. Johnson bounced a formation of Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, shooting down two, which were recorded on the <b>cine</b> <b>camera.</b> Climbing back to his starting point at 8,000ft, Johnson attempted to join a formation of six aircraft, he thought were Spitfires. The fighters were actually Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Johnson escaped by doing a series of steep climbs, during which he nearly stalled and blacked out. He eventually evaded the Messerschmitts, which had been trying to flank him on either side, while two more stuck to his tail. Johnson's Spitfire IX was hit by enemy aircraft fire for the only time, taking cannon shells in the rudder and elevators. Johnson had now equalled and surpassed Sailor Malan's record score of 32, shooting down two Fw 190s for his 32—33 air victories. However Johnson considered Malan's exploits to be better. Johnson points out, when Malan fought (during 1940—41), he did so outnumbered, and had matched the enemy even then. Johnson said: ...|$|E

C mount was found on Filmo 70 cameras with serial numbers 54090 and higher, probably from about 1926. Soon after, other camera manufacturers adopted the same mount, {{and it became a}} de facto standard for 16 mm <b>cine</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|R

50|$|James {{decided to}} make a film record of a young child's stay in hospital. It would allow the {{evidence}} to be examined and re-examined. He hoped it would pierce defences that the spoken word could not. With a grant of £150 he purchased a <b>cine</b> <b>camera</b> and 80 minutes of black-and-white film. He had never used a <b>cine</b> <b>camera</b> before.|$|E
50|$|The {{size and}} {{complexity}} of <b>ciné</b> <b>cameras</b> varies greatly depending on the uses required of the camera. Some professional equipment is very large and too heavy to be hand held whilst some amateur cameras were designed to be very small and light for single-handed operation.|$|R

30|$|Manual {{digitisation}} was {{the most}} widespread motion measurement technique for many decades, and prior to digital technologies, <b>cine</b> film <b>cameras</b> were traditionally used [32, 34 – 36]. These were well-suited {{to the field of}} movement analysis due to their high image quality and high-speed frame rates (100  Hz in the aforementioned studies). However, the practicality of this method was limited by long processing times. With the advent of video cameras (initially tape-based before the transition to digital), <b>cine</b> <b>cameras</b> have become essentially redundant in the field of biomechanics. Digital video cameras are now relatively inexpensive, have increasingly high resolutions and fast frame rates (consumer cameras are generally capable of high-definition video at greater than 120  Hz, whereas industrial cameras are significantly faster), and are associated with shorter processing times.|$|R

The paper argues that the operation and its consequences in the judicial system illustrate a number of issues: unreliable policing on the ground; the enthusiasm for technological approaches to crime; and the limits of those approaches. The paper concludes that the Chesterfield case should prompt us {{to take another look at}} the impact of technology on interwar British policing, and its relationship to surveillance. ...|$|R

Pöchs technical equipment is especially noteworthy. It included a photo camera, a <b>cine</b> <b>camera</b> and a phonograph, which enabled Pöch to take pictures, video and audio documents of the indigenous population. His 72 recordings of songs and narratives in Papuan languages were seen as a sensation at the time.|$|E
50|$|Believed {{to be one}} of the {{earliest}} narrative films made in Scotland, and almost certainly the first to be made in the Highlands, Andrew Paterson used the natural setting of the coast at North Kessock to make a silent movie involving smugglers, which premiered in the Central Hall Picture House, Academy Street, Inverness, on 29 June 1913.In 1912 one of the Gaumont area salesmen selling photographic equipment persuaded Paterson to buy a <b>cine</b> <b>camera.</b> Paterson was much involved with amateur theatricals in Inverness at the time and decided to experiment with the new medium.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} {{photographic}} lenses {{for use in}} still or <b>cine</b> <b>cameras</b> is intended to produce a lens that yields the most acceptable rendition of the subject being photographed within a range of constraints that include cost, weight and materials. For many other optical devices such as telescopes, microscopes and theodolites where the visual image is observed but often not recorded the design can often be significantly simpler than {{is the case in}} a camera where every image is captured on film or image sensor and can be subject to detailed scrutiny at a later stage. Photographic lenses also include those used in enlargers and projectors.|$|R
50|$|Some lenses, called zoom lenses, have a {{focal length}} that varies as {{internal}} elements are moved, typically by rotating the barrel or pressing a button which activates an electric motor. Commonly, the lens may zoom from moderate wide-angle, through normal, to moderate telephoto; or from normal to extreme telephoto. The zoom range {{is limited by}} manufacturing constraints; the ideal of a lens of large maximum aperture which will zoom from extreme wideangle to extreme telephoto is not attainable. Zoom lenses are widely used for small-format cameras of all types: still and <b>cine</b> <b>cameras</b> with fixed or interchangeable lenses. Bulk and price limit their use for larger film sizes. Motorized zoom lenses may also have the focus, iris, and other functions motorized.|$|R

The sisters were not able to review or edit any footage on location, and so were constantly anxious they had not captured the events and activities in Angola successfully.

Gaumont first hired Zecca as an actor in 1898 but Zecca directed his first film for Pathé, an experimental sound production, Le Muet mélomane (1899) based on a musical Zecca and another artist, Charlus, were performing. At the request of entrepreneur Georges Dufayel, owner of the Grands Magasins Dufayel, they acted the piece before a <b>ciné</b> <b>camera.</b> His next film, Les Méfaits d'une tête de veau (1899) was for Gaumont.|$|E
50|$|In early 1942, 30 cameramen {{were sent}} to Cairo, Egypt to form AFPU's Number 1 Unit.

It was {{at the start of}} the Alamein offensive that Sergeant Billy Jordan , skilfully filmed the opening artillery barrage. Footage of the North African campaign was used in the making of Desert Victory which won a best war documentary Academy Award in 1943. During the North African Campaign, the AFPU Number 1 Unit of 32 men, suffered four killed, seven wounded and six captured.|$|R
50|$|Smith had {{attended}} the Lumière programme in Leicester Square in March 1896 and {{spurred on by}} the films of Robert Paul, which played in Brighton for that summer season, he and local chemist James Williamson acquired a prototype <b>cine</b> <b>cameras</b> from local engineer Alfred Darling, who had begun to manufacture film equipment after carrying out repairs for Brighton-based film pioneer Esmé Collings. In 1897, with the technical assistance of Darling and chemicals purchased from Williamson, Smith turned the pump house into a film factory for developing and printing and developed into a successful commercial film processor as well as patenting a camera and projector system of his own. Both he and his neighbour Williamson {{would go on to}} become pioneering film makers in their own right creating numerous historic minute-long films.|$|R
50|$|The rotary shutter and {{the film}} drive are like those used in <b>cine</b> <b>cameras.</b> When the shutter release is pressed, a light-blocking shield lifts and the shutter disc rotates a full turn exposing the film through its open sector; when the {{pressure}} is released the light-blocking shield returns to its position behind the lens, and the spring motor advances the film and recocks the shutter. This is almost instantaneous. With practice a photographer could take 4 or 5 pictures a second. Each winding of the spring motor was good for about 25 pictures, half a roll of film. Shutter speed was determined by spring tension and mechanical delay since the exposure sector was fixed. The Robot I had an exposure range of 1 to 1/500, and provision for time exposures.|$|R
