40|$|New enzymes {{are going}} to have great {{potential}} in bast fibre processing and modification for different end uses. There are several new technologies using enzymes able to modify fiber parametres, achieve desired properties, improve processing results and ecology in the area of bast fibre processing and fabric finishing. Enzymatic retting of flax, enzymatic <b>cottonization</b> of bast fibre, enzymatic hemp separation, enzymatic processing of flax rovings before wet spinning etc. create a group of new technologies supported by effective mechanical treatments. A complex solution of relations between agrar and processing sphere and the utilization of new technologies of biochemical and mechanical processing enable the creation of suitable conditions to utilize traditional and perspective renewable fibre sources and to open them to ways to new qualities and to other industrial areas of use...|$|E
