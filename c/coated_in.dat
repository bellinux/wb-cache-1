40|$|A {{translucent}} coat {{of calcium}} alginate with a wrinkled appearance was obtained around the PVA matrices. Increase <b>in</b> <b>coating</b> time {{led to an}} increase <b>in</b> the <b>coat</b> thickness {{and a decrease in}} drug content, also, a certain amount of drug appeared <b>in</b> the <b>coat.</b> The drug release was affected by the thickness and the pH-dependent behaviour of the <b>coat.</b> <b>In</b> fact, the drug was released from the swollen matrix through the intact <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> simulated gastric fluid and through the gelatinized <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> simulated intestinal fluid giving linear profiles, after a burst effect...|$|R

5|$|A Late Preclassic tomb {{has been}} excavated, {{believed}} to be a royal burial. This tomb has been designated Burial1; it was found during excavations of Structure7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure7A. These ceramics date the offering {{to the end of the}} Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring , which was probably made of wood and <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD100–200.|$|E

5|$|Chromium, use of: The use of {{chromium}} {{was invented}} in China no later than 210 BC when the Terracotta Army was interred at a site not far from modern Xi'an; modern archaeologists discovered that bronze-tipped crossbow bolts at the site {{showed no sign of}} corrosion after more than 2,000 years, because they had been <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> chromium. Chromium was not used anywhere else until the experiments of French pharmacist and chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763–1829) in the late 1790s.|$|E
5|$|Danish AW101s have {{a higher}} gross weight {{capacity}} of 15,600kg and were, as delivered, <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> a paint designed to reduce the aircraft's infrared signature. In the SAR role, RDAF AW101s have a crew of six and were initially painted yellow to distinguish themselves from AW101 allocated to military duties, but were later painted green, and all 14 AW101s are used for SAR and troop transport.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds occur {{most often}} as {{euhedral}} or rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known as macles. As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic {{arrangement of the}} atoms, they have many facets that belong to a cube, octahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, tetrakis hexahedron or disdyakis dodecahedron. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Diamonds (especially those with rounded crystal faces) are commonly found <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> nyf, an opaque gum-like skin.|$|E

5|$|Generally, yellow {{stingrays}} pay little heed to divers and can {{be approached}} closely. If stepped on or otherwise provoked, however, this ray will defend itself with its tail spine, <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> potent venom. The resulting wound is extremely painful, but seldom life-threatening. Small and docile, the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it requires {{a large amount of}} space (at least 180gal or 684L) and a fine, deep substrate with minimal ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, flocked Christmas {{trees in}} purple, gold, pink, and even black became popular. The trees' {{branches}} were <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> a chemically-created, flame retardant substance resembling snow. Sophisticated style mavens suggested {{developing a new}} Christmas tree theme every year and buying color coordinated ornaments. Natural trees would return to favor in the 1970s when country arts and crafts became popular.|$|E
5|$|The Glamorgan sausage is a Welsh {{vegetarian}} sausage. It {{contains no}} meat or skin, instead {{it is made}} with cheese, generally Caerphilly, but sometimes cheddar, along with leek or spring onion. This mixture is then <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> breadcrumbs and rolled into a sausage shape before cooking. Glamorgan sausages date back to at least the early 19th century, {{at which point the}} sausages would have contained pork fat.|$|E

40|$|Deposition of <b>coating</b> (<b>in</b> {{particular}} metallic) on polymer fabric adds new {{characteristics to}} it, for example, increased (decreased) reflection, electro conductivity, improved decorative characteristics, etc. Deposition of <b>coating</b> <b>in</b> vacuum is more progressive method compared to «liquid» methods. It is more environmentally friendly, gives good adhesion, {{in some cases}} it is the only possible way of coating deposition...|$|R

5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> clay. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Doggett, {{acting on}} Reyes' insistence that Ed is in danger, stakes out his house. Ed, however, is skinned {{regardless}} of Doggett's attempts to protect him. Reyes admits to Doggett {{that she is}} having flashes of the same premonitions that the victims are experiencing. She tells Doggett that Ed's body was gagged with a rag <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> coal dust from a mine, even though she has never seen his body. Reyes and Doggett head to the mine from which they believe the dust originated. Doggett finds the skeleton of a sheriff who killed himself in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> copper but {{containing}} primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies pose {{a risk of}} zinc toxicosis, {{which can}} be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter trojans {{are dark}} bodies with reddish, featureless spectra. No firm {{evidence}} {{of the presence of}} water, or any other specific compound on their surface has been obtained, but it is thought that they are <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> tholins, organic polymers formed by the Sun's radiation. The Jupiter trojans' densities (as measured by studying binaries or rotational lightcurves) vary from 0.8 to 2.5g·cm−3. Jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during {{the early stages of the}} Solar System's formation or slightly later, during the migration of giant planets.|$|E
5|$|Over 160 {{structures}} {{have been}} mapped at Iximche. The structures {{were faced with}} stone blocks that were <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> lime plaster, which in some cases was then painted with Mixtec-Puebla style murals, although few traces of the murals survive today. The Mixtec-Puebla style originated around AD 900 in central Mexico and spread from there throughout Mesoamerica. The superstructures of buildings at Iximche were built from adobe blocks and once supported beam and mortar roofs but none have survived. The platform cores were generally built of rough stones set in a clay matrix. A few of the structures have been restored and the site core is kept clear of overgrowth. Residential structures built on platforms around the ceremonial plazas usually had built-in benches and hearths.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} difficulty was encountered {{with the}} uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These somehow {{had to be}} <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a hot dipping process without success. Meanwhile, Alcoa tried canning. A new process for flux-less welding was developed, and 97% of the cans passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure {{rate of more than}} 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved welding technique with the help of General Electric, which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.|$|E

50|$|The precise {{historical}} {{evolution of the}} frock after {{the second half of}} the 18th century is obscure, however it is likely that the frock was gradually supplanted by the frock <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> the early 19th century, eventually being relegated to evening dress. The frock <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> turn became cut away into the modern coat, giving us the two modern coats with tails.|$|R
