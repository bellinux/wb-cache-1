It has {{the status of}} the cultural weal entered to the monument register under the decision of the Voivodship Monument Conservator of 17 December 1979. The villa-garden complex is situated in two lots within 192 m2, lot no. 27/13 with surface of 10,779 m² and lot no. 27/21 with surface of 19.412 m². The building is located in the surrounding of the Park named after Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski (surface 8.34 ha) covered by conservator’s protection of 21 July 2006. Kwiatkowski villa was built in 1927-1928 acc. to project of Konrad Kłos architect. The construction was performed by Construction Office of engineer Antoni Kiełbasiński and Company. It was made in the modernistic style, referring to neoclassicism. It is a detached, one-storey, three-axial, two-bay building partly cellared with originally roof void, based on a rectangular shape with eastern jutty. The Palace usable area - ca. 320 m², premises - ca. 180 m², <b>cubage</b> - 1,260 m3. The facade of Kwiatkowski villa: breaks with four-pillar porticos; cornice with banister balustrade, stone vases in the corners. North facade - front one is regular, five-axial, with small concave portico, hemispherical balcony on the first floor with banister balustrade, supported with four columns. In turn, the south, garden facade has regular nature, five-axial, big hemispherical terrace open to the park, with fan-shaped stairs and with a rectangular balcony on the first floor supported with pillars. Originally, Kwiatkowski Villa functioned as a comfortable company flat with a garden for the first main directors of the National Factory of Nitric Compounds in Mościce. Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, during his visit, stayed in this villa. Before world war II the building was a representational hotel. During war, it was the headquarters of the German main director of the factory and Feldgericht the German military summary court. Upon war, its rooms were used by e.g. ZHP team in Mościce, Plant Council, Voivodship National Council, City National Council, Association for Promoting Physical Activity, Retiree and Pensioner Club, SITPChem Association of Engineers and Technical Engineers in Chemical Industry, Plant Division of Polish Touristic-Landscape Community, touristic equipment rental, division of Technological University of Cracow, division of AGH University of Science and Technology, Commerce Department of Zakłady Azotowe in Tarnów-Mościce, Licence Department of Zakłady Azotowe in Tarnów-Mościce as well as ONT Export Office and Technical Support Office of Zakłady Azotowe in Tarnów-Mościce.

40|$|AbstractThe {{deformation}} work rate {{can be expressed}} by the time rate of pair functional potentials which describe the energy of materials in terms of atomic bonds and atom embedding interactions. According to Cauchy-Born rule, {{the relations between the}} microscopic deformations of atomic bonds and electron gas and macroscopic deformation are established. Further, atomic bonds are grouped according to their directions, and atomic bonds in the same direction are simplified as a spring-bundle component. Atom embedding interactions in unit reference volume are simplified as a <b>cubage</b> component. Consequently, a material model composed of spring-bundle components and a <b>cubage</b> component is established. Since the essence of damage is the decrease and loss of atomic bonding forces, the damage effect can be reflected by the response functions of these two kinds of components. Formulating the mechanical responses of two kinds of components, the corresponding elasto-damage constitutive equations are derived. Considering that slip is the main plastic deformation mechanism of polycrystalline metals, the slip systems of crystal are extended to polycrystalline, and the slip components are proposed to describe the plastic deformation. Based on the decomposition of deformation gradient and combining the plastic response with the elasto-damage one, the elasto-plastic damage constitutive equations are derived. As a result, a material model formulated with spring-bundle components, a <b>cubage</b> component and slip components is established. Different from phenomenological constitutive theories, the mechanical property of materials depends on the property of components rather than that directly obtained on the representative volume element. The effect of finite deformation is taken into account in this model. Parameter calibration procedure and the basic characteristics of this model are discussed...|$|E

Two approaches using the parable index were proposed, firstly using two support diameters and secondly using one support diameter in the obtaining of the taper equations. The methods were applied in the other trees and the plot volumes were obtained and compared with the cubed plots volume.

Although several cube storage structures for range sum queries and dynamic updates have been introduced recently. However, the complexities of both space and time are too higher to realistic. To solve this problem, a hierarchical data cube (HDC) and corresponding algorithms are provided in this paper. Both of the range query and update costs of HDC are O(log d n), and the overall cost is O((logn) 2 d) (under the C qC u model) or O(K (logn) d) (under the C qn q+C un u model).

The pine stand is 30 years old, was thinned, and presents density of about 200 trees/ha.

For the survey, targets were installed on the field in order to merge clouds of points obtained in two sweeps from different positions, and the scan was performed with a density of one point at every 10 mm.

Algorithms were implemented in Visual Basic for Applications to determine the variables of trunk height, diameter and volume. The diameters along the trunk were calculated by two different methods: Method 1 and 2, in the first one sets the diameter of each slice the distance between the farthest points, in the second a great center is adjusted by the Simplex method for each slice and the distance average between the points and center defines the radius of the section. The volume was calculated by the <b>cubage</b> Smalian method.
