50|$|A simple {{parallel}} plate capacitor has two conductors {{separated by a}} dielectric layer. Most of the energy in this system is concentrated directly between the plates. Some of the energy spills over into the area outside the plates, and the electric field lines associated with this effect are called fringing fields. Part of the challenge of making a practical <b>capacitive</b> <b>sensor</b> is to design a set of printed circuit traces which direct fringing fields into an active sensing area accessible to a user. A {{parallel plate}} capacitor {{is not a good}} choice for such a sensor pattern. Placing a finger near fringing electric fields adds conductive surface area to the capacitive system. The additional charge storage capacity added by the finger is known as finger capacitance, CF. The capacitance of the sensor without a finger present is denoted as CP in this article, which stands for parasitic capacitance.|$|E
50|$|Capacitive Sensors {{generate}} a dielectric field between the tire and sensor. As {{the distance between}} the tire and the sensor varies, the voltage and/or current properties of the dielectric field change. Analog circuitry is employed to measure the field changes and record the run-out waveform. Capacitive sensors have a larger area-of-interest, on the order of 10mm compared to the very narrow contact stylus method. The <b>capacitive</b> <b>sensor</b> method is one of the earliest technologies, and has proven highly reliable; however, the sensor must be positioned very close to the tire surface during measurement, so collisions between tire and sensor have led to long-term maintenance problems. In addition, some sensors are very sensitive to moisture/humidity and ended with erroneous readings. The 10mm area-of-interest also means that bulge measurement is limited to {{a small portion of the}} tire. Capacitive sensors employ void filtering to remove the effect of the voids between the tread lugs in radial runout measurement, and letter filtering to remove the effect of raised letters and ornamentation on the sidewall.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAmong {{the various}} {{label-free}} methods for monitoring biomolecular interactions, <b>capacitive</b> <b>sensors</b> stand out {{due to their}} simple instrumentation and compatibility with multiplex formats.

To minimize electrode polarization effects, <b>capacitive</b> <b>sensors</b> with 20 nm electrode separation were fabricated using silicon dioxide sacrificial layer techniques. The nanoscale separation of the capacitive electrodes in the sensor results in an enhanced overlapping of electrical double layers, and apparently a more ordered “ice-like” water structure.
