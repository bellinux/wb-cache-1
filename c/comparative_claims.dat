60|$|Whatever {{might be}} thought of the <b>comparative</b> <b>claims</b> of Aridæus and of Roxana's babe in respect to the {{inheritance}} of the Macedonian crown, it was plain that neither of them was capable of exercising any actual power--Alexander's son being incapacitated by his youthfulness, and his brother by his imbecility. The real power fell immediately {{into the hands of}} Alexander's great generals and counselors of state. These generals, on consultation with each other, determined not to decide the question of succession in favor of either of the two heirs, but to invest the sovereignty of the empire jointly in them both. So they gave to Aridæus the name of Philip, and to Roxana's babe that of Alexander. They made these two princes jointly the nominal sovereigns, and then proceeded, in their name, to divide all the actual power among themselves.|$|E
60|$|There was, of course, great {{diversity}} of opinion {{throughout the nation}} {{in regard to the}} <b>comparative</b> <b>claims</b> of these two princes, respectively. Some maintained that Æneas the Trojan became, by conquest, the rightful sovereign of Latium, irrespective of any rights that he acquired through his marriage with Lavinia, and that Iulus, as the son of his eldest son, rightfully succeeded him. Others contended that Lavinia represented the ancient and the truly legitimate royal line, and that Æneas Silvius, as her son and heir, ought to be placed upon the throne. And there were those who proposed to compromise the question, by dividing Latium into two separate kingdoms, giving up one part to Iulus, with Alba Longa for its capital, and the other, with Lavinium for its capital, to Æneas Silvius, Lavinia's heir. This proposition was, however, overruled. The two kingdoms, thus formed would be small and feeble, it was thought, and unable to defend themselves against the other Italian nations in case of war. The question was finally settled by a different sort of compromise. It was agreed that Latium should retain its integrity, and that Æneas Silvius, being the son both of Æneas and Lavinia, and thus representing both branches of the reigning power, should be the king, while Iulus and his descendants forever, should occupy the position, scarcely less inferior, of sovereign power in matters of religion. Æneas Silvius, therefore, and his descendants, became kings, and as such commanded the armies and directed the affairs of state, while Iulus and his family were exalted, in connection with them, to the highest pontifical dignities.|$|E

In order to verify the adequacy of mousses to comply the standards for the nutrient content and nutrient <b>comparative</b> <b>claims,</b> their composition and energy values were compared with the food legislation adopted currently in Brazil, the European Union (E.

Also, products with inulin could achieve the requisites for the “high” claim for dietary fibre. Nonetheless, important differences between the legislations for achieving some claims were noted, especially when the serving portion was used as standard instead of 100  g.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the types of economic and quality-of-life promotional claims the FDA considers false or misleading. MethodsPublicly available FDA letters (n = 569) sent to pharmaceutical companies from 1997 through 2001 for inappropriate promotional claims were reviewed. A standard data collection form was developed, including six categories for economic violations and three for QOL violations. For QOL, only letters with explicit violations for false or misleading claims using the words “quality of life” or patient “well-being” were considered. Other information collected included type of regulatory letter and media in which violations were found. ResultsTwenty-eight (4. 9 %) letters cited false and/or misleading economic claims. The most common economic violation was “unsupported <b>comparative</b> <b>claim</b> of effectiveness, safety, or interchangeability” (n = 14). Twenty-eight (4. 9 %) letters cited QOL violations, of which four contained both economic and QOL violations. The most common QOL violation was “lack of substantial evidence for QOL claims” (n = 15). None of the FDA letters used the term “patient reported outcomes. ” Violations were found most frequently in brochure and Web site-based promotions. ConclusionsThe body of evidence that is emerging illustrates how the FDA is regulating promotional material containing misleading or unsubstantiated economic and QOL claims. However, knowing what constitutes an appropriate claim remains challenging because there are no formal guidelines describing what constitutes a violation, nor what level of substantiating evidence is required. More guidance may be needed to ensure appropriate use of these claims in drug promotions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays. The first essay investigates how consumers' implicit theories influence their sensitivity to reward points. This paper demonstrates that consumers' susceptibility to reward points differs depending on their implicit theory. Incremental theorists, who believe in changeability, are process focused and susceptible to reward points, while entity theorists, who believe in fixedness, are outcome focused and display less sensitivity to reward points, unless their theories are violated or they are encouraged {{to focus on the}} process. The second essay examines maximizing and satisficing consumers' decisions when they are forced to make a trade-off between desirability and feasibility. This paper demonstrates that when facing a trade-off between desirability and feasibility, compared with satisficers, who pursue a "good enough" option, maximizers, who pursue the "best" option, emphasize the desirability of the outcome and choose a difficult-to-obtain option over a less desirable but easy-to-obtain option. The study shows that maximizers express greater purchase intentions when the aspects highlighted by maximal <b>comparative</b> <b>claims</b> match their preference for desirability, while satisficers express similar purchase intentions regardless of the orientation of maximal <b>comparative</b> <b>claims...</b>|$|E

Instead, law and courts in all three nations were central players in the battles over blood. Most strikingly, in comparison to the US, courts in France and Japan have been significantly more responsive to plaintiffs’ claims.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory {{actions against}} drug companies' health economic promotions from 2002 through 2011 {{to understand how}} frequently and in what circumstances the agency has considered such promotions false or misleading. MethodsWe reviewed all warning letters and notices of violation (“untitled letters”) issued by the FDA's Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications (DDMAC) to pharmaceutical companies from January 2002 through December 2011. We analyzed letters containing a violation related to “health economic promotion,” defined {{according to one of}} several categories (e. g., implied claims of cost savings due to work productivity or economic claims containing unsupported statements about effectiveness or safety). We also collected information on factors such as the indication and type of media involved and whether the letter referenced Section 114 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act. ResultsOf 291 DDMAC letters sent to pharmaceutical companies during the study period, 35 (12 %) cited a health economic violation. The most common type of violation cited was an implied claim of cost savings due to work productivity or functioning (found in 20 letters) and economic claims containing unsubstantiated <b>comparative</b> <b>claims</b> of effectiveness, safety, or interchangeability (7 letters). The violations covered various indications, mostly commonly psychiatric disorders (6 letters) and pain (6 letters). No DDMAC letter pertained to Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act Section 114. ConclusionThe FDA has cited inappropriate health economic promotions in roughly 12 % of the letters issued by the DDMAC. The letters highlight drug companies' interest in promoting the value of their products and the FDA's concerns in certain cases about the lack of supporting evidence...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe water {{footprint}} (WF) {{has been developed}} within the water resources research community as a volumetric measure of freshwater appropriation. The concept is used to assess water use along supply chains, sustainability of water use within river basins, efficiency of water use, equitability of water allocation and dependency on water in the supply chain. With the purpose of integrating the WF in life cycle assessment of products, LCA scholars have proposed to weight the original volumetric WF by the water scarcity in the catchment where the WF is located, thus obtaining a water-scarcity weighted WF that reflects the potential local environmental impact of water consumption. This paper provides an elaborate critique on this proposal. The main points are: (1) counting litres of water use differently based {{on the level of}} local water scarcity obscures the actual debate about water scarcity, which is about allocating water resources to competing uses and depletion at a global scale; (2) the neglect of green water consumption ignores the fact that green water is scarce as well; (3) since water scarcity in a catchment increases with growing overall water consumption in the catchment, multiplication of the consumptive water use of a specific process or activity with water scarcity implies that the resultant weighted WF of a process or activity will be affected by the WFs of other processes or activities, which cannot be the purpose of an environmental performance indicator; (4) the LCA treatment of the WF is inconsistent with how other environmental footprints are defined; and (5) the Water Stress Index, the most cited water scarcity metric in the LCA community, lacks meaningful physical interpretation. It is proposed to incorporate the topic of freshwater scarcity in LCA as a “natural resource depletion” category, considering depletion from a global perspective. Since global freshwater demand is growing while global freshwater availability is limited, it is key to measure the <b>comparative</b> <b>claim</b> of different products on the globe's limited accessible and usable freshwater flows...|$|R

40|$|The lucrative {{world of}} {{comparative}} advertising has been attractive to marketers, who seek economic types of persuasive communication. Nevertheless, {{research in the}} actual effectiveness of comparative advertising has been inconclusive, contradicting, and insufficient. The increasing importance of comparative advertising in the current competitive global environment requires immediate findings about how comparative advertising can work effectively. This study is the first study to develop an integrated conceptual model of the factors, which influence comparative advertising effectiveness. Particularly, the conceptual model comprehensively indicates that two advertising features (namely, intensity of <b>comparative</b> <b>claims,</b> and source attractiveness) and five characteristics of the ad recipients (namely, NFC, product involvement, gender, familiarity with comparative advertising, and culture) determine {{the effectiveness of a}} comparative ad. The study adopts a critical-realist approach and a multi-method design to explore the research topic. The research questions are addressed using qualitative and quantitative data in a cross-cultural approach. Two phases of exploratory interviews conducted in Greece and a series of pilot tests conducted in the UK and Greece inform an extensive experimental study of 820 participants to explore the research questions and test all research hypotheses. The research findings empirically validate the conceptual model of the study in both countries. It is largely confirmed that the above mentioned factors influence claim believability and perceptions of manipulation intent in comparative advertising. Further persuasion effects are also examined. The results of the study contribute to knowledge about comparative advertising effectiveness and provide information and guidance to practitioners on how to develop and implement effective comparative ads. Overall, comparative advertising is a powerful marketing tool, which has to be applied with caution as there are factors which can {{have a negative impact on}} comparative advertising effectiveness. The novel findings of this study endow future research with a new avenue to proceed...|$|E
40|$|Background Direct-to-consumer {{advertising}} (DTCA) {{has been}} present {{in some countries}} for nearly two decades. Its success and ramifications have been examined but not yet cataloged recently in a comprehensive manner. Objective To review existing literature studies {{on the topic of}} DTCA techniques to provide an analysis of the current methods considered by drug marketers to enhance the effect of pharmaceutical product promotion and its success, as well as examine ramifications on the drug use process. Methods A search of 7 electronic databases including MEDLINE and SCOPUS was conducted in December 2015, and updated until February 2016. A scientific review of literature (2008 – 2015) was performed to identify and collate information from relevant, peer reviewed original study articles investigating various DTCA techniques commonly employed in pharmaceutical promotion. A thematic analysis was undertaken to categorize categories of drug promotion, or techniques, and the saliency and impact of these. Results Nineteen original study articles were included in this review. All articles were based in the U. S. and New Zealand, where DTCA is legal. After reviewing all the articles, 4 themes with 11 subcategories were generated. These themes included disease mongering and medicalization, drug references, advertisement strategies and eDTCA. The themes describe different categories of techniques used to augment DTC advertisements to increase their impact and overall success in promoting a pharmaceutical product. Many DTCA techniques utilized by pharmaceutical marketers are beneficial to the success of DTC promotion of a drug. These techniques include the use of drug efficacy information, <b>comparative</b> <b>claims,</b> non-branded help seeking advertisements, formatted risks information, celebrity or expert endorsers and website trust factors. Through their use, public perception of the drug is made more favorable, increased attention is drawn to the advertisement, and the pharmaceutical product gains greater credibility and subsequent success in sales. However some techniques, although beneficial to pharmaceutical promotion, need to be monitored by policymakers and regulatory advisors, as they have the potential to negatively impact consumer health knowledge. Conclusion Overall, through this review it is evident {{that there are a number}} if techniques that employed by pharmaceutical marketers to augment the success of pharmaceutical promotion. While these techniques may be beneficial to pharmaceutical companies and might increase awareness amongst consumers, it is important to be critical of them, as they have the potential to be exploited by pharmaceutical marketers. This review indicated that although some techniques are successful and appear to be satisfactory in providing information to consumers, other techniques need to be appraised more closely...|$|E
40|$|Human {{judgment}} is basically comparative. This also holds for self-evaluations, which come about through social comparison. When comparing themselves to others, individuals often conclude {{that they are}} in various respects better. Little is known, however, about the interpersonal consequences of such self-superiority beliefs when they are verbally communicated to others. This dissertation aims to fill this gap. More specifically, it tests the hypothesis that people’s reaction to another person’s self-superiority claims depends on what they believe these claims say about them, rather than about the claimant. People may express their self-superiority beliefs in an explicitly comparative manner, by saying that they are “better than others”, or in an implicitly comparative manner, by saying that they are “good”. Although both claims derive from social comparison and basically convey the same message, observers (i. e., people observing these claims) respond unfavorably to the former type of claim but favorably to the latter. According to the hubris hypothesis, which is at the basis of this dissertation, observers do so because they infer from explicit (more than from implicit) self-superiority claims that the claimant holds a negative view of other people and therefore of them. This chain of inferences makes observers react unfavorably to the claim and the claimant. This dissertation extends previous research on the hubris hypothesis in several manners. First, it shows that observers’ disapproval of explicitly <b>comparative</b> <b>claims</b> is specific to self-superiority claims and does not reflect an aversion to any overtly conveyed self-other difference. Second, it experimentally demonstrates the importance of the view that observers believe the claimant has of them in determining their reactions to self-superiority claims. It does so by investigating observers’ responses to various explicit self-superiority claims that either rule out or particularly strongly suggest that the claimant views them unfavorably. Third, this dissertation demonstrates the role of observers’ inference about how the claimant views them via mediation analyses as well. These analyses consistently support the causal path that according to the hubris hypothesis leads from an explicit self-superiority claim to observers’ disapproval. Fourth and finally, this dissertation presents a novel test and an extension of the hubris hypothesis. The novel test involves the identification of an additional determinant of observers’ reactions to self-superiority claims. Not only the type of claim (explicit versus implicit) but also the content of the claim (competence versus warmth) affects these reactions. Observers dislike superiority claims about competence more than superiority claims about warmth, with the former dimension being more important to their self-view. The extension is at the level of observers’ reactions to self-superiority claims. Observers do not only ascribe less desirable traits to explicit (versus implicit) self-superiority claimants and claimants bragging about competence (versus about warmth), but they also wish to affiliate less with them and react more aggressively to them. The latter finding demonstrates that self-superiority claims may function as provocations. In sum, this dissertation shows that, rather than flattering the claimant, self-superiority claimants are ultimately viewed as derogating the observer. status: publishe...|$|E

This implies that self-superiority beliefs may provoke undesirable interpersonal consequences when they are explicitly communicated to others, but not when they are disguised as noncomparative positive self-claims or self-improvement claims. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Nutrition)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Motivation Processed {{complementary}} food labels should protect and promote optimal breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices, important determinants of child survival, growth and development, and provide information regarding safe and appropriate use. However, {{there is a}} lack of formal guidelines from international normative bodies on the appropriate marketing of {{complementary food}}s. In recognition of the need for interim guidance, the Maternal, Infant and Young Child Working Group developed the Draft Guide for Marketing Complementary Foods, which provides practical guidance on how the marketing (including labelling) of processed complementary foods and supplements can be informed by the principles of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (the Code) and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions in a way that supports optimal infant and young child feeding. Aim The aim of this study was to describe the extent to which the labelling practices (as a sub-set of marketing practices) of processed complementary food sold in South Africa comply with international guidance on the marketing of complementary foods that is fully aligned with the principles of the Code and subsequent relevant WHA resolutions (the Draft Guide for Marketing Complementary Foods). Methods Employing a cross-sectional study design, products were purchased from a sample of 17 retail grocery stores, three wholesale grocery stores, three retail pharmacies and three baby chain stores in the Gauteng, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces from June to August 2011. Purchased products were then compared with a master list of complementary food products compiled through desk research, and missing products were identified and purchased. Label information was captured, then blinded and the order of products randomised. The Draft Guide for Marketing Complementary Foods was used to create a checklist with pre-set answers and accompanying criteria against which the captured labelling practices were then analysed. Results One hundred and sixty product labels of 35 manufacturers were analysed, none of which complied with all checklist criteria. Fifty-six (35 %) labels did not provide an appropriate age of introduction, while 32 (20 %) labels used phrases implying that the product was suitable for use before six months of age. Thirty-seven (23 %) labels used images of infants appearing to be younger than six months. Only 20 (13 %) labels carried a message regarding the importance of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, and none provided a message on the importance of the addition of complementary foods from six months together with continued breastfeeding to two years or beyond. Eight (5 %) labels recommended feeding the product in a bottle and two labels (1 %) used an image of a feeding bottle. Nineteen (12 %) labels suggested a daily ration too large for a breastfed child, and 32 (20 %) potentially promote the manufacturer’s infant formula. All labels provided label information in an appropriate language, but 102 (64 %) labels relegated required label information to small text and were thus not easy to read. Only six (4 %) labels failed to provide instructions for safe and appropriate use, while 44 (28 %) did not include safety messages in their preparation and use instructions. Ten (6 %) labels did not provide storage instructions, and 27 (17 %) labels did not provide necessary warnings. Nutrient content claims, nutrient <b>comparative</b> <b>claims,</b> nutrient function/other function claims and reduction of disease risk claims were found on 126 (79 %), eight (5 %), 117 (73 %) and 10 (6 %) labels, respectively. Conclusion The labelling practices of processed complementary food labels in South Africa do not fully comply with international guidance on the marketing of complementary foods (the Draft Guide for Marketing Complementary Foods) and so do not sufficiently protect and promote optimal infant and young child feeding practices, revealing much room for improvement. Such guidance must be refined and formalised by international normative bodies and adopted into national legislation to assist manufacturers in ensuring that their complementary food labels meet an accepted standard and contribute towards the safe and appropriate use of processed complementary foods.

40|$|As the {{regulator}} of all national food advertising, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has {{expressed concern that}} consumers may be misled by certain <b>comparative</b> nutrient content <b>claims</b> in advertising. To help examine this issue, primary food shoppers were recruited and interviewed in three U. S. markets according to generally accepted procedures for advertising copy tests. The study employs a 2 (ad claim type) x 2 (nutrition knowledge) x 4 (disclosure type) between-subjects design using manipulated print advertisements. Misleading generalizations for absolute levels of sodium content beyond that of control ads are found for both specific and general nutrient content claims from experimentally manipulated soup advertisements. Effects of certain ad disclosure types {{are found to be}} dependent on ad claim type and on nutrition knowledge levels.

40|$|JavaScript {{is widely}} used in web-based {{applications}} and is increasing popular with developers. So-called browser wars {{in recent years have}} focused on Java-Script performance, specifically <b>claiming</b> <b>comparative</b> results based on benchmark suites such as Sun-Spider and V 8. In this paper we evaluate the behavior of JavaScript web applications from commercial web sites and compare this behavior with the benchmarks. We measure two specific areas of JavaScript runtime behavior: 1) functions and code and 2) events and handlers. We find that the benchmarks are not representative of many real web sites and that conclusions reached from measuring the benchmarks may be misleading. Specific common behaviors of real web sites that are underemphasized in the benchmarks include event-driven execution, instruction mix similarity, cold-code dominance, and the prevalence of short functions. We hope our results will convince the JavaScript community to develop and adopt benchmarks that are more representative of real web applications. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSection 114 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 {{regulates the}} {{promotion}} of health economic information by pharmaceutical companies to US health plans. Greater clarity is important given demands by payers and other stakeholders for evidence of value. ObjectivesTo develop hypothetical case studies of health economic promotions to examine legal and policy implications. MethodsWe constructed for pedagogical purposes 10 categories of potential health economic promotions. We generated hypothetical case studies for each category, including questions about whether each might be allowable under Section 114. The case studies were developed around the following categories: 1) costing out on-label clinical end points; 2) promotion of a costing exercise to physicians working in an accountable care organization setting; 3) burden-of-illness claims; 4) economic analysis of a formulary restriction policy; 5) extrapolations to doses, populations, or settings not covered in trials; 6) adherence claims; 7) “utilization of care” as a secondary end point in randomized clinical trials; 8) costing out a competitor drug’s adverse event; 9) economic analysis of <b>comparative</b> effectiveness <b>claims</b> using an indirect treatment comparison; and 10) extrapolating from surrogate to long-term outcomes in an economic model. DiscussionMost cases seem to fall into a gray zone given haziness around what constitutes “competent and reliable evidence” and “directly relate[d]” to an approved indication. In practice, {{it is difficult to}} know what the section allows given the imprecision of the statute and lack of guidance about its scope. ConclusionIdeally, future guidance will provide clarity and flexibility...|$|R
