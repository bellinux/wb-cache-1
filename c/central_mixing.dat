5000|$|Scarecrow joins {{forces with}} a man known only as the [...] "Arkham Knight," [...] a {{paramilitary}} commander who commands a militia that answers only to he and Scarecrow. In his latest campaign against Gotham, Scarecrow unites all of Gotham's criminals {{in an attempt to}} finally kill Batman. At the beginning of the game, Scarecrow threatens to release his new strain of fear toxin on the streets of Gotham, resulting in the evacuation of most of the city's civilian population. The Arkham Knight's militia then conquers Gotham, preventing the authorities from interfering with Scarecrow's plan. Batman soon discovers that Scarecrow's new fear gas is being manufactured at the ACE Chemicals plant. Defeating the militia there, Batman confronts Scarecrow in the <b>central</b> <b>mixing</b> chamber, where the villain informs Batman that Barbara Gordon has been captured, before locking the hero inside the imploding facility. Batman manages to reduce the blast radius and narrowly escape, after contending with a hallucination of the deceased Joker.|$|E
5000|$|Years later, {{after the}} Joker's death in Batman: Arkham City, {{there was a}} power vacuum in Gotham City’s {{criminal}} underworld. When crime rates plummeted without the Clown Prince of Crime’s iron grip over the city’s criminals, the Arkham Knight appeared in Gotham, forging an alliance with the Scarecrow. Together, the two united all of Gotham’s masterminds, crime lords, thugs, thieves and gangsters {{in an attempt to}} rid themselves of the Dark Knight once and for all. Scarecrow forced Gotham’s inhabitants to evacuate with his newest strain of fear toxin, allowing the Arkham Knight’s militia to take complete control over the city. In the beginning of the game, the Arkham Knight and his militia provide an escort for Scarecrow at ACE Chemicals, preventing Batman and the police from foiling their plans of covering the entire eastern seaboard with fear gas. When Batman arrives, the Arkham Knight tries to kill him with his chopper, only to be stopped by the Scarecrow (who wanted the Dark Knight to suffer first). Eventually, Batman reduced the chain reaction in the <b>central</b> <b>mixing</b> chamber, stopping the fear gas from being released. The Arkham Knight then kidnaps Oracle from her clock tower and holds her hostage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an efficient audio flow control method in {{the point of}} quantitative performance using TDM(Tree-structural Distributed-terminal Mixing), compared to existing P 2 P(Peer To Peer) method. In comparison with existing P 2 P method, using <b>central</b> <b>mixing</b> and distributed terminal mixing method, we achieved advance {{at the point of}} global network usage and each terminal's CPU load, and additionally we expect more session, more terminal can be served by same amount of network bandwidth and computers. By using P 2 P method in audio communication, speaker and listener must connect to each other. So it has the critical defect that as the participants grows more and more, the network bandwidth usage, each terminal's CPU load will grows rapidly. So the number of participants in same session will be extremely restricted. In comparison with P 2 P method, the <b>central</b> <b>mixing</b> method has the great advantage at the points of network usage and terminals CPU load. Regardless of the number of speakers and listeners, all the participants can speak and listen with all other participants by using just one stream's amount of data size and CPU load. But all the network usages and CPU loads of "Audio decompression->Buffering->Mixing->Audio Compression" are concentrated on central server. So the number of sessions and terminals can be participated in one server will be highly restricted. This study solves the problems of server's CPU load and network load by using TDM. The TDM is the method to distribute the overload for gathering, mixing and distributing the audio data according to each terminal’s up/down bandwidth and data processing capability using tree-structure. This method enables many terminals participate in the internet-broadcasting by distributing the overload of server to all the terminals...|$|E

40|$|Surgical trauma {{triggers}} neural, endocrine and inflammatory reactions {{with subsequent}} alterations in systemic and regional blood flow, {{blood pressure and}} metabolism. These changes are detectable after all major surgical procedures but are often more pronounced after cardiac surgery, probably because of blood exposure to artificial surfaces of the heart lung machine, temperature modulation (e. g. cooling and rewarming) and systemic and/or regional hypoxia. Hypoperfusion may lead to dysfunction in vital organs after cardiac surgery. Regional venous oxygenation reflects oxygen supply/demand balance and marked regional deoxygenation occurs during cardiopulmonary bypass. This thesis addresses two important perspectives of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) : 1. Central and regional oxygenation, and 2. The systemic inflammatory response. Ninety-three patients, undergoing elective cardiac surgery were included in four prospective, randomized and controlled studies. Three studies were performed during CPB (I-III) and one study (IV) was performed in the early postoperative phase. The relationship between <b>central</b> <b>mixed</b> and regional venous oxygenation was evaluated in Paper I. In Paper II it was investigated if a reduction in CPB flow, within the recommended range, affects central and regional oxygenation and if the degree of hypothermia affects central and regional venous oxygenation and inflammatory activation. In Paper III it was investigated if high dose insulin affects <b>central</b> <b>mixed</b> and hepatic venous oxygenation and inflammatory response and in Paper IV if skeletal muscle luxury perfusion is the sole effect of high dose insulin in cardiac surgery. Regional deoxygenation occurred during cardiopulmonary bypass, despite normal <b>central</b> <b>mixed</b> venous oxygenation. Reduction in pump flow, within the recommended range, reduced oxygenation in both central and regional venous blood. More pronounced hypothermia during CPB resulted in an improved oxygenation, but {{did not affect the}} inflammatory response. Insulin infusion improved oxygenation in both <b>central</b> <b>mixed</b> and hepatic venous blood, but did not affect the inflammatory response. The insulin-induced increase in cardiac output in the early phase after cardiac surgery could not be explained solely by a reduction of skeletal muscle vascular resistance...|$|R

40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{the temporal}} evolution and the spatial {{structure of the}} interface between two polymer melts involving three different species (A, A* and B). The first melt is composed of two different polymer species A and A* which are fairly indifferent to one another (Flory parameter chi_AA* ~ 0). The second melt is made of a pure polymer B which is strongly attracted to species A (chi_AB 0). We then show that, due to these contradictory tendencies, interesting properties arise during {{the evolution of the}} interface after the melts are put into contact: as diffusion proceeds, the interface structures into several adjacent "compartments", or layers, of differing chemical compositions, and in addition, the <b>central</b> <b>mixing</b> layer grows in a very asymmetric fashion.

40|$|International audienceMixing in viscous fluids is challenging, but chaotic {{advection}} {{in principle}} allows efficient mixing. In {{the best possible}} scenario, the decay rate of the concentration profile of a passive scalar should be exponential in time. In practice, several authors {{have found that the}} no-slip boundary condition at the walls of a vessel can slow down mixing considerably, turning an exponential decay into a power law. This slowdown affects the whole mixing region, and not just the vicinity of the wall. The reason is that when the chaotic mixing region extends to the wall, a separatrix connects to it. The approach to the wall along that separatrix is polynomial in time and dominates the long-time decay. However, if the walls are moved or rotated, closed orbits appear, separated from the <b>central</b> <b>mixing</b> region by a hyperbolic fixed point with a homoclinic orbit. The long-time approach to the fixed point is exponential, so an overall exponential decay is recovered, albeit with a thin unmixed region near the wall...|$|E

40|$|Uncertainties on <b>central</b> <b>mixing</b> in main {{sequence}} (MS) and core He-burning (He-B) phases affect key predictions of stellar evolution such as late evolutionary phases, chemical enrichment, ages etc. We propose {{a test of}} the extension of extra-mixing in two relevant evolutionary phases based on period spacing Delta_P of solar-like oscillating giants. From stellar models and their corresponding adiabatic frequencies (respectively computed with ATON and LOSC codes) we provide the first predictions of the observable Delta_P for stars in the red giant branch (RGB) and in the red clump (RC). We find: i) a clear correlation between Delta_P and the mass of the helium core (M_He); the latter in intermediate-mass stars depends on the MS overshooting, hence {{it can be used to}} set constraints on extra mixing during MS when coupled with chemical composition; ii) a linear dependence of the average value of the asymptotic period spacing (_a) during the He-B phase on the size of the convective core. A first comparison with the inferred asymptotic period spacing for Kepler RC stars suggests the need for extra mixing also during this phase, as evinced from other observational facts.

This is the first mid-IR time series ever obtained for a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia). These observations can be understood {{within the framework of}} the delayed detonation model and the production of ~ 0. 6 M ??? of 56 Ni, consistent with the observed brightness, the brightness decline relation, and the ??-ray fluxes. The [Co III] line at 11. 888 ??m is particularly useful for evaluating the time evolution of the photosphere and measuring the amount of 56 Ni and thus the mass of the ejecta. Late-time line profiles of SN 2014 J are rather symmetric and not shifted in the rest frame. We see argon emission, which provides a unique probe of mixing in the transition layer between incomplete burning and nuclear statistical equilibrium. We may see [Fe III] and [Ni IV] emission, both of which are observed to be substantially stronger than indicated by our models. If the latter identification is correct, then we are likely observing stable Ni, which might imply <b>central</b> <b>mixing.</b> In addition, electron capture, also required for stable Ni, requires densities larger than ~ 1 ?? 109 g cm??? 3, which are expected to be present only in white dwarfs close to the Chandrasekhar limit.

40|$|The {{convective}} overshoot mixing {{plays an}} important role in stellar structure and evolution. However, the overshoot mixing is a long standing problem. The uncertainty of the overshoot mixing is one of the most uncertain factors in stellar physics. As it is well known, the convective and overshoot mixing is determined by the radial chemical component flux. In this paper, a local model of the radial chemical component flux is established based on the hydrodynamic equations and some model assumptions. The model is tested in stellar models. The main conclusions are as follows. (i) The local model shows that the convective and overshoot mixing could be regarded as a diffusion process, and the diffusion coefficient for different chemical element is the same. However, if the non-local terms, i. e., the turbulent convective transport of radial chemical component flux, are taken into account, the diffusion coefficient for each chemical element should be in general different. (ii) The diffusion coefficient of convective / overshoot mixing shows different behaviors in convection zone and in overshoot region because the characteristic length scale of the mixing is large in the convection zone and small in the overshoot region. The overshoot mixing should be regarded as a weak mixing process. (iii) The result of the diffusion coefficient of mixing is tested in stellar models. It is found that a single choice of our <b>central</b> <b>mixing</b> parameter leads to consistent results for a solar convective envelope model as well as for core convection models of stars with mass from 2 M to 10 M.
