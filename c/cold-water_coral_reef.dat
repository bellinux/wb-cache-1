Organic carbon mineralization at cold-water coral reefs on the Norwegian margin occurred in: a) the reef surface framework consisting of living and dead coral thickets and b) the underlying sediments. Several cold-water coral mounds in the Gulf of Cadiz were influenced by ascending hydrocarbon-rich fluids and the diagenetic imprint of a sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) was evidenced. Carbonate preservation in the <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> associated sediments was controlled by the availability of reactive iron. The interplay of low rates of sulfate reduction and the input of terrigenous Fe-rich material led to a buffering of the pore-water carbonate system in the Norwegian reef sediments.

In a novel approach for these ecosystems, we used a spatially resolved complex three-dimensional flow model of hydrography to help explain assembly patterns. Forward-selection of distance-based Moran's eigenvector mapping (dbMEM) variables identified two submodels of spatial scales at which communities change: broad-scale (across reef) and fine-scale (within reef). Variance partitioning identified bathymetric and hydrographic gradients important in creating broad-scale assembly of species and traits. In contrast, fine-scale assembly was related more to processes that created spatially autocorrelated patches of fauna, such as philopatric recruitment in sessile fauna, and social interactions and food supply in scavenging detritivores and mobile predators.

40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{the interactive}} effects of hydrography, topography and intrinsic community dynamics influence the assembly of species and functional traits across multiple spatial scales of a <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> seascape. In a novel approach for these ecosystems, we use a spatially resolved complex three-dimensional flow model of hydrography to help explain assembly patterns. Forward selection of distance-based Moran's eigenvector mapping (dbMEM) variables identified two submodels of spatial scales at which communities are structured: broad-scale (across reef) and fine-scale (within reef). Canonical variance partitioning revealed broad-scale structures created mainly by variability in bathymetry and hydrography across reefs, which manifest as relatively narrow environmental niches for predators and scavenging detritivores. Fine-scale assembly was related more to processes that create spatially autocorrelated patches of fauna within a reef due to restricted dispersal in sessile fauna but social mating interactions and food supply in more mobile organisms.

Deciphering principle patterns of bacterial community variation over multiple spatial scales may however prove critical for {{a better understanding of}} factors contributing to <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> stability and functioning. Methodology/Principal Findings: Bacterial community structure, as determined by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA), was investigated with respect to (i) microbial habitat type and (ii) coral species and color, as well as the three spatial components (iii) geomorphologic reef zoning, (iv) reef boundary, and (v) reef location. Communities revealed fundamental differences between coral-generated (branch surface, mucus) and ambient microbial habitats (seawater, sediments). This habitat specificity appeared pivotal for determining bacterial community shifts over all other study levels investigated. Coral-derived surfaces showed species-specific patterns, differing significantly between Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata, but not between L. pertusa color types. Within the reef center, no community distinction corresponded to geomorphologic reef zoning for both coral-generated and ambient microbial habitats.

Two vibrocores containing coral clasts and associated fauna embedded in a matrix of marine sediment were taken at the Mingulay Reef Complex, an inshore (~ 120 – 190 m water depth) L. pertusa reef off western Scotland. The cores were scanned using computed x-ray tomography (CT scan) {{with the aim of}} (1) reconstructing and quantifying the relative abundance and preservation of coral fragments in the cores, (2) identifying distinct reef facies, and hence (3) providing data {{that could lead to a}} conceptual model of reef growth. U-series dates were obtained on L. pertusa clasts from the two sediment cores to provide a temporal framework of the reef build-up. After exploring a range of methods for processing CT scans, three simple parameters were used to classify different strata within the cores: the overall density of the cores, the number of fossil clasts, and the sum of the area of clasts detected by the CT scan. These parameters were validated by comparing with density measurements from a multi-sensor core logger (MSCL) and physical dissection and analysis of fossils in the cores. From the CT scan analyses, three distinct reef facies were evident: Coral-Rich, Sediment-Rich and Shelly-Coral Hash Layers.

We examine how this could be tackled using the example of <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> which provide a number of ecosystem services but are vulnerable to both managed pressures (e. g. deep-water trawling) and unmanaged pressures (e. g. ocean acidification).

In this study, twelve sponge species from three <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> off Norway were investigated for the relationship between sponge phylogenetic classification (species and family level), as well as sponge type (high versus low microbial abundance), and the diversity of sponge-associated bacterial communities, taking also geographic location and water depth into account. Community analysis by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) showed that as many as 345 (79 %) of the 437 different bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in the dataset were shared between sponges and sediments, while only 70 (16 %) appeared purely sponge-associated. Furthermore, changes in bacterial community structure were significantly related to sponge species (63 % of explained community variation), sponge family (52 %) or sponge type (30 %), whereas mesoscale geographic distances and water depth showed comparatively small effects (< 5 % each). In addition, a highly significant, positive relationship between bacterial community dissimilarity and sponge phylogenetic distance was observed within the ancient family of the Geodiidae.

Multibeam echosounder bathymetry data, backscatter data and high-resolution seismic profiles were used to identify cold-water coral reefs. Together 12 cold-water coral reefs were mapped. Coral reefs have the highest density of up to 1. 39 reefs per km² on top of ridges of morainic origin and they occur in areas where the seafloor is represented by hard bottom sediments. Moraine ridges are often cut by erosional channels; those probably have a positive influence on the transport and concentration of food particles. Numerous pockmarks were observed in the sedimentary basin in the northeast from the main coral reef concentration. The data suggest that the development and lateral distribution of reefs in the Fugløy area is characterized by an interaction between biological growth processes and factors like seepage of fluid from pockmarks, local topography, hard substrate and current regime. The vertical distribution is most likely controlled by physical oceanographic conditions like temperature, salinity and density.

40|$|Cold-water {{coral reefs}} are {{hotspots}} of biodiversity and biogeochemistry in the deep-sea, solely fuelled by external energy sources. Hence, food input, processing and recycling {{play a major}} role in the functioning of these ecosystems. In this thesis we aimed to study energy flow and metabolism of <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> ecosystems by assessing the uptake and processing of different food sources by key species of the community (corals, worms and sponges) while including their (non-) trophic interactions and their impact on ecosystem functioning. Stable isotope as deliberately added tracers (13 C and 15 N) and bulk and compound specific isotope analysis were the major tools used throughout this study. Feeding experiments on the reef-building cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa, described in chapter 2, revealed that the coral can assimilate a broad range of organic food sources at comparable rates, indicating an opportunistic feeding strategy. Together with its microbial symbionts it is able to even access inorganic nutrients, such as bicarbonate and various nitrogen species, highlighting the previously unrecognized mixotrophic nature of the coral (chapter 3). Observations on the interaction between L. pertusa, the worm Eunice norvegica and the sponge Hymedesmia coriacea further showed that next to microbial symbionts associated macrospecies can also influence feeding and growth of the coral. Accordingly, results of the study observing the interaction between the worm E. norvegica and L. pertusa, described in chapter 4, demonstrated that the worm can enhance its food uptake in the presence of the coral while the coral kept assimilation constant by increasing the consumption of smaller algae particles less favored by the polychaete. Furthermore in the presence of the worm the coral increased skeletal formation (calcification). Given its effect on coral calcification the relationship might be of high importance for reef development and resilience. The interaction between the sponge H. coriacea and the coral, studied in chapter 5, however was characterized by a trophic transfer between both species via coral mucus, partly mediated by bacteria associated with the sponge. Subsequently, the sponge utilized the coral mucus to produce sponge-derived detritus, which can be feed upon by many species of the community, including the coral itself. The result might be a recycling of energy and nutrients which increases ecosystem functioning. In conclusion this thesis shows that the cosmopolitan reef building coral L. pertusa is an opportunistic feeder, exploiting a broad range of organic and inorganic resources. It further demonstrates that associates species can positively affect coral nutrition and growth and thereby can enhance <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> ecosystem functioning...|$|E

The study is based on underwater video and sidescan sonar. The reef complex covered an area of approximately 490 × 1300 m, at 280 – 400 m depth. It consisted of several small mounds (< 3 m high) where the scleractinian Lophelia pertusa occurred as live colonies, dead blocks and skeletal rubble.

Substrate type (coral structure, rubble, exposed hardground or soft sediment) was also recorded. Variations in the densities of these fauna (with respect to both reef complex and substrate type) were investigated, with spatial covariance between species assessed. For the majority of fauna investigated, densities varied by both reef and substrate. Spatial covariance indicated that some species may be utilising similar habitat niches, but that minor environmental differences may favour colonisation by one or other at a particular reef. Fish densities were generally higher in regions with biogenic substrate (coral structure and coral rubble substrates) than in areas of soft or hardground substrate. Further, fish were more abundant at the northerly Sotbakken Reef at time of study than elsewhere.

We also investigated shrimp distribution patterns on the local scale ( We found shrimp abundances at the Røst reef to be on average an order of magnitude greater in biogenic reef habitats than in non-biogenic habitats.

In non-biogenic habitats shrimp densities were &minus; 2 . We conclude that CWC reef habitats clearly support greater shrimp densities than the surrounding non-biogenic habitats on the Norwegian margin...|$|E
40|$|The {{finding of}} a {{previously}} undescribed <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> (Banana Reef) in the Scottish Mingulay reef complex, with denser coverage of living Lophelia pertusa than the principal Mingulay 1 Reef, was {{the incentive for}} a comparative study of the food supply to the 2 reefs. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) samples from the surface and bottom water covering a tidal cycle were compared with respect to lipids, pigments, and delta C- 13 and delta N- 15. Lipid profiles and stable isotope signatures of SPM were {{compared with those of}} coral tissue samples. Concurrently, hydrographic measurements were conducted to track the movement of the water masses across both reefs. Between-reef differences in SPM lipid concentrations were small compared to those in coral tissue. Corals at Banana Reef had lower lipid concentrations, pointing to less favourable food conditions than at Mingulay 1. Stable isotopes signatures and lipid profiles showed that corals on both reefs feed primarily on surface algal matter, within the timeframe of our study. At Mingulay 1, fresh microalgae are supplied to the coral reef by local downwelling. This downwelling pulse is tidally advected to Banana Reef. Food conditions observed during this study at both reefs do not explain the between-reef difference in coral coverage. A speculative explanation for the denser coral coverage at the deeper Banana Reef encompasses the slightly lower temperature that exhibits lower metabolic stress on corals, in combination with a higher current speed and particle encounter rate...|$|E
40|$|In many marine biogeographic realms, bioeroding sponges {{dominate}} the internal bioerosion of calcareous substrates such as mollusc beds and coral reef framework. They biochemically dissolve {{part of the}} carbonate and liberate so-called sponge chips, {{a process that is}} expected to be facilitated and accelerated in a more acidic environment inherent to the present global change. The bioerosion capacity of the demosponge Cliona celata Grant, 1826 in subfossil oyster shells was assessed via alkalinity anomaly technique based on 4 days of experimental exposure to three different levels of carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO 2) at ambient temperature in the cold-temperate waters of Helgoland Island, North Sea. The rate of chemical bioerosion at present-day pCO 2 was quantified with 0. 08 - 0. 1 kg/m** 2 /year. Chemical bioerosion was positively correlated with increasing pCO 2, with rates more than doubling at carbon dioxide levels predicted {{for the end of the}} twenty-first century, clearly confirming that C. celata bioerosion can be expected to be enhanced with progressing ocean acidification (OA). Together with previously published experimental evidence, the present results suggest that OA accelerates sponge bioerosion (1) across latitudes and biogeographic areas, (2) independent of sponge growth form, and (3) for species with or without photosymbionts alike. A general increase in sponge bioerosion with advancing OA can be expected to have a significant impact on global carbonate (re) cycling and may result in widespread negative effects, e. g. on the stability of wild and farmed shellfish populations, as well as calcareous framework builders in tropical and <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to map <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> mounds. The study area used for this mapping exercise is located approximately 13 km east of the island of Mingulay (56 ° 50 ′N, 7 ° 30 ′W) and is known as the Mingulay Reef Complex. The approach adopted consists on the combination of the Bathymetric Position Index tool for habitat mapping and the semi-automated mapping method developed initially to map pockmarks at seabed. During this exercise, 354 <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> were successfully mapped. The results of this test-of-concept supported the creation of a customised tool for semi-automated mapping of <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reefs,</b> to derive <b>coral</b> mound attributes from multibeam datasets without interpreter bias...|$|R

Ecohydrodynamics play {{a pivotal role in}} the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, however the lack of integrated complex flow models for deep-water ecosystems beyond the coastal zone prevents further synthesis in these settings. We present a hydrodynamic model for one of Earth’s most biologically diverse deep-water ecosystems, <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reefs.</b> The Mingulay Reef Complex (western Scotland) is an inshore seascape of <b>cold-water</b> <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> formed by the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa. We applied single-image edge detection and composite front maps using satellite remote sensing, to detect oceanographic fronts and peaks of chlorophyll a values that likely affect food supply to corals and other suspension-feeding fauna. We also present a high resolution 3 D ocean model to incorporate salient aspects of the regional and local oceanography. Model validation using in situ current speed, direction and sea elevation data confirmed the model’s realistic representation of spatial and temporal aspects of circulation at the reef complex including a tidally driven current regime, eddies, and downwelling phenomena. This novel combination of 3 D hydrodynamic modelling and remote sensing in deep-water ecosystems improves our understanding of the temporal and spatial scales of ecological processes occurring in marine systems. The modelled information has been integrated into a 3 D GIS, providing a user interface for visualization and interrogation of results that allows wider ecological application of the model and that can provide valuable input for marin...|$|R
