50|$|In 1844 the {{decision}} to upgrade current guns into more rapid firing percussion muskets was made. <b>Cap</b> <b>lock</b> gun production started in 1845.|$|E
50|$|A {{percussion}} <b>cap</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism styled on the patilla and romanlock pattern miquelets {{was used}} on pistols and sporting guns {{right up to}} the advent of the cartridge firearm. Sculpturing of the hammer in the form of wildlife (lions, dogs, mythical beasts, or fish) was a common practice on these percussion miquelet locks. Miquelets fashioned in this way were particularly well represented by the gunmakers of Eibar.|$|E

50|$|Typing case-sensitive {{passwords}} {{that are}} not displayed verbatim on the screen may cause mistakes when <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> is on. Help guides, tech support materials, and sometimes the interface itself may include advice on checking <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> before typing a password. In Windows login screens, a warning that <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> is on is shown in a balloon near the field. In Mac OS X, when <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> is on, a <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> symbol (⇪) is displayed inside a password field. Operating systems may also provide audible notifications when <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock,</b> Num lock, or Scroll lock buttons are toggled.|$|R
50|$|In ex-USSR Unix community, <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> key is {{traditionally}} {{used as input}} language switcher, convenient for usage with touch typing. Support for this is present in KDE, GNOME and other desktop environments. Default Russian, Ukrainian layouts for FreeBSD specifies <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> as input language switcher. Additional programs {{can be used for}} this goal in Microsoft Windows,. The original <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> function is reached in such layouts with Shift + <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock.</b>|$|R

5000|$|When the <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> key is {{repeatedly}} pressed approx. 10 times, the <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> LED {{turning on}} and off each time indicates the CPU is correctly reading the CIAs. If the <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> LED sticks on or off, the CPU is not servicing CIA interrupt requests.|$|R

50|$|A {{version of}} <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> that behaves like a {{traditional}} Shift lock does exist on certain layouts {{such as the}} French AZERTY. Some operating systems and window managers allow <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> {{to be used for}} a similar function. This behavior of the <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> survives, however, in German and Austrian QWERTZ keyboards.|$|R
50|$|While {{the typical}} locking {{behaviour}} on keyboards with <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> key {{is that of}} a toggle, each press reversing the shift state, some keyboard layouts implement a combi mode, where pressing a Shift key in <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> mode will also release the <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> mode, just as it typically happens in Shift lock mode.|$|R
25|$|<b>Caps</b> <b>lock</b> is {{replaced}} by Shift lock, thus affecting non-letter keys as well. However, there is an ongoing evolution towards a <b>Caps</b> <b>lock</b> key instead of a Shift lock.|$|R
25|$|An {{additional}} defining (albeit optional) {{feature of}} the Colemak layout {{is the lack of}} a <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> key; an additional Backspace key occupies the position typically occupied by <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> on modern keyboards.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{computer}} keyboards in Poland {{are laid out}} according to the standard US visual and functional layout. Polish diacritics are accessed by using the AltGr key with a corresponding similar letter from the base Latin alphabet. Normal capitalization rules apply with respect to Shift and <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> keys. For example, to enter [...] "Ź", one can type Shift+AltGr+X with <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> off, or turn on <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> and type AltGr+X.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{keyboard}} layout used, holding down the shift key while <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> is already on is either ignored (because all keys are already shifted), will also shift keys which are not being shifted by <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> alone (see above) or effectively invert the shifting status of each key, so that where <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> shifts all keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch to lowercase again, whereas on a keyboard where <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> only shifts alphabet keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch the alpha keys to lowercase while shifting the number row as normal. Some keyboard layouts implement a fourth variant, where Shift will temporarily invoke two different sets of alternative key definitions depending on if <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> is currently active or not. The inverting behaviour of the Shift key {{is the most common}} variant on English keyboards.|$|R
5000|$|Alphanumeric (eisū) toggles {{alphanumeric}} characters. In the Japanese 106/109-key layout, it {{is located}} on the <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> key. Pressing Alphanumeric/Caps Lock key alone actually means alphanumeric function, a user has to press [...] key to get <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> function.|$|R
50|$|Typical <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> {{behaviour}} is that {{pressing the}} key sets an input mode {{in which all}} typed letters are uppercase by default (i.e. in All caps). The keyboard remains in <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> mode until the key is pressed again.|$|R
5|$|There are two {{versions}} of the PowerBook100's QWERTY layout keyboard: a domestic US version with 63keys and an international ISO version with 64keys. The <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> key on the PowerBook100 did not have a locking position or a lighted indicator of its status, and to compensate, the System7 operating system software includes an extension file that causes an icon of the international <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> symbol (⇪) to appear in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar when <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> is active.|$|R

50|$|<b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> (stylized as CAPS LOCK) is {{the fourteenth}} studio album by the Japanese electronica band Capsule, {{released}} on October 23, 2013, by Warner Music Japan's sublabel Unborde as their first album release under the label. It was released digitally by iTunes on October 16, 2013. <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> debuted at number seven and thirteen of the Oricon Daily and Weekly Albums Chart, respectively, with 11,805 copies sold {{in its first}} week of release.|$|R

5000|$|The {{keyboards}} of {{some early}} computer terminals, including the Teletype Model 33 ASR and Lear-Siegler ADM-3A, the Apple II, and early {{models of the}} IBM PC, {{as well as a}} few Apple Keyboard models, positioned the Control key on the left of the keyboard, where <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> resides on most modern keyboards. This layout was preserved for later workstation systems and is often associated with Unix workstations. Keyboards from Sun Microsystems came in two layouts; [...] "Unix" [...] and [...] "PC-style", with the Unix layout having the traditional placing of the Control key and other keys. The Commodore Amiga computers all had Control key to the left, next to a tiny <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> key, inactivating the rarely used <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> key from the Amiga Operating System was very common. The keyboards produced for One Laptop Per Child computers also have the Control key in this location. Other vendors produce keyboards for different computer systems with this placement of the Control key, such as the Happy Hacking Keyboard. Beginning with the Google Cr-48, Chromebooks have replaced <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> with a dedicated [...] "Search" [...] key.|$|R

25|$|The Cr-48's {{hardware}} design broke convention by replacing certain keys with shortcut keys, {{such as the}} function keys, and replacing the <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> key with a dedicated search key, which can be changed back to <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> in the OS's keyboard settings. Google addressed complaints that the operating system offers little functionality when the host device is not connected to the Internet, demonstrated an offline version of Google Docs, and announced a 3G plan that would give users 100MB of free data each month, with additional paid plans available from Verizon.|$|R
2500|$|Negroponte {{has demanded}} that the {{keyboard}} not contain a <b>caps</b> <b>lock</b> key, which frees up keyboard space for new keys such as a future [...] "view source" [...] key.|$|R
50|$|On {{computers}} running Windows, Alt-Shift switches between keyboard layouts. Holding down a Shift key (or pressing <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock)</b> in Windows {{produces the}} uppercase Latin letter {{without the need}} to switch layouts.|$|R
