5|$|The {{proboscis}} (plural – proboscises) {{is formed}} from maxillary galeae and is adapted for sucking nectar. It {{consists of two}} tubes held together by hooks and separable for cleaning. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> up which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head. The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest and extended only when feeding. The maxillary palpi are reduced and even vestigial. They are conspicuous and five-segmented {{in some of the}} more basal families and are often folded.|$|E
5|$|The fitting {{shop was}} {{designed}} to manufacture 40 locomotives {{a year and a}} total of 300 were produced in the next eight years. The first locomotive, given its trial in May 1854, was named Lady Elgin, after the wife of the Governor General of Canada of the time, the Earl of Elgin. For the bridge hundreds of thousands of components were required and all were manufactured in Birkenhead or in other English factories to Brassey's specifications. These were all stamped and coded, loaded into ships to be taken to Quebec and then by rail {{to the site of the}} bridge for assembly. The <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> of the bridge contained over 10,000 pieces of iron, perforated by holes for half a million rivets, and when it was assembled every piece and hole was true.|$|E
25|$|The {{floating}} {{drift tube}} klystron {{has a single}} cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated <b>central</b> <b>tube.</b> Electrically, {{this is similar to}} the two cavity oscillator klystron with a lot of feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.|$|E

25|$|In {{species of}} Lepidoptera, it {{consists}} of two tubes held together by hooks and separable for cleaning. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> through which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head. The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest, and is extended only when feeding. The maxillary palpi are reduced or even vestigial. They are conspicuous and five-segmented {{in some of the}} more basal families, and are often folded. The shape and dimensions of the proboscis have evolved to give different species wider and therefore more advantageous diets. There is an allometric scaling relationship between body mass of Lepidoptera and length of proboscis from which an interesting adaptive departure is the unusually long-tongued hawk moth Xanthopan morganii praedicta. Charles Darwin predicted the existence and proboscis length of this moth before its discovery based on his knowledge of the long-spurred Madagascan star orchid Angraecum sesquipedale.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{box section}} {{comprised}} two 9.8-metre wide dual lane traffic tubes and a 1.35 metres wide twin walled <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> for services and emergency access. The 1.2-metre thick base slab was cast first, {{followed by the}} 50cm thick central walls. [...] The outer walls and roof were cast together in a single operation, in six nominal 20-metre lengths, using special travelling formwork. [...] This was struck inside the formed section, moved along to the next length and then jacked up into position, each within a 72-hour cycle. [...] Each 1000 cubic metre pour required approximately 1500 square metres of formwork. The inside shutters for the outer walls were vertical steel section panels and Alform Beam walers, which were attached to the top slab of the special steel traveller, while the outer shutters were crane handled vertical steel section panels with Alform Beam or steel channel walers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{last two}} V8's, the T and the 100hp were not successful. [...] Though tested, they never flew. [...] The type T {{introduced}} steel cylinders {{and was an}} overhead-valve engine with vertically mounted valves operated from a central camshaft by thin pull rods and rockers. [...] The carburettor was mounted centrally at the front, feeding a <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> which ran {{to the back of}} the engine, divided and ran back along each cylinder bank. Dual magneto/coil and battery ignition was provided. [...] The 100hp engine was also an overhead-valve engine in the sense that the port opened directly into the cylinder head, though the valves were mounted horizontally. [...] This arrangement required an unusual shape of combustion chamber but enabled the valves to be operated directly from a central crankshaft raised on pillars to cylinder head height. Vibrations of this crankshaft and weakness of a new cylinder head restraint system dogged the engine, the last E.N.V. made.|$|E

50|$|Are {{composed}} {{of a combination of}} flat membrane sheets separated by a thin meshed spacer material which serves as a porous plastic screen support. These sheets are rolled around a <b>central</b> perforated <b>tube</b> and fitted into a tubular steel pressure vessel casing. The feed solution passes over the membrane surface and the permeate spirals into the <b>central</b> collection <b>tube.</b> Spiral-wound modules are a compact and cheap alternative in ultrafiltration design, offer a high volumetric throughput and can also be easily cleaned. However it is limited by the thin channels where feed solutions with suspended solids can result in partial blockage of the membrane pores.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell body}} itself was not lethal: its sole {{function}} was {{to transport the}} bullets close to the target, and it {{fell to the ground}} intact after the bullets were released. A battlefield where a shrapnel barrage had been fired was afterwards typically littered with intact empty shell bodies, fuzes and <b>central</b> <b>tubes.</b> Troops under a shrapnel barrage would attempt to convey any of these intact fuzes they found to their own artillery units, as the time setting on the fuze could be used to calculate the shell's range and hence identify the firing gun's position, allowing it to be targeted in a counter-barrage.|$|R
2500|$|The OA vz. 30's armored {{body was}} {{mounted on a}} Tatra 6 x 4 T-72 truck chassis. The chassis design was unusual {{as it was a}} <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> design with {{independently}} sprung rear half-axles which gave good cross-country performance. The driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by an armored shutter with a vision slit. The assistant driver sat on the left and had a small vision port for his ZB vz. 26 machine gun. It was mounted in a firing slit directly to his front. There were similar vision ports on both sides. The crew accessed the fighting compartment from a door {{in the rear of the}} vehicle. The gunner sat in a small, cylindrical turret with 360° of traverse. It had an observation port in the front and vision slits on both sides and the rear. The turret had another ZB vz. 26 light machine gun in a ball mount. Another machine gun was carried inside the vehicle. 3000 rounds were stored for the machine guns. The armor ranged between [...] thick; this was deemed enough to deflect ordinary bullets fired from over [...] distance.|$|E

50|$|The ICP can be {{retained}} in the quartz torch because the flow of gas between the two outermost tubes keeps the plasma away from {{the walls of the}} torch. A second flow of argon (around 1 liter per minute) is usually introduced between the <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> and the intermediate tube to keep the plasma away {{from the end of the}} <b>central</b> <b>tube.</b> A third flow (again usually around 1 liter per minute) of gas is introduced into the <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> of the torch. This gas flow passes through the centre of the plasma, where it forms a channel that is cooler than the surrounding plasma but still much hotter than a chemical flame. Samples to be analyzed are introduced into this central channel, usually as a mist of liquid formed by passing the liquid sample into a nebulizer.|$|E
5000|$|A central draught lamp, or Argand lamp, {{works in}} the same manner as the flat wick lamp. The burner is {{equipped}} with a tall glass chimney, of around 12 inches tall or taller, to provide the powerful draft this lamp requires to burn properly. The burner uses a wick, usually made of cotton, that is made of a wide, flat wick rolled into a tube, the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick. The tubular wick is then mounted into a [...] "carrier," [...] which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered. The wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes; the inner wick <b>tube</b> (<b>central</b> draft <b>tube)</b> provides the [...] "central draft" [...] or draft that supplies air to the flame spreader. When the lamp is lit, the <b>central</b> draft <b>tube</b> supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly.|$|R
