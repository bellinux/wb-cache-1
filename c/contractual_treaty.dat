At the same time these human rights protect vital matters, such as the right to adequate food, which obviously has a relationship to the right to life. On the other hand, the annexes to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement, which are binding on all WTO member States, has implied a shift from the old General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) to the WTO, from pure <b>contractual</b> <b>treaties</b> to more standardsetting treaties. The article seeks to analyse if the obligations erga omnes and the concept of ‘multilateral obligations’ are applicable to distinguish between human rights treaties {{on the one hand and}} WTO agreements on the other. The background of the analysis is also the work of the International Law Commission (ILC) Study Group on fragmentation of international law, finalised in 2006. The article finds that there is still uncertainty regarding the exact meaning of the term ‘multilateral obligations’. Hence, other concepts such as ‘absolute obligations’ might be preferred in order to characterise human rights treaties, and hence implicitly acknowledge that treaties that protect vital matters may prevail over other treaties, based on the interests which are to be protected...|$|R

There is some question whether the courts are able to include in policy decisions those values that are not derived from economic utility. In this article, the values represented by traditional Native American beliefs about nature and particularly water are examined. While Native Americans have won some court battles over water, the judges have usually decided on the basis of <b>contractual</b> and <b>treaty</b> agreements and {{not on the basis of}} the preservation of traditional values. Cases arising in the Great Plains reflect this tendency in judicial thinking...|$|R
50|$|The Treaty of Münsingen {{was signed}} on December 14, 1482. This accord officially reunited the divided county of Württemberg {{after it was}} divided by the Treaty of Nürtingen in 1442. The {{hereditary}} dispute between the Stuttgart part and the part of Urach were settled after 40 years. Residing in Urach, Count Eberhard V, later Duke Eberhard I of Württemberg, obtained rule and moved the capital to Stuttgart. The succession was laid down for the ruling count in the Stuttgart part of the country, Eberhard VI. With this treaty, that was worked out with collaboration {{of the council of}} Württembergian subjects, the indivisibility of Württemberg and the primogeniture became <b>contractual.</b> The <b>treaty</b> prevented the division of Württemberg and thus was an important step to the exaltation to a duchy in 1495. The original document is stored in the main public record office in Stuttgart.|$|R
40|$|The {{university}} {{model of}} enterprise type of 21 st century is analyzed. The transfer of classical university model into entrepreneurial one presents {{a threat to}} the university cultural mission. The Science and Education become more valuable as they produce knowledge, which becomes an item of goods. The authors compare modern university model with classic one. Following the hermeneutical method, the modern epoch is presented as a period of economic mercantilism and knowledge is interpreted as symbolic capital. In addition to that, the formation premise of the education market and open knowledge market are analyzed. The transformation of university structures is explored in the context of knowledge capitalization process. The article shows the knowledge as a source of innovation and the university as a result of commercial competition. The interconnection between the modern university and the mainstreaming of research project results into new technologies is based on <b>contractual</b> relationship (<b>treaty</b> relations). This relationship is defined by the term "innovation zone", which presents the final phase of the innovation cycle. We conclude that in the context of “knowledge capitalism” universities become the means of competition for global leadership in the high technologies...|$|R
50|$|Mediation's {{effectiveness}} in trans-border disputes has been questioned, but {{an understanding of}} fundamental mediation principles points to the unlimited potential of mediation in such disputes. Mediators explicitly address and manage cultural and language differences in detail during the process. Voluntary referral to mediation is not required—many mediations reach the table through binding <b>contractual</b> provisions, statutes, <b>treaties,</b> or international agreements and accords. The principle of voluntariness applies {{to the right of}} parties to self-determination once they are in the mediation—not to the mechanism for initiating the mediation process. Many mediations also result form mutual consent because they are non-binding and they encourage the exploration of interests and mutual benefits of an agreement. Because the parties, themselves, create the terms of agreement, compliance with mediated settlement agreements is relatively high. Any compliance or implementation issues can be addressed by follow-up mediation, regular compliance monitoring, and other processes.|$|R
40|$|It is, no doubt, a truism {{that in the}} {{relations}} of states treaties are matters of importance and frequent occurrence. The law of treaties, therefore, rightly occupies a central position in international law. Within this branch of the law, three large categories of rules may easily be distinguished relating, respectively, to the conclusion, to the interpretation, and to the termination of treaties. It is with {{some aspects of the}} first of these categories that the present study is exclusively concerned. In order that a treaty may be validly concluded on behalf of a state, two requirements are of fundamental importance: the first is that expressions of consent must have occurred; the second, that these expressions shall emanate from persons who are competent to give them. The original plan of the present study envisaged a full treatment of the rules of international law governing the two requirements referred to above. As the work proceeded, however, it became clear that no more than one of the topics could be treated within the framework of a thesis. Accordingly, the writer decided not to discuss the rules of international law relating to what constitutes an expression of consent to a treaty. The result of the writer's inquiry into the question whether, in cases of doubt, the signature of a treaty constitutes an irrevocable expression of consent, or ratification is required, is found in a published article, appended to the present study as Annex I. An inquiry into a cognate problem, namely, the need for unanimity in the revision of multilateral treaties, is also attached to this thesis as Annex II. Consequently, the present study is restricted to a systematic examination of those rules of international law which relate to the identification of those authorities in the state who are competent to express the final consent of the state to a treaty. The questions of the representation in <b>contractual</b> and <b>treaty</b> matters of subjects other than states, however, is not discussed. The present work deals with two distinct but interrelated problems. The first is that of the conditions under which the expressions of consent to a treaty of an authority or person are imputed to the state on whose behalf the authority or person purports to act. This is the question of identifying the competent treaty-making organ. The other problem is that of the conditions under which the expression of consent given to a treaty by an individual may be imputed to the treaty-making organ whose agent the individual purports to be. Both problems are of considerable difficulty. In the case of the second problem, the competence of agents, the difficulties are caused, chiefly, by the scant attention which the question has attracted. Material relevant to it has not been easily accessible, and the doctrinal discussion of the matter has hitherto been so limited that the present study may probably claim to be the first full treatment of the topic. By contrast, many of the difficulties relating to the problem of the competence of treaty-making organs, have been caused by the prolific treatment which it has been accorded at the hands of publicists. In order, therefore, to make some fresh contribution to this subject, the emphasis of this study has been placed on the investigation and discussion of the practice of states and the decisions of tribunals, both municipal and international. One consequence of this approach is to expose to criticism many of the views hitherto expressed on this subject; and it has, therefore, become necessary to attempt the formulation of a theory that is less contradicted by the practice of states than most existing theories seem to be. The study falls into three parts. Part I contains an examination of the problem of the competence of agents of treaty-making organs. Part II takes up the question of the competence of treaty-making organs generally. In Part III the same question is examined with special reference to states possessing constitutional regulations governing their treaty-making activities...|$|R
2500|$|The {{terms of}} the {{marriage}} were settled by two agreements, a public treaty and a private <b>contractual</b> arrangement. The <b>treaty</b> was executed between Spain and the United Kingdom in London on 7 May 1906 by their respective plenipotentiaries, the Spanish Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, Don Luis Polo de Bernabé, and the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, Bt. Ratifications were exchanged on 23 May following. Among other conditions, the treaty stipulated:BE it known unto all men by these Presents that whereas His Catholic Majesty Alfonso XIII, King of Spain, has judged it proper to announce his intention of contracting a marriage with Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena, niece of His Majesty Edward VII, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and daughter of Her Royal Highness the Princess Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore (Princess Henry of Battenberg)…Article I. It is concluded and agreed that the marriage between His said Majesty King Alfonso XIII and Her said Royal Highness the Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena shall be solemnized in person at Madrid {{as soon as the}} same may conveniently be done. II. His said Majesty King Alfonso XIII engages to secure to Her said Royal Highness the Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena from the date of her marriage with His Majesty, and for the whole period of the marriage, an annual grant of 450,000 pesetas. His said Majesty King Alfonso XIII also engages, if, by the will of Divine Providence, the said Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena should become his widow, to secure to her, from the date of his death, an annual grant of 250,000 pesetas, unless and until she contracts a second marriage, both these grants having already been voted by the Cortes. The private settlements to be made on either side in regard to the said marriage will be agreed upon and expressed in a separate Contract, which shall, however, be deemed to form {{an integral part of the}} present Treaty…III. The High Contracting Parties take note of the fact that Her Royal Highness the Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena, according to the due tenor of the law of England, forfeits for ever all hereditary rights of succession to the Crown and Government of Great Britain… The treaty's reference to the forfeiture of Victoria Eugénie's British succession rights reflected neither the British government's censure of the alliance, nor any [...] made by her. Rather, it was an explicit recognition of the fact that by marrying (and becoming) a Roman Catholic, Victoria Eugénie lost any right to inherit the British crown as a consequence of Britain's Act of Settlement. This exclusion was personal and limited: those among her descendants who do not become Roman Catholic remain in the line of succession to the British Throne.|$|R
