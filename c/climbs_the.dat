5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. On {{each of the}} road stages there were classified climbs on the route. The first riders {{to the top of}} the climb were awarded points in the mountains classification. For most of the <b>climbs,</b> <b>the</b> first four riders won points, with five, three, two and one points respectively. More points were awarded for the two most difficult climbs of the race. These were the summit finish to Monte Terminillo on stage 5 and the Poggio San Romualdo on stage 4. On these <b>climbs,</b> <b>the</b> winner won 15 points in the classification, with the next six riders also winning points. The rider with the most points was awarded the green jersey.|$|E

500|$|The [...] {{route of}} the 2015 Amstel Gold Race began in Maastricht and left the city towards the north. The riders passed through the towns of Bunde and Geulle {{on their way to}} <b>the</b> first <b>climbs</b> of <b>the</b> day. <b>The</b> first <b>climb</b> of <b>the</b> day was the Slingerberg; the peloton then passed through Beek and <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> Adsteeg.

The route then turned south through Meerssen, where <b>the</b> riders <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> third <b>climb,</b> <b>the</b> Lange Raarberg, then east in the {{direction}} of Heerlen.

5|$|At {{the base}} of the first drop, the train banks a few degrees to the right and <b>climbs</b> <b>the</b> first air-time hill and descends. Following this, the train climbs up to a hairpin 180-degree hammerhead turn to the left. The train descends from the height of the turn to travel up and over three more air-time hills. After the hills, the train climbs up a steep slope into the mid-course brake run.|$|E
5|$|For {{the points}} classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for {{finishing}} {{a stage in}} the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category (first being the highest), with more points available for higher category <b>climbs.</b> <b>The</b> Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category <b>climbs.</b> <b>The</b> Cima Coppi for this Giro was the Passo Pordoi. The first rider to cross the Pordoi Pass was Spanish rider Pedro Mu√±oz. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided {{the same way as}} the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.|$|E

As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey.|$|E
500|$|The second loop {{was shorter}} than the first at [...] It again began with <b>the</b> <b>climb</b> of <b>the</b> Geulhemmerberg, then {{travelled}} through the outskirts of Maastricht. The route again turned north, this time to <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> Bemelerberg, before another turn to the south-east towards Beutenaken. The route re-used several of the roads {{that made up the}} first loop: <b>the</b> riders <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> Loorberg for the second time, then turned north for <b>the</b> second <b>climb</b> of <b>the</b> Gulpenerberg. From this point, the peloton took a different route towards Valkenburg, which included <b>the</b> <b>climbs</b> of <b>the</b> Kruisberg, the Eyserbosweg, the Fromberg and the Keutenberg. On this loop, the riders did not <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> Sibbergrubbe but proceeded directly to <b>the</b> third <b>climb</b> of <b>the</b> Cauberg.

5|$|The Giro was raced on {{a unique}} path through Italy, taking the peloton to some {{historic}} {{cities and towns}} in Italian cycling. Though the route lacked any well-known, storied <b>climbs,</b> <b>the</b> many intermediate and mountain stages {{in the second and}} third weeks of the race proved deceptively difficult. The 10th and the 16th stages were both called the race's queen stage, as both contained multiple difficult mountain climbs.|$|E
5|$|The race began for {{the second}} year in {{succession}} with a team time trial on one of Italy's islands, in this case Sicily (in 2007 it had been Sardinia).

5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, for which points were awarded for reaching {{the top of a}} climb before other riders.
