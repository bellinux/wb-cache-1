50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low oil pressure. 1) no oil or low {{oil in the}} engine 2) worn or {{defective}} oil pump or broken pressure relief valve spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with oil pressure as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) oil gallery fracture or blockage. Low oil pressure can cause engine damage. First thing to fail will be <b>cam</b> <b>carrier</b> bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip. Also the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings will seize. Indications of low oil pressure may be that the warning light is on, a low pressure reading on the gauge, or clattering/clinking noises from the engine. Low oil pressure is a problem that must be addressed immediately to prevent serious damage.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in 1989 for the 740 GLE (and later {{used in the}} 940/960), The 16-Valve Redblock motors {{were offered}} in both a 2.0 litre Turbo (B204FT/GT) and a 2.3 litre 154 hp Naturally {{aspirated}} version (B234F). The head was designed for Volvo by Porsche. In addition to the 16 Valve head, these motors were equipped with twin counter rotating external balance shafts and the engine block itself differs from the 8V redblock. The block differed from the standard B230 in that the auxiliary shaft (used to drive the oil pump and distributor on models that had block mounted distributors) was replaced with an external oil pump. The 16-Valve head was itself a completely new design for Volvo: The head was of a multi-piece design featuring a separate <b>cam</b> <b>carrier</b> and lower section. The later [...] "white block" [...] motors can trace their head design back to the two-piece setup found in the B204 and B234. The 2.0 litre turbo variant was introduced for European markets with tax structures tied to engine displacement such as Italy. Unique to the B204 turbo was an exhaust gas pyrometer which was used to detect excessively high exhaust temperatures. When excessively high exhaust temperatures were detected, the fuel injection computer would richen the mixture. It has a forged crankshaft, cast pistons, and 13 mm connecting rods.|$|E
50|$|Interchange:1991-1993 {{models were}} Multi-port injection, {{and had a}} single crank sensor for {{computer}} timing. 1994-1995 models used the same long block, but had different <b>cam</b> <b>carriers</b> and timing cover.1996-1997 models used {{a modified version of}} the same short block and had different heads.91-93 motors cannot be used in later models due to lack of sensors needed for the newer computer systems.|$|R
50|$|Following {{experiments}} with an eight valve twin cam cylinder {{head for the}} Vauxhall Slant Four, the company developed a 16-valve, twin cam engine in the early 1970s; the first test engine, 'Old Number 1', was running by 1973. The cylinder head was similar in design but different in appearance to the Lotus one; in particular the <b>cam</b> <b>carriers</b> on the Vauxhall engine were angled upwards so that the covers were both horizontal (those on the Lotus engine were equal about the cylinder centreline).|$|R
50|$|Oil leakage was {{commonplace in}} {{the first few years of}} production, though the problem was {{eventually}} addressed by aftermarket cam cover gaskets made from reusable rubber. Later 900 series Lotus engines included a revised cam tower that greatly improved the cam cover sealing design. The later cam towers can be retrofitted to the earlier 907 engines. Early Jensen-Healey engines (1972-1973) had oil supply issues that made the oil pressure slow to build on start-up. Some early engines also had issues with oil drainage which resulted in too much oil being retained in the <b>cam</b> <b>carriers.</b> Differences between early and late 907 engines included rope seals for the rear of the crankshaft versus regular spring-loaded rubber lip seals for the rear of the crankshaft on later 907 engines.|$|R
50|$|The 3.2 L Power Stroke is {{an inline}} five-cylinder engine that debuted in the U.S.-spec Transit for model year 2015. The engine is a {{modified}} version of the Ford Duratorq 3.2 L diesel engine that has been adapted to meet emissions in the United States. To aid in economy, emissions, and reduce NVH, it has a high pressure common rail fuel injection system and piezo injectors that can spray up to five different injections per compression event. It has a water cooled EGR system to reduce the temperature of the exhaust gas before being recirculated through the intake. A unique feature to the emissions system is that the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and the DPF have been combined into one singular unit as opposed to the traditional two separate units. Exhaust treatment continues with SCR which is done by the injection of diesel exhaust fluid in the exhaust to reduce NOx. The engine features a variable geometry turbo which allows for intake air flow tuning on the fly to increase power and fuel economy. The engine also features a variable-flow oil pump to avoid wasting mechanical energy pumping excessive amounts of oil. It has cast aluminum, low friction pistons with oil squirters to keep them cool during heavy-load conditions, a die cast aluminum <b>cam</b> <b>carrier</b> to stiffen up the valve train and reduce NVH, and to increase low end durability, the crankshaft is cast iron and the connecting rods are forged. The block itself is an extra rigid, gray cast iron with a closed deck. The power figures for the 3.2 L Power Stroke are 185 hp at 3,000 rpm and 350 lb-ft at 1,500-2,750 rpm. The Euro Duratorq 3.2 makes 197 HP and 350 ft-lb of torque.|$|E
5000|$|Remnants {{of other}} FPE parts were much later {{found by the}} then-owner of 1954 Kieft F1 chassis, Gordon and Martyn Chapman, in an air-raid cellar in the {{abandoned}} building which used to belong to Bill Lacey (of Power Engines Ltd., a Coventry Climax specialist) near the main entrance of Silverstone Circuit, including 3 blocks, 2 cranks, 16 cylinder heads, 20-some <b>cam</b> covers (<b>carriers?),</b> two cardboxes full of timing gears and camshafts, which all belonged to [...] "Doc Murfield" [...] who had purchased the parts from Andrew Getley in 1968-69 and had entrusted them to Bill Lacey.|$|R
5000|$|Wartime {{emergencies}} also {{spurred the}} creation or conversion of unconventional aircraft <b>carriers.</b> <b>CAM</b> ships, like , were cargo-carrying merchant ships that could launch but not retrieve a single fighter aircraft from a catapult. These vessels were an emergency measure during World War II {{as were the}} Merchant aircraft carriers (MACs), such as [...] which put a flight deck {{on top of a}} cargo ship. Submarine aircraft carriers, such as the French Surcouf and the Japanese , which was capable of carrying three Aichi M6A Seiran aircraft, were first built in the 1920s but were generally unsuccessful at war.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, two {{different}} IgSF-members {{have been investigated}} addressing different aspects. The {{first part of the}} study deals with the analysis of human pathological missense mutations of L 1 <b>CAM.</b> <b>Carriers</b> of these mutations exhibit multiple severe neurological symptoms, which has been combined using the acronym CRASH-Syndrome. Here, different in vitro assays were utilized to give insights into molecular mechanisms causing the CRASHSyndrome. The cell surface expression of mutant L 1 proteins and their impact on homophilically mediated neurite outgrowth was tested. Analysis of 25 pathological missense mutations revealed dramatic effects on the surface expression of mutant L 1 proteins in CHO cells. In detail, mutations that are predicted to affect the structure of individual extracellular domains are more likely to affect intracellular processing and/or ligand binding than those mutations affecting surface properties of the molecule. Furthermore, different L 1 -mutations have been overexpressed in primary neurons and their effects on the homophilically mediated neurite outgrowth was examined. Here, the results were conclusive with respect to the cell surface expression in CHO cells. In the second part, the mouse homologue of the recently described IgSF-member Neurotractin has been characterized. For this, the cDNA of mouse neurotractin (mNTRA) was cloned and specific antibodies have been generated. Western Blot Analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution showed a developmentally regulated increase of mNTRA in different brain regions. Immunohistochemistry, using antibodies against mNTRA, identified its expression on different neuronal subpopulations in the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, cortex, and the hippocampus. Moreover, the subcellular distribution of mNTRA has been localized to presynaptic terminals using immunocytochemistry of primary neurons, and a biochemical approach using brain tissue of adult mice. Functional studies were performed examining the influence of mNTRA on neurite outgrowth. Here, a positive effect on the neurite length of hippocampal neurons and a clear choice behaviour of outgrowing hippocampal explants for mNTRA was observed. This implies for mNTRA a function as an attractive guidance cue for the neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. In order to analyse a potential plasticity-dependent regulation of mNTRA in vivo, entorhinal cortex lesions with mice were performed. Immunohistological examinations showed an upregulation of mNTRA in the deafferented hippocampus, and most interestingly, on reactive astrocytes in the denervated outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. The spatiotemporal expression regulation of mNTRA after lesion, corresponds with the timing of regenerative axon sprouting in the outer molecular layer. Thus, the attractive influence of mNTRA in vitro, and the regulation after entorhinal cortex lesion, leads to the assumption of an in vivo function of mNTRA in regenerative axon sprouting. Finally, mNTRA-deficient mice have been generated, for a detailed analysis of the in vivo function for mNTRA in future studies...|$|R
50|$|When fired, {{propellant}} gases {{from the}} ignited cartridge following the projectile down the bore are vented through a gas port into a gas cylinder where they drive the piston and bolt carrier rearward. There is about 0.2 in of uninterrupted free travel calculated {{to permit the}} gas build-up in the bore to drop to a safe level before the <b>carrier's</b> <b>cam</b> slot rotates the bolt counter-clockwise to unlock. The locking lugs have no pitch therefore no primary extraction occurs during the unlocking sequence. A deeply seated spring-loaded claw extractor in the bolt head extracts the spent cartridge casing from the chamber and a spring-powered ejector fixed to the front feed mechanism trigger housing ejects the casing. The bolt carrier continues to the rear and compresses the recoil spring on its guide rod.|$|R
50|$|The locked-breech {{blowback}} system mirrored that of John Pedersen's Remington Model 51 {{only with a}} locking recess above rather than below the bolt. When the firearm is in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder in the frame. When the cartridge is fired, the breech block and bolt carrier move together a short distance rearward powered by {{the energy of the}} cartridge as in a standard {{blowback system}}. When the breech block contacts the locking shoulder, it stops, locking the breech. The bolt carrier continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase. This delay allows chamber pressure to drop to safe levels while the breech is locked and the cartridge slightly extracted. Once the bullet leaves the barrel and pressure drops, the continuing motion of the bolt <b>carrier</b> <b>cams</b> the breech block from its locking recess, continuing the operating cycle.|$|R
5000|$|Gordon Murray then {{approached}} BMW, {{which took}} an interest, and the motorsport division BMW M headed by engine expert Paul Rosche {{designed and built}} Murray a 6.1 L (6,064 cc) 60-degree V12 engine called the BMW S70/2.At [...] and 266 kg the BMW engine ended up 14% more powerful and 16 kg heavier than Gordon Murray's original specifications, with the same block length.It has an aluminium alloy block and heads, with 86 mm x 87 mm bore/stroke, quad overhead camshafts with variable valve timing (a relatively new and unproven technology for the time) for maximum flexibility {{of control over the}} four valves per cylinder, and a chain drive for the camshafts for maximum reliability.The engine uses a dry sump oil lubrication system.The carbon fibre body panels and monocoque required significant heat insulation in the engine compartment, so Murray's solution was to line the engine bay with a highly efficient heat-reflector: gold foil. Approximately 16 g (0.8 ounce) of gold was used in each car.The road version used a compression ratio of 11:1 to produce [...] at 7400 rpm and torque output of 480 lb·ft (651 N·m) at 5600 rpm. The engine has a redline rev limiter set at 7500 rpm.In contrast to raw engine power, a car's power-to-weight ratio is a better method of quantifying acceleration performance than the peak output of the vehicle's powerplant. The standard F1 achieves 550 hp/ton (403 kW/tonne), or just 3.6 lb/hp.The <b>cam</b> <b>carriers,</b> covers, oil sump, dry sump, and housings for the camshaft control are made of magnesium castings. The intake control features twelve individual butterfly valves and the exhaust system has four Inconel catalysts with individual Lambda-Sondion controls.The camshafts are continuously variable for increased performance, using a system very closely based on BMW's VANOS variable timing system for the BMW M3; it is a hydraulically actuated phasing mechanism which retards the inlet cam relative to the exhaust cam at low revs, which reduces the valve overlap and provides for increased idle stability and increased low-speed torque. At higher rpm the valve overlap is increased by computer control to 42 degrees (compare 25 degrees on the M3) for increased airflow into the cylinders and thus increased performance.To allow the fuel to atomise fully, the engine uses two Lucas injectors per cylinder, with the first injector located close to the inlet valve - operating at low engine rpm - while the second is located higher up the inlet tract - operating at higher rpm. The dynamic transition between the two devices is controlled by the engine computer.Each cylinder has its own miniature ignition coil. The closed-loop fuel injection is sequential. The engine has no knock sensor as the predicted combustion conditions would not cause this to be a problem. The pistons are forged in aluminium.Every cylinder bore has a nikasil coating giving it a high degree of wear resistance.From 1998 to 2000, the Le Mans-winning BMW V12 LMR sports car used a similar S70/2 engine.The engine was given a short development time, causing the BMW design team to use only trusted technology from prior design and implementation experience. The engine does not use titanium valves or connecting rods. Variable intake geometry was considered but rejected on grounds of unnecessary complication.As for fuel consumption, the engine achieves on average 15.2 mpg (15 L/100 km), at worst 9.3 mpg (25 L/100 km) and at best 23.4 mpg (10 L/100 km).|$|R
2500|$|Each {{negative}} logic selector bail that is {{displaced by the}} interposer in turn pulls a latch interposer and link which causes a selector latch near the cycle shaft to be {{pulled away from the}} latch bail. The latches pulled away in this manner are disengaged {{for the rest of the}} cycle, while the remaining latches take part in character selection, hence the term [...] "{{negative logic}}". The minus five selector bail pulls an interposer and link which causes a latch to disengage from a cam, allowing it to move an additional input into the whiffletree that subtracts five units of rotation from any negative logic inputs. An additional [...] "low velocity" [...] selector latch is also engaged by certain keys, such as '.' and '_', which require a reduced striking force so as not to cut the paper; this selector latch engages the low velocity control cam follower, which pulls the low velocity cable connected to the <b>cam</b> in the <b>carrier,</b> causing the low velocity lobe to be used instead of the usual high velocity lobe. Additionally, punctuation marks are deliberately placed about the ball so the maximum amount of energy is used to position the element prior to striking, further reducing the impact.|$|R
5000|$|This new-found {{importance}} of naval aviation forced nations {{to create a}} number of carriers, in efforts to provide air superiority cover for every major fleet in order to ward off enemy aircraft. This extensive usage {{led to the development}} and construction of 'light' carriers. Escort aircraft carriers, such as , were sometimes purpose-built but most were converted from merchant ships as a stop-gap measure to provide anti-submarine air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. Following this concept, light aircraft carriers built by the US, such as , represented a larger, more [...] "militarized" [...] version of the escort carrier. Although with similar complement to escort carriers, they had the advantage of speed from their converted cruiser hulls. The UK 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier was designed for building quickly by civilian shipyards and with an expected service life of about 3 years. They served the Royal Navy during the war and was the hull design chosen for nearly all aircraft carrier equipped navies after the war until the 1980s. Emergencies also spurred the creation or conversion of highly unconventional aircraft <b>carriers.</b> <b>CAM</b> ships, were cargo-carrying merchant ships that could launch (but not retrieve) a single fighter aircraft from a catapult to defend the convoy from long range German aircraft.|$|R
