5|$|The non-streamlined Nos. 6230–6234 {{were painted}} {{in a special}} version of the {{standard}} crimson lake livery. The locomotives were lined out in gold bordered with fine red lines. Serif lettering and numerals in gold leaf and vermillion shading were applied. Handrails and sundry small external fittings were <b>chrome-plated,</b> as were the nameplates, which had a black background.|$|E
5|$|There {{was limited}} {{interference}} from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included {{the addition of}} a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted. To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original drawing in Rome. Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then <b>chrome-plated.</b> Winston sculpted a reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.|$|E

25|$|From 2003 to 2005, {{during the}} Thameslink blockade, some minor {{interior}} updating took place such as recovering seats with an updated Thameslink moquette. First-class compartments were refurbished with new carpet, retrimmed seats and <b>chrome-plated</b> heater panels, apart from unit 319444, which retained its 1997-designed interior.|$|E
25|$|The Type 100 had a <b>chrome-plated</b> bore to {{help fight}} {{corrosion}} in Asian jungle conditions. Its complex ammunition feed included a feature whereby the firing pin would not operate until the round was fully chambered; frequent stoppages in firing were experienced in the field. The round was the underpowered and relatively ineffective 8x22mm Nambu pistol round. The curved box magazine extending {{from the left side}} made for poor weapon balance when full. The sights were canted to the left.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{because of}} the high value of old promotional, {{friction}} and annual kit cars in 1:25 scale, a “cottage industry” boom has taken place. Parts for these valuable old cars are being cast in high-quality resin and sold online by such vendors as The Modelhaus, R & R Resin and Star Models. A skilled modeler can now restore a broken promo that was played with as a toy decades ago to like-new condition. Such parts as hood ornaments, wheels, tires, and even windshield frames from delicate convertibles are available. Parts that were originally <b>chrome-plated</b> are available pre-chromed for easy restoration.|$|E
25|$|Promotional makers like AMT {{worked very}} closely with styling {{departments}} of American automobile manufacturers (Anderson 2003). One fascinating article appearing in Ford Times (1961) chronicled the manufacturing process of AMT models. Intricate drawings and styling models, just like with the real thing, were first constructed. Larger 1:10 or 1:12 scale clay models would be crafted to perfect details. Accurate dies in 1:25 scale, which was the most common, would be made from these for plastic injection. Bumpers and hood ornaments were <b>chrome-plated</b> and bodies were painted, often in factory colors. Painted bodies were baked in ovens, then the models were assembled and packaged.|$|E
25|$|In the United States military, each branch {{has its own}} flag, an {{organizational}} colour, sometimes also called a ceremonial flag. Each of these is 4ft 4in × 5ft 6in, some using 2.5-inch gold fringe during specific instances. The ceremonial flag is paraded with a National Colour of equal dimensions in a colour guard, with gold fringe as necessary. The National Color is never dipped in salute, but remains vertical at all times, while the organizational colours and any guidons are dipped as necessary. When the National Colour is not cased, all persons salute the Colors. The finial is a nickel or <b>chrome-plated</b> spearhead, though the Navy uses different finials on occasion.|$|E
25|$|Available in 2006 Route 66 Edition was {{finished}} in either Solar Yellow or Black. This version featured Solar Yellow brake calipers, body-color grille, solar-tinted sunscreen glass, liftgate mounted spoiler, 17-inch all-season performance tires, four-wheel anti-lock brakes with low-speed traction control, speed control, and a sport suspension. Brightwork accents included chrome body-side moldings, a chrome exhaust tip and , <b>chrome-plated,</b> and five-spoke Empire aluminum wheels. Exterior identification included a 'Street Cruiser' badge with Solar Yellow accents on the liftgate and 'Route 66' badges {{on the front}} doors. A total of 1443 Route 66 models were produced in North America, with 142 of those equipped with 5 speed manual transmissions.|$|E
25|$|Introduced at the 1993 New York Auto Show, {{the main}} {{changes for the}} P10 came as a midyear refresh in April 1993 (model year 1993.5), when dual airbags {{replaced}} motorized seatbelts, leather interiors came standard with power front seats, matte-black side moldings were replaced by body-colored ones, the refrigerant was converted from R12 to R134a, the audio system was upgraded to six speakers with a CD player instead of the previously-standard cassette deck, and other new options such as remote keyless entry were added. In February 1994, the 1994 model year was given a new larger <b>chrome-plated</b> grille and door handles, a lowport engine (replacing the original highport SR20DE, in which the intake plenum is below the fuel injectors and fuel rail), {{a change in the}} vehicle's self-diagnostic system to OBD-II, and larger 195/65R14 tires. The Touring models, introduced in February 1994, featured a limited-slip differential in the transmission; 195/65R14 Yokohama tires, sportier, more highly bolstered black leather front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats; fog lights; and a spoiler on the rear decklid.|$|E
25|$|The wide stairs {{leading from}} the subway land in the {{southern}} third of the building at a ticket hall and waiting area, which is open on both sides. A painted steel mid-rail runs the length of these stairs. Opposite the stair void the gaps between the piers are filled with screens made with a metal frame and grill panel bolted to the brick surrounds and resting on low brick walls. The internal faces of the piers are rendered and painted. The ticket windows are directly opposite the stair landing. Only the western one is currently in use, the other now hidden behind a freestanding automatic ticket machine. A number of timetable wall-boxes line the available wall space, one being an early timber example. One of the original <b>chrome-plated</b> ticket rails {{in front of the}} operating ticket window remains. The floor is lined with a chequered pattern of black and white terrazzo tiles, while the ceiling is made with fibrous cement sheeting. A stainless steel downpipe marks {{the top of the stairs}} and the endpoint of the middle handrail. There were four downpipes in the original design, one next to what had been the telephone box on the south-eastern facade, another between the office and store and another between the toilet and waiting area. How many still exist is unknown as three were enclosed in various walls along the centreline of the building and cannot be viewed. It is likely that some if not all remain.|$|E
500|$|Oliver {{typewriters}} {{were finished}} with olive green paint or nickel-plating and {{white or black}} keyboards, depending on customer preference. Beginning with model No. 3, machines were painted green except some variants to be exported to warm or damp regions, which were <b>chrome-plated.</b> The color was changed from green to black on the introduction of model No.11. Oliver typewriters made for the British war effort were supplied with a [...] "war finish".|$|E
500|$|The Sovereign {{was unusual}} because the casing {{was made from}} pressed steel, which gave it a much higher quality feel {{compared}} to injection moulded plastic. This allowed a variety of paint and plating options, including black painted, <b>chrome-plated,</b> silver-plated, and gold-plated, and a limited edition silver-plated version, inscribed to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977, were also produced. Asprey of London was rumoured to have produced two Sovereigns in solid gold, costing [...] each.|$|E
500|$|A mutant {{with the}} ability to {{transform}} his body into an organic steel, [...] while also granting him superhuman strength and a resistance to physical damage while in that form. Cudmore wore a foam latex muscle suit covered with a <b>chrome-plated</b> plastic plus a hard plastic head to have the metal skin on the set, with some digital augmentation being used to enhance the facial expressions. A digital double was used only for stunts that could not be achieved practically, such as the Fastball Special where Colossus throws Wolverine.|$|E
500|$|Daft Punk {{continued}} {{to wear the}} robot costumes in their live performances at the 2008, 2014 and 2017 Grammy Awards, with variations in clothing. During the 2014 ceremony, they also accepted their awards on stage in the outfits, with Pharrell and Paul Williams speaking on the duo's behalf. At the time the decision to stay in costume drew criticism from viewers on Twitter, including future White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. In both their appearance at the 2017 Grammy Awards and in the Weeknd's [...] "I Feel It Coming" [...] music video, the duo wore long black capes and <b>chrome-plated</b> gloves along with their customary helmets.|$|E
500|$|With [...] "Love Sex Magic," [...] Ciara {{moved in}} a more pop {{direction}} than her past music. Jordan Sargent of PopMatters noted that while a pop fan might see the singer [...] "back in her mind creatively," [...] a Ciara fan would see the song as [...] "signal {{the end of the}} singer's career as it once was." [...] Sargent stated that the song [...] "sounds nothing like the <b>chrome-plated</b> crunk nor the moonlit balladry that Ciara has staked her name on." [...] Musically, the song is a dance-pop-R number which makes use of electro and funk music, as well as displaying disco and soul influences. The song has a minimalistic dance beat, with a [...] "funky, retro 70s style R guitar" [...] as the backdrop. Lauren Carter of the Boston Herald said that the song is influenced by Timberlake's disco-funk work on FutureSex/LoveSounds, stating that [...] "it sounds like a reworked version of his bass-heavy dance number [...] "Sexy Ladies." [...] Carter commented that Timberlake was [...] "ushering Ciara away from her typically crunk-laced stylings in favor of JT’s electro-slide." [...] Ann Powers of The Los Angeles Times said that the song was [...] "Madonna-esque." [...] Both Ciara and Timberlake provide verses, accompanied by vocal whims and falsetto.|$|E
2500|$|In 1949, {{injection}} plastic molding became available. After {{the first}} Ford aluminum promotional model was offered (Doty 2008, 89), aluminum was abandoned. Different colors of plastic {{could now be}} used, so the company name was quietly changed to AMT, which deemphasized the word [...] "aluminum" [...] (Cawthon 2002). For example, AMT's 1949 and 1950 Plymouth sedans were among its first plastic models, along with some Fords. These promos often had wind-up motors {{which could not be}} seen through the shiny silver-tinted windows. They had metal chassis and diecast metal <b>chrome-plated</b> bumpers, which were later replaced with <b>chrome-plated</b> plastic. Often, official factory paint colors were applied to the models. The company's first commercial products were pre-assembled plastic promotional models, which were only available through automobile dealerships, ...|$|E
2500|$|The Budd Company {{kept the}} only {{prototype}} model, but later renamed it [...] "XR-Budd" [...] {{and used it}} for marketing purposes. The Rambler lettering on {{the rear of the}} trunk lid was removed, while the stamped steel wheels with full wheel covers were upgraded to <b>chrome-plated</b> reverse wheels with exposed lug nuts. Budd sold the prototype to The Henry Ford Museum in 1997. It is now at the museum and also displayed at major classic car shows.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{details on}} the LF-Sh as a result, {{differed}} from the production model. [...] Among them, the integrated exhaust vents were instead a seamless one-piece design versus a <b>chrome-plated</b> version. [...] The LED headlamps did not appear on the standard production LS 460, but did later debut on the hybrid ultra-luxury LS 600h / LS 600h L. [...] The long wheelbase model LS 460 L is a lengthened version of the LF-Sh/LS 460 standard wheelbase design.|$|E
2500|$|The {{optional}} [...] "Go Package" [...] {{included a}} four-barrel carbureted [...] AMC V8, power front disc brakes, heavy-duty suspension, dual exhausts with chromed outlets, wide body-side stripes, and E70x14 red-line tires mounted on <b>chrome-plated</b> [...] "Magnum 500" [...] styled road wheels. A 343 Go Pac Javelin could accelerate from 0 to [...] in 8seconds, had {{a top speed}} approaching , and could run a quarter-mile in 15.4seconds.

2500|$|For {{the opening}} {{night of the}} {{following}} Met season, Domingo returned {{to the role of}} Wagner's Lohengrin, which he had last sung in early 1968. He had originally dropped the role from his repertoire after he felt his voice had been temporarily damaged by learning the challenging opera. The New York Times noted that the now more mature artist [...] "lacked the <b>chrome-plated,</b> penetrating quality that one associates with German tenors", but praised him for bringing [...] "an unusual legato grace to a role that is seldom sung so beautifully". He also performed the role at the Vienna State Opera in 1985 and 1990. A performance during his last run of the opera was televised on 28 January 1990 and later released on VHS and DVD. He had just recovered from the flu at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Rappaport and Sprague {{designed}} a new stethoscope in the 1940s, {{which became the}} standard by which other stethoscopes are measured, consisting of two sides, {{one of which is}} used for the respiratory system, the other for the cardiovascular system. The Rappaport-Sprague was later made by Hewlett-Packard. HP's medical products division was spun off as part of Agilent Technologies, Inc., where it became Agilent Healthcare. Agilent Healthcare was purchased by Philips which became Philips Medical Systems, before the walnut-boxed, $300, original Rappaport-Sprague stethoscope was finally abandoned ca. 2004, along with Philips' brand (manufactured by Andromed, of Montreal, Canada) electronic stethoscope model. The Rappaport-Sprague model stethoscope was heavy and short (...) with an antiquated appearance recognizable by their two large independent latex rubber tubes connecting an exposed leaf-spring-joined pair of opposing F-shaped <b>chrome-plated</b> brass binaural ear tubes with a dual-head chest piece.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these features, Riviera {{sales for}} 1971 dropped to 33,810, the lowest to date. The 1972 Riviera was little changed, with the 455 engine {{switching}} to net power ratings, [...] or [...] with the Gran Sport, although the actual drop in net power was only [...] Sales remained moribund at 33,728. For 1973, the [...] engine became standard, with [...] with the Stage One package, which {{also included a}} limited slip differential and a <b>chrome-plated</b> air cleaner. The [...] "Gran Sport" [...] package was still available as a separate option package consisting of a ride-and-handling package that included a rear stabilizer bar, JR78-15 whitewall steel-belted radial tires, a specially tuned [...] "radial roadability" [...] suspension, additional sound insulation and special [...] "Gran Sport" [...] badging. Sluggish sales of the third generation Riviera led GM {{to believe that the}} boattail deck lid was too radical for most customers' tastes, so in 1973 it was blunted and made slightly shorter. The design change however only led to a marginal increase in sales, with 34,080 being produced for the model year.|$|E
2500|$|A 1976 AMC Pacer Hatchback {{was used}} in the 1992 movie Wayne's World, and again in the 1993 movie Wayne's World 2. The Pacer used in both movies was painted bright blue with flame decals, with stock steel wheels and wheel covers in the front, and {{aftermarket}} <b>chrome-plated</b> steel wheels in the rear. It featured a two-tone light blue-and-beige vinyl interior, as well as a licorice dispenser mounted in place of the overhead light in the headliner. The car is used throughout both movies, however, the car is seen the most in the first Wayne's World movie in the introductory scene, where Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) inserts a cassette tape into the stereo of the Pacer, and Wayne, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey), and his friends rock out and head bang to [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] by Queen. Modifications to the movie car included interior camera mounts, tow hooks welded to the front subframe, and the removal of the HVAC system. The rear wheel wells were modified to accommodate aftermarket speaker boxes, the aforementioned licorice dispenser was added, and an additional cup holder was added to the Pacer's dashboard. The car used an AMC 258 c.i. six-cylinder engine and an automatic transmission.|$|E
2500|$|When fired, {{a portion}} of the {{propellant}} gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a [...] port, drilled at a 30° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the <b>chrome-plated</b> piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the bolt carrier {{on the right side of}} the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the pistol grip.|$|E
2500|$|Dynaflow was now {{standard}} equipment, {{and engine}} horsepower was increased to 150 through {{a slight increase}} in the compression ratio. This contributed in conjunction with the now standard Dynaflow in giving the new Buicks a top speed of 110mph. In the middle of the year the Riviera, joined the body style lineup selling 4,314 units. Featuring power windows as standard equipment, the 2-door Buick Roadmaster Riviera, along with the Cadillac Series 62 Coupe de Ville and the Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, was among the first hardtop coupes ever produced. The Riviera was also notable for its popular optional [...] "Sweepspear" [...] chrome body side molding, which would soon become a Buick trademark. This <b>chrome-plated</b> strip started above the front wheel, after which it gently curved down nearly to the rocker panel just before the rear wheel, and then curved around the rear wheel in a quarter of a circle to go straight back to the tail-light. The [...] "Riviera trim", as it was initially called, was also made available on the Roadmaster convertible very late in the model year. With a total of 88,130 sold, the all-time annual record for Roadmaster, the model accounted for 27 percent of all Buick sales, a remarkably high proportion in light of its price, which was only slightly less than a Cadillac Series 61.|$|E
2500|$|For 1968, {{both the}} Corvette body and {{interior}} were completely redesigned. As before, {{the car was}} available in either coupe or convertible models, but coupe was now a notchback fitted with a near-vertical removable rear window and removable roof panels (T-tops). A soft folding top was included with convertibles, while an auxiliary hardtop with a glass rear window was offered at additional cost. Included with coupes were hold down straps {{and a pair of}} vinyl bags to store the roof panels, and above the luggage area was a rear window stowage tray. The enduring new body's concealed headlights moved into position via a vacuum operated system rather than electrically as on the previous generation, and the new hide-away windshield wipers utilized a problematic vacuum door. The door handles were flush with the top of the doors with a separate release button. Front fenders had functional engine cooling vents. Side vent windows were eliminated from all models, replaced with [...] "Astro Ventilation", a fresh air circulation system. In the cabin, a large round speedometer and matching tachometer were positioned in front of the driver. Auxiliary gauges were clustered above the forward end of the console and included oil pressure, water temperature, ammeter, fuel gauge, and an analog clock. A fiber-optic system appeared on the console that monitored exterior lights and there was no glove box. The battery was relocated from the engine area to one of three compartments behind the seats to improve weight distribution. New options included a rear window defroster, anti-theft alarm system, bright metal wheel covers, and an AM-FM Stereo radio. All cars ordered with a radio, like the C2 cars, continued to be fitted with <b>chrome-plated</b> ignition shielding covering the distributor to reduce interference.|$|E
2500|$|... 1978 was the Corvette's twenty fifth anniversary, and all 78's {{featured}} silver anniversary {{nose and}} fuel door emblems. A new fastback rear window {{was the most}} dramatic and noticeable styling change, giving the ten-year-old C3 Corvette body style a fresh lease on life. The fixed-glass fastback benefited both aerodynamics and increased the usable luggage space behind the seats while improving rearward visibility in the bargain. A shade was installed that could be pulled forward to cover the rear compartment to protect cargo and carpet against the unrelenting sun. The tachometer and speedometer were redesigned to match the new “aircraft styled” center console and gauge cluster first seen the previous year. Redesigned interior door panels were also new {{as well as an}} actual glove box was added in front of the passenger seat, replacing the map pockets of previous years. Available options now included power door locks, a power antenna, dual rear speakers and a CB radio. The optional convenience group, introduced the previous year, now included intermittent (delay) wipers, floor mats, and the passenger side vanity mirror was an upgraded illuminated unit. The base L-48 engine generated Those destined for California or high altitude areas produced [...] Gone was the <b>chrome-plated</b> ignition shielding over the distributor, replaced with a metal-lined black plastic unit. The single-snorkel air intake used since 1976 was changed to a dual-snorkel set-up on L-82 equipped cars helping to boost that output to [...] L-82 engines were also now fitted with an aluminum intake manifold which saved 24pounds compared to the cast iron unit of previous years. The Corvette converted to metric tires with the P225/70R15 as standard. Wider P255/60R15 tires were available as an option and required fender trimming from the factory for clearance. The fuel tank capacity increased from 17 gal to 24 gal on all cars. To make room for the larger tank, a smaller (P195/80D15) space saver spare tire was utilized.|$|E
2500|$|The logo became iconic due to {{a program}} opening {{sequence}} produced in 1981 by New York City production firm Liberty Studios, nicknamed [...] "HBO in Space", which was used from September 20, 1982 to September 30, 1997. The original full version begins with a window shot of a family (or alternately, a married couple) in an apartment sitting down to watch HBO on their television set (which {{was replaced by a}} cloudscape that faded into the city sequence in December 1983), which transitions to a fly-through over a constructed model cityscape and countryside. A starburst – or [...] "stargate effect" [...] – then occurs following a pan towards a star-filled sky (which begins a shorter version of the sequence), unveiling a <b>chrome-plated</b> HBO logo that flies and rotates into view; colored light beams encircle the side of the [...] "O", then flash to a partially animated sequence featuring more lights racing counter-clockwise in its interior on a silver axis, revealing [...] "HBO Feature Presentation" [...] or another program type (such as [...] "Standing Room Only", [...] "HBO Special" [...] or [...] "On Location") in block text, before additional beams sweep across the text and shine, with more flashing into a fade to black.

Many versions of the intro are available on YouTube, including one uploaded to HBO's official YouTube channel. The accompanying fanfare – originally composed for Score Productions by Ferdinand Jay Smith III of Jay Advertising, who adapted the theme from the Scherzo movement of Antonín Dvořák's Ninth Symphony – has become a musical signature for HBO, and has been used in feature presentation, upcoming program and evening schedule bumpers, and network IDs since 1998 with various arrangements from horns to piano being used over the years.|$|E
