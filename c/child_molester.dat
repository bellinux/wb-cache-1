5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} {{going to follow}} the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements {{from each of the}} films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true <b>child</b> <b>molester,</b> something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} facial and prosodic affect recognition abilities among pedophilic and nonpedophilic <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> and community-dwelling controls. Pedophilic <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> {{are characterized by}} primary sexual interest in prepubescent children, whereas nonpedophilic <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> are characterized by offending against children despite being primarily sexually attracted to adults. The results showed that nonpedophilic <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> made more errors in recognizing both facial and prosodic affect, performing more poorly than both controls and pedophilic <b>child</b> <b>molesters.</b> These {{findings are consistent with}} greater psychopathic tendencies among nonpedophilic molesters as well as with prior findings of smaller amygdala volume among <b>child</b> <b>molesters...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies using the Implicit Association Test have shown {{successfully}} that male <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> hold cognitive associations between children and sexual concepts. The results of such studies appear to indicate that male <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> hold core cognitive associations that play some part in facilitating and/or maintaining sexual advances towards children. Given the relative success of the Implicit Association Test with male <b>child</b> <b>molesters,</b> we used this test with 17 female <b>child</b> <b>molesters.</b> The results showed that female <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> {{did not differ from}} non-sexual offending females on the Implicit Association Test. In fact, female <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> appeared more likely to associate adults with sexual concepts rather than children.

5|$|Gert Fröbe as Auric Goldfinger: A wealthy, psychopathic man {{obsessed with}} gold. Orson Welles was {{considered}} as Goldfinger, but his financial demands were too high; Theodore Bikel auditioned for the role, but failed. Fröbe was cast because the producers saw his {{performance as a}} <b>child</b> <b>molester</b> in the German film Es geschah am hellichten Tag. Fröbe, who spoke little English, said his lines phonetically, but was too slow. To redub him, he had to double the speed of his performance {{to get the right}} tempo. The only time his real voice is heard is during his meeting with members of the Mafia at Auric Stud. Bond is hidden below the model of Fort Knox whilst Fröbe's natural voice can be heard above. However, he was redubbed {{for the rest of the}} film by stage actor Michael Collins.|$|E
5|$|Rapists of virgins and {{children}} are also attested to have been buried alive, with a stake driven through them. In one such judicial tradition, the rapist was {{to be placed in}} an open grave, and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself; the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure. Serving {{as an example of the}} fate of a <b>child</b> <b>molester,</b> in August 1465 in Zurich, Switzerland, Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled, for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine. His clothes were taken off, and he was placed on his back. His arms and legs were stretched out, each secured to a pole. Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground. Thereafter, people left him to die.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a <b>child</b> <b>molester.</b> The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
50|$|The Philippines {{continued}} to assist U.S. {{law enforcement authorities}} in the transfer to U.S. custody of Americans who sexually exploited <b>children.</b> Foreign <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> are {{a major problem in}} a country like the Philippines.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} the results of research investigating the relation between inter-personal factors and personality disorders and intra-familial versus extra-familial <b>child</b> <b>molesters.</b> The sample contained 41 intra-familial and 43 extra-familial <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> as well as a matched comparison group of 80 subjects. The analysis of the research results show that interpersonal factors, such as parental sensitivity, trust, and adult romantic attachment, discriminate between intra-familial and extra-familial <b>child</b> <b>molesters.</b> These findings struc-ture the heterogeneous field of <b>child</b> <b>molesters,</b> as intra-familial <b>child</b> molesting seems to be related to relational attitude as well as personality disorders, whereas extra-familial child molesting is mainly related to personality disorders without showing significant deficits in the interpersonal factors that were measured. These results contribute to the explanation of this deviant sexual conduct and to the development and differentiation of the treatment of <b>child</b> <b>molesters...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} by Beech, Parrett, Ward, and Fisher {{has suggested that}} Ward and Keenan's male-derived implicit theories represent a good theoretical fit for explaining female child molesters’ offence-supportive cognitions. This paper re-examines the applicability of Ward and Keenan's (1999) male-derived implicit theories for explaining the self-reported offence-supportive cognitions of 16 UK female <b>child</b> <b>molesters.</b> Using almost identical analytic methods to Beech et al., we show that it is indeed possible to code female child molesters’ offence-supportive cognitions under {{each of the five}} male-derived implicit theories proposed by Ward and Keenan. However, our results show that the content of female child molesters’ offence-supportive cognitions appears very different to that of male <b>child</b> <b>molesters.</b> Based on our findings, we discuss relevant treatment implications and offer a re-conceptualization of implicit theories for female <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> using the sex-role stereotyping literature. We also propose that – unlike male <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> – female <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> are unlikely to hold generalized implicit theories that sexualize children...|$|R
40|$|This article {{renders the}} results of {{research}} that investigated personality disorders {{in a sample of}} paraphilic and nonparaphilic <b>child</b> <b>molesters.</b> The sample contained 36 paraphilic <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> and a matched comparison group of 34 nonparaphilic <b>child</b> <b>molesters.</b> The analyses of the research results show that four personality disorders discriminate between both groups. Only the obsessive- compulsive personality disorder contributes significantly to the explanation of paraphilic child molestation. This result also contributes to the development and differentiation of the treatment of paraphilia-related disorders. For several <b>child</b> <b>molesters,</b> psychological approaches to the treatment of sexual offending (e. g., cognitive-behavioral treatment, psychotherapy in general) are limited and cannot be expected to immediately reduce risk.
