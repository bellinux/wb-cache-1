5|$|In 1826, {{shortly after}} the death of his father, Meyerbeer married his cousin, Minna Mosson (1804–1886). The {{marriage}} which may have been 'dynastic' in its origins proved to be stable and devoted; the couple were to have five children, of whom the three youngest (all daughters) survived to adulthood. In the same year, following the death of Carl Maria von Weber, Weber's widow asked Meyerbeer to complete her husband's unfinished comic opera Die drei Pintos. This was to cause him much trouble over future years, as he found the material insufficient to work on. Eventually in 1852 he settled the matter with Weber's heirs by handing them Weber's drafts and a <b>cash</b> <b>compensation.</b> (The opera was later completed by Gustav Mahler).|$|E
5|$|In 2004 and 2005, two state-level {{class action}} suits were filed against Apple in New York and California alleging the first, second, and third {{generation}} iPod music players sold prior to May 2004 {{did not have}} the battery life represented and/or that the battery's capacity to take and hold a charge substantially diminished over time. Rather than litigate these claims, Apple entered into a settlement agreement in August 2005 after a fairness hearing in the California action, with the settlement terms designed to end the New York action as well. An appeal followed the California court's approval of the settlement but the appellate court upheld the settlement in December 2005. Eligible members of the class were entitled to extended warranties, store credit, <b>cash</b> <b>compensation,</b> or battery replacement, and some incentive payments, with all unfiled claims expiring after September 2005. Apple agreed to pay all costs of the litigation, including incentive payments to the class members and the plaintiffs' attorney fees, but admitted no fault. In 2006 Apple Canada, Inc., also settled several similar Canadian class action suits alleging misrepresentations by Apple regarding iPod battery life.|$|E

25|$|In May 1955, Westinghouse {{agreed to}} trade WPTZ and KYW radio to NBC in {{exchange}} for WNBK television and WTAM-AM-FM in Cleveland, and $3 million in <b>cash</b> <b>compensation.</b> NBC had long sought an owned-and-operated television station in Philadelphia, the largest market where it did not own a station.

After being rebuffed by Westinghouse on several occasions, NBC threatened to drop its affiliation from WPTZ and Westinghouse's other NBC television affiliate, WBZ-TV in Boston, unless Westinghouse agreed to the trade. NBC took over operation of WPTZ and KYW in late January 1956; on February 13, 1956, channel 3's call letters were changed to WRCV-TV (in reference to the RCA-Victor record label; KYW radio adopted the WRCV calls as well).|$|E

Finally, there is a positive correlation between changes in <b>cash</b> or total <b>compensation</b> and changes in audit or total fees. Our results show that the audit opinion is one determinant of CEO compensation while auditors charge higher audit or total fees to compensate for the high litigation risk associated with increases in CEO compensation...|$|R
60|$|In {{proposing a}} {{modification}} of the Reparation terms, I have considered them so far only in relation to Germany. But fairness requires that so great {{a reduction in the}} amount should be accompanied by a readjustment of its apportionment between the Allies themselves, The professions which our statesmen made on every platform during the war, as well as other considerations, surely require that the areas damaged by the enemy's invasion should receive a priority of compensation. While {{this was one of the}} ultimate objects for which we said we were fighting, we never included the recovery of separation allowances amongst our war aims. I suggest, therefore, that we should by our acts prove ourselves sincere and trustworthy, and that accordingly Great Britain should waive altogether her claims for cash payment in favor of Belgium, Serbia, and France. The whole of the payments made by Germany would then be subject to the prior charge of repairing the material injury done to those countries and provinces which suffered actual invasion by the enemy; and I believe that the sum of $7,500,000,000 thus available would be adequate to cover entirely the actual costs of restoration. Further, it is only by a complete subordination of her own claims for <b>cash</b> <b>compensation</b> that Great Britain can ask with clean hands for a revision of the Treaty and clear her honor from the breach of faith for which she bears the main responsibility, as a result of the policy to which the General Election of 1918 pledged her representatives.|$|E

5000|$|The Dublin and Kingstown Railway Company {{was founded}} in 1831 by {{businessmen}} {{in the city to}} look into building a railway. Within two years, they had a contractor and a parliamentary act. [...] The construction contract was awarded to William Dargan.Building of the 10 km (6 mi) line was delayed by opposition from two different landowners who insisted on large <b>cash</b> <b>compensations</b> {{and in the case of}} Lord Cloncurry the building of a private foot bridge over the line to a bathing area complete with a Romanesque temple, a short tunnel and a cutting to maintain his privacy. Part of the line ran on an embankment built across the strand between Merrion and Blackrock which later led to the formation of Booterstown marsh. The first train ran on 9 October 1834, consisting of eight carriages hauled by the locomotive Hibernia. Thus, the D & K was the worlds first commuter railway line, narrowly beating several similar lines in England.|$|R

40|$|Although studies {{about the}} {{determinants}} of CEO compensation are ubiquitous, the balance of evidence {{for one of the}} more controversial theoretical approaches, managerial power theory, remains inconclusive. The authors provide a meta-analysis of 219 U. S. -based studies, focusing on the relationships between indicators of managerial power and levels of CEO compensation and CEO pay-performance sensitivities. The results indicate that managerial power theory is well equipped for predicting core compensation variables such as total <b>cash</b> and total <b>compensation</b> but less so for predicting the sensitivity of pay to performance. In most situations where CEOs are expected to have power over the pay setting process, they receive significantly higher levels of total <b>cash</b> and total <b>compensation.</b> In contrast, where boards are expected to have more power, CEOs receive lower total <b>cash</b> and total <b>compensation.</b> In addition, powerful directors also appear to be able to establish tighter links between CEO compensation and firm performance and can accomplish this {{even in the face of}} powerful CEOs.
