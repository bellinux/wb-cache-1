40|$|Most {{relevant}} {{aspects of}} the dogs digestion and nutrition and the increasing importance of the Pet Food Industry were overviewed. The nutritional needs of dogs under different physiological conditions as recomended by same authors were compared and discussed. Pet Food Industry was outlooked: its history commoditics classification and production technologies, emphasizing those applied to intermediate moisture foods (IMF). The experimental work performed {{in the production of}} IMF using as raw materials animal offals and condemned meats discarded as waste by the abbatoirs. The technology developed for the production of this intermediate moisture food was assessed by a HACCP plan, the quality of the raw materials and by monitoring critical points. Feeding trials were conducted in dogs of different ages and conditions, adults in maintenance and working and growing pupies where the digestibility of the pet food was determined. The work presented allows to conclude that it is possible the production of a convenient and nutritionaly balanced IMF, which is stable at room temperature for at least one year, by using as main ingredients <b>condemned</b> <b>materials</b> from abbatoirs and soy and rice by products with a cheep non pollutant technologyAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

50|$|In 2013, APT <b>condemned</b> <b>material</b> it alleged {{was taught}} {{in the public schools}} of Newton, Massachusetts, {{suggesting}} that its content was anti-Semitic and biased against Israel. As part of its efforts in this regard, APT launched an advertising campaign alleging that the educational material was anti-Israel and “glorified Islam.” Local school officials and religious leaders vigorously disputed APT’s allegations. The claims in APT’s ads were challenged by the Anti-Defamation League, which called APT’s claims “misleading” and argued in a report it issued on the controversy that APT’s “charge” with respect to the educational material “lacks evidence and is irresponsible.” The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the town of Newton have also rejected APT’s claims.|$|R

40|$|From a {{total of}} 32 717 cattle slaughtered, 183 whole carcass condemnations were {{attributable}} to 9 diseases and conditions, namely, tuberculosis (TB), cysticercosis, emaciation, generalised lymphadenitis, jaundice, abscesses, moribund, sarcosporidiosis and odour. Bovine TB {{was the most important}} cause of condemnations (152 / 183, 83. 1 %). Bovine cysticercosis and sarcosporidiosis accounted for 5 / 183 (2. 7 %) and 8 / 183 (4. 4 %), respectively, while each of the remaining conditions contributed less. Among the many conditions responsible for offal / organ condemnations were fascioliasis, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, hydatidosis and TB. In terms of number and weight, Fasciola gigantica infections made livers and lungs the most condemned offals (20. 1 % and 0. 7 %, respectively). Hydatidosis was the cause of 0. 9 %lung and 0. 1 %liver losses. Cysticercus bovis contributed to only 0. 05 %of all inspected tongues, hearts, and heads. TB was very rare in heads (0. 01 %). The financial impact of whole carcasses and offals condemned during the study period was enormous and deprived livestock farmers of the much needed revenue and consumers of protein sources. Much or all of the <b>condemned</b> <b>material</b> that could have been useful was wasted by not being retrieved for conversion to processed meat, bone meal or pet food.

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the microscopic lesions found in lymph node tissues condemned for tuberculosis by the Brazilian SIS. Sixty-one condemned lymph nodes were collected, fixed in buffered formalin 10 % and submitted to histological processing. By evaluating the condemned tissues with H&E stain, 55 tuberculoid granuloma were found, as well as three actinomycosis granuloma, 2 presenting lymphoid hyperplasia and 1 crystal deposition. The misdiagnosis rate in the samples condemned due to tuberculosis was satisfactory, however it can be improved...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the opinions of more than 300 primary teachers. The first pur-pose {{of the study was}} to investigate the reported frequency with which teachers used various beginning reading materials (e. g., literature, basals, workbooks, predictable text, leveled text, decodable text, and vocabulary-controlled text). The second pur-pose {{of the study was to}} inspect how instructional purposes, state text policies, pro-grams, grade levels, and freedom of choice influenced reported uses. The results sug-gested that teachers of beginning readers use many different types of materials and are guided primarily by instructional purposes rather than programs or grade levels. Teachers reported using decodable text and literature for very particular instructional purposes but reportedly used other materials less specifically. Respondents in states with strong text mandates, like Texas and California, did differ from respondents in other states. In sum, the results suggested that teachers believed that different materi-als can serve different purposes with different readers. In the late 1990 s, both Texas and California made considerable changes in their re-quirements for beginning reading materials by requiring texts to be decodable (California English/Language Arts Committee, 1999; Texas Education Agency, 1997). These changes reversed earlier policies that emphasized literary merit in be-ginning reading <b>materials</b> and <b>condemned</b> contrived <b>materials</b> (California English/ Language Arts Committee, 1987; Texas Education Agency, 1990). The reversal of policies sparked a major shift in the reading textbook market, which affected thou-sands of children across the country (Hiebert, Menon, & Martin, 2005; Hoffman...|$|R
