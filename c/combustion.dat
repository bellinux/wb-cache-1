5|$|Thermal {{power plants}} which use oil shale as a fuel mostly employ {{two types of}} <b>combustion</b> methods. The {{traditional}} method is Pulverized <b>combustion</b> (PC) which {{is used in the}} older units of oil shale-fired power plants in Estonia, while the more advanced method is Fluidized bed <b>combustion</b> (FBC), which is used in the Holcim cement factory in Dotternhausen, Germany, and was used in the Mishor Rotem power plant in Israel. The main FBC technologies are Bubbling fluidized bed <b>combustion</b> (BFBC) and Circulating fluidized bed <b>combustion</b> (CFBC).|$|E
5|$|Highly {{concentrated}} {{sources of}} oxygen promote rapid <b>combustion.</b> Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, {{is needed to}} trigger <b>combustion.</b> Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source {{of most of the}} chemical energy released in <b>combustion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Internal <b>combustion</b> {{technologies}} such as the Paraho Direct are thermally efficient, since <b>combustion</b> of char on the spent shale and heat recovered from the shale ash and evolved gases can provide all the heat requirements of the retort. These technologies can achieve 80-90% of Fischer assay yield. Two well-established shale oil industries use internal <b>combustion</b> technologies: Kiviter process facilities have been operated continuously in Estonia since the 1920s, {{and a number of}} Chinese companies operate Fushun process facilities.|$|E

50|$|<b>Combustions,</b> Srdić's second {{short story}} collection, was {{published}} in May 2014. This book was also published by the KrR publishing house (Rašić Literary Workshop). It contains nine stories which treat the problem of identity in various narrative ways. For the synopsis of <b>Combustions</b> Srdić was awarded the Borislav Pekić grant.|$|R

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of <b>combustion</b> of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal <b>combustion</b> vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|Each engine main <b>combustion</b> chamber (MCC) {{receives}} fuel-rich hot {{gas from}} a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate <b>combustion.</b> The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the <b>combustion</b> process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the <b>combustion</b> chamber reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal <b>combustion</b> engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of <b>combustion</b> engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|In his article, Winter {{wondered}} why Coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream <b>combustion</b> to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature {{had been present}} during his supposed flying experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter noted that the August 1910 patent filings in French were {{essentially the same as}} the May 1911 ones in English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device, meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel <b>combustion</b> in the jet stream. He also noted that no mention was made in the early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or <b>combustion.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17thcentury, Robert Boyle proved that air is {{necessary}} for <b>combustion.</b> English chemist John Mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires {{only a part of}} air that he called spiritus nitroaereus. In one experiment, he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and <b>combustion.</b>|$|E

5|$|Oil-shale {{extraction}} {{can damage}} the biological and recreational value of land and the ecosystem in the mining area. <b>Combustion</b> and thermal processing generate waste material. In addition, the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and <b>combustion</b> include carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale, as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels.|$|E

5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal <b>combustion</b> engine vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with {{power from the}} internal <b>combustion</b> engine and regenerative braking, {{they can not be}} recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E

5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient <b>combustion</b> can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate <b>combustion</b> in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the <b>combustion</b> process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E

25|$|The very-high {{temperature}} of lightning naturally produces {{small amounts of}} NOx, NH3, and HNO3, but high-temperature <b>combustion</b> has contributed to a 6 or 7 fold increase in the flux of NOx to the atmosphere. Its production {{is a function of}} <b>combustion</b> temperature - the higher the temperature, the more NOx is produced. Fossil fuel <b>combustion</b> is a primary contributor, but so are biofuels and even the burning of hydrogen. The higher <b>combustion</b> {{temperature of}} hydrogen produces more NOx than natural gas <b>combustion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Secondary <b>combustion</b> air is {{supplied}} into the boiler {{at high speed}} through nozzles over the grate. It facilitates complete <b>combustion</b> of the flue gases by introducing turbulence for better mixing and by ensuring a surplus of oxygen.

50|$|Internal <b>combustions</b> engines require {{lubrication}} {{in operation}} that moving parts slide smoothly over each other. Insufficient lubrication subjects {{the parts of}} the engine to metal-to-metal contact, friction, heat build-up, rapid wear often culminating in parts becoming friction welded together e.g. pistons in their cylinders. Big end bearings seizing up will sometimes lead to a connecting rod breaking and poking out through the crankcase.|$|R
