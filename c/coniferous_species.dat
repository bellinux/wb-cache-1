25|$|A large {{concentration}} of diverse <b>coniferous</b> <b>species</b> of trees exists in these mountains. Thirty conifer species (or more, {{depending on where}} one delineates the region) inhabit the area, including two endemic species, the Brewer's spruce and the Port Orford cedar, making the Klamath Mountains {{one of the richest}} coniferous forest regions of {{the world in terms of}} concentrated species diversity. The region also has several edaphic plant communities, adapted to specific soil types, notably serpentine outcrops.|$|E
25|$|This {{mushroom}} can {{be found}} growing on hardwoods, more rarely on conifers. According to Ryvarden and Gilbertson in their monograph on the polypores of Europe, M. giganteus grows especially on Quercus and Fagus tree species, {{but it has also}} been collected on the hardwoods Acer, Aesculus, Alnus, Betula, Castanea, Celtis, Corylus, Eucalyptus, Laurus, Myrica, Persea, Pittosporum, Platanus, Populus, Prunus, Pyrus, Tilia, Ulmus; it has also been found growing on the <b>coniferous</b> <b>species</b> Abies, Larix, and Pinus.|$|E
25|$|In the {{northeast}} {{part of the}} range (United States and Canada), prime habitat consists of a forest canopy of hardwoods such as beech, maple, and birch, and <b>coniferous</b> <b>species.</b> Corn crops and oak-hickory mast are also common sources of food in some sections of the Northeast; small, thick swampy areas provide excellent refuge cover largely in stands of white cedar. Along the Pacific coast, redwood, Sitka spruce, and hemlocks predominate as overstory cover. Within these northern forest types are early successional areas important for black bears, such as fields of brush, wet and dry meadows, high tidelands, riparian areas, {{and a variety of}} mast-producing hardwood species. The spruce-fir forest dominates much of the range of the black bear in the Rockies. Important nonforested areas here are wet meadows, riparian areas, avalanche chutes, roadsides, burns, sidehill parks, and subalpine ridgetops.|$|E

40|$|Forest {{plantations}} {{have been}} widely used as an effective measure for increasing soil carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) stocks and soil enzyme activities play a key role in soil C and N losses during decomposition of soil organic matter. However, few studies have been carried out to elucidate the mechanisms behind the differences in soil C and N cycling by different tree species in response to climate warming. Here, we measured the responses of soil's extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) to a gradient of temperatures using incubation methods in 78 -year-old forest plantations with different tree species. Based on a soil enzyme kinetics model, we established a new statistical model to investigate the effects of temperature and tree species on soil EEA. In addition, we established a tree species–enzyme–C∕N model to investigate how temperature and tree species influence soil C∕N contents over time without considering plant C inputs. These extracellular enzymes included C acquisition enzymes (β -glucosidase, BG), N acquisition enzymes (N -acetylglucosaminidase, NAG; leucine aminopeptidase, LAP) and phosphorus acquisition enzymes (acid phosphatases). The results showed that incubation temperature and tree species significantly influenced all soil EEA and Eucalyptus had 1. 01 – 2. 86 times higher soil EEA than <b>coniferous</b> tree <b>species.</b> Modeling showed that Eucalyptus had larger soil C losses but had 0. 99 – 2. 38 times longer soil C residence time than the <b>coniferous</b> tree <b>species</b> over time. The differences in the residual soil C and N contents between Eucalyptus and <b>coniferous</b> tree <b>species,</b> as well as between slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii) and hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Ait.), increase with time. On the other hand, the modeling results help explain why exotic slash pine can grow faster, as it has 1. 22 – 1. 38 times longer residual soil N residence time for LAP, which mediate soil N cycling in the long term, than native <b>coniferous</b> tree <b>species</b> like hoop pine and kauri pine (Agathis robusta C.  Moore). Our results will be helpful for understanding the mechanisms of soil C and N cycling by different tree species, which will have implications for forest management...|$|R
