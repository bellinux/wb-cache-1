25|$|For a {{good deal}} of time, Ryang had to rely on Fanta to deal with evil affinities until they could be purified. This changed when Fanta's brother gave Ryang some strong magical {{abilities}} using his skateboard as a medium. So far, Ryang has used the skateboard to fly, and created a powerful energy blast by drawing on its power, even though it was nowhere near him. Five spirits can inhabit the skateboard, each representing one of the five elements (earth, fire, wood, water, and metal). Evidently, Ryang does not have to have the skateboard with him to access magical power, and is extremely likely he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> more.|$|E
25|$|The Keys hold {{sovereign}} {{power in}} their own demesne and their day. All other Keys are of equal power {{when they are not}} in their realm. The exception to this is Sunday's Key, which is paramount over the others. They <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> of what is asked of them, such as opening, locking, manipulating, and freezing items. The full powers of the Keys are not known, as of Lady Friday. According to Arthur, the Keys have the ability to kill anything they wish, be it Denizen, mortal, or Nithling. Beings that are none of these, such as the Architect, her consort the Old One, their three sons, and possibly Arthur in later books, may be immune.|$|E
500|$|After McNary-Haugen's defeat, Coolidge {{supported}} a less radical measure, the Curtis-Crisp Act, {{which would have}} created a federal board to lend money to farm co-operatives in times of surplus; the bill did not pass. In February 1927, Congress took up the McNary-Haugen bill again, this time narrowly passing it, and Coolidge vetoed it. In his veto message, he expressed {{the belief that the}} bill would do nothing to help farmers, benefiting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy. Congress did not override the veto, but it passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority; again, Coolidge vetoed it. [...] "Farmers never have made much money," [...] said Coolidge, the Vermont farmer's son. [...] "I do not believe we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> about it." ...|$|E

500|$|American critic Robert Christgau {{gave the}} album a [...] "neither" [...] rating, {{indicating}} an album that [...] "may impress {{once or twice}} with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won't". A negative review came from Rolling Stone, who gave the album two stars out of five, labelling the album [...] "utterly disappointing" [...] and blaming producer Nellee Hooper, suggesting he [...] "sabotaged a ferociously iconoclastic talent with a phalanx of cheap electronic gimmickry." [...] Michele Romero of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, saying, [...] "On a few songs, [...] breathy mewl is a pleasant contrast to the mechanical drone of Sugarcube-like techno-tunes. But most of Debut sounds annoyingly like the monotonous plinking of a deranged music box. Wind it up if you like -- eventually it will stop." [...] Debut rated highly in British end of year polls. The NME ranked Debut at number one on their list of [...] "Top 50 LPs of 1993". Melody Maker placed the album at number six on their list of [...] "Albums of the Year for 1993" [...] calling it [...] "a fantastic debut". In 1994, Q included the album on their list for top fifty albums of 1993. Björk reacted to the positive reviews hesitantly, stating that if she'd [...] "delivered exactly the same album and I came from Nottingham, I'd have got completely different reviews, normal down-to-earth ones" [...] and that Debut [...] "was {{a bit of a}} rehearsal and it's really not that good. I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> better." ...|$|E

2500|$|A poll {{released}} in early November 2008 found that voters supporting Obama listed {{health care as}} their second priority; voters supporting McCain listed it as fourth, tied with the war in Iraq.

2500|$|Practical action must {{be taken}} at the lower levels to match the {{competitive}} political vision. It may be tempting for the counter-insurgent side to simply declare guerrillas [...] "terrorists" [...] and pursue a harsh liquidation strategy. Brute force however, may not {{be successful in the}} long run. Action does not mean capitulation, but sincere steps such as removing corrupt or arbitrary officials, cleaning up fraud, building more infrastructure, collecting taxes honestly, or addressing other legitimate grievances <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> to undermine the guerrillas' appeal.|$|E
2500|$|For drone strikes to be effective, the United States must obtain consent {{from the}} host country they are {{operating}} in. The growing chorus of objections from host countries, most notably emanating from Pakistan, seriously inhibits drones’ effectiveness. [...] "Host states have grown frustrated with U.S. drone policy, while opposition by non-host partners could impose additional restrictions {{on the use of}} drones. Reforming U.S. drone strike policies <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> to allay concerns internationally by ensuring that targeted killings are defensible under international legal regimes that the United States itself helped establish and by allowing U.S. officials to openly address concerns and counter misinformation." [...] Micah Zenko at the Council on Foreign Relations believes the United States should [...] "end so-called signature strikes, which target unidentified militants based on their behavior patterns and personal networks, and limit targeted killings to a small number of specific terrorists with transnational ambitions. He wants more congressional oversight of drone strikes and stricter regulation on armed drone sales. Finally, he recommends the United States work with international partners to establish rules and norms governing the use of drones. Zenko believes the U.S. government has not been transparent regarding how non-battlefield drone strikes are reconciled with broader foreign policy objectives, the scope of legitimate targets, and their legal framework. While drones may be a critical counterterrorism tool that advances U.S. interests, their [...] "lack of transparency threatens to limit U.S. freedom of action and risks proliferation of armed drone technology without the requisite normative framework." [...] Zenko thinks current drone policy might share the same fate of the Bush-era enhanced interrogation techniques and warrantless wiretapping, both of which were unpopular, illegal and ultimately ended.|$|E
