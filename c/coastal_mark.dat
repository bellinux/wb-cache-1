5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in May 1943 did not signal {{the end of the}} Battle of the Atlantic. Some 60 vessels remained, and posed a threat to convoys. In later months, the Schnorchel, a device {{originated}} by the Dutch and later adopted by the Kriegsmarine after the Germans invaded the Netherlands were capable of allowing a U-boat to replace its air supply and vent its diesel exhaust without surfacing became available. However, it was sensitive to the weather, and put immense pressure and strain on crews who had to remain submerged for long period in hostile waters. Further, <b>Coastal's</b> <b>Mark</b> III radar could detect the mast. The smoke emitted was visible from 1,000 feet. In some cases the mast itself could be seen, some one foot in diameter, projecting two feet and moving at 12–15 knots. The technological response was to use High Tea, a series of sonobuoys dropped by aircraft onto the surface of the sea to detect U-boats. By late 1943, the U-bootwaffe was losing 20 percent of its strength per month. Some 70 percent that did return were seriously damaged.|$|R

5000|$|While {{he spent}} most of the year {{shocking}} Paris with his novel style and views, Seurat spent his summers painting wistful seascapes. In 1890, he traveled to the tiny port of Gravelines, near the Belgian border, and painted what would be his last four landscapes. That was two fewer paintings than he had produced the summer previous, perhaps because the broad <b>coastal</b> plain, <b>marked</b> only by dunes, was markedly different from his usual Normandy settings. The rise of the summer vacation meant artists found a ready market for seaside images. Unlike older artists such as Monet, though, Seurat preferred utterly prosaic images of ports and shores, rather than more dramatic sunsets and stormy seas. The complete lack of humans, either vacationers or hardworking fishermen, was typical of Seurat's seascapes, which always had a luminous stillness.|$|R

The limited number of modern fortifications built in Ireland, such as those with the first gunports retrofitted to Carrickfergus Castle in the 1560s and at Corkbeg in Cork Harbour and built in the 1570s in fear of an invasion, were equally unexceptional by European standards.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this study, the Navidad current, which flows {{along the}} {{northern}} coast of Spain in winter, is observed and characterized using coastal altimetry data over the period 1992 - 2002. This <b>coastal</b> current, <b>marked</b> by a strong interannual variability, is associated with eastward transport of warm waters along the shelf slope. Specific data editing and processing strategies have been applied to the along-track altimeter data, which allows us to retrieve altimetric sea level anomalies closer to the coast, with a better spatial coverage and improved quality when compared with standard altimetric products. The current variability observed upstream by in situ time series after November 1996 is well reproduced by the satellite across-track surface geostrophic current anomalies up until September 1999; this agreement degrades later in time. The combined use of satellite-derived current anomalies and sea-surface temperature anomalies allows us to develop indices of Navidad occurrences, in the first long-term, systematic survey of that current based on a multi-sensor approach. The satellite analyses confirm the previously identified Navidad occurrences in winter of 1995 - 1996, 1997 - 1998, and 2000 - 2001.

Major uncertainties exist {{in the rate of}} permafrost thaw and associated C emissions (33 - 508 Pg C or 0. 04 - 1. 69 °C by 2100; refs,) and plant C uptake. In the High Arctic, semi-deserts retain unique soil-plant-permafrost interactions and heterogeneous soil C pools (> 12 Pg C; ref.). Owing to its <b>coastal</b> proximity, <b>marked</b> changes are expected for High Arctic tundra. With declining summer sea-ice cover, these systems are simultaneously exposed to rising temperatures, increases in precipitation and permafrost degradation. Here we show, using measurements of tundra-atmosphere C fluxes and soil C sources (14 C) at a long-term climate change experiment in northwest Greenland, that warming decreased the summer CO 2 sink strength of semi-deserts by up to 55 %. In contrast, warming combined with wetting increased the CO 2 sink strength by an order of magnitude. Further, wetting while relocating recently assimilated plant C into the deep soil decreased old C loss compared with the warming-only treatment. Consequently, the High Arctic has the potential to remain a strong C sink even {{as the rest of the}} permafrost region transitions to a net C source as a result of future global warming. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|This study aims to {{reconstruct}} the Holocene to modern depositional environments and the evolution over the main controls of the sedimentation along the northern coast of Sfax (Tunisia) using three sediment cores retrieved at 30 meters water depth by SEACNVS (Société d'Étude et d'Aménagement des Côtes Nord de la Ville de Sfax). The identification {{of different types of}} depositional environments was mainly based on field work,mineralogical and sedimentological analyses of core sediments. Mineralogical analysis by X-ray diffraction have been done on bulk powder and on oriented aggregate of the clay < 2 microns fraction,particle size distribution,magnetic susceptibility was measured on opened cores with a Bartington MS 2 Epoint sensor and Loss-On-Ignition (LOI) was measured after 24 h at 105 °C (water content, density), after 4 h at 550 °C (organic matter content) and after 2 h at 950 °C (inorganic carbonate). The mineralogical composition is made by clay minerals, quartz, calcite, gypsum and K-feldspar. The mineralogy of < 2 μm clay fraction show a mixture of kaolinite,illite, smectite and palygorskite. As harp change in the magnetic susceptibility profiles records the transition from a marine to a continental depositional environment. The marine domain is characterized by lower magnetic susceptibility values and coarser sedimentary grain than the continental domain. The vertical succession of depositional facies is made by two contrasted environments: a fluvial depositional environment (<b>coastal</b> plain) <b>marked</b> by channels and inundation plains at the in the lower section of all cores; a littoral marine environment characterized by fossil sand depositions in the upper section. The sand is rich in gastropods, lamellibranches, algæ and benthic fauna (Ammonia tepida, Ammonia beccarii, Elphidium crispum, Peneroplis pertususles Miliolidae, Peneroplis pertusus, Rosalina sp and Peneroplis planatus). This facies evolution indicates a relative sea-level rise which flooded the fluvial system at the coastal plain during the late Holocene.

40|$|Titanosauriformes was a globally-distributed, {{long-lived}} clade {{of dinosaurs}} that contains both {{the largest and}} smallest known sauropods. In an effort to understand the phylogenetic relationships of their early (Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous) members, this dissertation presents a taxonomic revision of Early Cretaceous North American titanosauriforms and a lower-level cladistic analysis of basal titanosauriforms worldwide. Taxonomic revision renders some Early Cretaceous North American sauropods nomina dubia, substantially augments the hypodigm of others, and recognizes a new genus and species. This revision reinforces the similarity among Early Cretaceous North American dinosaur faunas; this homogeneity stands {{in marked contrast to}} the latitudinal variation in dinosaur faunas that developed later in the Cretaceous. Reports of titanosaurs in the Early Cretaceous of North America are unsubstantiated. The latest register of Early Cretaceous North American sauropods (before the ‘sauropod hiatus’) occurs in the <b>coastal</b> units <b>marking</b> transgression of the Western Interior Seaway, whereas eight ecologically disparate dinosaur lineages are present just below and above this boundary in the same geologic units that sauropods are found in. I thus interpret the start of the sauropod hiatus {{as the result of a}} continent-wide extinction, coincident with and perhaps attributable to competition with ornithischian herbivores, rather than the result of preservation or sampling bias. Cladistic analysis of 25 taxa and 114 characters results in the recovery of three main titanosauriform clades: Brachiosauridae, Euhelopodidae, and Titanosauria. A re-evaluation of the phylogenetic affinities of fragmentary taxa and footprints based on synapomorphies recovered in this analysis finds no evidence for titanosaurs before the Early Cretaceous, in contrast to previous reports of Middle and Late Jurassic forms. The origin of Titanosauria is enigmatic because the geologically oldest titanosaurs are derived forms (lithostrotians) found penecontemporaneously on both Laurasian and Gondwanan continents. Finally, I explore the bone histology (osteocyte morphology) of recent birds in an attempt to discover proxies of bone growth rate that can be applied to Titanosauriformes. Characterization of osteocyte shape and size reveals substantial intra-bone, intra-individual, and intra-specific variation, and highlights the need for sampling control in studies of fossil bone histology...|$|R
40|$|The Pliocene-Pleistocene Carcar Formation and the Quaternary Alluvium are {{two major}} lithologies that rim the entire island {{province}} of Cebu. The Carcar Formation (CaF) is predominantly limestone rock mass characterized by rolling to hilly topography while the Quaternary Alluvium (QA 1) is generally unconsolidated sedimentary deposit on <b>coastal</b> plain <b>marked</b> by low relief and undulating landscape. Mineralogical examinations of the vertisolic soil/clay horizons that mantle these rock formations were conducted to identify and characterize the nature of clay minerals using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetry (TG), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX). Analytical qualitative {{results show that the}} clays derived from the Carcar Formation are chiefly smectite-rich assemblage with supplemental association of mixed-layer kaolinite/smectite. Clays from the Quaternary Alluvium are the same as in the CaF, however, mixed-layer kaolinite/smectite in the QA 1 appears relatively richer than in the CaF. Quantitative estimates by computer simulation yield slight to moderate variations in the proportions of kaolinite and smectite in the mixed-layer phase, and correlatively, the degree of ordering is determined to be random in both CaF and QA 1 clay assemblages. Kaolinite content participating in the interstratified phase is discerned to be diagnostically higher in the alluvium than in the limestone. Calcite impurities occur greater in clays sourced from the Carcar Formation and are found comparatively rarer in the Quaternary Alluvium. Quartz is noted to be frequently present in minor to moderate amounts in both lithologies but is generally more persistent in the QA 1. The mixed-layer kaolinite/smectite phase is observed in both CaF and QA 1 and revealed that it is not an exotic clay phase exclusively confined in the red-burning clay area. Illite or illitic facies is found only in the QA 1 and is envisaged as authigenically or neogenically formed. Smectite with high rehydration capacity is recorded only in the CaF and is believed to be a result of its structure and beidellitic composition. ...|$|R

Urban bats remained in the city for foraging during pregnancy in spring, but increased largely their home ranges towards the marshland during lactation in early summer.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of beachrock outcrops {{along the coast}} of the Simeto River delta, the greater watercourse of Sicily, is described in this work. The delta is located into a microtidal context, where the wave energy action prevails on the coastal depositional processes as controlling factor. The deposits are constituted by discontinuous levels, 1 - 1, 2 meters thick of very well cemented arenitic sediments of recent age. The present human-induced changes of the precarious equilibrium regulating the sediment supply to the coast during last century, in the high part of the Simeto River drainage basin, caused strong erosion, with <b>marked</b> <b>coastal</b> land-loss examples. Because of that, the studied horizons have been quickly exposed from their original cover. As a consequence, they have been comprised into a vadose-freatic horizon, affected by percolation of meteoric and marine waters. Precipitation of calcite- and aragonite-rich solutions has determined their rapid cementation. For this reason, these discontinuous levels cropping out along the southern sector of Plaia di Catania beach are considered as recent incipient beachrocks sensu Kneale and Viles (2000). Beachrock formation, principally due to strong erosional rates characterising the Catania coastal plain, is also attributed to the high tectonic uplift rate, which has affected the whole eastern margin of Sicily, at least since the Upper Pleistocene...|$|R
40|$|The {{systematic}} {{exploitation of}} marine foods by terrestrial mammals lacking aquatic morphologies is rare. Widespread ethnographic and archaeological evidence from {{many areas of}} the world shows that modern humans living on coastlines often ratchet up the use of marine foods and develop social and technological characteristics unusual to hunter-gatherers and more consistent with small scale food producing societies. Consistent use of marine resources often is associated with reduced mobility, larger group size, population packing, smaller territories, complex technologies, increased economic and social differentiation, and more intense and wide-ranging gifting and exchange. The commitment to temporally and spatially predictable and dense coastal foods stimulates investment in boundary defense resulting in inter-group conflict as predicted by theory and documented by ethnography. Inter-group conflict provides an ideal context for the proliferation of intra-group cooperative behaviors beneficial to the group but not to the altruist (Bowles, 2009). The origins of this <b>coastal</b> adaptation <b>marks</b> a transformative point for the hominin lineage in Africa since all previous adaptive systems were likely characterized by highly mobile, low-density, egalitarian populations with large territories and little boundary defense. It is important to separate occasional uses of marine foods, present among several primate species, from systematic and committed coastal adaptations. This paper provides a critical review of where and when systematic use of coastal resources and coastal adaptations appeared in the Old World by a comparison of the records from Africa and Europe. It is found that during the Middle Stone Age in South Africa there is evidence that true coastal adaptations developed while there is, so far, a lack of evidence for even the lowest levels of systematic coastal resource use by Neanderthals in Europe. Differences in preservation, sample size, and productivity between these regions do not explain the pattern.

25|$|A Santa Ana fog is a {{derivative}} phenomenon {{in which a}} ground fog settles in coastal Southern California {{at the end of}} a Santa Ana wind episode. When Santa Ana conditions prevail, with winds in the lower two to three kilometers (1.25-1.8 miles) of the atmosphere from the north through east, the air over the coastal basin is extremely dry, and this dry air extends out over offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean. When the Santa Ana winds cease, the cool and moist marine layer may re-form rapidly over the ocean if conditions are right. The air in the marine layer becomes very moist and very low clouds or fog occurs. If wind gradients turn on-shore with enough strength, this sea fog is blown onto the <b>coastal</b> areas. This <b>marks</b> a sudden and surprising transition from the hot, dry Santa Ana conditions to cool, moist, and gray marine weather, as the Santa Ana fog can blow onshore and envelope cities in as quickly as fifteen minutes. However, a true Santa Ana fog is rare, because it requires conditions conducive to rapid re-forming of the marine layer, plus a rapid and strong reversal in wind gradients from off-shore to on-shore winds. More often, the high pressure system over the Great Basin, which caused the Santa Ana conditions in the first place, is slow to weaken or move east across the United States. In this more usual case, the Santa Ana winds cease, but warm, dry conditions under a stationary air mass continue for days or even weeks after the Santa Ana wind event ends.|$|R
