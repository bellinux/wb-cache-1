5|$|Terry Pratchett {{was pleased}} with the 1986 {{interactive}} fiction game The Colour of Magic, but criticised its poor marketing. He was reluctant to grant Discworld licences due to concern for the series, and wanted a reputable company who <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> property. Other video game companies had previously approached Pratchett seeking a licence. One such company was AdventureSoft, and their failure to obtain a Discworld licence {{led to the creation of}} Simon the Sorcerer, which took inspiration from the Discworld series of books.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} because the designer Gregg Barnett wanted a large adventure for CD-based systems. A licence {{was difficult to}} obtain; Pratchett was reluctant to grant one as he wanted a Discworld game to be developed by a company with a reputation and who <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> property. An original story was created due to Barnett having difficulty basing games on one book. Discworld was praised for its humour, voice-acting and graphics, though some criticised its gameplay and difficult puzzles. Discworld {{was followed by a}} sequel, , in 1996.|$|E

25|$|The reigns of John II Casimir Vasa, Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki and John III Sobieski brought further {{downgrading}} {{and loss}} of effectiveness of governmental authority, both {{in the domain of}} royal control and in the areas of legislative (central and local) ability to function and power. With the diminished fortunes of regular szlachta, the struggle for power and the rather feeble, bit still present attempts to reform the system took place within the changing alliances of powerful magnates and royal courts. From the time of John Casimir and his wife Marie Louise, who <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> well-being of the Commonwealth, but were obsessively preoccupied with the issue of royal succession, the Polish–Lithuanian state was informally divided into a number of territorial domains, practically controlled by regional top feudal lords, inclined to pursue their private and familial interests in the first place.|$|E

After Philip's {{assassination}} in June 1208, Prince-Archbishop Valdemar {{as well as}} the burghers and the city of Bremen joined the party of the former rival king OttoIV, whom InnocentIII crowned Emperor in 1209. OttoIV persuaded ValdemarII to withdraw into the north of the Elbe and urged anti-archbishop Burchard to resign. Bremen's cathedral chapter had fallen out with Valdemar and reconciled with Hamburg's concathedral chapter to elect a new archbishop, this time searching the papal consent. This made Valdemar search for the papal recognition as archbishop, in 1210 he pilgrimaged to Rome and craved Innocent's forgiving, and he pardoned him and lifted his ban against Valdemar. Innocent entitled Valdemar to serve as metropolitan of Bremen ecclesiastical province and archbishop and to ordain priests. Thus recognised by pope and emperor Valdemar departed for Bremen.|$|E

He also claimed that the UN is not for peace or the Palestinian people but simply against Israel, and pointed out that if the UN really <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation of the Palestinians, they would have taken at least one decision regarding the situation of the Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon, where Palestinians are being persecuted and systematically discriminated against.|$|E

According to Kimmo and Johansson, they <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game's content, not just the technical aspects, and made a game that they found fun themselves. They created two reoccurring characters based on themselves, who appear throughout the game: Kimmo, based on the real Kimmo, and the [...] "cottage council chairman" [...] Thorvald, who represents Johansson. As Kann was interested in language, and had specific ideas of how to spell certain words, they used consistently correct grammar, while consistently using non-standard spelling for words such as [...] "sig" [...] ("oneself") and [...] "dem" [...] ("them"), rendering them as [...] "sej" [...] and [...] "dom".|$|E

500|$|Abramski's first {{defense was}} that the {{misrepresentation}} was not material since his uncle was legally capable of making the purchase himself, and {{that the answer to}} the question of whether he was purchasing the gun for himself was not required to be kept on the firearms dealer's record. When reaching the Supreme Court, Abramski modified his defense and claimed that the law only cares about the person buying the gun from the dealer, not the final receiver of the gun. The Court did not agree with this interpretation and held that the law <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> final receiver, which is properly considered the person buying the gun. Such straw arrangement, the Court held, are different from allowed transfers where a person buys a gun for himself and later decides to sell it. The court therefore found that the misrepresentation was material and also that the answer was required to be kept on the dealer's record. The Court thus held that the purchase violated 18 U.S.C. §922(a)(6), which makes it unlawful to falsify facts [...] "material to the lawfulness of the sale,” and 18 U.S.C. §924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits misrepresentation with respect to information which a is required to maintain on record. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the declaration about the ultimate recipient of the gun was not material to the sale, and that it is not included in the information that the dealer is required to keep on the records. After the ruling, proponents of gun control stated that the Court's decision will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, while opponents of gun control stated that the ruling is a [...] "horrible injustice".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} rated R for [...] "pervasive vulgar {{language}} and crude sexual humor, {{and for some}} violent images" [...] by the Motion Picture Association of America; this rating did not come as surprise to most media outlets, as many had predicted long before that the film would likely be for ages 18 and over. However, {{there was much more}} discussion within the MPAA than initially reported in the media. The board's objections to the film were described in highly specific terms by Paramount Pictures executives in private memos circulating at Paramount. For months the ratings board insisted on the more prohibitive NC-17. South Park was screened by the MPAA six times—five times, the board returned the movie to Paramount with an NC-17. The last submission the filmmakers received was an NC-17, two weeks before release. A marketing agent from Paramount called the two and explained that the studio [...] "needed" [...] an R. In response, Stone called producer Scott Rudin and [...] "freaked out." [...] Rudin then called a Paramount executive and, in Stone's words, [...] "freaked out on them." [...] The next day the film was changed to an R rating without reason, with the original film intact. [...] "The ratings board only <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dirty words; they're so confused and arbitrary," [...] said Parker to The New York Times shortly before the release of the picture. [...] "They didn't blink twice because of violence." [...] During production of the trailer for the film, the raters objected to certain words but had no problem with a scene in which cartoon bullets are killing soldiers. [...] "They had a problem with words, not bullets," [...] he said. The MPAA gave Paramount specific notes for the film; in contrast, Parker and Stone's NC-17 comedy Orgazmo, released in 1998 by Rogue Pictures, was not given any specifications on how to make the movie acceptable for an R rating. The duo attributed the R rating to the fact that Paramount {{is a member of the}} MPAA; the distributor dismissed these claims. The film was given a 15 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification for [...] "frequent coarse language and crude sexual references" [...] with no cuts made. It was rated MA15+ (Mature accompanied for those under 15) by the Australian Classification Board without cuts.|$|E
