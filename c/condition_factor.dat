40|$|The "condition" {{is used as}} an {{indicator}} of fish health and is generally equated with the quantity of energy reserves. Biometric <b>condition</b> <b>factors</b> have been widely used and preferred over costly and time-consuming biochemical condition. Here, we investigated the relevance of four common <b>condition</b> <b>factors</b> based on biometric measurements (Le Cren's index, girth -length index, gonado-somatic index and hepato-somatic index) and of size- and weight -based empirical models to describe the physiological condition of tropical tunas. Biometric <b>condition</b> <b>factors</b> of bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) tunas sampled throughout 2013 in the western Indian Ocean region were assessed against benchmark biochemical indices (lipid content, protein content, triacylglycerol:sterol ratio and energy density) estimated in tissues with different physiological functions, i. e. red muscle, white muscle, liver, and gonads. Our findings suggest that tropical tunas do not store lipids in white muscle and that protein content is less variable than lipid content, which largely varies with ontogeny and the seasons according to tissue and species. This variability induced inconsistency between biometric factors, including the empirically adjusted ones, and biochemical indices, {{with the exception of the}} gonado-somatic index that fitted well to the composition of the gonads in the three species, and especially in females.

40|$|In this study, length-weight {{relationships}} and relative <b>condition</b> <b>factors</b> were analyzed for Yellow Croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) {{along the north}} coast of China. Data covered six regions from north to south: Yellow River Estuary, Coastal Waters of Northern Shandong, Jiaozhou Bay, Coastal Waters of Qingdao, Haizhou Bay, and South Yellow Sea. In total 3, 275 individuals were collected during six years (2008, 2011 - 2015). One generalized linear model, two simply linear models and nine linear mixed effect models that applied the effects from regions and/or years to coefficient a and/or the exponent b were studied and compared. Among these twelve models, the linear mixed effect model with random effects from both regions and years fit the data best, with lowest Akaike information criterion value and mean absolute error. In this model, the estimated a was 0. 0192, with 95 % confidence interval 0. 0178 ~ 0. 0308, and the estimated exponent b was 2. 917 with 95 % confidence interval 2. 731 ~ 2. 945. Estimates for a and b with the random effects in intercept and coefficient from Region and Year, ranged from 0. 013 to 0. 023 and from 2. 835 to 3. 017, respectively. Both regions and years had effects on parameters a and b, while the effects from years were shown to be much larger than those from regions.
