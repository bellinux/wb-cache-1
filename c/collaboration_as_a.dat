2500|$|Other Scots were induced to sign {{bonds and}} take {{payments}} from the English and became [...] "assured men". A sample bond for assurance {{was drafted by}} a Scot Henry Balnaves at St Andrews Castle in December 1546. This mostly happened in the war-zones of the border and around English garrisons. After the war ended many Scots were accused of assurance or <b>collaboration</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> crime; 192 citizens of Dundee were acquitted in 1553 and the whole town of Dumfries received a pardon. In July 1549 with English losses in France the assurance system ceased. James Henrisoun then asked his English masters [...] "Whether it were better to conquer hearts without charges, or burn, and build forts at great charges, which will never conquer Scotland?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1925 {{was a major}} {{turning point}} in Kern's career when he met Oscar Hammerstein II, with whom he would {{entertain}} a lifelong friendship and <b>collaboration.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> young man, Kern had been an easy companion with great charm and humor, but he became less outgoing in his middle years, sometimes difficult to work with: he once introduced himself to a producer by saying, [...] "I hear you're {{a son of a}} bitch. [...] So am I." [...] He rarely collaborated with any one lyricist for long. [...] With Hammerstein, however, he remained on close terms {{for the rest of his}} life. [...] Their first show, written together with Harbach, was Sunny, which featured the song [...] "Who (Stole My Heart Away)?" [...] Marilyn Miller played the title role, as she had in Sally. [...] The show ran for 517 performances on Broadway, and the following year ran for 363 performances in the West End, starring Binnie Hale and Jack Buchanan.|$|E

2500|$|Senator Feinstein {{has been}} one of Congress's strongest advocates for victims' rights. In the 1990s, Senator Feinstein was one of the {{original}} sponsors, along with Republican Senator Jon Kyl, of an effort to amend the United States Constitution to protect victims' rights in trial. Though the constitutional amendment ultimately failed, Senators Kyl and Feinstein authored the 2004 Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act, which listed a victims' bill of rights and provided mandamus relief in appellate court for any victim denied those rights. The act also offered sanctions against government officials who wantonly and willfully refused to comply with the Crime Victims' Rights Act. Both Senators Kyl and Feinstein described their <b>collaboration</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> high point of bi-partisan collaboration in their careers. In front of the Senate, Senator Kyl said, [...] "This legislation would not be before us today without Senator Feinstein. That is simply a fact. For all of the hard work we have put in with her cooperation and her commitment to this, I thank Senator Feinstein deeply. She knows that bond of trust will continue to exist between us." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{collaboration}} is not however, {{to be confused}} with assimilation or [...] "selling out". [...] The romance plots in the novel have been perceived as assimilationist as if the Anglo men are conquering the Mexican women. [...] However, as Cotera notes, [...] "such criticisms are founded, of course, on the exigencies of race and nation, forcing what is essentially a critique of patriarchal ideology into service as a critique of imperialism, a service that the novel only imperfectly satisfies". [...] Instead of viewing the <b>collaboration</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "sell out" [...] or a problem, it {{can be viewed as a}} nepantla, a term the highly acclaimed and respected Chicana scholar Gloria Anzaldúa uses based on a Nahuatl word that refers to [...] "a space between or a middle ground". [...] This concept favors the recognition of the humanity in others and ourselves in order to create bridges and overcome borders. [...] This works on multiple levels, [...] "collapsing ‘the binaries of colored/white, female/male, mind/body," [...] all of which are relevant to Caballero and the historical context of the novel. [...] Eimer and Gonzalez took a leap of faith in one another in both their friendship and their work, as [...] "Caballero's collaborations across difference take place against a historical and geographical backdrop that highlights the risks that such a crossing entail a U.S.-Mexico borderlands still in formation in 1846-1848…". [...] It cannot be stressed enough that beyond the Mexican/Anglo leap of faith taken, the text works with many layers of collaboration on the [...] "path of conocimiento". Caballero's structure of genres is [...] "part history, part tragedy, part romance, part feminist tract," [...] and [...] "its multivalent strategies of description reflect the very complexity of the historical transformations that it seeks to document.|$|E
