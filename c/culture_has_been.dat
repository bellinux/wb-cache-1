5|$|The {{role of the}} sea {{in human}} <b>culture</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{important}} for centuries, as people experience the sea in contradictory ways: as powerful but serene, beautiful but dangerous.

In the works of the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the sea symbolises the personal and the collective unconscious in dream interpretation.|$|E
