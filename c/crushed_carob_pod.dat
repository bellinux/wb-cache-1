40|$|Carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua L.) is a {{perennial}} leguminous evergreen tree {{native to the}} coastal regions of the Mediterranean basin and {{is considered to be}} an important component of vegetation for economic and environmental reasons. Two constituents of the pod, pulp and seeds, can be used as feed or in food production. In this study, drying characteristics, texture and microstructure of <b>carob</b> <b>pods</b> were studied. Three different carob samples were prepared: whole <b>carob</b> <b>pod,</b> <b>carob</b> <b>pod</b> parts and <b>carob</b> seed. The drying experiments and the modelling showed that carob seeds had the highest drying rate, followed by pod parts and the whole, intact carob fruit. Texture studies showed that the maximum compression force depended on the area of the carob fruit on which compression tests were performed. The seeds showed the highest compression force, followed by the stem zone, the tip and the centre of the fruit. Differences in drying behaviour and texture of <b>carob</b> <b>pods</b> can successfully be interpreted by the micromorphology of the <b>carob</b> <b>pods</b> and seeds.

The influence of secondary carbon sources (maltose, lactose and galactose) on dextran molecular weight and fermented broth viscosity were also studied. Significant changes were not observed in broth viscosity during dextran production at initial sucrose concentration of 20 and 120 g/l. Complementary sugars maltose, lactose and galactose together with sucrose promote {{production of}} dextran with fewer glucose units. Dextran molecular weight decreases from the range 1, 890, 000 – 10, 000, 000 to 240, 000 – 400, 000 Da when complementary sugars are present.

Because of {{the strong}} {{association}} with health benefits of some chemical compounds contained in carob fruit the composition of chemical substances of two common type <b>carob</b> <b>pods</b> (Ceratonia siliqua L.) and their changes during fruit developing in two periods of harvesting were reported. Samples were originated from a site near Rethymno, Crete Island, {{at an altitude of}} 100 m above the sea level. The moisture content determined through sample’s drying in 70 oC under vacuum, sugars by HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography), total polyphenols by ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) and fatty acids by gas chromatography (GC) in the fleshy and wild types were determined at three stages of development. Principal sugars found were glucose, fructose and sucrose. The predominant fatty acid was linoleic acid (n- 6) followed by oleic, palmitic and then linolenic (n- 3) fatty acids. The total unsaturated fatty acids content was two times higher than the content of total saturated fatty acids in fully-developed <b>carob</b> <b>pod.</b> The ratio n- 6 /n- 3 was under 5, showing a good equilibrium between the two essential fatty acids.

Sucrose (437. 3 mg/g dry weight), glucose (395. 8 mg/g dry weight) and fructose (42. 3 mg/g dry weight) were the major sugars identified and quantified in the fruit. Total phenolics (13. 51 mg gallic acid equivalents [GAE]/g dry weight), proanthocyanidin (0. 36 mg GAE/g dry weight), gallotannins (0. 41 catechin equivalents [CE]/g dry weight) and flavanols (3. 21 mg CE/g dry weight protein) content of the fruit were also determined.

Tannic acid and the tannin fraction of carob extract exerted both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on C. fulvus. Respiration of C. fulvus in the presence of bactericidal concentrations of tannic acid or tannin fraction of carob extract was inhibited less than 30 %.

However, the CA concentration decreased dramatically once the initial pH exceeded 7.0, consistent with results from Roukas (1998) on the effect of initial pH on CA production from <b>carob</b> <b>pods</b> by surface fermentation.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the in vivo {{anthelmintic}} activity of sainfoin hay (Onobrychis viciifolia) and <b>carob</b> <b>pod</b> meal (Ceratonia siliqua) against gastrointestinal nematodes. Seven days before infection, 64 naive lambs were assigned to four different groups: Group S received sainfoin hay and group CAR was fed with <b>carob</b> <b>pods.</b> The remaining lambs received lucerne hay (Medicago sativa) and were assigned to positive (non-treated, NT) and negative (treated, T) control groups (treatment with albendazole). On day 0, lambs were artificially trickle infected for 6  weeks, with a mixture of infective larvae of Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Parasitological and pathophysiological parameters were measured repeatedly during the 2 -month study. Compared to the NT group, decreases in egg excretion were observed in the CAR and S groups with significant differences only found for sainfoin (p <  0. 05). At necropsy, group S showed decreases in the total worm numbers of both nematode species with significant differences for H. contortus. In contrast, no differences were noticed for the CAR group. Compared to the NT group, lower values for fecundity of female H. contortus were found in the S and CAR groups, however differences were non-significant. No differences in body weight gains were found between groups. Consistent results were found showing significantly higher packed cell volume (PCV) values in the T and S groups compared to NT and CAR groups. Overall, these results confirm a positive effect associated with the feeding of lambs with tanniniferous resources on host resilience (PCV values) and against gastrointestinal parasitic nematodes by affecting some biological traits of worm populations (e. g. eggs per gram of faeces and worm numbers). However, the anthelmintic effects differed between the two tannin-containing resources, which might be associated with the quantity and/or quality of secondary metabolites (condensed tannins and/or other polyphenols) ...|$|R
