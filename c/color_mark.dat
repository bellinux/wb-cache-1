Sanchez believes these tools along with her abstract style “allows the viewer a greater opportunity to enter into interaction with the work and to project their own interpretation of what is going on”, overall creating greater dialogue between the viewer and the work.|$|E

40|$|The Qualitex {{decision}} in 1995 inspired trademark reformation and harmonization worldwide {{for the protection}} of color marks. While protecting color trademarks has not created issues of market entry in domestic markets, the {{growth in the number of}} transnational market participants and an increased utilization of non-traditional branding may catalyze color depletion in international trade. After exploring how current advertising expenditure requirements and distinctiveness requirements affect the registrability and protection of a <b>color</b> <b>mark,</b> this Note offers potential global reforms to help minimize hurdles for small scale transnational participants and the threat of international color depletion. Specifically, due to consumers 2 ̆ 7 increasing exposure to international brands through e-commerce, courts should give more deference to survey results on Internet platforms to establish distinctiveness in the brand 2 ̆ 7 s relevant customer base. The proposals in this Note will benefit trademark owners and potential transnational market participants by ensuring that consumer confusion is based on actual market practices, which will in turn prevent color depletion by keeping widely used colors in the public domain. Ultimately, by remaining conscious of the facts and issues presented in this Note, attorneys, legislators, and trademark owners can ensure fair market competition and mitigate color depletion from taking place in transnational trade...|$|E
40|$|Successful halo-model {{descriptions}} of the luminosity dependence of clustering distinguish between the central galaxy in a halo {{and all the others}} (satellites). To include colors, we provide a prescription for how the color-magnitude relation of centrals and satellites depends on halo mass. This follows from two assumptions: (i) the bimodality of the color distribution at fixed luminosity is independent of halo mass, and (ii) the fraction of satellite galaxies which populate the red sequence increases with luminosity. We show that these two assumptions allow one to build a model of how galaxy clustering depends on color without any additional free parameters than those required to model the luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering. We then show that the resulting model is in good agreement with the distribution and clustering of colors in the SDSS, both by comparing the predicted correlation functions of red and blue galaxies with measurements, and by comparing the predicted <b>color</b> <b>mark</b> correlation function with the measured one. Mark correlation functions are powerful tools for identifying and quantifying correlations between galaxy properties and their environments: our results indicate that the correlation between halo mass and environment is the primary driver for correlations between galaxy colors and the environment; additional correlations associated with halo `assembly bias' are relatively small. Our approach shows explicitly how to construct mock catalogs which include both luminosities and colors [...] thus providing realistic training sets for, e. g., galaxy cluster finding algorithms. Our prescription is the first step towards incorporating the entire spectral energy distribution into the halo model approach. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted to MNRAS. Minor revisions were made, and a plot was adde...|$|E
40|$|Current {{analytic}} and semi-analytic {{dark matter}} halo models {{distinguish between the}} central galaxy in a halo and the satellite galaxies in halo substructures. It is expected that galaxy properties are correlated with host halo mass, and that central galaxies {{tend to be the}} most luminous, massive, and reddest galaxies in halos while the satellites around them are fainter and bluer. Using a recent halo-model description of the color dependence of galaxy clustering (Skibba & Sheth 2008), we investigate the colors of central and satellite galaxies predicted by the model and compare them to those of two galaxy group catalogs constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Yang et al. 2007, Berlind et al. 2006 a). In the model, the environmental dependence of galaxy color is determined by that of halo mass, and the predicted <b>color</b> <b>mark</b> correlations were shown to be consistent with SDSS measurements. The model assumes that satellites tend to follow a color-magnitude sequence that approaches the red sequence at bright luminosities; the model’s success suggests that bright satellites tend to be ‘red and dead ’ while the star formation in fainter ones {{is in the process of}} being quenched. In both the model and the SDSS group catalogs, we find that at fixed luminosity or stellar mass, central galaxies tend to be bluer than satellites. In contrast, at fixed group richness or halo mass, central galaxies tend to be redder than satellites, and galaxy colors become redder with increasing mass. We also compare the central and satellite galaxy color distributions, as a function of luminosity and as a function of richness, in the model and in the two group catalogs. Except for faint galaxies and small groups, the model and both group catalogs are in very good agreement...|$|E

40|$|Laser <b>color</b> <b>marking</b> of {{stainless}} steel {{has been in the}} interests of different industries for some time. Still wide use of the process is not seen on consumer products which might be because of lack of their usability information. Laser processing {{of stainless}} steel surfaces creates an oxide layer on the surface. The thickness of this layer defines how white light is reflected from the surface. What in principle is only a thin oxide layer on the surface can be seen as different colors by the viewer. If this oxide layer is thick and solid it will have good corrosion and wear properties. Consumer products are constantly under certain corrosion and wear. In this study, the corrosion and wear properties of laser <b>color</b> <b>marking</b> on AISI Type 304 L (EN 1. 4307) austenitic stainless steel were evaluated based on laser process parameters and colors. The results show that the corrosion properties of marked surface expressed as critical pitting temperatures (CPT) depend on heat input: coarsely the lower heat input the higher CPT. Also scanning velocity has a remarkable effect on CPT. The laser <b>color</b> <b>marking</b> parameters have a significant influence on the wear behaviour of both the surface itself and that of the counter body surface. Laser <b>color</b> <b>marking</b> has high potential to become a widely used technique for product marking and decoration...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether honeybees {{can learn to}} fly through complex mazes, in the presence or the absence of specific visual cues. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bees can learn to fly through a complex maze by following a trail of <b>colored</b> <b>marks.</b> 2. Bees, initially trained to follow <b>color</b> <b>marks</b> through an initial part of the maze, are immediately {{able to use the}} same sign-tracking cue to find their way {{through the rest of the}} maze, which is unfamiliar to them. 3. Bees trained to follow <b>color</b> <b>marks</b> through a particular maze can use the same cue to negotiate a novel maze. 4. Bees trained to use a particular color to negotiate a maze can immediately use a novel color to negotiate the same maze or even a novel maze. 5. After learning to negotiate a maze by following <b>colored</b> <b>marks,</b> bees can find their way through the maze even when the marks are removed, albeit at reduced levels of accuracy. Thus, the trained bees do not rely solely on sign-tracking to find their way through the maze: they also acquire a spatial memory of the maze or at least a sequence of motor commands describing the correct path through it. 6. Bees can learn to use color as a signal even when it indicates the path through the maze in a symbolic way, for example, blue indicating a turn to the light and green a turn to the left. 7. Bees can learn an unmarked maze. Performance under these conditions is poorer than when marks are provided, but is still significantly better than chance level. 8. Control experiments rule out the use of external landmarks in all of these situations. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R
