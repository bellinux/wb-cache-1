5|$|As of 2016, {{the genus}} {{contains}} nine accepted species. There are seven species of <b>crested</b> newts: Anatolian <b>crested</b> newt (Triturus anatolicus), Balkan <b>crested</b> newt (T. ivanbureschi), Danube <b>crested</b> newt (T. dobrogicus), Italian <b>crested</b> newt (T. carnifex), Macedonian <b>crested</b> newt (T. macedonicus), northern <b>crested</b> newt (T. cristatus), and southern <b>crested</b> newt (T. karelinii). Marbled newts have two species, the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) {{and the southern}} marbled newt (T. pygmaeus).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the northern <b>crested</b> newt to the north, the Danube <b>crested</b> newt's range borders that of the Italian <b>crested</b> newt (T.carnifex) in the west, {{and that of the}} Macedonian (T.macedonicus) and Balkan (T.ivanbureschi) <b>crested</b> newts in the south.|$|E
5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern <b>crested</b> newt, {{and the northern}} <b>crested</b> newt in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, especially in the <b>crested</b> newts, means that native species can be genetically polluted through the introduction of close species, {{as it is the}} case with the Italian <b>crested</b> newt introduced in the range of the northern <b>crested</b> newt. Warmer and wetter winters due to global warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially susceptible to the highly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, introduced to Europe from Asia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Crest</b> brand {{has also}} been {{associated}} with about twenty brands of dental care products, including toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, dental floss, and a tooth-whitening product called <b>Crest</b> Whitestrips. Examples of toothpastes include <b>Crest</b> Pro Health, <b>Crest</b> 3D White, <b>Crest</b> Tartar Protection, <b>Crest</b> Whitening and Scope flavored toothpaste. From 2004 to 2010, <b>Crest</b> sold dental floss under the <b>Crest</b> Glide brand, which is now called Oral-B Glide. The original <b>Crest</b> logo was designed by Donald Deskey.|$|R
2500|$|Neural <b>crest</b> cells {{originating}} from different positions along the anterior-posterior axis develop into various tissues. [...] These regions of neural <b>crest</b> {{can be divided}} into four main functional domains, which include the cranial neural <b>crest,</b> trunk neural <b>crest,</b> vagal and sacral neural <b>crest,</b> and cardiac neural <b>crest.</b>|$|R
50|$|The present <b>crest</b> was {{introduced}} in 2009 and features three viking longboats from the <b>crest</b> of Waterford City, and {{a representation of the}} round tower in Ardmore. The <b>crest</b> introduced in 2009 was a further refinement of a <b>crest</b> introduced in 2003. The new <b>crest</b> replaced the original <b>crest</b> of Waterford City. The new <b>crest</b> {{was introduced}} as the Waterford GAA board were unable to copyright the old one due to it being a civil <b>crest.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Danube <b>crested</b> newt was {{described}} as a variety of the northern <b>crested</b> newt (Triturus cristatus) by C. Kiritzescu in 1903. Later, it was considered a subspecies until genetic analysis supported its recognition as a separate species in the <b>crested</b> newt species complex. The northern <b>crested</b> newt is its likely sister species according to a molecular phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA; analysis of nuclear DNA gives however some conflicting results regarding this sister relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} <b>crested</b> newt is {{the most}} widespread species, while the others are confined to smaller regions, e.g. the southwestern Iberian Peninsula in the southern marbled newt, and the Danube basin {{and some of its}} tributaries in the Danube <b>crested</b> newt. The Italian <b>crested</b> newt (T. carnifex) has been introduced outside its native range in some European countries and the Azores. In the northern Balkans, four species of <b>crested</b> newt occur in close vicinity, and may sometimes even co-exist.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious colour {{differences}} between <b>crested</b> and marbled newts, {{species in the}} genus also have different body forms. They range from stocky with sturdy limbs in the Anatolian, Balkan and the southern <b>crested</b> newt {{as well as the}} marbled newts, to very slender with short legs in the Danube <b>crested</b> newt. These types were first noted by herpetologist Willy Wolterstorff, who used the ratio of forelimb length to distance between fore- and hindlimbs to distinguish subspecies of the <b>crested</b> newt (now full species); this index however sometimes leads to misidentifications. The number of rib-bearing vertebrae in the skeleton was shown to be a better species indicator. It ranges from 12 in the marbled newts to 16–17 in the Danube <b>crested</b> newt and is usually observed through radiography on dead or sedated specimens.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the more}} notable floods after 1844 include the 1909 flood, <b>cresting</b> at 36.3 ft; the 1915 flood, <b>cresting</b> at 31 ft; the 1928 flood, <b>cresting</b> at 38.65 ft; the 1944 flood, <b>cresting</b> at 36.5 ft; the 1951 flood, <b>cresting</b> at 42.97 ft; and the 2007 flood, <b>cresting</b> at 36.07 ft.|$|R
25|$|During their existence, NAC had 4 {{different}} <b>crests.</b> After their {{foundation in}} 1912, their <b>crest</b> {{was a black}} shield, with a yellow diagonal line running over it and in it the letters N.A.C.. This <b>crest</b> was replaced in 1968 by another <b>crest.</b> The reason for this <b>crest</b> change is unknown. In 1974 the <b>crest</b> {{was replaced by a}} <b>crest</b> which contained the letters NAC in a black and yellow combination. The <b>crest</b> was most probably changed due to the dismissal of the NAC board in 1974. In order to state a new beginning, a new board member’s daughter designed NAC’s third <b>crest.</b>|$|R
50|$|The truncal neural <b>crest</b> or trunk neural <b>crest</b> {{is a form}} {{of neural}} <b>crest.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Crested</b> and marbled newts {{are found}} in Eurasia, from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula {{in the west to}} West Siberia and the {{southern}} Caspian Sea region in the east, and reach north to central Fennoscandia. Overall, the species have contiguous, parapatric ranges; only the northern <b>crested</b> newt and the marbled newt occur sympatrically in western France, and the southern <b>crested</b> newt has a disjunct, allopatric distribution in Crimea, the Caucasus, and south of the Caspian Sea.|$|E
5|$|<b>Crested</b> newts {{are dark}} brown, with black {{spots on the}} sides, and white {{stippling}} in some species. Their belly is yellow to orange with black blotches, forming a pattern characteristic for individuals. Females and juveniles of some species have a yellow line running down their back and tail. During breeding phase, <b>crested</b> newts change in appearance, most markedly the males. These develop a skin seam running along their back and tail; this crest is the namesake feature of the <b>crested</b> newts and can be up to 1.5cm high and very jagged in the northern <b>crested</b> newt. Another feature of males at breeding time is a silvery-white band {{along the sides of}} the tail.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic data helped clarify {{relationships}} within the genus Triturus. A 2011 phylogeny based on complete mitochondrial DNA resolved all divergences with high statistical support. The <b>crested</b> and the marbled newts are sister groups, {{and within the}} <b>crested</b> newts, the Balkan–Asian group with T. anatolicus, T. karelinii and T. ivanbureschi is sister to the remaining species, results consistent with other studies. The mitochondrial analysis also supports the northern (T. cristatus) and the Danube <b>crested</b> newt (T. dobrogicus), {{as well as the}} Italian (T. carnifex) and the Macedonian <b>crested</b> newt (T. macedonicus), respectively, as sister species, but analysis of nuclear DNA gave some conflicting results regarding those divergences.|$|E

2500|$|In English heraldic {{practice}} the <b>crest,</b> the device or emblem that appears above the helmet or chapeau {{in a full}} coat of arms, should not duplicate any <b>crest</b> previously granted. Just as each shield should be unique, so too should each <b>crest.</b> In Scotland, however, it is permissible, and not uncommon, for two or more different families to bear the same <b>crest.</b> [...] As Scottish heraldry joins the <b>crest</b> and motto in the <b>crest</b> badge, however, the combination of <b>crest</b> and motto should, in each case, be unique.|$|R
5|$|The Danube <b>crested</b> newt's {{back and}} sides are dark brown with black spots and white stippling. The belly is orange to red (in other <b>crested</b> newts, {{it is usually}} yellow or orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all <b>crested</b> newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which can be quite high and jagged and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the other}} <b>crested</b> newt species, the Danube <b>crested</b> newt is more adapted to life along a river system and {{frequently}} occurs in flowing water and together with fish. Typical breeding sites are slow-flowing river margins, oxbow lakes, flooded marshland, larger ponds, or ditches, provided abundant underwater vegetation is available. During land phase, the newts live in deciduous forests or groves, bushlands, or meadows.|$|E

50|$|Forte <b>Crest</b> Hotels {{were more}} {{upmarket}} business hotels than Forte Posthouse. They were mostly located {{in cities and}} were mostly four-star. The naming convention was Forte <b>Crest</b> + {{the name of the}} city or locality, e.g. Forte <b>Crest</b> Sheffield or Forte <b>Crest</b> Gatwick Airport. Perhaps the most high-profile hotel was the huge Forte <b>Crest</b> Heathrow, now a Holiday Inn. The signage and general get up colour of <b>Crest</b> hotels was light blue/aquamarine.|$|R

The blazon of the heraldic <b>crest</b> within a clan members <b>crest</b> badge is A tower embattled Argent. The heraldic motto upon the <b>crest</b> badge is VIRTUE MINE HONOUR.|$|R
5|$|Historically, most European newts were {{included}} in the genus, but taxonomists have split off the alpine newts (Ichthyosaura), the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton) and the banded newts (Ommatotriton) as separate genera. The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts (Calotriton). Two species of marbled newts and seven species of <b>crested</b> newts are accepted, of which the Anatolian <b>crested</b> newt was only described in 2016. Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap, hybridisation may take place.|$|E

5|$|The aquatic {{habitats}} {{preferred by}} the newts are stagnant, mid- to large-sized, unshaded water bodies with abundant underwater vegetation but without fish, which prey on larvae. Typical examples are larger ponds, which {{need not be}} of natural origin; indeed, most ponds inhabited by the northern <b>crested</b> newt in the UK are human-made. Examples of other suitable secondary habitats are ditches, channels, gravel pit lakes, garden ponds, or (in the Italian <b>crested</b> newt) rice paddies. The Danube <b>crested</b> newt is more adapted to flowing water and often breeds in river margins, oxbow lakes or flooded marshland, where it frequently co-occurs with fish. Other newts {{that can be found}} in syntopy with Triturus species include the smooth, the palmate, the Carpathian, and the alpine newt.|$|E
5|$|The <b>crested</b> newts are {{believed}} to have originated in the Balkans and radiated in a brief time interval between 11.5 and 8 mya: First, the Balkan–Asian group (the Anatolian, Balkan and southern <b>crested</b> newt) branched off from the other <b>crested</b> newts, probably in a vicariance event caused by the separation of the Balkan and Anatolian land masses. The origin of current-day species is not fully understood so far, but one hypothesis suggests that ecological differences, notably in the adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle, may have evolved between populations and led to parapatric speciation. Alternatively, the complex geological history of the Balkan peninsula may have further separated populations there, with subsequent allopatric speciation and the spread of species into their current ranges.|$|E

50|$|A new battle {{mechanism}} is the <b>Crest</b> Magic system, in which players may equip <b>Crests</b> to certain characters {{to allow them}} to cast different types of elemental magic. Players collect new <b>crests</b> and gain access to more powerful magic. The <b>crests</b> may also be positioned in a key item called Solomon's Key; positioning the <b>crests</b> correctly will unlock new spells for each <b>crest</b> for a certain region. Most of the crests' names are derived from demonology.|$|R
50|$|Modern Scottish clan {{members can}} show their {{allegiance}} to their clan and chief by wearing a Scottish <b>crest</b> badge. These heraldic badges usually display the clan chief's heraldic <b>crest</b> and motto {{surrounded by a}} strap and buckle. Such <b>crest</b> badges have been used since the Victorian era. The <b>crest</b> badge used by members of Clan MacIver contains the Latin motto nunquam obliviscar ("i will never forget") and the heraldic <b>crest</b> of a boar's head couped Or. Both the <b>crest</b> and motto {{are very similar to}} the <b>crest</b> and motto of the chief of Clan Campbell - the Duke of Argyll.
