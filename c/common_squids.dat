40|$|This study aim at {{providing}} an academic {{point of view}} on the possibilities of applying forward trading to fishery catch commodities in PIH Mina Ayu, Indramayu. This study was done based on secondary data of varieties of fishery commodities on the level of fish auctions in the Indramayu area and on the level of the Central Market in Caringin, Bandung. Gathered data were analyzed using the portofolio mean variance model (Markowitz model) to determine five commodity types with the largest rate of return and the optimal portofolio combination. Using the Winter’s Method time series analysis, forecasting of production, availability and price were conducted on the commodities determined by the previous analysis. The result of the time series analysis becomes the basic information for PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu to produce sales order for the agro-commodity auction in West Java. The five commodities with the highest rate of return were: Eastern little tuna (Euthynus spp), Indo-pacific king mackerell (Scomberomorus guttatus), Black promfet (Formio niger), <b>Common</b> <b>squids</b> (Loligo spp) and Indian mackerell (Restrelliger spp) with an optimal portofolio combination of 99. 4 % return and 25. 7 % risk. Forecasting of production and price suggest that PIH Mina Ayu can feasibly apply the forward trading method due to adequate availability of raw materials, which is needed in a relatively small amount in regards to the capacity of cold storage facility available in PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu. Forecasting of the price of commodities in the Central Market in Caringin Bandung suggest a significant margin of price, which shows a potential profit for PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu. The significant margin was {{due to the fact that}} by applying the forward trading method, PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu can bypass three links in the chain of distribution undergone by the existing spot trading method...|$|E

As sardine biomass decreased in the late stages ofthe cool regime, catch of the other four species increased immediately during the warm period of the 1990 s.

The interannual variations of sea surface temperature (SST) in winter represented by the indicator SST of 6 ℃ are consistent with the east-west zonal areas in the central East Sea which represented over 1 ℃ standard deviation of SST in February during 1990 - 2000.

5000|$|The TES is voltage-biased {{by driving}} a current source Ibias through a load {{resistor}} RL (see figure). The voltage is chosen {{to put the}} TES in its so-called [...] "self-biased region" [...] where the power dissipated in the device is constant with the applied voltage. When a photon is absorbed by the TES, this extra power is removed by negative electrothermal feedback: the TES resistance increases, causing a drop in TES current; the Joule power in turn drops, cooling the device back to its equilibrium state in the self-biased region. In a <b>common</b> <b>SQUID</b> readout system, the TES is operated in series with the input coil L which is inductively coupled to a SQUID series-array.

About two-thirds of the left fourth arm of this individual was lost and the surface of the arm's tip was completely covered with skin. This short arm was either caused by i) malformation or ii) accidental loss of the tip, followed by regeneration. Arm regeneration is common in cephalopods, and the left fourth arm of the present specimen was very similar to the regenerating arms of other cephalopods. Therefore, the arm of the present specimen may be regenerating.

In the first phase, sperm are produced in the testis and in the next phase sperm are transferred into the accessory gland, stored there in the form of spermatophore until copulation with the female. In the maturation stage, sperm are still produced, which means that copulating behavior is repeated by same male during this final sexual stage.
