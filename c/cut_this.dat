5|$|For the negotiations, {{the studio}} {{requested}} that the cast members accept a 45 percent cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last. The actors {{were willing to take}} a pay cut, but wanted a percentage of the back-end payments instead. At one point Shearer even offered a 70 percent pay cut in exchange for back-end percentages, but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end percentages. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take a pay cut of 30 percent, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay <b>cut.</b> <b>This</b> included animators, writers, the post-production crew and even Jean himself. The further use of digital animation also saves money, as the animation of the show becomes more efficient.|$|E
5|$|The docks {{maintenance}} {{facility was}} established {{on the land}} exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New <b>Cut,</b> <b>this</b> {{was known as the}} 'Overfall'. By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise a solution to this problem. In place of the Overfall he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide. The shallow sluices enabled adjustment of the dock water level according to weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 19 September, {{it was clear that}} the breakthrough attacks in the Battle of Sharon by the XXI Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin had been successful and the XX Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode was ordered to begin its attack, supported by an artillery barrage, against the well-defended Ottoman front line. The attacks continued until midday on 21 September, when a successful flanking attack by the XXI Corps, combined with the XX Corps assault, forced the Seventh and Eighth Armies to disengage. The Ottoman Seventh Army retreated from the Nablus area towards the River Jordan crossing at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge before the rearguard at Nablus was captured. The Desert Mounted Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel advanced through the gap provided by the infantry on 19 September to almost encircle the fighting in the Judean Hills, capturing Nazareth, Haifa, Afulah, Beisan, Jenin and Samakh, before advancing to Tiberias. During this time, Chaytor's Force commanded by Major General Edward Chaytor captured part of the retreating Ottoman and German column at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge to <b>cut</b> <b>this</b> line of retreat across the Jordan River. To the east of this river, as the Fourth Army began its retreat, Chaytor's Force advanced to capture Es Salt on 23 September. Amman was captured on 25 September during the Second Battle of Amman when a strong Fourth Army rearguard was defeated there on 25 September.|$|E

5|$|During the {{transition}} period between {{the signing of the}} Geneva Accords and the planned reunification elections, South Vietnam remained in chaos as the VNA tried to subdue the remaining autonomous factions of the Hòa Hảo, Cao Đài, and Bình Xuyên militias. In early 1955, during a battle with the Cao Đài forces of Trình Minh Thế, after a dispute over control of the That Son region, Ba Cụt was wounded in a disputed incident. Thế claimed to have tried initiating peace talks with Ba Cụt, but received no reply, so he decided to try to capture his rival. He sent some of his militant disciples to infiltrate Ba Cụt's forces and try to capture the Hòa Hảo leader. When they located Ba Cụt and surrounded him, he refused to surrender but instead tried to shoot his way out. Ba Cụt was severely wounded by a bullet that penetrated his chest. It seemed that he would die, but a French Air Force helicopter flew in and airlifted him to a colonial hospital. He recovered but in the interim the fighting stopped. Another account claims the two military leaders had been on good terms and exchanging diplomatic missions, but that the skirmish was caused by one of Ba Cụt's aides addressing the envoy in an abrasive and rude manner, and that the injuries were minor. Yet another account holds that the reaction by Thế's envoy was premeditated and that the claim the firing was in response to rudeness was merely a cover for an assassination attempt. According to this theory, Thế, whose units were then being integrated into Diệm's VNA, had given orders to target Ba <b>Cụt.</b> <b>This</b> was allegedly done on the orders of CIA agent Edward Lansdale, who was trying to help secure Diệm in power at the time. Lansdale has been accused of failing in an earlier attempt to bribe Ba Cụt to cease his activities.|$|E

25|$|Another {{modification}} of the round Ideal Cut that maintains the basic proportions of its angles is the Passion <b>Cut.</b> <b>This</b> cut's design can be considered {{the opposite of the}} Hearts and Arrows, as it eliminates the arrows in order to capture a different light return {{from the center of the}} diamond. The cut splits the eight pavilion mains and increases the specifically-placed total facets from 57 to 81. The cut was designed to enhance brilliance and mask inclusions.|$|E
25|$|The second pincer, codenamed Operation Arctic Fox (Unternehmen Polarfuchs), {{was to be}} {{launched}} south of this. The goal of the operation was to take Salla, which had been conceded to the Soviet Union after the Winter War, and then to proceed eastward along the railway to capture Kandalaksha. This way the vital Murmansk Railway line which connected Murmansk with Central Russia would be <b>cut.</b> <b>This</b> operation would involve the German XXXVI Corps under command of Hans Feige and the Finnish III Corps commanded by Hjalmar Siilasvuo.|$|E

25|$|Weapons and logistics. The Samorian army {{did manage}} to acquire {{a large number of}} repeating rifles. Replacement and {{resupply}} however including ammunition, was a continuing problem. Freetown, under British rule in Sierra Leone, was an important source of supply. The French tried incessantly to <b>cut</b> <b>this</b> pipeline, and finally did in collaboration with the British. An attempt was made to manufacture guns indigenously, but quality was poor, although the African gunsmiths did succeed in rendering a workable breech mechanism, and in various repairs. Ammunition was also manufactured, and was so precious that after each battle, empty cartridge cases and even bullets were collected.|$|E
25|$|Since the mid-20th century wild {{blueberries}} {{have been}} cultivated on the Isaac Wile Hill and Balsam Fir Christmas trees have been grown {{in various parts}} of the community. After the first three autumn frosts which set the needles, the trees are traditionally cut in November. Research is currently being done in Truro, Nova Scotia to develop a tree which will not drop its needles after being <b>cut.</b> <b>This</b> is key to an industry which exports 80 percent of its product to the USA—a market that is steadily become interested in artificial trees that don't drop needles.|$|E
25|$|The process uses a {{milling cutter}} with a {{cross-section}} that is slightly smaller than the final cross-section of the cut; {{it has the same}} diameter as the worm. The cutter is then angled to the gashing angle. The gashing angle is calculated from the lead and pitch diameter of the worm; often tables are available with the gashing angles for common diameters and leads. The cutter is centered over the blank and then plunged into it to the proper depth. The cutter is finally withdrawn and the blank indexed to the next tooth space and <b>cut.</b> <b>This</b> is repeated until all of the tooth spaces have been cut.|$|E

25|$|Oxy-acetylene can cut only low- to medium-carbon steels and wrought iron. High-carbon steels are {{difficult}} to cut because the melting point of the slag {{is closer to the}} melting point of the parent metal, so that the slag from the cutting action does not eject as sparks but rather mixes with the clean melt near the <b>cut.</b> <b>This</b> keeps the oxygen from reaching the clean metal and burning it. In the case of cast iron, graphite between the grains and the shape of the grains themselves interfere with the cutting action of the torch. Stainless steels cannot be cut either because the material does not burn readily.|$|E
25|$|Warren {{was able}} to take a {{position}} near the junction of the Quaker Road and the Boydton Plank Road. Griffin's division and Brigadier General Samuel Crawford's division taking up positions along the Boydton Plank Road, the Union movements on March 29 and Chamberlain's success in taking the Lewis Farm position enabled the Union Army to <b>cut</b> <b>this</b> important communication and supply road and to set up to attack the White Oak Road Line. Having to deal with muddy roads over a longer route, Sheridan's cavalry divisions reached Dinwiddie Court House at about 5:00p.m. on March 29, 1865. Sheridan put troops of Devin's and Crook's divisions into position to guard the Vaughan Road, Flat Foot Road, Boydton Plank Road and Adams Road.|$|E

25|$|Woods {{returned}} {{ahead of}} schedule at the 2014 Quicken Loans National. However he struggled with every aspect of his game, missing the halfway cut. His next appearance came at the third major of the year – the Open Championship. This took place at Hoylake – location of his 2006 victory. Despite a strong start, Woods faded over the weekend to eventually finish 69th. Woods' back pain was clear to see at the 2014 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, where he withdrew from the tournament. Against all expectations, Woods made an unexpected appearance just one week later at the final major of the year, competing at the PGA Championship. Woods though would miss the <b>cut.</b> <b>This</b> would {{mark the end of}} the season for Woods. During the off-season, Woods split with swing coach Sean Foley.|$|E
25|$|When {{dragged through}} a field the coulter cuts {{down into the}} soil and the share cuts {{horizontally}} from the previous furrow to the vertical <b>cut.</b> <b>This</b> releases a rectangular strip of sod that is then lifted by the share and carried by the mouldboard up and over, so that the strip of sod (slice of the topsoil) that is being cut lifts and rolls over as the plough moves forward, dropping {{back to the ground}} upside down into the furrow and onto the turned soil from the previous run down the field. Each gap in the ground where the soil has been lifted and moved across (usually to the right) is called a furrow. The sod that has been lifted from it rests at about a 45 degree angle in the next-door furrow and lies up the back of the sod from the previous run.|$|E
25|$|After {{losing the}} toss, Australia were sent into field. Their bowling attack again {{struggled}} to be effective, with Sachin Tendulkar scoring his 40th Test century (10th against Australia) and VVS Laxman compiling a slow 64. The only highlight for the Australian was Krejza's 8/215 from 43.5 overs, as India amassed 445. The off-spinners figures {{was the second}} best by an Australian on debut in Test history. Matthew Hayden and Simon Katich started quickly for Australia, reaching 32 in the seventh over, before Hayden was run-out. Ponting played freely, scoring 11 runs from the final three balls of an Ishant Sharma over. However in the following over he was clean bowled for 24 (41 balls) by a Harbhajan Singh delivery that spun and left him cramped for room while trying to <b>cut.</b> <b>This</b> was the tenth occasion he had been dismissed by Harbhajan in Tests.|$|E
