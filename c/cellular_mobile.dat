40|$|As an {{efficient}} capacity enhancement technique, smart an-tenna {{has been introduced}} into wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>cellular</b> systems. Since the traffic models for a wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>cellular</b> system using smart antennas closely relate to users’ space locations and the parameters of smart antennas, the con-ventional traffic models for a wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>cellular</b> sys-tem using omnidirectional antennas are not suitable for the systems using smart antennas. In this paper, we propose and analyze two novel traffic models for two wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>cellular</b> systems using smart antennas, which are switched-beam and adaptive beamforming systems, respectively. The handoff rates of a wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>cellular</b> system us-ing smart antennas are obtained and verified by simulations. Based on the obtained handoff rates, the performances of om-nidirectional antenna systems, switched-beam systems, and adaptive beamforming systems are compared {{in terms of the}} blocking probabilities of originating calls and handoff calls...|$|R

Call {{admission}} control in <b>mobile</b> <b>cellular</b> networks {{has become a}} high priority in network design research due to {{the rapid growth of}} popularity of wireless networks. Dozens of various call admission policies have been proposed for <b>mobile</b> <b>cellular</b> networks. This paper proposes a new classification of user based call admission policies in <b>mobile</b> <b>cellular</b> networks. The proposed classification not only provides a coherent framework for comparative studies of existing approaches, but also helps future researches and developments of new call admission policies...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cellular</b> <b>Mobile</b> Networks: In <b>cellular</b> <b>mobile</b> {{communication}} (GSM & LTE Systems, for instance), {{frequency spectrum}} is a precious resource which {{is divided into}} non-overlapping spectrum bands which are assigned to different cells (In cellular communications, a cell refers to the hexagonal/circular area around the base station antenna). However, after certain geographical distance, the frequency bands are re-used, i.e. the same spectrum bands are reassigned to other distant cells. The co-channel interference arises in the <b>cellular</b> <b>mobile</b> networks owing to this phenomenon of frequency reuse. Thus, besides the intended signal from within the cell, signals at the same frequencies (co-channel signals) arrive at the receiver from the undesired transmitters located (far away) in some other cells and lead to deterioration in receiver performance.|$|E
