He rushes here for a meal every chance he can get, for just please tell me what satisfaction is that for a well-educated young fellow to feed all alone in his cabin--like a wild beast? That's what Falk expects his engineers to put up with for fifteen dollars extra. And the rows on board every time a little smell of cooking gets about the deck! You wouldn't believe! The other day da Costa got the cook to fry a steak for him--a turtle steak it was too, not beef at all--and the fat caught or something. Young da Costa himself was telling me of it here in this room.

It was virtually identical to the Class 19 apart from the wheelbase of the front bogie which had been increased from 6 ft to 6 ft to improve the clearance between the cylinders and the bogie wheels, since the bogie wheels of predecessors Classes 19 and 19A fouled the <b>cylinder</b> <b>covers</b> on sharp curves.

50|$|Convinced {{that this}} was a great advance, Watt entered into {{partnerships}} to provide venture capital while he worked on the design. Not content with this single improvement, Watt worked tirelessly on a series of other improvements to practically every part of the engine. Watt further improved the system by adding a small vacuum pump to pull the steam out of the cylinder into the condenser, further improving cycle times. A more radical change from the Newcomen design was closing {{off the top of the}} cylinder and introducing low-pressure steam above the piston. Now the power was not due to the difference of atmospheric pressure and the vacuum, but the pressure of the steam and the vacuum, a somewhat higher value. On the upward return stroke, the steam on top was transferred through a pipe to the underside of the piston ready to be condensed for the downward stroke. Sealing of the piston on a Newcomen engine had been achieved by maintaining a small quantity of water on its upper side. This was no longer possible in Watt's engine due to the presence of the steam. Watt spent considerable effort to find a seal that worked, eventually obtained by using a mixture of tallow and oil. The piston rod also passed through a gland on the top <b>cylinder</b> <b>cover</b> sealed in a similar way.|$|E
50|$|Within the spherical joint, {{the main}} tube is led through {{a kind of}} guide tube, which is capable of turning, in a {{vertical}} plane, upon side trunnions; These trunnions being supported by bearings which work in vertical guides, and are capable of being raised or lowered by the arrangement shown in Fig. 2. This arrangement is as follows: From each bearing a chain is led, over a guide pulley situated {{at the top of}} the guide belonging to that bearing, to an arm fixed on a rocking-shaft placed close to the floor of the vessel. On this rocking-shaft there is also fixed another arm, and from this a chain proceeds aft to the piston rod of a horizontal steam cylinder, placed as shown in Fig. 2. This cylinder is provided with a slide valve, by which the steam can be admitted to or released from the forward end of the cylinder at pleasure; and, when the steam is so admitted, it drives back the piston, and, by means of the arrangement of chains and rocking-shaft already described, raised the guide tube, through which the main tube passes, and thus depresses that end of the latter which carries the torpedo. The extent to which the piston in the steam cylinder is driven back, and, consequently, the extent to which the guide tube is raised, is regulated by means of a screw which passes through the back <b>cylinder</b> <b>cover,</b> this screw, which is furnished with a handwheel and check-nut, forming a stop against which the piston rests when driven back by the steam.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the recent}} {{development}} of internal combustion engine, considerable {{increase in speed}} and power has been accomplished. This achievement, however, brought up various problems due to the excessive temperature of engine parts, which becomes a crucial factor in engine durability.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Cylinder</b> <b>cover</b> is an {{important}} component of the engine. It is damaged by low cycle thermal fatigue, high cycle thermal fatigue and creep in operation. Thus, the life and reliability of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>cover</b> are important criteria for engines. The temperature field and stress field of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>cover</b> are computed by the sequentially coupled analysis method: the elastic strain, plastic strain and creep strain of the dangerous point on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>cover</b> are analyzed in ten startup-working-shut down cycles; and it is proved in theory that low cycle thermal fatigue is the primary factor affecting the service life of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>cover</b> and the startup time of the engine is an appropriate parameter to estimate the life of thecylinder cover. The creep has little influence on the stress amplitude, and makes the mean stress increased. The relaxation is coexisting with creep in high temperature; it reduces the increase speed of mean stress. After finite cycles, the mean stress tends to constant gradually. Therefore, the creep-fatigue interaction can equal to thermo-mechanical fatigue whose stress amplitude and mean stress are constant. At last, the mean service life of cylinder is predicted...|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{decisions}} made by the Marine Accidents Inquiry Agency during the period from 1950 to 1964, investigaion was carried out on the broken parts of engine and their causes. 1. In diesel engines, principal broken parts were propeller shaft, crank arm, crank pin bolt and main bearing. The crack or breakage of crank arm was caused mostly by the deviation of center line of main bearings. The breakage of crank pin bolts was due mostly to excessive or unbalanced tightening. 2. In hot balb engines, nearly one half of damaged engines were due to the breakage of crank arm. When start engine, neglect about exhaust remaining oil in cylinder caused the engine to rapid rotation, and so crank case, piston, cylinder or <b>cylinder</b> <b>cover</b> to damage. 1. 漁船機関損傷の部位とその原因を,デイーゼル機関. 焼玉機関別に海難審判庁の裁決より考察した. 2. 主軸受中心線偏移によるクランク アームのき裂又は折損が最も多く,殊に焼玉機関に於て著しく,早期の開放点検整備が強く要望される. 3. デイーゼル機関に於ては,更に主軸受の焼損及びクランク ピン. ボルトの折損が多く,之等は他の部分の損傷に直接影響のある所で,潤滑油系に対する充分な注意と,ボルト締め付けに際しての細心の留意が肝要である. 4. 焼玉機関の始動時の急回転による損傷が各部に見出され,特に始動失敗の折の慎重な処置が望まれる. 機関損傷の殆どが,極めて基本的な事項の不注意,不処置に起因し,取扱者の充分な点検整備の実行が遂行されるならば,著しく軽減される海難である...|$|E

40|$|We take an {{opportunity}} to present this report on “THERMAL BARRIER COATINGS ON IC-ENGINES: REVIEW” and put before readers some useful information regarding this paper. In baseline engine, the liner undergoes a severe wear at high temperatures of combustion which results in seizure of the liner. Due to heat losses through the cylinder walls, the thermal efficiency of the engine decreases. Reduction of emissions from diesel engine is becoming increasingly important, because of promulgation of stringent emissions legislation. To increase wear resistance, thermal efficiency, and minimize pollutants in the exhaust of the engine, a thermal barrier and wear resistant coating is applied to inner walls of the cylinder which replaces conventional liner. Thermal barrier Coating (TBC), a new technique used at present scenario. TBC is {{a thin layer of}} ceramic coating applied to combustion chamber components, mainly for piston crown, valves, <b>cylinder</b> <b>cover</b> and cylinder walls. By using this technique, the present problems could be solved to some extent. Thermal barrier coatings becoming increasingly important in providing thermal insulation for heat engine components.
