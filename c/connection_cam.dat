30|$|In the brain, neurons {{recognize}} {{each other}} and form stable synaptic <b>connections</b> through <b>CAMs.</b> CAMs are proteins locate on the cell surface that serve as “glue” for adhering pre- and post-synaptic terminals together. These proteins are responsible for mechanical stabilization of and organization of synaptic contacts. Typically, they contain three domains: an intracellular domain that interacts with the intracellular scaffold protein, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain that interacts with other CAMs via either trans- or cis-interactions. Most CAMs (e.g., neurexins and neuroligins, SynCAMs, and β 1 integrin) localize {{at the center of}} the synapse (Mortillo et al., 2012); whereas others (e.g., the N-cadherin/β-catenin system) are found at the outer rims of pre-synaptic active zones and post-synaptic regions (Uchida et al., 1996).|$|R

This paper examined the overlap between participation in allopathic breast cancer early detection activities and CAM use. Methods. A systematic review examined the association between breast screening behaviors and CAM use. Searches were conducted on the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and NCCAM databases and gray literature between 1990 and 2011. STROBE criteria were used to assess study quality. Results. Nine studies met the search criteria. Four focused on CAM use in women at high breast cancer risk and five on average risk women. CAM use in women ranged from 22 % to 82 % and was high regardless of breast cancer risk. Correlations between CAM use and breast cancer early detection were not strong or consistent but significant relationships that did emerge were positive. Conclusions. Populations surveyed, and measures used to assess CAM, breast cancer screening, and correlates, varied widely. Many women who obtained allopathic screening also sought out CAM.

50|$|The FDR and the CVR {{were found}} {{and sent to}} Washington to be read out by the NTSB in United States. They were found in good condition; however, the team {{experienced}} difficulty reading the Cockpit Area Microphone (CAM). The team {{also found that the}} channel from the CAM was masked by hum and noise dominating the signal. There were some voices heard on the CAM track; {{there were a number of}} step changes in background noise level and character that may have been consistent with an intermittent electrical <b>connection</b> in the <b>CAM</b> wiring circuit. As a result, the team was not able to conclude that the CAM was providing input to the CVR throughout the entire 30 minutes. Such a poor quality in CVR record failure makes it impossible to find out whether the flight crews made proper take-off configuration procedures including checklist execution. However several crew words, cockpit switch activations, engine noise, and cabin chime sounds heard on the CAM channel of the CVR were typically at a volume level much lower than the standard take off warning horn of the Boeing 737-200. The typical sound of the take-off configuration warning was not heard in the CVR CAM channel. The stick-shaker warning (typically as loud as or louder than the takeoff warning horn) was also not heard on the CVR CAM channel.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} locally {{stationary}} processes contains theory and methods about {{a class of}} processes that describe random phenomena whose fluctuations occur both in time and space. We consider three aspects of locally stationary processes {{that have not been}} explore in the already vast literature on these nonstationary processes. We begin by studying the asymptotic efficiency of simple hypotheses tests via large deviation principles. We establish the analogues of classic results such as Stein's lemma, Chernoff bound and the more general Hoeffding bound. These results are based on a large deviation principle for the log-likelihood ratio test statistic between two locally stationary Gaussian processes which is obtained and presented in the first chapter. In the second chapter we consider the Bayesian estimation of two parameters of a locally stationary process: trend and time-varying spectral density functions, respectively. Under smoothness conditions on the latter function, we obtain the asymptotic normality and efficiency, with respect to a broad class of loss functions, of Bayesian estimators. In passing we also show the asymptotic equivalence between Bayesian estimators and the maximum likelihood estimate. Our concluding fourth chapter explores the time-varying spectral density estimation problem {{from the point of view}} of Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments. We establish that the estimation of a time-varying spectral density function can be asymptotically construed as a white noise problem with drift. This result is based on Le <b>Cam's</b> <b>connection</b> theorem. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Emphasis on {{humanistic}} {{values and}} personal experience in nursing {{has led to}} the popularisation of holistic nursing approach to nursing care. Although holistic nursing care as a construct is widely discussed in nursing literature. Contextual clinical application has been difficult, in the absence of guiding conceptual framework and guidelines that directs nursing practice. In this study, the purpose was to examine the meaning of holistic nursing care and develop a framework for holistic nursing care, which can be utilised in nurse education settings and in clinical nursing practice in the context of paediatric nursing in academic hospitals. To achieve this aim, qualitative methodological perspectives were employed based on careful selection of the population, sampling, collection and analysis of data and trustworthiness. To enable the accomplishment of the purpose, the study objectives were formulated into two phases. Phase one objective enabled the identification of the characteristics of the concept holistic nursing care through concept analysis and by obtaining the emic viewpoints of the paediatric nurses working in academic hospitals. A philosophical inquiry was employed using Rodgers’ evolutionary method of concept analysis. To elucidate the concept holistic nursing care a qualitative, interpretive, explorative and contextual research design was employed. Holistic nursing care was interpreted as whole care fostering person-centred and family-centred care. The results confirm the current discourse in nursing literature with respect to “person-centred”, “family-centred care” as opposed to “patient-centred care”. The emphasis is on recognition of the need to transform current linguistic ontology from “patient care” towards the provision of “whole-person” care. Participants’ interpreted v holistic nursing care as whole care directed towards a unique and complex human being. The dynamic, which is the driving force for the achievement of whole care, is established through enabling goal-directed nurse-family relationships. One of the key finding is the prominence of spirituality and the inclusion of spirituality in different aspects of child nursing. The dependency of individual nurses to spiritual sources for personal strength and support was recognised and acknowledged. Knowledge of disease, person and “know how” are necessary for the acomplishment of ethically, safe person-centred whole care. Attributes of holistic nursing care yielded two dimensions; whole person and mind-body-spirit dimension. The decriptors of whole person include physical, mental, emotional, spirit and spitual being. Spirituality is the predominant antecedent. Holistic nursing care is initiated by the recognition of the individual, in need of health care, as a spiritual being with mind-body-spirit dimension. Spirituaity is an ever-present force pervading all human experience. Complimentary alternative medicine (CAM) was identified as a surrogate term. The <b>connection</b> of <b>CAM</b> with holistic nursing care is the focus of therapetic interventions that are directed to the mind-body-spirit domain. The emphasis is on health rather than curing. Preventative therapeutic interventions are desingned {{to meet the needs of}} the whole-person. Caution is advocated in the use of CAM therapies in child nursing, as CAM efficacy has not been sufficiently investigated in child health care. The conceptual framework is presented as unique contribution to nursing. The framework may be introduced at undergraduate teaching of child and family nursing care and in specialists’ paediatric nurse education. Recognition of the human being as a whole person with mind-body-spirit dimension is not restricted to a child or family care. Therefore, the vi framework is presented as a fundamental structure that can be used generally to all intervention activities in relation to human–human interactions. Its use may be broadened to any therapeutic environments. The framework may be tested in adult nursing in variety of settings in health care. There is a potential to expand and transfer certain elements of the framework to other discipline beyond nursing: in doctor-patient relationships, manager-employee relationships, and person-to-person interactions. Perhaps the South African Nursing Council, as the regulating body responsible for developing the educational framework of nursing education in this country may adopt this framework in line with their philosophy of nursing to articulate with their intended goal of providing holistic nursing care for the people of this nation. Adoption of the framework may require a shift from the current “patient-centred care” towards “person-centred care”...|$|R
