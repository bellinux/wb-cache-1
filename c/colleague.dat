5|$|Gray was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. A {{large percentage of the}} original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected Gray and his friend, <b>colleague,</b> and fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one of the areas where Gray and his friend and <b>colleague,</b> Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz {{was a member of the}} Lazzaroni group. Agassiz had come to lecture at the Lowell Institute in 1846 and got hired by Harvard in 1847. Gray befriended him the way he had been befriended during his trip to Europe.|$|E

5000|$|About 80 {{species of}} Morchella were {{described}} until {{the turn of}} the century (http://www.indexfungorum.org/), a number of which were later shown to be illegitimate or synonyms. As molecular tools became widely available in the new millennium, a revived interest in the genus commenced and several new species were proposed. In 2008 Kuo described Morchella tomentosa from burned coniferous forests in western North America. In 2010 Işiloğlu and <b>colleagues</b> described Morchella anatolica, a basal species from Turkey later shown to be sister to Morchella rufobrunnea. A study by Clowez described over 20 new species in 2012. In the same year, another study by Kuo and <b>colleagues</b> described 19 species from North America, while molecular phylogenetics currently suggest there are over 60 species of Morchella worldwide. An extensive taxonomical and nomenclatural revision of the genus provided by Richard and <b>colleagues</b> in 2014, applied names to 30 of the genealogical lineages recognized so far and clarified several synonymities. Also in 2014, Elliott and <b>colleagues</b> described Morchella australiana from sclerophyll forests in Australia, while Clowez and <b>colleagues</b> described Morchella fluvialis from riparian forests in Spain. In 2015, Loizides and <b>colleagues</b> clarified the taxonomy of Morchella tridentina, a cosmopolitan species described under many names, and recombined Morchella kakiicolor as a distinct species. [...] Later in the same year, Clowez and <b>colleagues</b> described Morchella palazonii from Spain, while Voitk and <b>colleagues</b> described Morchella laurentiana from Canada and Morchella eohespera, a cosmopolitan species present in several continents. In an extensive phylogenetic and morphological study from Cyprus in 2016, Loizides and <b>colleagues</b> added two more Mediterranean species, Morchella arbutiphila and Morchella disparilis, and resurrected Morchella dunensis as an autonomous species. In the same year, Taşkın and <b>colleagues</b> described four of the previously unnamed phylospecies from Turkey: Morchella conifericola, Morchella feekensis, Morchella magnispora and Morchella mediteterraneensis.|$|R
