60|$|Brings out the {{darkness}} of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk. Skinfood. One of the old queen's sons, duke of Albany was it? had only one skin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to make it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your? Peau d'Espagne. That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps have. Pure <b>curd</b> <b>soap.</b> Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.|$|E
50|$|Hard soap or <b>curd</b> <b>soap</b> {{is a kind}} of soap; {{examples}} are Aleppo soap, Castile soap, and Marseille soap or savon de Marseille. During the preparation of the soap, common salt (sodium chloride) is added to the liquid soap mass. This leads to the soap mass separating from glycerin, resulting in a harder soap. It can also be made using sodium hydroxide.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the family {{business}} goes back to Michael Mäurer and his stepson Andreas August Wirtz, who established a soapworks in 1845 in Stolberg. Initially, only soft <b>soaps,</b> <b>curd</b> <b>soaps</b> and fine soaps were sold {{in a grocery store}} for the local market. Over time, the products were established in the Rhineland and later also in neighboring countries (mainly France and Benelux). In 1884 the production of washing powder began and then {{around the turn of the}} century the company's first trademarks were registered. Mäurer & Wirtz now produces detergents, soap products, perfumes and cosmetics. Since 1992, products under the Betty Barclay brand have also been produced under license. In 2007, the company took over the brands 4711, Tosca, Sir Irisch Moos and Extase from Procter & Gamble, and in 2011 the Baldessarini fragrance line, and Windsor were acquired.|$|R

50|$|With an {{increasing}} number of homes incorporating indoor plumbing, Drackett saw a need for a good chemical drain opener. Clogs are largely caused by grease and hair going down the drain. Lye turns grease into soap, a process known as saponification, but in hard water, soap curdles, adding to the problem. One approach was to use concentrated nitric acid, or sulfuric acid. These attack both hair and <b>soap</b> <b>curd,</b> and generate heat as well, but they also attack metal pipes. Drackett used a mixture of dry lye crystals and aluminum pellets, producing much heat. When he used machined shards of aluminum instead of smooth aluminum beads, the sharp aluminum in churning mix physically would cut through most ordinary clogs, yet the aluminum was soft enough to not cut into metal pipes.|$|R
