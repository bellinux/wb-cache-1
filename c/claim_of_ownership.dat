The practice, which has become known as [...] "data pimping", came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interested parties who believe that the interception of data is illegal under UK law (RIPA). At a more fundamental level, many have argued that the ISPs and Phorm have no right to sell a commodity (a user's data) to which they have no <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Controversy {{surrounded}} the Whydah long before Clifford {{brought up the}} first artifacts. In 1982 the state of Massachusetts filed a <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> on the Whydah treasure. After a long battle through a succession of courts, sole ownership of the Whydah was granted to Clifford in 1988. This {{was only the beginning}} of the troubles for the Whydah artifacts. New troubles arose when Silver Screen Entertainment directors, Tom Bernstein and Roland Betts proposed the concept for developing a large-scale museum complex devoted to the Whydah. The museum was offered to the city of Boston, where controversy surrounding the Whydah's history as a slave ship had already made waves with local government officials. The proposal for the museum included plans for a full-scale replica of the ship, a holographic image of Sam Bellamy, a conservation viewing area, interpretation of artifacts, a play acting out pirate hangings, and an exploration of the Whydah's history as a slave ship. Concern was raised that a [...] "theme park" [...] was being built around the concept of a slave ship. State representative Byron Rushing compared this concept to building a [...] "theme park based on a concentration camp." [...] Ultimately developers Bernstein and Betts decided that the political atmosphere of Boston was to unsteady on the issue. Having ended negotiations with Boston, Bernstein and Betts looked to Tampa as a possible location for the complex.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhen {{commercial}} flights between Rapa Nui and Tahiti {{began in}} 1968, after nearly 70 years of colonial confinement, a new migratory process began from Rapa Nui to Tahiti.

For the Rapanui people the history of the Pamatai lands evokes a series of memories and forgetfulness, the genealogical ties as well a constant search for the linkage with Tahiti—a “memory of diaspora”.
