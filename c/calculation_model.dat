40|$|Polar Sea ice-ocean {{parameter}} <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> {{provide better}} parameterization schemes {{for the global}} climate system models. But Polar Sea ice-ocean parameter <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> are broad and derived from many diverse scientific disciplines. Hence, knowledge of numerous scientific disciplines is required to successfully develop models that can provide better parameterization schemes for the global climate system models. Additional difficulties include inconsistent data structures, formats, and metadata required by models as well as limitations on computing, storage, and connectivity. Traditional standalone and closed network systems cannot fully support sharing and integrating interdisciplinary models from variant sources. To address this need, we have identified methods for sharing Polar Sea ice-ocean parameter <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) techniques and open geospatial standards. The service-oriented model sharing service is accessible using any tools or systems compliant with open geospatial standards, {{making it possible to}} utilize vast scientific resources available {{from around the world to}} solve highly sophisticated application problems. The methods also allow model services to be empowered by diverse computational devices and technologies. Based on the generic and abstract operations and data structures required for Web Processing Service (WPS) standards, we developed an interactive interface for model sharing to help reduce interoperability problems for model use. Polar Sea ice-ocean parameter <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> are shared on model services, where the computational processes provided by models can be accessed through tools and systems compliant with WPS. We developed a platform to help modelers publish individual models in a simplified and efficient way. In the end, we developed a user-friendly Web site to demonstrate our approach. 2013 IEEE...|$|R
