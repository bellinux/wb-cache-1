40|$|BACKGROUND: Pancreatic islet {{endocrine}} cell-supporting architectures, including islet encapsulating basement membranes (BMs), {{extracellular matrix}} (ECM), and possible <b>cell</b> <b>clusters,</b> are unclear. PROCEDURES: The architectures around islet <b>cell</b> <b>clusters,</b> including BMs, ECM, and pancreatic acinar-like <b>cell</b> <b>clusters,</b> were {{studied in the}} non-diabetic state and in the inflamed milieu of fulminant type 1 diabetes in humans. RESULT: Immunohistochemical and electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that human islet <b>cell</b> <b>clusters</b> and acinar-like <b>cell</b> <b>clusters</b> adhere directly to each other with desmosomal structures and coated-pit-like structures between the two <b>cell</b> <b>clusters.</b> The two cell-clusters are encapsulated by a continuous capsule composed of common BMs/ECM. The acinar-like <b>cell</b> <b>clusters</b> have vesicles containing regenerating (REG) Iα protein. The vesicles containing REG Iα protein are directly secreted to islet cells. In the inflamed milieu of fulminant type 1 diabetes, the acinar-like <b>cell</b> <b>clusters</b> over-expressed REG Iα protein. Islet endocrine cells, including beta-cells and non-beta cells, which were packed with the acinar-like <b>cell</b> <b>clusters,</b> show self-replication with a markedly increased number of Ki 67 -positive cells. CONCLUSION: The acinar-like <b>cell</b> <b>clusters</b> touching islet endocrine cells are distinct, because the <b>cell</b> <b>clusters</b> are packed with pancreatic islet clusters and surrounded by common BMs/ECM. Furthermore, the acinar-like <b>cell</b> <b>clusters</b> express REG Iα protein and secrete directly to neighboring islet endocrine cells in the non-diabetic state, and the <b>cell</b> <b>clusters</b> over-express REG Iα in the inflamed milieu of fulminant type 1 diabetes with marked self-replication of islet cells...|$|R

Methods: The expression of tumor-associated antigen MUC- 1 on three pancreatic cancer <b>cell</b> <b>clusters</b> and animal xenografts was detected by indirect immmunostaining.

In vivo, an antiproliferative effect for tumors was tested at two days post-subcutaneous cell inoculation.

Results: MUC- 1 is strongly expressed on CFPAC- 1, PANC- 1 and moderate expression was found CAPAN- 1 <b>cell</b> <b>clusters</b> and tumor xenografts. The AICs can target and kill cancer <b>cell</b> <b>clusters</b> (100 mm) in vitro. Some 73 – 81 % of cells were TUNEL positive <b>cells</b> in the <b>clusters</b> after incubation with AIC. At two days post- cell inoculation in mice, a single local injection of 74 and 148 MBq/kg of AIC causes complete inhibition of tumor growth. Systemic injections of 111, 222 and 333 MBq/kg of AIC cause significant tumor growth delay after 16 weeks, compared with the nonspecific control providing 333 MBq/kg after 16 weeks.

40|$|AbstractIn {{zebrafish}} embryos, {{the nascent}} embryonic shield first {{appears as a}} thickening in the germ ring of the mid-epiboly blastoderm. This site defines the dorsal side of the developing embryo. In this paper, we report that the site of embryonic axis formation is marked earlier at the late-blastula stage {{by the appearance of}} a cluster of cells with unique endocytic activities. This cluster of cells is composed of enveloping layer epithelial cells and one to two layers of underlying deep cells. Unlike other marginal blastomeres, cells in this cluster do not participate in involution as the blastoderm undergoes epiboly. These noninvoluting endocytic marginal (NEM) cells can be selectively labeled by applying membrane impermeant fluorescent probes to pre-epiboly and mid-epiboly embryos. During embryonic shield formation, deep cells in the NEM <b>cell</b> <b>cluster</b> rearrange and are displaced forward to {{the leading edge of the}} blastoderm. As deep NEM cells move into this location, they become a group of cells known as “forerunner cells. ” Between 60 %- and 80 %-epiboly, the forerunner cells coalesce into a coherent <b>cell</b> <b>cluster</b> that forms a wedge-shaped cap at the leading edge of the blastoderm. During embryonic axis formation, deep cells migrate and converge toward the embryonic midline, which is defined by the center of the forerunner <b>cell</b> <b>cluster.</b> At approximately 90 % epiboly, the forerunner <b>cell</b> <b>cluster</b> becomes overlapped by the constricting germ ring. At tailbud stage, forerunner cells form the dorsal roof of Kupffer's vesicle, which is located ventral to the nascent chordoneural hinge.
