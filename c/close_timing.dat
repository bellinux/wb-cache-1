40|$|Abstract. The {{method of}} {{supplying}} fuel for an electronic-controlled {{fuel injection system}} is calculating the required fuel amounts under various operating conditions of engine and controlling the opening and <b>closing</b> <b>timing</b> of fuel injection. After fuel injection, the effects of condensation and atomization of injected fuel as well as fuel mixing for combustion are strongly dominated by the opening timing and duration of intake valves. This can further affect the emission composition and performance for an engine. As the emission regulation is getting more stringent and the requirement for minimizing specific fuel consumption is becoming more urgent, investigating the effect of <b>closing</b> <b>timing</b> of fuel injection {{has turned out to}} be a major issue. Therefore, this paper presents a study about a series of engine tests to investigate the effect of end of injection angle on the performance and emission formation for a gasoline engine.

50|$|Due to the <b>close</b> <b>timing</b> of 1st World Outgames and the 7th {{edition of}} the Gay Games, many {{individual}} and team participants were {{forced to choose between}} Gay Games Chicago and World Outgames Montreal, a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on 22 July 2006 was only 7 days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on 29 July 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike. Few teams were able to field complete squads for both events; In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament. On the other hand, certain sports that had {{never had a chance to}} be presented in Gay Games were presented in Montreal and participants were very satisfied with the opportunity to compete. There was some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise. For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew approximately 12,000 participants, Montreal 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games. Organizers later recognized that if only one option would have been presented, Montreal's goal of 24,000 participants could have become a reality.|$|E
40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) is a promising {{internal combustion engine}} concept. It holds promise of combining low emission levels with high efficiency. However, as ignition timing in HCCI operation lacks direct actuation and is highly sensitive to operating conditions and disturbances, robust closed-loop control is necessary. To facilitate control design and allow for porting of both models and the resulting controllers between different engines, physics-based mathematical models of HCCI are of interest. This paper presents work on a physical model of HCCI including cylinder wall temperature and evaluates predictive controllers based on linearizations of the model. The model was derived using first principles and formulated on a cycle-to-cycle basis. The resulting model was of second order with two inputs and two outputs. Measurement data including cylinder wall temperature measurements was used for calibration and validation of the model. Predictive control of the combustion phasing was then evaluated experimentally using ethanol as fuel.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of EIVC (early inlet valve closure) on emissions, fuel economy and {{exhaust gas temperature}} of a turbocharged, 4 cylinder common rail direct injection diesel engine has been investigated and compared with the {{influence of}} deactivating two cylinders. IVC (inlet valve <b>closing)</b> <b>timings</b> were set at up to 60  CA (crank angle) degrees earlier than the production setting of 37 ° ABDC for the engine. At the earliest timing, effective compression ratio was reduced from 15. 2 : 1 to 13. 7 : 1. The effects on emissions were significant only for EIVC settings at least 40  CA degrees earlier than the production setting, and were sensitive to engine load. At 2  bar BMEP (brake mean effective pressure) and fixed levels of NOx, soot emissions were reduced but CO (carbon monoxide) and HC (hydrocarbon) increased unless fuel rail pressure was reduced. With increasing load, soot reduction diminished and was negligible at 6  bar BMEP; CO and HC emissions deteriorated further. At all conditions, EIVC raised exhaust gas temperature by > 50  °C; the effect on fuel economy was negligible or a fuel economy penalty. Comparisons indicate cylinder deactivation is the more effective strategy for reducing engine-out emissions of HC and CO and raising exhaust gas temperature under light load operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Synaptic {{plasticity}} {{of different}} inputs converging onto CA 3 pyramidal neurons {{is central to}} theories of hippocampal function. The mossy fibre (MF) input to these neurons is thought to exhibit plasticity that is in nearly all aspects fundamentally different from plasticity in other brain regions: in particular, when induced by high frequency presynaptic stimulation, plasticity at these synapses is independent of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation and presynaptically expressed. Here, we show that different stimulation protocols that depend on the <b>close</b> <b>timing</b> of MF activity and postsynaptic spikes induce bidirectional plasticity in CA 3 neurons in 3 -week-old rats. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is observed when an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), evoked by MF stimulation, precedes a single postsynaptic action potential (AP) or a brief AP burst by 10 ms. Instead, timing-dependent long-term depression (LTD) requires the pairing of a single AP to an EPSP with a delay of 30 ms. The pairing of APs to synaptic activity is required for plasticity induction, since the application of unpaired APs or EPSPs did not alter synaptic strength. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that both timing-dependent LTP and LTD critically depend on the activation of NMDARs. Specifically blocking postsynaptic NMDARs prevents plasticity, demonstrating that NMDARs important to spike-timing-dependent plasticity in CA 3 neurons are required at postsynaptic sites. In summary, this study shows that the <b>close</b> <b>timing</b> of APs to MF excitatory synaptic input can alter synaptic efficacy in CA 3 neurons in a bidirectional manner...|$|E

Previous research has demonstrated an early sensitivity to timing in interactions (e. g. Murray & Trevarthen, 1985). In contrast, less is known about infants’ abilities to produce turns in a timely manner and existing findings are rather patchy. We conducted a longitudinal study of twelve mother-infant dyads in free-play interactions at the ages of 3, 4, 5, 9, 12 and 18 months. Based on existing work and the predictions made by the Interaction Engine Hypothesis (Levinson, 2006), we expected that infants would begin to develop the temporal properties of turn-taking early in infancy but that their timing of turns would slow down at 12 months, which is around the time when infants start to produce their first words. Findings were consistent with our predictions: Infants were relatively fast at timing their turn early in infancy but slowed down {{towards the end of the}} first year. Furthermore, the changes observed in infants’ turn-timing skills were not caused by changes in maternal timing, which remained stable across the 3 - 18 month period. However, the slowing down of turn-timing started somewhat earlier than predicted: at 9 months...|$|E

Electro-Hydraulic valve actuators are used to eliminate the camshaft of an existing Internal Combustion(IC) engine and to control the valve timing of intake and exhaust valves, valve duration independently. This paper presents a research activity like hydraulic valve actuator design, dynamic simulations, analysis and adaptive valve timing control of Camless Engine Valve Actuator. Electro-Hydraulic valve actuator’s main function is to provide fully variable open/close valve timing.

40|$|Controlled {{autoignition}} (CAI) combustion, {{also known}} as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), was achieved through the negative valve overlap approach by using small-lift camshafts. Three-dimensional multicycle engine simulations were carried out in order better to understand the effects of variable intake valve timings on the gas exchange process, mixing quality, CAI combustion, and pollutant formation in a four-stroke port fuel injection (PFI) gasoline engine. Full engine cycle simulation, including complete gas exchange and combustion processes, was carried out over several cycles {{in order to obtain}} the stable cycle for analysis. The combustion models {{used in the present study}} are a modified shell ignition model and a laminar and turbulent characteristic time model, which can take high residual gas fraction into account. After the validation of the model against experimental data, investigations of the effects of variable intake valve timing strategies on the CAI combustion process were carried out. These analyses show that the intake valve opening (WO) and intake valve <b>closing</b> (IVC) <b>timings</b> have a strong influence on the gas exchange and mixing processes in the cylinder, which in turn affect the engine performance and emissions. Symmetric IVO timing relative to exhaust valve <b>closing</b> (EVC) <b>timing</b> tends to produce a more stratified mixture, earlier ignition timing, and localized combustion, and hence higher NO, and lower unburned HC and CO emissions, whereas retarded WO leads to faster mixing, a more homogeneous mixture, and uniform temperature distribution...|$|R

40|$|Modern diesel {{compression}} {{engines are}} known for their increased durability, fuel economy and torque when compared with their spark ignition gasoline counterparts. These are some of the reasons why diesel engines are preferred in heavy duty applications such as trains and semi-trucks. During the Heavy Duty Federal Test Procedure transient drive cycle, or HDFTP, nearly 85 % of the total fuel burned is at speeds greater than 2000 revolutions per minute (RPM) for the studied engine. Therefore, it is desirable to increase the fuel economy at these loads and speeds. It is hypothesized that the use of late intake valve <b>close</b> <b>timing</b> (LIVC) modulation could give an increase in volumetric efficiency from flow momentum.

Moreover, the peak of premixed combustion heat release rate is reduced when the geometric compression ratio is increased to 15. 4, and linking with injection timing by delaying 6 °CA can further reduce NOx by 55. 3 % from the baseline. Finally, over 80 % NOx reduction can be achieved when the above schemes are combined with over 15 % EGR. The NOx and soot can be reduced simultaneously by using moderate Miller cycle combination with moderate EGR, and the results show a large reduction of NOx and moderate reduction of soot.
