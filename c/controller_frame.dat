In this paper, we introduce a method that synergistically combines an analytical pattern generator and a feedback <b>controller</b> <b>frame,</b> which are developed for the purpose of synthesizing dynamic quadrupedal trot-walking locomotion on flat and uneven surfaces. To begin with, the pattern generator analytically produces feasible and dynamically balanced joint motions in accordance with the desired trot-walking characteristics, with no empirical parameter tuning requirements. In concurrence with the pattern generation, a two-phased <b>controller</b> <b>frame</b> is constructed for closed-loop sensory feedback: (i) virtual admittance controller via force sensing, (ii) upper torso angular momentum regulation via gyro sensing. The former controller evaluates joint force errors and generates the corresponding joint displacement for a given set of virtual spring-damper couples. Together with the position constraints, these displacements are additionally fed-back to local servos for achieving compliant quadrupedal locomotion with which the position/force trade-off is addressed. The second controller, that is simultaneously used, evaluates the upper torso angular momentum rate change error using measured and reference orientation information. It then regulates the torso orientation in a dynamically consistent way as the rotational inertia is characterized. In order to validate the proposed methodology several experiments are conducted on both flat and uneven surfaces, using two robots with distinct properties; a ∼ 7 kg cat-sized electrically actuated quadruped (RoboCat- 1), and a ∼ 80 kg Alpine Ibex-sized hydraulically actuated quadruped (HyQ). As a result we demonstrate continuous, repetitive, compliant and dynamically balanced trot-walking cycles in real-robot experiments, adequately confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

40|$|Within power systems, {{high-power}} pulsewidth-modulated ac-dc converters {{are used}} in flexible ac transmission systems controllers and for interfacing renewable energy sources to the grid. These converters traditionally employed PI controllers designed in the synchronous dq-frame with decoupling of d and q axes. Recently, stationary -frame proportional-resonant (PR) controllers have been proposed. Though both types of control are suitable for the regulation of three-phase converters, the PR controller displays steady-state and dynamic behavior that differs significantly from that of decoupled dq-frame controllers. This paper derives a stationary <b>frame</b> <b>controller</b> that is the exact equivalent of the commonly used synchronous <b>frame</b> <b>controller</b> with L decoupling. The new stationary frame “PRX 2 ” controller consists of a proportional (P), a resonant (R), and two cross-coupling components. The PRX 2 controller offers identical transient and steady-state performance and has the same frequency response as the decoupled synchronous <b>frame</b> PI <b>controller.</b> Unlike other stationary <b>frame</b> <b>controllers</b> containing resonant components, the PRX 2 controller is unique because it contains a cross-coupling feedback component, which accounts for {{the behavior of the}} L decoupling branches present in synchronous <b>frame</b> <b>controllers.</b> It is shown that ignoring this decoupling component greatly increases the controller's sensitivity to frequency variation.

40|$|Abstract – Communications {{processors}} are SoCs {{that contain}} multiple processor cores, an on-chip network, memory <b>controllers,</b> <b>frame</b> managers, encryption and pattern matching engine, etc. In early design exploration of such SoCs, {{it is important}} to have workloads as close as the final real-world workloads that the SoC will be running. However at the same time, it is often difficult to run such realistic workloads on early performance models and simulators. Under such scenarios, it is extremely useful to be able to have simplified workloads that are similar to the realistic workloads. In our recent research, we have created a benchmark synthesis process, which consists of synthesizing a proxy workload that possesses approximately the same performance and power characteristics as the original workload. The synthesis comprises of two steps: (1) profiling the real-world proprietary workload to measure its inherent behavior characteristics, and (2) modeling the measured workload attributes into a synthetic benchmark program. The set of workload characteristics can be thought of as a signature that uniquely describes the workload’s inherent behavior, independent of the microarchitecture. The cloned code in fact has no functionality and cannot be reverse engineered to create the original code or algorithms. The cloned software can be freely released to hardware developers so that they can optimize the hardware they deliver to their clients to yield improved performance. This paper describes the benchmark synthesis process as well as the status of the research. An automated synthetic benchmark generation methodology is presented first as an approach to synthesize benchmarks for early performance studies from real-world applications. The process of constructing synthetic proxies that approximately resemble the original application is explained. Experiments with generating proxy workloads for the Freescale QorIQ Communications SoC P 4080 are presented...|$|R
40|$|Current {{regulation}} {{plays an}} important role inmodern power electronic ac conversion systems. The most direct strategy to regulate such currents is to use a simple closed loop proportionalintegral (PI) regulator, which has no theoretical stability limits as the proportional and integral gains are increased, since it is only a second order system. However, pulsewidth modulation (PWM) transport and controller sampling delays limit the gain values that can be achieved in practical systems. Taking these limitations into account, this paper presents an analytical method to determine the best possible gains that can be achieved for any class of practical linear ac current controller. The analysis shows that the maximum possible proportional gain is determined by the plant series inductance, the dc bus voltage and the transport and sampling delays, while the maximum possible integral gain is determined primarily by the transport and sampling delays. The work is applicable to stationary frame PI regulators, stationary <b>frame</b> <b>controllers</b> with back electromotive force compensation, stationary <b>frame</b> P+resonant (PR) <b>controllers,</b> and synchronous d-q <b>frame</b> <b>controllers,</b> since they all have identical proportional and integral gains that must be optimized for any particular application...|$|R
