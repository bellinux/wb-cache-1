25|$|Modern {{computers}} use {{a variety}} of techniques. One common method, especially on higher-end processors with floating point units, is to combine a polynomial or rational approximation (such as <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>approximation,</b> best uniform approximation, and Padé approximation, and typically for higher or variable precisions, Taylor and Laurent series) with range reduction and a table lookup—they first look up the closest angle in a small table, and then use the polynomial to compute the correction. Devices that lack hardware multipliers often use an algorithm called CORDIC (as well as related techniques), which uses only addition, subtraction, bitshift, and table lookup. These methods are commonly implemented in hardware floating-point units for performance reasons.|$|E

500|$|Theoretical work {{following}} the war included the commensurate line theory of Paul Richards. Commensurate lines are networks {{in which all}} the elements are the same length (or in some cases multiples of the unit length), although they may differ in other dimensions to give different characteristic impedances. Richards' transformation allows any lumped element design to be taken [...] "as is" [...] and transformed directly into a distributed element design using a very simple transform equation. [...] In 1955 K. Kuroda published the transformations known as Kuroda's identities. [...] These made Richard's work more usable in unbalanced and waveguide formats by eliminating the problematic series connected elements, but it was some time before Kuroda's Japanese work became widely known in the English speaking world. [...] Another theoretical development was the network synthesis filter approach of Wilhelm Cauer in which he used the <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>approximation</b> to determine element values. [...] Cauer's work was largely developed during World War II (Cauer was killed towards the end of it), but could not be widely published until hostilities ended. [...] While Cauer's work concerns lumped elements, it is of some importance to waveguide filters; the Chebyshev filter, a special case of Cauer's synthesis, is widely used as a prototype filter for waveguide designs.|$|E

50|$|It {{was well}} known in both {{mathematics}} and engineering that the optimal response would exhibit an equiripple behavior and {{that the number of}} ripples could be counted using the <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>approximation.</b> Several attempts to produce a design program for the optimal Chebyshev FIR filter were undertaken in the period between 1962 and 1971. Despite the numerous attempts, most did not succeed, usually due to problems in the algorithmic implementation or problem formulation. Otto Herrmann, for example, proposed a method for designing equiripple filters with restricted band edges. This method obtained an equiripple frequency response with the maximum number of ripples by solving a set of nonlinear equations.

5000|$|In August 1970, James McClellan entered {{graduate}} school at Rice University with a concentration in mathematical models of analog filter design. James McClellan enrolled in a new course called [...] "Digital Filters" [...] due to his interest in filter design. The course was taught jointly by Thomas Parks and Sid Burrus. At that time, DSP was an emerging field and, as a result, lectures often involved recently published research papers. The following semester, the spring of 1971, Thomas Parks offered a course called [...] "Signal Theory," [...] which James McClellan took as well. During spring break of the semester, Thomas drove from Houston to Princeton in order to attend a conference. At the conference, he heard Ed Hofstetter's presentation about a new FIR filter design algorithm (Maximal Ripple algorithm). He brought the paper by Hofstetter, Oppenheim, and Siegel, back to Houston, thinking {{about the possibility of}} using the <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>approximation</b> theory to design FIR filters. He heard that the method implemented in Hofstetter's algorithm was similar to the Remez exchange algorithm and decided to pursue the path of using the Remez exchange algorithm. The students in the [...] "Signal Theory" [...] course were required to do a project and since <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>approximation</b> was a major topic in the course, the implementation of this new algorithm became James McClellan's course project. This ultimately led to the Parks-McClellan algorithm, which involved the theory of optimal <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>approximation</b> and an efficient implementation. By the end of the spring semester, James McClellan and Thomas Parks were attempting to write a variation of the Remez exchange algorithm for FIR filters. It took about six weeks to develop {{and by the end of}} May, some optimal filters had been designed successfully.|$|E
