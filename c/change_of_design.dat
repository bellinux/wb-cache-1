25|$|In 1997, {{yet another}} <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> that was {{controversial}} with the fans, a kit that featured a white drop—down V {{with a black}} and red mesh design {{at the bottom of}} the jersey. This was Mizuno's first design, taking over from Stag. The traditional red V was once more reverted to, after the controversial design, with a more circular design used for the 1999 season. In 2000, a more regular V was seen again. In 2003, a triple—V design was seen, and the first to be used by long—serving kit designers Puma AG. 2004 saw a double curvy red V used, before, in 2005, yet again tradition was reverted to in the design and this design was used until 2009. The away strip used in 2005 was the famous blue strip with a dark blue V. 2009 saw the long red V of 1985's design appear again, before, in 2010, a casual thin red V was seen.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the White House lunch meeting, Leach agreed to abandon the idea that the double eagle design be used for the small gold pieces, and to {{cooperate}} with Bigelow and Pratt in the making of the new coins. [...] Leach even undertook to reimburse Pratt's fee of $300 to Bigelow from government funds. [...] The President wanted to see Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle from the ten-dollar piece adapted in a recessed surface for the smaller pieces, and, if it did not constitute a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>design,</b> used on the ten-dollar piece as well (a project that did not go beyond the talking stage). [...] Bigelow wrote to Pratt on May 1 after conferring with Leach, stating that the Mint Director would likely not object if Pratt were to improve Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle, but [...] "I would not, if I were you, get too far from the original, as the President likes it. [...] Perhaps you can make him like it better." ...|$|E

30|$|For the statically {{indeterminate}} structure, the approximation accuracy is very low. This is mainly because internal forces are changing as the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> variables, and these changes don’t {{be reflected in}} RSM equation, which lead to {{the difference in the}} form between RSM approximation with reciprocal variables and analytic solution. In order to improve the approximation accuracy, a new method of high accuracy response surface should be developed.|$|R
500|$|Moore in {{his letter}} urged a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>design,</b> stating that the sketch, if {{translated}} into a coin, [...] "would bring humiliation {{to the people of}} Maine". However, Maine officials refused and insisted on the submitted sketches. After discussions among Peters, Moore, and various officials, an agreement was reached whereby the sketches would be converted into plaster models, and Fraser engaged his onetime student, Anthony de Francisci, to do the work. The younger sculptor completed the work by early July, and the models were approved by the Commission on July 9. The Engraving Department at the Philadelphia Mint created the coin dies utilizing de Francisci's models. Either Chief Engraver George T. Morgan, or his assistant, future chief engraver John R. Sinnock, changed the moose and pine tree on the coin from being in relief (as in de Francisci's models), to be sunken into the coin. This was probably in an attempt to improve the striking quality of the coins, and if so, had limited success, as the full detail would not appear on many coins.|$|E
500|$|The red coat {{remained}} standard uniform for the British Army until khaki {{was introduced}} as standard in 1885, although some allowances {{were made for}} colonial conditions, {{with the use of}} lighter materials, and slight <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>design.</b> However, the uniform and equipment remained quite restrictive, particularly in colonial warfare. In 1841, the light bobs situation was compared unfavourably with his enemy's light marching order: [...] "Buckle him up in a tight red jacket, when the thermometer is about 80°; place across his breast two buff-leather belts, about a quarter of an inch in thickness, and each what the milliners call a nail in breadth; hang to one of them a cartouche-box containing sixty rounds of ball cartridges, each of these about above an ounce in weight; strap across his shoulders a square well-packed wallet, containing four shirts, with or without frills, and other notions; plant a cap on his head which in point of weight is equal to an iron pot; then place over his shoulder a musket and bayonet weighing a stone; with three days' provisions in his haversack, and a couple of quarts of liquid in a canteen." ...|$|E

This chapel was left outside of the final cathedral, perhaps due to a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> in the 12th century.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1900s the simple framing methods {{mentioned}} above were gradually replaced by {{more complex and}} sophisticated methods, but the general mode of operation remained the same. The <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> are most noticeable on systems where both double- and single-deck cars were used on the same system. Single deck trams usually have tall and lightly constructed collectors with complicated frames to support the heavy cast-steel collector plate, while double deck cars usually have heavier collectors with less complicated frames.|$|R

50|$|The {{eastern part}} of the line was {{extended}} three times, one extension being to the Pervomayskaya temporary station inside a newly opened depot.

These three stations demonstrated a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> priorities straying away from Stalinist architecture to the new minimalism centipede designs supported under Nikita Khrushchev's leadership.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} method <b>of</b> <b>design</b> and {{optimization}} <b>of</b> stable IIR digital filters with non-standard amplitude characteristics using continuous ant colony optimization algorithm ACOR is presented. In proposed method (named ACO-IIRFD) dynamical <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> parameters in <b>designed</b> filters are introduced. Due to these dynamical <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> filter parameters, <b>design</b> <b>of</b> IIR digital filters with small deviations between designed filter characteristics and assumed characteristics is possible. Three IIR digital filters with amplitude characteristics: linearly-falling, linearly-growing, and non-linearly-growing, which can have application in amplitude equalizers, are designed using proposed method. ...|$|R

Therefore, the sensitivity analysis in this thesis focuses on the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> the displacement and the angle of flexural rotation at the top of the pile due to the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>design</b> variables which are the stiffness of the pile (EI), the cohesion of the soil (c), the modulus of subgrade reaction (k), the effective unit weight (gamma 2 ̆ 7), the strain at which 50...|$|R
50|$|Several {{have argued}} that the {{decision}} by managers to send workers back into the factories was due to the pressure to complete orders for buyers on time. This second line of argument gives partial responsibility for the disaster to the short production deadlines preferred by buyers due to the quick <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>designs,</b> referred to as fast fashion. Some have argued the demand for fast fashion and low-cost clothing motivated minimal oversight by clothing brands, and that collectively organised trade unions could have responded to the pressure of management.

25|$|The Mark 2 has a semi-integral construction, {{giving it}} more {{strength}} than a Mark 1 {{in the event}} of an accident, although a key driver <b>of</b> the <b>changed</b> construction method was to overcome the serious corrosion problem point in the Mark 1 at the base of the body, where it was attached to the underframe.
