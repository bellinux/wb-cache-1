50|$|Rowland {{performed}} many {{measurements of}} the atmosphere. One experiment included collecting air samples at various cities and locations around the globe to determine <b>CCl3F</b> North-South mixing. By measuring the concentrations at different latitudes, Rowland {{was able to see}} that <b>CCl3F</b> was mixing between hemispheres quite rapidly. The same measurement was repeated 8 years later and the results showed a steady increase in <b>CCl3F</b> concentrations. Rowland's work also showed how the density of the ozone layer varied by season increasing in November and decreasing until April where it levels out for the summer only to increase in November. Data gained throughout successive years showed that although the pattern was consistent, the overall ozone levels were dropping. Rowland and his colleagues interacted both with the public and the political side and suggested various solutions, which allowd to step wise reduce the CFC impact. CFC emissions were regulated first within Canada, the United States, Sweden and Norway. In the 1980s, the Vienna Agreement and the Montreal Protocol allowed for global regulation.|$|E

50|$|Charles (Boss) Kettering, vice {{president}} of General Motors Research Corporation, was seeking a refrigerant replacement that would be colorless, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic, and nonflammable. He assembled a team that included Thomas Midgley, Jr., Albert Leon Henne, and Robert McNary. From 1930 to 1935, they developed dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2 or R12), trichlorofluoromethane (<b>CCl3F</b> or R11), chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2 or R22), trichlorotrifluoroethane (CCl2FCClF2 or R113), and dichlorotetrafluoroethane (CClF2CClF2 or R114), through Kinetic Chemicals which was {{a joint venture between}} DuPont and General Motors.|$|E
5000|$|Organofluorine {{chemistry}} {{began in}} the 1800s {{with the development of}} organic chemistry. [...] The first organofluorine compounds were prepared using antimony trifluoride as the F− source. The nonflammability and nontoxicity of the chlorofluorocarbons <b>CCl3F</b> and CCl2F2 attracted industrial attention in the 1920s. In the 1930s, scientists at duPont discovered polytetrafluoroethylene. [...] Subsequent major developments, especially in the US, benefited from expertise gained in the production of uranium hexafluoride. Starting in the late 1940s, a series of electrophilic fluorinating methodologies were introduced, beginning with CoF3. About this time, electrochemical fluorination ("electrofluorination") was announced, having been developed in the 1930s with the goal of generating highly stable perfluorinated materials compatible with uranium hexafluoride. [...] These new methodologies allowed the synthesis of C-F bonds without using elemental fluorine and without relying on metathetical methods. In 1957, the anticancer activity of 5-fluorouracil was described. This report provided one of the first examples of rational design of drugs. [...] This discovery sparked a surge of interest in fluorinated pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. The discovery of the noble gas compounds, e.g. XeF4, provided a host of new reagents starting in the early 1960s. In the 1970s, fluorodeoxyglucose was established as a useful reagent in 18F positron emission tomography. In Nobel Prize-winning work, CFC's were shown to contribute to the depletion of atmospheric ozone. This discovery alerted the world to the negative consequences of organofluorine compounds and motivated the development of new routes to organofluorine compounds. In 2002, the first C-F bond-forming enzyme, fluorinase, was reported.|$|E
40|$|Field {{measurements}} of <b>CCl₃F</b> and CCl₂F₂ in ground water {{have shown that}} concentrations in recharge areas may be higher than those in water at equilibrium with the atmosphere. This research tested the hypothesis that sorption and desorption of fluorocarbons from grain surfaces in response to changes in soil moisture content are responsible for this enrichment. Soil slurry experiments were performed to determine whether aqueous fluorocarbon concentrations increased when water {{came into contact with}} dry soils. In all slurries, the aqueous <b>CCl₃F</b> concentration increased significantly, whereas the CCl₂F₂ concentrations increased in all but two of the slurries. The percent increase of both compounds correlated well with soil properties such as percent clay and percent organic matter. Column experiments were carried out to obtain distribution coefficients (Kd) for <b>CCl₃F</b> and CCl₂F₂ on dry soils. These values were 3. 02 and 3. 20 cm³/g, respectively, and the values for Kd on saturated sand were 0. 67 and 0. 360 cm 3 ig for <b>CCl₃F</b> and CCl₂F₂, respectively. The difference in magnitude of Kd for saturated and dry media suggests that significant amounts of both fluorocarbons desorb from grain surfaces when dry soil is wetted, causing enrichment of aqueous fluorocarbon concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Interest in halocarbons {{has been}} sparked by {{experimental}} {{evidence suggesting that}} these compounds are potential carcinogens and teratogens. The U. S. EPA started a nationwide program in 1970 to identify and quantify trace organic compounds in public water supplies and sewage effluents. To date no detailed large-scale areal ground-water surveys delineating concentrations of these halocarbons {{have been reported in}} the literature at the part per trillion level and below. The objectives of this dissertation are twofold: (1) identification, quantification, and detailed areal mapping of several halocarbon species in ground water near the Santa Cruz River northwest of Tucson, Arizona; and (2) development of halocarbon techniques for age dating recently recharged (0 - 40 years old) ground water. The halocarbon compounds considered are: trichlorofluoromethane (CC 1 ₃F), dichlorodifluoromethane (CC 1 ₂F₂), carbon tetrachloride (CC 1 ₄), chloroform (CHC 1 ₃), trichloroethylene (C₂HC 1 ₃), methyl chloroform (CH₃CC 1 ₃), and tetrachloroethylene (C₂C 1 ₄). Objective (1) includes discussions of the areal halocarbon distributions detected in the ground water, their sources, and a qualitative comparison of the distributions to ground-water quality and land use patterns adjacent to the Santa Cruz River. Objective (2) utilizes the exponential atmospheric concentration buildup of CCl₂F₂, CC 1 ₃F, and CCl₄, and the ratios of CCl₂F₂ to <b>CCl₃F</b> and CCl₄ to <b>CCl₃F.</b> Water samples from wells and the Santa Cruz River were collected in glass syringes and brought to the laboratory for analysis. An electron-capture gas chromatograph coupled to a gas stripping/concentration unit was used to quantify the halocarbons. Four high concentration areas were delineated, each probably associated with a different source: the CWUA area which was irrigated with sewage effluent during the 1960 's; Rillito Creek (near its confluence with the Santa Cruz) which is a major ground-water recharge source; the Ina Road treatment plant/landfill/oxidation ponds area; and the Roger Road treatment plant "sewer farm" which is irrigated with sewage effluent. The CCl₂F₂ to <b>CCl₃F</b> ratio distribution indicates that most ground water in the study area is at least partially mixed with recharge less than 30 years old. The ground water adjacent to the Rillito has an apparent age of less than 10 years, in agreement with the <b>CCl₃F</b> distribution. Ground water in the Cortaro area has an apparent age of about 25 years, correlating with the start of irrigation in the area...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of <b>CCl₃F</b> (CFC- 11) with CH₄ (in an argon bath gas) in a dielectric barrier discharge nonequilibrium plasma was examined. Oxygen and nitrogen {{were excluded from}} the feed stream and the reactions resulted in the production of fluorine-containing polymers, as well as a range of gaseous products including H₂, HCl, HF, C₂H₃F, C₂H₃Cl, C₂H₂ClF, CHCl₂F, CCl₂F₂, CH₃Cl, CH₂Cl₂, CHCl₃, and C₂Cl₄. The polymeric material synthesized during reaction is characterized as being non-cross-linked and random in nature, containing functional groups including CH₃, CH₂, CHCl, CHF, CF₂, and CF₃. The conversion level of CCl 3 F increased from 37 % to 63 % as the input energy density increased from 3 to 13 kJ L – 1 (the applied voltage range was 14. 1 to 15. 2 kV, peak–peak). The electrical discharge was characterized and found to be a slight modification of filamentary discharge toward a diffuse discharge due to the presence of the relatively low concentration of <b>CCl₃F</b> and CH₄ (less than 2 % each) in argon. A reaction mechanism is proposed describing the formation of gas phase, as well as polymeric products...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{describes}} {{research in}} the conversion of fluorine-containing ozone-depleting and greenhouse gases (abbreviated as “fluorocarbons”) into environmentally benign substances using a non-equilibrium plasma process. Conversion {{of a variety of}} fluorocarbons, including CFC- 12 (CCl₂F₂), CFC- 11 (<b>CCl₃F),</b> HCFC- 22 (CHClF₂), HFC- 134 a (CF₃CH₂F) and a mixture of CFC- 12, HCFC- 22 and HFC- 134 a were investigated in detail. Among these chemicals, CFC- 11, CFC- 12 and HCFC- 22 are ozone depleting substances while all are potent greenhouse gases. Conversion of HFC- 134 a was examined with and without the addition of methane, while methane was used as a reactant in all other experiments. Oxygen and nitrogen were excluded from all experiments and under these conditions the targeted fluorocarbons convert to gaseous as well as polymeric products. A dielectric barrier discharge(DBD) reactor, constructed from two concentric dielectric barriers, a 2. 0 – 2. 4 cm plasma zone and a 4. 5 – 4. 7 mm discharge gap, was used to generate the non-equilibrium plasma. The reaction of the fluorocarbon results in the formation of corrosive hydrofluoric acid (HF) gas, restricting reactor materials selection. In order to overcome this process constraint, the double barrier DBD reactor configuration with coaxial electrodes was selected to ensure that the electrodes were protected from exposure to HF. In terms of dielectric strength, quartz is highly suitable for the DBD reactor, however it is not suitable in a gas stream containing HF. In contrast, alumina is an HF-resistant material and has been used in studying the high temperature conversion of CFCs and halons although its dielectric strength is lower than that of quartz. With the aim of developing reactors designed for handling HF, a detailed preliminary study was undertaken using these two dielectric materials, quartz and alumina, examining the conversion of methane in an argon bath gas. It was found that the higher relative permittivity of alumina compared to quartz results in higher power dissipation in the alumina reactor compared to a similar quartz reactor, for a given applied voltage, due to increased capacitance of the system. Unlike thermal conversion methods, excitation and discharge quenching in the DBD system is too rapid to allow the development of any significant thermal equilibrium between electrons and ions and temperature rise of the process stream is relatively small. Measurements of the temperature in the reaction zone (using temperature of the outer electrode as a proxy) reveal that the reactants convert at a relatively low bulk gas temperature compared to conventional thermal or thermal plasma reactors. Carbon-containing gas phase products were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and quantified using a micro gas chromatograph (μGC). Hydrogen, produced during reactions, was quantified by a dedicated GC employing argon as carrier gas. A specially designed teflon Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas cell (11. 7 mm path length) was used to quantify acid gases (HCl and HF). The data acquired from this analytical train were used to estimate mass balances, where overall balances in excess of 95 % were achieved for all experiments. Polymeric products, generated during the reaction of the fluorocarbons, were deposited in the plasma zone. The polymeric materials were collected by rinsing the reactor tubes with tetrahydrofuran solvent and characterised by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The polymers were primarily non-crosslinked in nature, and are readily soluble in chloroform and tetrahydrofuran solvents. This property of the polymers enabled their analysis by solution state ¹³C and ¹⁹F NMR spectroscopies. Based on analyses of ¹³C NMR, spectra, the composition of polymeric materials changed according to their source material, viz, from one fluorocarbon to other. The conversion of HFC- 134 a in an argon bath gas (feed condition: 1. 25 % HFC- 134 a in 100 cm³ min⁻¹) was 52 % at 2 kJ L⁻¹ (the outer electrode temperature of 36 °C) and 82 % (where the outer electrode temperature was 101 °C). This temperature profile demonstrates the non-equilibrium nature of the system, where the electron temperature is relatively high compared to bulk gas temperature. The applied voltage range was 13. 4 – 15 kV (peak-peak) for this conversion range of HFC- 134 a, and corresponds to an input energy density range of 2 – 12 kJ L⁻¹. The addition of methane with the HFC- 134 a in the argon bath gas reduces the level of conversion of HFC- 134 a compared to reactions in the absence of methane. For example, at an input energy density of 6 kJ L⁻¹, the conversion level of HFC- 134 a (feed condition: 1. 25 % HFC- 134 a in 100 cm³ min⁻¹) was 75 % while the addition of an equimolar concentration of methane reduced the conversion level of HFC- 134 a to 47 %. The reaction of CFC- 12 was examined, with methane included as an additive in argon bath gas and a conversion range of 44 to 71 % for CFC- 12 (feed condition: 1. 25 % CFC- 12, 1. 25 % CH 4 in 100 cm³ min⁻¹) was observed over an input energy density range of 3 – 13 kJ L⁻¹. CFC- 11 and HCFC- 22 were also examined (with methane as additive) under similar feed conditions, where the conversion ranged from 37 – 63 % and 53 – 79 % respectively over an input energy density range of 3 – 13 kJ L⁻¹. A fluorocarbon mixture (85 % CFC- 12, 1. 5 % HCFC- 22 and 13. 5 % HFC- 134 a) with methane (similar feed conditions) was studied and the conversion of the major fluorocarbon, CFC- 12 was found to be 59 – 76 % for the input energy density of 3 – 13 kJ L⁻¹. According to mass balance analysis, the products from the reaction of CFC- 12 with methane under the feed condition described earlier and an input energy density of 5 kJ L⁻¹ contain 48 % gas phase substances and 52 % polymer (measured in wt %). The elemental composition of C, H, Cl and F (in wt %) for this polymer is 27. 51 %, 1. 82 %, 44. 92 % and 25. 88 % respectively. HF and HCl (if chlorine is present in the fluorocarbon) are major gas phase products while H 2 is an additional major gas phase product where methane is employed as an additive. A reaction mechanism describing the formation of gas phase and polymeric products is presented. As the reactions were conducted in an argon bath gas, the reactions of metastable argon atoms and direct electron impact reactions contribute to the resulting product distribution. As the discharge is primarily an ionisation phenomena, any interactions between ionised plasma species and the external electric field must be considered and factored into the elucidation of the prevailing reaction mechanisms particularly the formation of polymers. While the formation of polymers in plasma is described in many ways including the ionic mechanism, radical mechanism and atomicpolymerisation, this thesis considers the ionic mechanism as a basis with additional hypotheses to explain the product spectrum. Accordingly, Coulombic interactions between charged species and the electric field due to the applied voltage are important when considering the polymer's formation mechanism and a polymerisation mechanism is described in this thesis which includes the contributions of cations on polymer formation...|$|E
