50|$|Javitz was {{interested}} in how libraries and museums documented folk art and brought attention to the documentation of African-American folk art at the NYPL after viewing European cities documentation in the 1920s. In 1929, she became superintendent of the Picture Collection at the NYPL. She held the position until she retired in 1968. In the 1930s she assisted Arthur Alfonso Schomburg, Curator of the Library’s Division of Negro History, Literature and Prints, by reviewing the collection to find important prints, photographs, and plates of African-American subjects. During her tenure, she instituted important innovations including requesting pictures with drawings on a <b>call</b> <b>slip</b> to locate the material and streamlined the process of adding new materials to the library {{with a team of}} artists and catalog card index.|$|E

40|$|Objective – To {{describe}} an inventory {{system that was}} created within the library and to show the cost-effectiveness of using the inventory system compared {{to the price of}} reacquiring mis-shelved books. Design – Bibliometric study and cost-benefit analysis. Setting – Medium-sized academic library in a rural community of the United States. Subjects – Approximately 300, 000 books from LC classifications D through H, N, P and Q, representing two thirds of the library’s entire monograph collection. Methods – The library created its own electronic inventory and shelf-reading program, using a laptop computer equipped with a hand-held scanner, to scan barcodes in the stacks. Library staff used the Microsoft Access database to update two files containing a shelf-list and an active-status list while the books were scanned. The program alerted the worker if books found had an active status (i. e., Missing, Renewed, Overdue, Charged), were not in the correct order, or were not in the system. Each transaction created a log which contained a time stamp (to the second), the call number and the barcode number. It also took note of scanning errors, books that were out of order, and books that were not on a shelf-list. After a complete section was examined, a list was produced to reveal the distance of mis-shelved books from their correct location and the amount of time between each scan. The researchers used statistical analysis (using SPSS 15. 0) to measure scan speed for each scan, mis-shelving rate and error distance of each mis-shelved book. In order to analyze the cost of labour to replace a book versus the cost of inventorying, the researchers estimated the salary costs of staff members involved in selection, acquisition and cataloguing. The library spent $ 440, 000 USD in labour costs to purchase 15, 000 monographs in one fiscal year (approximately $ 30. 00 USD in labour costs per book). They multiplied this by 5300 books that were found to be “badly” mis-shelved (found beyond 25 books away from the proper position). Labour fees were used to determine costs of inventorying by calculating average scanning speed and cost per hour to pay someone to scan the entire half-million monograph collection. Main Results – It took approximately 707 hours to scan 305, 000 monographs. The average (mode) calculation for scans was 5 seconds for 80 % of the barcodes, with an average (mean) of 8. 35 seconds between scans. The longest average (mean) time for scanning barcodes was in the N section, followed by G, H, P, Q, D, E and F. A total of 291 books were found on the shelves with an “active” status (i. e., Charged (4), Overdue (7), Renewed (4), In Transit (24), and Missing (228)). Twenty-four books with the status “Miscellaneous” (i. e., At Bindery, <b>Call</b> <b>Slip,</b> Cataloguing Review, Damaged, and Mending) were also found on the shelves. Of the 15 active books in the categories “Charged”, “Overdue” and “Renewed”, ten were found in the proper position on the shelf. Of the 228 “Missing” books, 30 % were scanned in the correct location, 10 % were found 26 to 100 books away, and half were located over 100 books from their proper location. In addition to the books already marked as “Missing” in the catalogue, there were 516 books (. 17 % of the entire scanned section) still not found on the shelf after three searches over a period of 6 months. Of the 291 active status books found on the shelves, 52 % were reused as of July 2008. (The inventory was completed at the end of 2006). Over 36 % of books mis-shelved further than 25 books from their correct location were reused. However, among all books scanned, only 17 % were reused during the same time period. The researchers noted that inconsistencies between the call number as shown on the book label and how it appeared in the catalogue occurred 565 times. Of these discrepancies, 40 % of the labels resulted in books being misplaced ten or fewer books away, 10 % misplaced between 10 and 100 books away, and 35 % misplaced more than 100 books away from the correct position. In general, 82 % of mis-shelved books were found within 1 to 25 books away from their correct location. By calculating that 5300 books were mis-shelved beyond 25 books away from their proper position, labour costs were estimated to be at least $ 159, 000 USD (5300 x $ 30. 00 USD per book in labour costs). Costs for interlibrary loan were calculated at approximately $ 30. 00 USD per transaction, and patron’s time wasted trying to locate misplaced books was estimated at 30 minutes per book. This was much more than the labour costs associated with scanning books, which at an average speed of 8 seconds per book and $ 10. 00 US per hour for scanning worked out to be 2. 2 cents per book, or $ 11, 000 USD to scan the entire half-million monograph collection. Conclusion – The results appear to reveal that the labour costs for inventory control are less expensive than repurchasing or borrowing the same number of books...|$|E

50|$|The field {{windings}} in the stator of an induction motor {{set up a}} rotating magnetic field through the rotor. The relative motion between this field and the rotor induces electric current in the conductive bars. In turn these currents lengthwise in the conductors react with the magnetic field of the motor to produce force acting at a tangent orthogonal to the rotor, resulting in torque to turn the shaft. In effect the rotor is carried around with the magnetic field but at a slightly slower rate of rotation. The difference in speed is <b>called</b> <b>slip</b> and increases with load.|$|R

Void fraction usually varies from location to location in the flow channel (depending on the two-phase flow pattern). It fluctuates with time and its value is usually time averaged. In separated (i.e., non-homogeneous) flow, it is related to volumetric flow rates of the gas and the liquid phase, and to the ratio of the velocity of the two phases (<b>called</b> <b>slip</b> ratio).|$|R

50|$|If {{the rotor}} of a {{squirrel}} cage motor were to run at the true synchronous speed, the flux in the rotor at any given place on the rotor would not change, and no current would be created in the squirrel cage. For this reason, ordinary squirrel-cage motors run at some tens of RPM slower than synchronous speed. Because the rotating field (or equivalent pulsating field) effectively rotates faster than the rotor, {{it could be said}} to slip past the surface of the rotor. The difference between synchronous speed and actual speed is <b>called</b> <b>slip,</b> and loading the motor increases the amount of slip as the motor slows down slightly. Even with no load, internal mechanical losses prevent the slip from being zero.|$|R
50|$|Yaw {{refers to}} the {{direction}} in which the nose of the aircraft is pointing. It is the left-right movement of the nose across the horizon. It is possible for the nose of the aircraft to be pointing in a different direction from that in which the aircraft is moving. This usually occurs in a turn, and is <b>called</b> <b>slip</b> (if the aircraft is moving sideways into the turn) or skid (if it is moving outwards). Yaw is almost impossible to detect by visual references. In fixed-wing aircraft it is detected by references to the slip indicator. Gliders usually have a piece of string mounted in the pilot's vision which indicates airflow over the glider, and is called the yaw string.|$|R

European writers like Rousseau, who had never seen an Indian or heard a war-whoop, had been industrious in idealizing the savages, attributing to them all manner of noble virtues; and the sentimental attitude of these foreign writers was reflected here, after the eastern Indians had well-nigh vanished, in such stories as Mrs. Morton's Quabi, or The Virtues of Nature, a romance in verse which was published in 1790. In the same romantic strain are Cooper's Last of the Mohicans, Helen Hunt's Ramona and some of the early poems of Freneau and Whittier.|$|R
