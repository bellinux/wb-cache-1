25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{invention}} of his revolutionary illumination scheme as {{a graduate student at the}} University of Giessen, Köhler was working on overcoming problems with microphotography. Microscopes were illuminated by gas lamps, mirrors or other primitive light sources, resulting in an uneven specimen illumination unsuited for producing good quality photomicrographs using the slow-speed emulsions available at the time. Over the course of his work for his doctorate degree, Köhler developed a microscope configuration that allowed for an evenly illuminated field of view and reduced optical glare from the light source. It involved a <b>collector</b> <b>lens</b> for the lamp that allowed the light source to be focused on the front aperture of the condenser. This in turn allowed the condenser to be focused on the specimen using a field diaphragm and condenser focus control. This superior illumination scheme is still widely used in modern microscopes and forms the basis for phase contrast, differential interference contrast, epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy.|$|E
50|$|Fresnel {{lenses of}} {{different}} focal lengths (one collimator, and one collector) {{are used in}} commercial and DIY projection. The collimator lens has the lower focal length and is placed closer to the light source, and the <b>collector</b> <b>lens,</b> which focuses the light into the triplet lens, is placed after the projection image (an active matrix LCD panel in LCD projectors). Fresnel lenses are also used as collimators in overhead projectors.|$|E
50|$|Critical {{illumination}} acts to form {{an image}} of the light source on the specimen to illuminate it. This image is formed by the condenser or <b>collector</b> <b>lens.</b> This illumination is bright but not always even, as any structure in the light source (for example the filament of a light bulb) will be visible in the resulting image. Homogenous light sources such as a flame or sunlight give more even illumination. Alternatively, a ground or opal glass diffuser can be used to homogenise the light source, but this will cause a significant amount of light to be scattered away from the sample.|$|E

The basic technique is to combine a high color-rendering index (CRI) high-intensity discharge lamp (HID lamp) and ballast with a condenser and <b>collector</b> Fresnel <b>lens,</b> an LCD removed from a common computer display and a triplet lens.|$|R

50|$|Solar {{thermal water}} {{disinfection}} uses {{heat from the}} Sun to heat water to 70-100 °C {{for a short period}} of time. A number of approaches exist here. Solar heat <b>collectors</b> can have <b>lenses</b> in front of them, or use reflectors. They may also use varying levels of insulation or glazing. In addition, some solar thermal water disinfection processes are batch-based, while others (through-flow solar thermal disinfection) operate almost continuously while the Sun shines. Water heated to temperatures below 100 °C is generally referred to as Pasteurized water.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of a system to accurately determine {{the speed of a}} projectile (bullet) by measuring the time of flight between two parallel laser screens is described. Each screen is formed by a laser source and a set of prisms. At the detection end of each of the screens, a <b>collector</b> <b>lens</b> focuses the incident laser light beam onto a photodetector. The <b>collector</b> <b>lens</b> and detector are kept in a recess so that no stray or ambient light falls on the photodetector. Whenever a projectile crosses either of the screens, the corresponding photodetector senses the event, due to partial or full obscuration of the incident energy. An electronic circuit is used to accurately record the time when the projectile crosses each screen, and the time interval gives the time of flight. The distance between the screens being known, the velocity is displayed on a computer screen. Because a single collimated beam of light generates the entire optical curtain, the reduction in incident energy at the photodetector plane is independent of the entry point of the projectile into the screen. Due to the baffling of the photodetector from ambient light, the optical screens can be used at indoor or outdoor ranges equally effectively...|$|E

LEAR worked in its full momentum range between 100 MeV/c and 2 GeV/c, with perform-ance (intensities, ejection modes and spill length) exceeding the design specifications.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the many books written on photoelasticity, the optical system of the polariscopes used has {{received}} little attention. This paper describes the investigation carried out {{for the construction of}} the new polariscope at University College, London. The uniformity of illumination of the optical field and the sharpness of the isochromatics are two indispensable conditions for a good polariscope. Their fulfilment depends {{on the size of the}} light source, on the sizes, focal lengths and respective positions of the condenser, <b>collector</b> and camera <b>lenses,</b> and finally on the thickness of the specimen. The necessary relations between these factors are determined and may be applied in choosing the components of a polariscope according to its intended use.

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims {{to provide}} both {{experimental}} and theoretical model for utilization of Fresnel lens in solar water desalination by humidification-dehumidification process. The {{work was done}} in two stages. The first stage aimed at investigating the performance of Fresnel lens in heating saline water. Solar energy is considered {{as a source of}} heating. For thermodynamic analysis, mass and energy balance equations have been developed for the water heating, humidifier, and other cycle components. The models were solved numerically and validation showed that the model outcomes are 25 % higher than the experimental data due to energy losses. The analysis indicates that Fresnel <b>lens</b> <b>collector</b> has good efficiency (70 %) in clear days. The influence of ambient conditions and the percent of different types of energy loss, etc., are also analyzed. The second stage was to perform experiments for intensification of fresh water yield from the unit. The experiments were done for both open and close loop of air. The results showed that closed loop system provides higher water production than open loop system...|$|R
40|$|Wide field-of-view imaging of fast {{processes}} in a microscope requires high light intensities motivating {{the use of}} lasers as light sources. However, due to their long spatial coherence length lasers are inappropriate for such applications as they produce coherent noise and parasitic reflections, such as speckle, degrading image quality. Therefore, we provide a step-by-step guide for constructing a speckle-free and high contrast laser illumination setup using a rotating ground glass diffuser driven by a stepper motor. The setup is easy to build, cheap and allows a significant light throughput of 48 %, which is 40 % higher in comparison to a single <b>lens</b> <b>collector</b> commonly used in reported setups. This is achieved by using only one objective to collect the scattered light from the ground glass diffuser. We validate the stability and performance of our setup in terms of image quality, motor-induced vibrations and light throughput. To highlight the latter, we record Brownian motion of micro-particles using a 100 x oil immersion objective and a high-speed camera operating at 2 000 Hz with a laser output power of only 22 mW. Moreover, by reducing the objective magnification to 50 x sampling rates up to 10 000 Hz are realized. To help readers with basic or advanced optics knowledge realizing this setup we provide; a full component list, 3 D-printing CAD files, setup protocol, and the code for running the stepper motor...|$|R

40|$|The {{first attempt}} to {{completely}} characterise a three-dimensional field was done by Ellis and Dogariu with excellent results reported [1]. However, their method is based on near-field techniques, which limits its range of applications. In this work, we present an alternative far-field method for the characterisation of the three-dimensional field that results from the interaction of a tightly focused three-dimensional field [2] with a sub-resolution specimen. Our method {{is based on the}} analysis of the scattering-angle-resolved polarisation state distribution across the exit pupil of a high numerical aperture (NA) <b>collector</b> <b>lens</b> using standard polarimetry techniques.

Sntroduction Hiqh-energy charged particle beams can be focused by magnetic quadrupole lenses, or by a device producing an azimuthal maqnet ic field B. Such a field can be created by a magnetic horn [11, or by a “wire” [2] lens. A wire lens 1 s essentially a cylindrical conductor through which flows a st. rong axial current of uniform density. The resulting B-field, which is linearly increasing wit. h radius inside the conductor, leads to simultaneous focusing in all transverse direc-tlons. A wire lens is the most efficient device for focusing antiprotons (p) with a large product. ion cone, {{as is the case}} for i transferred to the new CERN Antiproton Collect. or (AC) ring. In the “plasma lens” the conductor is a column of ionized gas. This gas is practically transparent for high-. energy particles and does not deter 1 orat. e the emittance of the beam being focused.

40|$|Linear concentrating {{solar thermal}} systems offer a {{promising}} method for harvesting solar energy. In this paper, {{a model for a}} novel linear Fresnel <b>lens</b> <b>collector</b> with dual-axis tracking capability is presented. The main objective is to determine the performance curve of this technology by means of both experiment and theoretical analysis. A mathematical model including the optical model of the concentrator and the heat transfer model of the receiver pipe was developed. This tool was validated with experimental data collected using a proof of concept prototype installed in Bourne, UK. The performance curve of the collector was derived for temperatures between 40 °C and 90 °C. The results show that the global efficiency of the collector is limited to less than 20 %. The energy losses have been analysed. The optical losses in the lens system accounts for 47 % of the total energy dissipated. These are due to absorption, reflection and diffraction in the Fresnel lenses. Furthermore manufacturing error in the lens fabrication has to be considered. One third of the solar radiation collected is lost due to the low solar absorptance of the receiver pipe. Thermal radiation and convection accounts for 6 % of the total as relatively low temperatures (up to 90 °C) are involved. In order to increase the performance of the system, it is recommended to install an evacuated receiver and to insulate the recirculation system. Considering data from manufacturers, these improvements could increase the global efficiency up to 55 %. Utilising the results from this work, there is the intention of building an improved version of this prototype and to conduct further tests...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{energy has}} become a major {{alternative}} for supplying a substantial fraction of the nation's future energy needs. The Department of Energy (DOE) supports activities ranging from the demonstration of existing technology to research on future possibilities; and at LBL projects are in progress which span that range of activities. To assess various solar applications it is important to quantify the solar resource. In one project, LBL is cooperating with the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in the implementation and operation of a solar radiation data collection network in northern California. Special instruments have been developed and are now in use to measure the solar and circumsolar (around the sun) radiation. These measurements serve to predict the performance of solar designs which use focusing <b>collectors</b> (mirrors or <b>lenses)</b> to concentrate the sunlight. Efforts are being made to assist DOE in demonstrating existing solar technology. DOE's San Francisco Operations Office (SAN) has been given technical support for its management of commercial-building solar demonstration projects. The installation of a solar hot water and space heating system on an LBL building established model techniques and procedures as part of the DOE Facilities Solar Demonstration Program. Technical support is also provided for SAN in a DOE small scale technology pilot program in which grants are awarded to individuals and organizations to develop and demonstrate solar technologies appropriate to small scale use. In the near future it is expected that research will exert a substantial impact in the areas of solar heating and cooling. An absorption air conditioner is being developed that is air cooled yet suitable for use with temperatures available from flat plate collectors. With inexpensive but sophisticated micro-electronics to control their operation, the performance of many-component solar heating and cooling systems may be improved, and work is under way to develop such a controller and to evaluate commercially available units. Research is continuing on 'passive' approaches to solar heating and cooling where careful considerations of architectural design, construction materials, and the environment are used to moderate a building's interior climate. Computer models of passive concepts are being developed in a collaborative project with Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. These models will be incorporated into public domain building energy analysis computer programs to be used in systems studies and in the design of commercial buildings on a case study basis. The investigation of specific passive cooling methods is an ongoing project; for example, a process is being studied in which heat storage material would be cooled by radiation to the night sky, then provide 'coolness' to the building. The laboratory personnel involved in the solar cooling, controls, and passive projects are also providing technical support to the Solar Heating and Cooling Research and Development Branch of DOE in developing program plans, evaluating proposals, and making technical reviews of projects at other institutions and in industry. Low grade heat is a widespread energy resource that could make a significant contribution to energy needs if economical methods can be developed for converting it to useful work. Investigations continued this year on the feasibility of using the 'shape-memory' alloy, Nitinol, as a basis for constructing heat engines that could operate from energy sources such as solar heated water, industrial waste heat, geothermal brines, and ocean thermal gradients. Several projects are investigating longer-term possibilities for utilizing solar energy. One project involves {{the development of a new}} type of solar thermal receiver that would be placed at the focus of a central receiver system or a parabolic dish. The conversion of the concentrated sunlight to thermal energy would be accomplished by the absorption of the light by a dispersion of very small particles suspended in a gas. Work continued this year on chemical storage processes (such as 2 SO{sub 3 } = 2 SO{sub 2 } + O{sub 2 }) that could play an important role in providing long-term storage for high temperature power generation cycles. Another project is exploring biological systems. The possibility is being explored of developing a photovoltaic cell, based on a catalyst (bacteriorhodopsin) which converts light to electrical ion flow across the cell membrane of a particular bacteria...|$|R
