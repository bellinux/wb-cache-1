40|$|Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) is a gaseous {{detector}} used in particle {{detection and}} {{is known for its}} high rate capability. Ever since its invention in 1997, GEM was applied in many areas and recently has been proposed to be installed in the CMS high η regions for upgrade at LHC, CERN. A complete understanding of the working and gain behaviour does not exist. GEM gain is influenced by <b>charging</b> <b>up</b> and this has been variedly interpreted in literature lacking consensus. I have attempted in this work through simulations and measurements to achieve a better understanding of single GEM gain and how it is affected by various factors. Specific experimental methods which evolved with subsequent measurements were employed to systematically study the <b>charging</b> <b>up</b> effect. Information from simulations was applied to characterize measurements thereby enabling the development of a model for <b>charging</b> <b>up.</b> Conductivity mechanism of the dielectric used in GEM was analyzed and the resistivity measured. Gain free of <b>charging</b> <b>up</b> effects was measured and this is appropriate for comparison with simulation...|$|R

40|$|The Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS) can be {{conveniently}} {{considered as}} a charge breeder for any vapor source; this approach allows to compare the injection of metals from ovens with the injection of sin-gle charged RIB (radioactive ion beams) or the simple in-jection of heavy gases.

50|$|The player selects one {{of three}} {{different}} planes, each with different ratings in speed, power, {{and the strength of}} their homing attack. When flying through the levels, three primary weapons can be used by picking up their respective items, to fire either spreading vulcan bullets, straight-firing lasers, or multi-directional missiles. By holding button 1, the player can <b>charge</b> <b>up</b> to fire a special missile. If this missile hits a large enemy, the player will lock on to that enemy, and can fire fast homing projectiles to damage it further. There is also a supply of smart bombs which can be used to clear away the majority of enemies and their projectiles from the screen. Smart bombs can also be <b>charged</b> <b>up,</b> and each level of charge yields a different effect. If the player is shot down while <b>charging</b> <b>up</b> a bomb, the bomb does not go off.|$|R
