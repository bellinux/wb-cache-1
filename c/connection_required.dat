5000|$|In Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994), the Court {{evaluated}} {{further the}} degree of the <b>connection</b> <b>required.</b> In that case, the City of Tigard, Oregon required any business owner seeking to substantially expand onto property adjacent to a floodplain to create a public greenway and bike path from private land {{in order to prevent}} flooding and traffic congestion. The Supreme Court ruled that the city’s requirement would be a taking if the city did not show that there was a reasonable relationship between the creation of the greenway and bike path and the impact of the development. [...] "Without question, had the city simply required petitioner to dedicate a strip of land along Fanno Creek for public use, rather than conditioning the grant of her permit to redevelop her property on such a dedication, a taking would have occurred", the Court held. “Such public access would deprive petitioner of the right to exclude others, one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property".|$|E

5000|$|IMTS {{base station}} sites {{generally}} covered an area 40-60 miles in diameter. This extended range {{was due to}} both their large transmitter power {{and in many cases}} higher antenna placement at anywhere from 100-500 ft. IMTS base stations in larger cites had as many as 7 or 8 channels while rural stations had as few as one or two channels. Each telephone conversation (<b>connection)</b> <b>required</b> the exclusive use of a channel for the duration. Because of this limitation these systems had a much lower capacity than cellular systems and all channels busy conditions were common. In larger cities this dictated a very limited number of simultaneous calls. Each subscriber was given a packet of dialing and use instructions. Roaming (receiving calls out of the [...] "home area") was achieved by selecting the specific channels used by the tower and service provider the user was traveling in and dialing a three-digit code, thereby logging the user's land number at that location. This process had to be repeated at each tower which, as noted, usually had a range of 40-60 miles. Some areas only had half-duplex (one-way) communications and required the push-to-talk switch in the handset, between the mouthpiece and the earpiece. Two lights on the [...] "head" [...] indicated busy (red) if no channels were idle and in-use (green) if connected to the tower, or depressing the push-to-talk switch. There was no encryption and all conversations were public.|$|E
5000|$|Goble {{was first}} settled by Daniel B. Goble in 1853. He {{took up a}} {{donation}} land claim and later sold it to George S. Foster, who laid out a town and named it after Goble. Until there was a railroad bridge built across the Columbia River at Vancouver, Washington, Goble was the Oregon terminus for the train ferry to Kalama, Washington. Goble had a post office from 1894 to 1960.The history of the area is complicated because there are at five or six different community names applied to at least three locations {{in close proximity to}} each other all dating to about the same era. These names include: Hunters, Reuben, Goble, Mooreville, Red Town, Enterprise aka Enterprise Landing, and arguably Beaver Homes. The history of the area begins with the selection of Kalama, Washington, as the beginning point for the construction of the Pacific Division of the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1870. [...] At least by 1879, there was a landing on the Oregon side of the Columbia River across from Kalama known as Enterprise Landing. [...] Reuben was a post office name assigned to the location when a post office was sought in 1890 and {{it was found that the}} name Enterprise was already taken. [...] The physical location is given to be about a mile south of the present day Goble. Reuben was named for the brother of the first postmaster, Reuben R. Foster. Scheduled Rail service of the Northern Pacific Railway from Tacoma to Kalama began on January 5, 1874. It connected to regular riverboat traffic on the Columbia River. However the Northern Pacific Railroad was chartered to construct transcontinental railroad and telegraph lines between Lake Superior and Puget Sound and completing the <b>connection</b> <b>required</b> a Portland to Kalama route. In 1877, Oregon Senator John Mitchell sponsored legislation calling for the Northern Pacific to forfeit 7000000 acre of land grants unless they completed a line to Kalama [...] "as far as practicable along the Oregon side of the Columbia River". The bill didn't pass congress, but on September 8, 1883, the Last spike was driven at Gold Creek, Montana to close the gap in the Rocky Mountain Division section of the Northern Pacific Railroad. [...] A special train celebrating the opening of the transcontinental line arrived in Tacoma on September 13, 1883, which had traveled over the Portland-Hunters line. The Train Ferry Tacoma would go in service the following year.|$|E
