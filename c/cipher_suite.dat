A paper presented at an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conference on computer and communications security in 2012 demonstrated that the False Start extension was at risk: in certain circumstances it could allow an attacker to recover the encryption keys offline and to access the encrypted data.|$|E

2500|$|The server {{responds}} with a ServerHello message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, <b>cipher</b> <b>suite</b> and compression method from the choices {{offered by the}} client. If the server recognizes the session id sent by the client, it {{responds with}} the same session id. The client uses this to recognize that a resumed handshake is being performed. If the server does not recognize the session id sent by the client, it sends a different value for its session id. This tells the client that a resumed handshake will not be performed. At this point, both the client and server have the [...] "master secret" [...] and random data to generate the key data {{to be used for}} this connection.|$|E
2500|$|The TLS {{protocol}} exchanges recordsâ€”which encapsulate {{the data}} to be exchanged in a specific format (see below). Each record can be compressed, padded, appended with a message authentication code (MAC), or encrypted, all depending {{on the state of}} the connection. Each record has a content type field that designates the type of data encapsulated, a length field and a TLS version field. The data encapsulated may be control or procedural messages of the TLS itself, or simply the application data needed to be transferred by TLS. The specifications (<b>cipher</b> <b>suite,</b> keys etc.) required to exchange application data by TLS, are agreed upon in the [...] "TLS handshake" [...] between the client requesting the data and the server responding to requests. The protocol therefore defines both the structure of payloads transferred in TLS and the procedure to establish and monitor the transfer.|$|E
