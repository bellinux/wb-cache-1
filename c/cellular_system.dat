2500|$|Hinckley {{introduced}} the JetStick, Dual Guard composite material, {{and the use}} of fiberglass. The first experiments with fiberglas began during the 1950s and concluded with the creation of the B40 in 1959. Despite much criticism such as the comparison of fiberglass to “frozen snot,” Hinckley used the material in boatbuilding [...] Hinckley created Dual Guard technology in 1999, a composite composed of an aramid and carbon fiber, aimed at creating a stronger and more efficient hull. [...] In 2016, the company launched a remote monitoring system called OnWatch. OnWatch uses a series of sensors to track numerous data points on a boat and relay them via a <b>cellular</b> <b>system</b> to servers that update a mobile Web site (it feels like an app when you add the OnWatch icon to your smartphone homescreen). Once you log in, it gives you a homescreen with an at-a-glance understanding of how your boat is doing, from technical details such as engine status, bilge, battery, and fuel-tank levels, to the state of your shore power connectivity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Cellular</b> <b>systems</b> {{present a}} highly complex {{organisation}} at different scales including the molecular, cellular and colony levels. The complexity at {{each one of}} these levels is tightly interrelated. Integrative systems biology aims to obtain a deeper understanding of <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> by focusing on the systemic and systematic integration of the different levels of organisation in <b>cellular</b> <b>systems.</b> The different approaches in <b>cellular</b> modelling within <b>systems</b> biology have been classified into mathematical and computational frameworks. Specifically, the methodology to develop computational models has been recently called executable biology since it produces executable algorithms whose computations resemble the evolution of <b>cellular</b> <b>systems.</b> In this work we present P systems as a multiscale modelling framework within executable biology. P system models explicitly specify the molecular, cellular and colony levels in <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> in a relevant and understandable manner. Molecular species and their structure are represented by objects or strings, compartmentalisation is described using membrane structures and finally cellular colonies and tissues are modelled as a collection of interacting individual P systems. The interactions between the components of <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> are described using rewriting rules. These rules can in turn be grouped together into modules to characterise specific cellular processes. One of our current research lines focuses on the design of cell systems biology models exhibiting a prefixed behaviour through the automatic assembly of these cellular modules. Our approach is equally applicable to synthetic as well as systems biology. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{analytical}} model {{to compute the}} blocking probability in channelized <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> with dynamic channel allocation. We model the channel occupancy in a cell by a two-dimensional (2 -D) Markov chain, which can be solved to obtain the blocking probability in each cell. We apply our analytical model to linear highway systems with and without lognormal shadowing and then extend it to 2 -D <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> with lognormal shadowing. We show that, for linear highway systems, distributed dynamic channel-allocation schemes perform similarly to the centralized dynamic channel-allocation schemes in terms of blocking probability. However, for 2 -D <b>cellular</b> <b>systems,</b> the improvement in the performance is significant and {{the reduction in the}} blocking probability in systems with distributed dynamic channel allocation is by almost one order of magnitude, when compared to that in systems with centralized dynamic channel allocation. In practice, our analysis of linear highway systems is applicable to digital European cordless telephony (DECT) and that of 2 -D <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> is applicable to global systems for mobile communications (GSM).

40|$|The initial {{concept for}} the {{terrorist}} cell arguably {{stems from the}} late 19 th century Russian revolutionary Sergei Nechayev. His ingenious organisational structure consisted of placing at {{the lowest level of}} a revolutionary terrorist organisation an arm of tiny, loosely tied cells of seven to ten terrorists whose purpose was to cause terrible, total, complete destruction. In contemporary times, the terrorist cell has become the mainstay for various terrorist organisations. It is notable for its durability, flexibility and having crossed cultural boundaries within both time and space. By systematically analysing <b>cellular</b> <b>systems,</b> this research study sets out to uncover common organisational and operational patterns between terrorist organisations from which, derived predictors might facilitate the profiling of <b>cellular</b> <b>systems.</b> The methodology in this study employs the systematic decomposition and localisation analysis method to deconstruct the <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> of terrorist organisations. A further comparative analysis identifies cellular interconnectedness leading to the reconstitution of <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> as generic templates for re-interpretation. These results seek to contribute to the area of comparative studies within the academic discipline of terrorism and provide a platform for the future computer modelling of <b>cellular</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
