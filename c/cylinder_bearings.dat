40|$|This {{experimental}} study investigates {{the influence of}} different parameters on the operational behavior of high-speed hydrodynamic radial plain journal bearings such as predominantly used in turbo gearboxes. The investigations were conducted on bearings of various sizes and designs, including circular <b>cylinder</b> <b>bearings,</b> double wedge bearings, four-face bearings and tilting pad bearings with five pads. Experimental bearings with a diameter of 40 to 60 mm and a maximum bearing width of 80 mm can be installed in the bearing test rig. The motor is connected to a single-stage turbo spur gear so that the gearbox output shaft reaches a maximum rotational speed of 48, 600 min"-" 1. The experimental bearings can be steplessly loaded between 0 and 4 N/mm" 2. The operational behavior of the bearings is assessed by means of their friction energy, shaft displacement, oil flow rate, and bearing temperatures. The influence of bearing loading, load direction, oil feed temperature, and oil feed pressure on the operational behavior was investigated for every bearing type. The investigations were focused on the tilting pad bearings in a flooded mode of operation. Test results indicate that turbulent flow leads {{to an increase in}} the friction energy and load capacity of the bearing as compared to laminar flow. (orig.)

40|$|Today {{small metal}} parts are mass-produced as for example rollers in <b>cylinder</b> <b>bearings.</b> At high {{velocity}} cutting the metal is {{cut with a}} great force in a scissor-like device. Both precision and repeatability {{is important to be}} able to guarantee good quality, but from an economical point of view {{it is also important to}} keep a great manufacturing capacity. The part of the process that is most time consuming is when the metal bar, that is about to be cut, is fed to the right position. Therefore it is interesting to examine if the time used for positioning can be reduced. This thesis examines if more advanced automatic control can be used to speed up the process while maintaining the precision. In order to test and evaluate different theories, two different mathematical models have been developed. The models where implemented in the simulation program SIMULINK in MATLAB and they where compared to and adapted to data measured on the physical machine. One model is developed from physical relationships and mostly used for simulations while the other one, a condition state model, has been used for regulator design. The first question to answer was if it is at all possible to control the process any faster. When a theoretical limit was found the next step was to design a regulator to show that the theory of automatic control does not imply too great limitations. The design that was chosen was condition state feedback where the states were appraised with an observer. A faster system will raise the demands on cycle times and precision. To make sure that the hardware isn’t the limiting factor, design requirements have been set up. A small list of what hardware is available has also been put together (and shows that it is possible to implement such a system). The conclusion is that it is, theoretically, possible to radically increase the manufacturing capacity. The assumptions for this to be accomplished is especially that the uncertainty of the model is minimizedand that hardware with enough capacity can be found...|$|E

The heat was made worse by the steam turret, vacuum-brake ejector and sight-feed lubricator that were placed inside the cab.

50|$|As {{two-stroke}} engines {{use their}} crankcase to pressurize the air:fuel mixture before {{transfer to the}} cylinder, any standard lubricating oil left there (per practice with four-stroke engines) would be swept up and burnt with the fuel. To provide cylinder lubrication, fuels supplied to two-stroke engines are often mixed with oil {{so that it can}} coat the <b>cylinders</b> and <b>bearing</b> surfaces along its path. The ratio of gas to oil is set by the engine manufacturer but ranges from 30:1 to 50:1 per volume unit. Oil remaining in the mixture is burnt with the fuel and results in a familiar blue smoke and odor.|$|R

The compression-ratio is controlled by an adjustable threaded T screw on the <b>cylinder</b> head, <b>bearing</b> onto a contra piston within the cylinder bore.

50|$|Internal combustions engines require {{lubrication}} {{in operation}} that moving parts slide smoothly over each other.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of the study was to {{determine}} methodology for estimation of the operational reliability based on the statistical results of abrasive wear testing. Design/methodology/approach: For research, a traditional tribological system, i. e. a friction pair of the AlSi 17 CuNiMg silumin in contact with the spheroidal graphite cast iron of EN-GJN- 200 grade, was chosen. Conditions of dry friction were assumed. This system was chosen based on mechanical cooperation between the cylinder (silumin) and piston rings (spheroidal graphite cast iron) in conventional internal combustion piston engines with spark ignition. Findings: Using material parameters of the cylinder and piston rings, nominal losses qualifying the cylinder for repair and the maximum weight losses that can be smothered were determined. Based on the theoretical number of engine revolutions to repair and stress acting on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bearing</b> surface, the maximum distance that the motor vehicle can travel before the seizure of the cylinder occurs was calculated. These results were the basis for statistical analysis carried out with the Weibull modulus, the end result of which was the estimation of material reliability (the survival probability of tribological system) and the determination of a pre-operation warranty period of the tribological system. Research limitations/implications: The analysis of Weibull distribution modulus will estimate the reliability of a tribological cylinder-ring system enabled the determination of an approximate theoretical time of the combustion engine failure-free running. Originality/value: The results are valuable statistical data and methodology proposed in this paper can be used to determine a theoretical life time of the combustion engine...|$|R
