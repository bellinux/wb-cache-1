50|$|Part of the town’s {{heating energy}} {{comes from an}} {{environmentally}} friendly high-performance heat pump from the ﬁrm in Freital named Thermea. It draws heat from the river Lauter, whose water has a yearly average temperature of 10 °C.

50|$|In particular, {{the problem}} of 'pluming' arose with early {{installations}} of <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers,</b> in which a white plume of condensed vapour (as minuscule droplets) becomes visible at the outlet flue.

50|$|The {{adjacent}} {{low energy}} building {{was constructed in}} 1999 to show how super-insulation can enable a 1,000m2 building to be heated from a gas <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler</b> little larger than would {{be used in a}} typical UK home. This served as NEF's headquarters until 2004. A 39kWp photovoltaic array was added to this building in 2012, taking advantage of special fixings that had been designed into the original building.|$|E
50|$|<b>Condensing</b> <b>boiler</b> {{manufacturers}} {{claim that}} up to 98% thermal efficiency can be achieved, compared to 70%-80% with conventional designs (based on the higher heating value of fuels). Typical models offer efficiencies around 90%, which brings most brands of condensing gas boiler in to the highest available categories for energy efficiency. In the UK, this is a SEDBUK (Seasonal Efficiency of Domestic Boilers in the UK) Band A efficiency rating, while in North America they typically receive an Eco Logo and/or Energy Star Certification.|$|E

5000|$|... <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> {{are no more}} {{difficult}} to service, nor do they require more frequent servicing ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> are {{water heaters}} fueled by gas or oil. They achieve high {{efficiency}} (typically greater than 90% on the higher heating value) by condensing water vapour in the exhaust gases and so recovering its latent heat of vaporisation, which {{would otherwise have}} been wasted. This condensed vapour leaves the system in liquid form, via a drain. In many countries, the use of <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> is compulsory or encouraged with financial incentives.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{hot gases}} {{produced}} in the combustion process is water vapour (steam), which arises from burning the hydrogen content of the fuel. A <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler</b> extracts additional heat from the waste gases by condensing this water vapour to liquid water, thus recovering its latent heat of vaporization. A typical increase of efficiency can {{be as much as}} 10-12%. While the effectiveness of the condensing process varies depending on the temperature of the water returning to the boiler, it is always at least as efficient as a non-condensing boiler.|$|E
50|$|Most {{non-condensing}} boilers {{could be}} forced to condense through simple control changes. Doing so would reduce fuel consumption considerably, but would quickly destroy any mild steel or cast-iron components of a conventional high-temperature boiler due to the corrosive nature of the condensate. For this reason, most <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler</b> heat-exchangers are made from stainless steel or aluminum/silicon alloy. External stainless steel economizers can be retrofitted to non-condensing boilers to allow them to achieve condensing efficiencies. Temperature control valves are used to blend hot supply water into the return to avoid thermal shock or condensation inside of the boiler.|$|E
5000|$|Notable {{landmarks}} in the company’s {{more recent}} history include {{the launch of}} the first wall-hung circulation water heater, the Circo Geyser, in 1961, and the first wall-hung water heater with <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler</b> technology that was developed and produced in-house in 1995. 2001 saw the internationalisation and expansion of the Vaillant Group’s brand and product portfolio and its sales and production network, following the acquisition of the British Hepworth Group. The company continued down this path of internationalisation with the acquisition of a majority stake in the Turkish heating and air-conditioning technology specialist Türk Demir Döküm [...] Fabrikalari in 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{manufacturers}} of new domestic <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> produce a basic [...] "fit all" [...] control system {{that results in}} the <b>boiler</b> running in <b>condensing</b> mode only on initial heat-up, after which the efficiency drops off. This approach should still exceed that of older models (see the following three documents published by the Building Research Establishment: Information Papers 10-88 and 19-94; General Information Leaflet 74; Digest 339. See also Application Manual AM3 1989: <b>Condensing</b> <b>Boilers</b> by Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers).|$|R
50|$|Reliability, {{as well as}} {{initial cost}} and efficiency, affects total cost of ownership. One major {{independent}} UK firm of plumbers stated sarcastically in 2005 that it had made thousands of call-outs to mend <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers,</b> and that the greenhouse gas emissions from its vans were probably greater than the savings made by the shift to eco-conscious boilers. However, the same article {{points out that the}} Heating and Hotwater Information Council, together with some installers, have found that modern <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> are just as reliable as standard boilers.|$|R
5000|$|The Building Research Establishment, {{which is}} the UK's major {{research}} body for the building industry, produced a leaflet on domestic <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers.</b> According to the Building Research Establishment: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{condensate}} {{expelled from}} a <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler</b> is acidic, with a pH between 3 and 4. Condensing boilers require a drainpipe for the condensate produced during operation. This {{consists of a}} short length of polymer pipe with a vapour trap to prevent exhaust gases from being expelled into the building. The acidic nature of the condensate may be corrosive to cast iron plumbing, waste pipes and concrete floors but poses no health risk to occupants. A neutralizer, typically consisting of a plastic container filled with marble or limestone aggregate or [...] "chips" [...] (alkaline) can be installed to raise the pH to acceptable levels. If a gravity drain is not available, then a small condensate pump must also be installed to lift it to a proper drain.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), in {{cooperation}} with Breaking Ground began construction on a $59 million, 99000 sq ft supportive housing complex at 133 Pitt Street on the Lower East Side that will be Manhattan's first such LEED Silver development. Designed by Kiss + Cathcart Architects (Brooklyn Health House, Stillwell Avenue Subway Terminal), The Lee, named {{after one of the}} project's major financiers, will offer affordable housing and on-site social services for 263 residents. 104 units are reserved for the homeless, 105 are for low-income residents, and 54 units are for young adults that are at high risk for homelessness. Green design features include an efficient <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler,</b> a green roof, efficient water fixtures, high-performance lighting, and low-irrigation landscaping. HPD and Breaking Ground expect a minimum of twenty percent savings in utility expenses.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} heat exchangers are constructed of materials that will withstand this acidity, typically aluminum or stainless steel. Since the final exhaust from a <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler</b> has a lower temperature than the exhaust from an atmospheric boiler 38°C (100°F) vs. 204°C (400°F) a mechanical fan is always required to expel it, with the additional benefit of allowing the use of low-temperature exhaust piping (typically PVC in domestic applications) without insulation or conventional chimney requirements. Indeed, the use of conventional masonry chimney, or metal flue is specifically prohibited due to the corrosive nature of the flue products, with the notable exception of specially rated stainless steel and aluminum in certain models. The preferred/common vent material for most condensing boilers available in North America is PVC, followed by ABS and CPVC. Polymer venting allows for {{the added benefit of}} flexibility of installation location including sidewall venting saving unnecessary penetrations of the roof.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{potentials}} {{of energy}} conservation and emission mitigation are investigated by thermoeconomic systems analysis for a district heating system of 100 well-insulated housing units. The technologies considered are solar collectors, heat exchangers, the seasonal storage of solar heat, (gas-fired) <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers,</b> heat pumps, and the cogeneration {{of heat and}} electric-ity. Appropriate combinations of these technologies yield (non-renewable primary) energy savings between 15 % and 35 % associated with cost increases between ÿ 20 % and 140 % compared to a reference case with individual <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> and electricity taken from the public grid. ...|$|R

40|$|This Applications Manual brings {{together}} existing knowledge on <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> {{for the benefit}} of building services engineers. lt provides a 'state-of-the-art' assessment of their advantages and disadvantages and it is hoped that many of the uncertainties surrounding the subject will be dispelled in the text. This manual should increase the uptake of the technology, and hence promote significant energy savings.

5000|$|In Europe the usable {{energy content}} of fuel is {{typically}} calculated using the {{lower heating value}} (LHV) of that fuel, the definition of which assumes that the water vapor produced during fuel combustion (oxidation), remains gaseous, and is not condensed to liquid water so the latent heat of vaporization of that water is not usable. Using the LHV, a <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler</b> can achieve a [...] "heating efficiency" [...] in excess of 100% (this does not violate the {{first law of thermodynamics}} as long as the LHV convention is understood, but does cause confusion). This is because the apparatus recovers part of the heat of vaporization, which is not included in the definition of the lower heating value of fuel. In the U.S. and elsewhere, the higher heating value (HHV) is used, which includes the latent heat for condensing the water vapor, and thus the thermodynamic maximum of 100% efficiency cannot be exceeded with HHV's use.|$|E
40|$|Condensing {{technology}} {{applied to}} boilers {{is to make}} full use of thermal energy contained in the fuel. That means that additionaly the heat from condensation of exhaust gases {{can be used for}} the purposes of heating the domestic hot water and to cover the demand for central heating. The study analyzed the operation of the “traditional” boiler equipped with the ORC module as the similar arrangement but with the <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler.</b> In the case of a conventional boiler there is noted a greater fuel consumption and the greater power generated than {{in the case of the}} unit with the <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler.</b> Postulated is the indicator in the form of a ratio of turbine power to the mass flow rate of fuel, which in turn gives a higher value for the <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler,</b> thus demonstrating that the operation of <b>condensing</b> <b>boiler</b> ORC module will be more economical.

50|$|Initial {{testing and}} annual {{monitoring}} of the heat transfer fluid in <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> with aluminium or stainless steel heat exchangers is highly recommended. Maintenance of a slightly alkaline (pH 8 to 9) liquid with anti-corrosion and buffering agents reduces corrosion of the aluminium heat exchanger. Some professionals believe that the condensate produced on the combustion side of the heat exchanger may corrode an aluminium heat exchanger and shorten boiler life. Statistical evidence is not yet available since <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> with aluminium heat exchangers have not been in use long enough.|$|R
50|$|<b>Condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> {{are up to}} 50% more {{expensive}} to buy and install than conventional types in the UK and the US. However, , at UK prices the extra cost of installing a condensing instead of conventional boiler should be recovered in around 2-5 years through lower fuel use (for verification, see the following three documents published by the Building Research Establishment: Information Papers 10-88 and 19-94; General Information Leaflet 74; Digest 339; see also Case studies in Application Manual AM3 1989: <b>Condensing</b> <b>Boilers</b> by Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers), and 2-5 years at US prices. Exact figures {{will depend on the}} efficiency of the original boiler installation, boiler utilisation patterns, the costs associated with the new boiler installation, and how frequently the system is used.The cost of these boilers is dropping as the mass takeup enforced by government takes effect and the manufacturers withdraw older, less efficient models, but production cost is higher than older types as <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> are more complex.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> are now largely {{replacing}} earlier, conventional {{designs in}} powering domestic central heating systems in Europe and, {{to a lesser}} degree, in North America. The Netherlands was the first country to adopt them broadly. In Europe, their installation is strongly advocated by pressure groups and government bodies concerned with reducing energy use. In the United Kingdom, for example, all new gas central-heating boilers fitted in England and Wales since 2005 must be high-efficiency <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> unless there are exceptional circumstances the same regulations apply to oil-fired boilers from April 2007 (warm air central heating systems are exempt from these regulations). In the United States, there is a Federal tax credit for the installation of <b>condensing</b> <b>boilers</b> and additional rebates from power companies in some states. In Western Canada, energy suppliers now offer energy rebates when these systems are installed in multi-unit dwellings. The decrease in natural gas prices in North America has resulted in increased retrofitting of existing <b>boiler</b> installations with <b>condensing</b> equipment.|$|R
