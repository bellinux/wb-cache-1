25|$|Napoleon left Boulogne on 27 August, {{bound for}} Aachen {{to visit the}} tomb of Charlemagne, and to see his wife Jos√©phine. The army {{remained}} encamped outside Boulogne and the British were initially suspicious that his departure was a ruse, {{and that he would}} double back unexpectedly to take command of the army and launch the invasion. In the meantime the frigate HMS Immortalite was sent under the command of Captain Edward Owen to carry out surveys along the French coast around the port. Fulton subsequently pronounced his inventions ready, and an assault was planned for early October. Working at Portsmouth Dockyard Fulton had built several types of craft and explosive devices. The 'torpedo-catamaran' was a coffer-like device balanced on two wooden floats and steered by a man with a paddle. Weighted with lead so as to ride low in the water, the operator was further disguised by wearing dark <b>clothes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> black cap. His task was to approach the French ship, hook the torpedo to the anchor cable and, having activated the device by removing a pin, remove the paddles and escape before the torpedo detonated. Also to be deployed were large numbers of casks filled with gunpowder, ballast and combustible balls. They would float in on the tide and on washing up against an enemy's hull, explode. Also included in the force were several fireships, carrying 40 barrels of gunpowder and rigged to explode by a clockwork mechanism.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "punk" [...] {{was first}} used in {{relation}} to rock music by some American critics in the early 1970s, to describe garage bands and their devotees.

The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world, {{and it became a}} major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated punk subculture emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive styles of clothing and adornment (ranging from deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, spike bands and other studded or spiked jewelry to bondage and S <b>clothes)</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies.|$|E

Dalrymple wrote that [...] "the response to the Stephen Lawrence case is another example of how the rule of law is to be supplanted by the rule of sentiment‚Äîand it is yet one more instance of what one might call the Dianafication of British public life, in which transitory popular enthusiasm trumps venerable tradition". In a 2004 essay, he analysed how sentimentality towards children was closely linked with violence and neglect, particularly in the poorest sections of British society: [...] "The upbringing of children in much of Britain is a witches' brew of sentimentality, brutality, and neglect, in which overindulgence in the latest fashions, toys, or <b>clothes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> television in the bedroom are regarded as the highest‚Äîindeed only‚Äîmanifestations of tender concern for a child's welfare".|$|E
