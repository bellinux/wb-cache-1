He took a few Mandarin classes while attending Harvard to try to improve. After joining the Knicks in 2012, Lin slept on a couch in his brother's one-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City. The night before his breakout game, he slept on the couch of teammate Landry Fields. He relocated to a luxury condo in White Plains, New York, after his Knicks contract became guaranteed.|$|E

Michigan is the only state that includes height and weight as bounds for non-discrimination in hiring. The plaintiff alleges that the women made the offer of a free gym membership and that if she did not improve in 30 days, her employment would be terminated. The company denied that they threatened to fire the plaintiffs, and the suit was settled out of court.|$|E
25|$|Queensland Airlines and its agents did {{not have}} {{weighing}} scales for use with passengers and luggage. The Traffic Manager for Queensland Airlines advised that sets of weighing scales had been purchased but were not in use because {{they had not been}} approved by the Department of Weights and Measures. He said that at every port other than Bilinga passengers <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>some</b> other company's weighing scales, and passengers intending to board at Bilinga could use the weighing scales at the nearby railway station. Staff of Queensland Airlines at Bilinga asked passengers to estimate their weight.

500|$|There was a {{limit of}} six people on stage for each performance. This {{included}} the Melodifestivalen choir (huskören, literally [...] "the house choir"), a five-person group of flexible backing singers used by most participants. Artists <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>some</b> {{or all of the}} back-up singers, or use their own group. All vocals had to be completely live; human voices were not allowed on backing tracks. However, from 2009, the number of performers allowed on stage was eight, and voices were allowed on backing tracks. A live orchestra was used every year from the event's debut to 2000, except 1985 and 1986. Two orchestras were used between 1960 and 1963, a large orchestra and Göte Wilhelmsons kvartett, a jazz quartet. Since 2001, participants have performed to backing tracks.|$|E

A 1988 review said that, [...] "Unfortunately, many of [...] effects looked too self-consciously clever." [...] A 1990 review concluded that, [...] "It is easy to be optimistic about ISO; its shows are goofy fun. But the apparently casual silliness derives from great theatrical shrewdness." [...] A 1991 review said that, [...] "The evening got off to a good, punchy start, then dwindled irretrievably into sophomoric hijinks." [...] A 1993 review stated that, [...] "Iso is after laughs and it gets them. But its targets are threadbare just when dance <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>some</b> sharp satirists."

The Tesla shows just how good zero-emissions [...] "green" [...] technology can be. Quite frankly, getting into a normal car {{at the end of}} the test drive was a major letdown.

2500|$|Drowned in Sound's Sammy Maine, however, {{gave the}} album a mixed review, writing: [...] "There's flashes of Jimmy Eat World {{brilliance}} {{and even a}} few classics in there, but this is an album that's also prone to a few fillers and cheesy one liners. This is a band that should be beyond mediocre offerings but sadly, there's just one too many on Damage." [...] The A.V. Clubs Kyle Ryan gave the album a mostly negative review, stating: [...] "While the group's predictability has traditionally been a positive assurance of quality, it's now more indicative of stasis. Damage doesn't offend, but it doesn't offer much that's memorable, either." [...] Rolling Stones Nick Catucci gave the album a negative review, stating: [...] "On their first album since 2010, the Arizona guys still sound sweet.

He was curious to see what the Wizard's magic tools looked like, and hoped he <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>some</b> of them and so secure more power; but after he had taken the articles, one by one, from the bag, he had to admit they were puzzles to him. For, unless he understood their uses, they were of no value whatever. Kiki Aru, the Hyup boy, was no wizard or magician at all, and could do nothing unusual except to use the Magic Word he had stolen from his father on Mount Munch. So he hung the Wizard's black bag on a branch of the tree and then climbed down to the lower limbs that he might see what the victims of his transformations were doing.|$|E
