Here we provide a novel quantitative approach for assessing forest resilience that focuses on three components of resilience, namely resistance, recovery, and net change, using a spatially explicit model of forest dynamics. Under the pulse set scenarios, we explored the resilience of nine ecosystem services and four biodiversity measures following a one-off disturbance applied to an increasing percentage of forest area.

Sporocarps were mapped and collected, and somatic incompatibility tests between mycelial cultures cultivated from the sporocarps were used to identify genets. Calculations of the size and numbers of genets and their distribution were performed. The spatial distribution of the tested sporocarps and the identified genets are presented graphically in a grid. The total number of identified genets within the investigated area (1210 m 2) was 27 based on 48 tested sporocarps. The size of the genets was calculated by measuring {{the distance between the}} furthermost sporocarps with somatically compatible mycelial cultures. 16 of the 27 identified genets displayed 2 or more sporocarps. The most extensive genet, as reflected by the tested sporocarps, was 1. 25 meters in diameter. The shortest distance between sporocarps from different genets was 32 cm. The results indicate that the population contains of relatively small, short-lived and spore established genets.

We asked the question: Is there an impact of grey phase MPB kill severity on bird and beetle assemblages, and does an effect persist following wildfire in BC? We compared the bird community of central interior BC against categorical and <b>continuous</b> <b>disturbance</b> severity gradients in unburned (MPB-only) and burned (MPB+FIRE) forests. Bird abundance and diversity was higher following fires, possibly supported by foraging resources from the positive abundance of beetles, however our findings suggest intermediate severities of compound disturbances show the greatest increases. In MPB-only areas, cumulative MPB kill was generally unimportant at the stand scale, but local gradients {{played a role in}} describing guild patterns, bird community membership, and single species abundances. In comparison, both burn severity and underlying MPB kill were important predictors in MPB+FIRE stands, suggesting evidence of a compound disturbance effect. We observed tenuous patterns that suggest the MPB outbreak might have detrimental effects on avian bark insectivores post-fire, but a positive influence on aerial foraging species. Further research is required on available resources for these guilds after compound MPB and wildfire disturbances...|$|E

This work has found two novel and important differences from the 1989 survey in that <b>continuous</b> <b>disturbance</b> is no longer required for introduced species to persist, and one introduced plant, Taraxacum officinale, has begun growing in two undisturbed locations. Climate warming {{as well as the}} invasional meltdown hypothesis can explain these two new observations. The decline in introduced species diversity can in large part be explained by the removal of barley from grain shipments to the Churchill grain elevator, although the study was confounded by a low precipitation summer which could have impacted the number of introduced species that germinated and grew in 2013. The drop in introduced species diversity despite a warming climate is evidence that many of the plants recorded as occurring in Churchill were ecologically doomed populations only kept in existence through constant seed subsidies from the grain elevator...|$|E

30|$|In real world, {{because of}} {{switching}} phenomenon or sudden noise, many real {{systems have been}} found to be subject to instantaneous perturbations and abrupt changes at certain instants. That is, these systems cannot be controlled by continuous control and endure <b>continuous</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Therefore, impulsive control, as a typical discontinuous control scheme, has been widely adopted to design proper controllers for achieving synchronization or stability [1 – 9]. Based on the Lyapunov function method, the Razumikhin technique, or the comparison principle, many valuable results have been obtained, and synchronization criteria have been derived. For a given neural network, we can estimate the largest impulsive interval from the derived criteria by fixing impulsive gains and calculating some system constants, for example, Lipschitz or Lipschitz-like constants with respect to neuron activation functions, and vice versa. As we know, different neural networks usually have totally different system parameters and activation functions, which means that the impulsive controllers with fixed impulsive gains and intervals are not unified. In other words, the system parameters have more restrictions on the choice of impulsive gains and intervals. For relaxing the restrictions, adaptive strategy is introduced to design adaptive impulsive controllers. The Lipschitz (or Lipschitz-like) and other constants with respect to system parameters and activation functions need not be known beforehand and can be calculated according to the proposed adaptive strategy [24 – 26].|$|E

However, current understanding is based overwhelmingly on natural systems {{and there have}} been few assessments of zooplankton spatial pattern in artificial lakes subjected to intensive management. Here, we investigate spatial structure among crustacean zooplankton at scales ranging from 1 m to 2700 m in the newly-formed Cardiff Bay (UK). We hypothesised that zooplankton spatial structuring in Cardiff Bay would be weakened by artificial aeration that was expected to create intense, <b>continuous</b> <b>disturbance</b> that homogenised physico-chemical conditions. Water quality across Cardiff Bay varied only moderately, and variations in zooplankton community composition were weakly related to temperature, oxygen, chlorophyll-a concentration and salinity at scales of around 2 km. However, spatial pattern explained over 60 % of variance in zooplankton composition at the smallest scales (0 - 5 m), implying that inter-specific interactions were involved. Additionally, the numerically dominant zooplankton (Daphnia hyalina (Leydig 1860), Eurytemora affinis (Poppe 1880) and Eucyclops agilis (Koch 1838)) had highly contagious distributions in warmer locations with increased chlorophyll-a reflecting aggregated response to abundant food. These data suggest that local biotic interactions among zooplankton and broader-scale links between dominant species and their algal food are sufficiently intense to persist despite the homogenising effects of artificial aeration and lake mixing. Such spatial pattern and scale-dependence has ramifications for zooplankton sampling while illustrating the self-organising capacity of predator-prey interactions even in novel, disturbed environments...|$|E

The focus has been on Apalus bimaculatus, since the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency are creating a restoration program as it is red listed as Near Threatened. The purpose was also to get an overview of the pits since the County Administrative Board wants to continue this project. Apalus bimaculatus is easy to overlook since it is a short-lived beetle and it lives early in the spring. The species parasitize on Colletes cunicularius which are dependent on fine-grained, exposed sand in sunlit areas with Salix nearby. Gravel is a limited resource that today is replaced with crushed rock, this is a big problem for the beetles since the gravel pits are their primary habitat. The sand pits have a <b>continuous</b> <b>disturbance</b> which results in mixed sand and removed vegetation. This early succession state benefits species that are sensitive to competition.

The continuous monitoring and storage of every voltage waveform at a selection of key sites will add significant expenses to the associated costs in managing the electricity industry while demanding an enormous quantity of information to be processed. This thesis gives a less comprehensive approach which may be accepted as a standard and consistent method of characterising the supply using simple set of power quality indices. Also presented is a power quality data management and reporting methodology which will give useful feedback to endusers, allowing assessment of operability of equipment {{as well as to}} the regulators and utilities, for the comparison of competitive distributor performance. This is supported by a power quality surveys of selected sites within electricity utilities in Australia. The thesis gives a method of analysis that can be used to conveniently convert the collected raw data into useful knowledge, covering various types of power quality disturbances i. e. continuous or variation type and discrete or event type. Literature suggests that there has been many studies undertaken on <b>continuous</b> <b>disturbance</b> characterisation and related indices. Comprehensive standards have been developed specifying objectives to be met with standard limits for all <b>continuous</b> <b>disturbance</b> types. However, there are no generally acceptable methods for characterisation of discrete disturbances and limits are not well defined in international standards. A generalised method is proposed in this thesis to characterise discrete disturbances which is essentially based on a Disturbance Severity Indicator (DSI) proportional to the customer complaint rate. Scaled versions of the CBEMA and ITIC curves have been used to give an approximation to customer complaints. The power quality reporting methodology suggested in this thesis is a consistent approach for power quality data analysis; categorised in to Short term, Medium term and Long term reporting, giving summary indices for each individual disturbance type and a single Unified Power Quality Index (UPQI) for each site and the utility. This approach would give an assessment of power quality rapidly, by means of representative numbers without overlooking important details. These indices, which are the result of characterisation and extraction from a large volume of power quality data, are easy to assess and representative of the actual impact of the disturbances they characterise. A novel methodology is also given to define discrete disturbance limits based on statistical information collected from large scale power quality surveys performed around the world. Further, Multivariable Linear Regression (MVLR) has been used as a tool to identify hidden patterns and relationships within a large quantity of power quality data in an Australian monitoring campaign. For this, a factor analysis model has been developed using MVLR and complemented with Data Mining techniques; this model reveals the good and bad factors that influence utility power quality. Finally, the power quality data management guidelines and reporting methodologies developed have been applied to representative sites of several Australian utilities, to illustrate their ability to rank sites for power quality improvements and to rank utilities for power quality benchmarking...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Survival {{depends on}} the maintenance, within very narrow limits, of {{physiologic}} variables critical to life, leading to a condition known as homeostasis. Homeostasis is achieved by cascading networks of sophisticated feedback/feedforward control systems that operate in accordance with prescribed reference set-points. In diagnosed populations (such as autistic), these set-points often deviate from those that optimize physiologic perfor-mance. Combined with misinterpretation of sensory information, these deviant set-points act to maintain the body in a perpetual survival mode that derives from the fear response. When this is the case, clinicians prescribe therapy {{in an attempt to}} re-set the reference control quantities to more desirable values through the process of functional adaptation. Recent research and clinical applications have verified that music therapy is one particularly effective clinical intervention that accomplishes this goal. Its effectiveness derives from its ability to function through sub-cortical, non-cognitive pathways that are indigenous to fundamental physiological response mechanisms. The instinct to track music is innate; it parallels and reflects the human condition. Having been invented by humans to express emotion, music speaks the language of the body through its six basic elements: rhythm, melody, harmony, dynamics, timbre, and form. This paper develops a paradigm describing how and why these music elements can be utilized, in combination or individually, as a medical intervention to redirect fear responses and specifically target sensory integration dysfunction. Applied clinically as a <b>continuous</b> <b>disturbance</b> to malfunctioning feedback-control pathways, music therapy can thus succeed in stimulating functional adaptation, driving the physiologic system towards more optimal responses to sensory inputs...|$|E

The cable {{has been used to}} make K 500 superconducting cyclotron magnet coil at Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Kolkata. The superconducting critical current is the most important parameter in the design and operation of magnet. The constant electric field (0. 1 µvolt/cm) criterion is used to define critical current. The critical current is measured in different magnetic fields, which is applied perpendicular to the direction of current. The critical current is measured taking sample from different spools. As the available pieces of cable are not long enough, there would be at least five number of joints in the winding. Joints are made in-house on the coil winding machine by brazing copper substrate and soft soldering the superconductor elements of the cable. The 100 mm lapping length is kept between superconductors in the joint. Joint resistance being a <b>continuous</b> <b>disturbance</b> must also be made minimum as possible.
