40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study of}} a current problem {{in the field of}} audio processing: Source and receiver localization. Currently, this problem requires that either the onset time of the sources or the internal delay of the receivers are known. The algorithms studied here, take advantage {{of the structure of the}} time matrix, which contains the TOA of all the receivers with respect to all the sources, and finds the solution to the locations when the onset times are known. The problem here is then approached from a time difference of arrival (TDOA) perspective, which inherently cancels the onset times by subtracting the time of arrival (TOA) of a source at every receiver. An alternative approach is also proposed, which uses speech <b>signals</b> as <b>calibration</b> <b>signals</b> in order to estimate the onset times. Such an approach is based on an algorithm which uses artificial <b>calibration</b> <b>signals</b> to calculate the onsets. Those signals are known a-priori, which implies that an additional device which produces those signals is needed.

The validation is based on <b>calibration</b> <b>signals</b> and data from a study on event-related potentials. DESCRIPTORS: Time constant. Slow potentials, Digital filtering. We present here a computer algorithm for the modification of the time constant of an EEG amplifier to any desired vaiue. This possibility is of interest in particular for researeh on slow potentials and to a somewhat lesser degree for the sponta-neous EEG: as has been pointed out by Duncan-Johnson and Donchin (1979), {{there is a great}} varia-bility in the time constant used which may lead to spurious differences between studies. Further-more, EEG amplifiers in clinical laboratories often have time constants ranging from 0. 1 to 1. 0 see only, preventing those laboratories from doing re-search on slow potentials, where much higher time constants are needed. Especially with behaviorally disturbed subjects it may even be advantageous to record the EEG with a time constant as low as 0. 1 sec; this can alleviate problems with the dynamic range of the equipment which oceur more fre-quently with higher time constants. Our method applies to single sweeps, averaged potentials, and also to the continuously recorded EEG. It is based on digital filtering using the Fast FourierTransform(FFT) (Cooley&Tukey, 1965).
