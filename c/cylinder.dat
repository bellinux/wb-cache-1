5|$|A <b>cylinder</b> boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving <b>cylinder</b> to protect the paint from {{abrasion}} and impact, to protect the surface the <b>cylinder</b> stands on from impact with the <b>cylinder,</b> {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the <b>cylinder</b> to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the <b>cylinder</b> to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the <b>cylinder,</b> and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the <b>cylinder</b> may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a <b>cylinder</b> boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|A <b>cylinder</b> handle may be fitted, usually clamped to the neck, to {{conveniently}} {{carry the}} <b>cylinder.</b> This can {{also increase the}} risk of snagging in an enclosed environment.|$|E
5|$|A valve failed on a diver’s {{emergency}} <b>cylinder</b> on {{a diving}} support vessel during {{preparation for a}} dive injuring five divers. The <b>cylinder</b> valve was ejected at 180 bar due to incompatible thread. Pillar valve was M25x2 parallel thread and <b>cylinder</b> was a 3/4″x14 BSP parallel thread.|$|E
5|$|Diving <b>cylinders</b> {{may also}} be {{specified}} by their application, as in bailout <b>cylinders,</b> stage <b>cylinders,</b> deco <b>cylinders,</b> sidemount <b>cylinders,</b> pony <b>cylinders,</b> suit inflation <b>cylinders,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|If the <b>cylinders</b> are small, {{the valve}} chests may be located between the <b>cylinders.</b> For larger <b>cylinders</b> the valve chests are usually {{on top of}} the <b>cylinders</b> but, in early locomotives, they were {{sometimes}} underneath the <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Telescopic <b>cylinders</b> {{are also}} {{referred}} to as telescoping <b>cylinders</b> and multi-stage telescopic <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive <b>cylinder</b> also causes a {{temperature}} rise as the gas inside the <b>cylinder</b> is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty <b>cylinder</b> is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} gas in the <b>cylinder</b> then increases to above ambient as the <b>cylinder</b> fills to the working pressure.|$|E
5|$|Empty {{scuba tanks}} or scuba tanks {{pressurized}} {{at less than}} 200kPa are not restricted as hazardous materials. Scuba cylinders are only allowed in checked baggage or as a carry-on if the <b>cylinder</b> valve is completely disconnected from the <b>cylinder</b> and the <b>cylinder</b> has an open end {{to allow for a}} visual inspection inside.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the <b>cylinder</b> {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the <b>cylinder</b> valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the <b>cylinder.</b> This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each <b>cylinder,</b> and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one <b>cylinder</b> to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other <b>cylinder</b> access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one <b>cylinder</b> to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the <b>cylinder</b> neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other <b>cylinder</b> causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one <b>cylinder.</b> This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E
2500|$|Early steam {{locomotives}} had two <b>cylinders,</b> one either side, {{and this}} practice persisted as the simplest arrangement. The <b>cylinders</b> could be mounted between the main frames (known as [...] "inside" [...] <b>cylinders),</b> or mounted outside the frames and driving wheels ("outside" [...] <b>cylinders).</b> Inside <b>cylinders</b> {{are driven by}} cranks built into the driving axle; outside <b>cylinders</b> are driven by cranks on extensions to the driving axles.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} used saturated steam. The high-pressure <b>cylinders</b> had piston valves arranged {{above the}} <b>cylinders,</b> while the low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> had Allen Richardson balanced slide valves, also arranged above the <b>cylinders</b> and all actuated by Walschaerts valve gear. Copper steam pipes were arranged {{on each side}} of the dome and passed vertically down outside the boiler to the steam chests of the high-pressure <b>cylinders.</b> The exhaust from the high-pressure <b>cylinders</b> passed through a receiver pipe along the centre of the engine to the low-pressure <b>cylinders.</b> The exhaust from the low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> passed to the smokebox and blast pipe through a pipe fitted with flexible connections.|$|R
50|$|The Archive {{currently}} holds {{only the}} <b>cylinders</b> {{in the collection}} of the UCSB Libraries. Other libraries, including the Library of Congress and Bowling Green State University, have contributed <b>cylinders</b> for preservation and digitization, as have private collectors. The Archive accepts donations of <b>cylinders</b> but at present does not add digital files of <b>cylinders</b> from other collections, the one exception being <b>cylinders</b> {{in the collection of}} John Levin.|$|R
5|$|Some {{national}} standards {{require that the}} <b>cylinder</b> valve includes a bursting disk, a pressure relief device that will release the gas before the <b>cylinder</b> fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the <b>cylinder</b> will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in good condition, on a correctly filled <b>cylinder</b> is very low.|$|E
5|$|The {{functional}} diving <b>cylinder</b> {{consists of}} a pressure vessel and a <b>cylinder</b> valve. There are usually one or more optional accessories depending on the specific application.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominal volume}} of gas stored is {{commonly}} quoted as the <b>cylinder</b> {{capacity in the}} USA. It {{is a measure of}} the volume of gas that can be released from the full <b>cylinder</b> at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include 'free gas volume' or 'free gas equivalent'. It depends on the internal volume and the working pressure of a <b>cylinder.</b> If the working pressure is higher, the <b>cylinder</b> will store more gas for the same volume.|$|E
40|$|We numerically studied flow-induced {{vibrations}} of two tandem <b>cylinders</b> in trans-verse direction {{between two}} parallel walls. The {{effect of the}} horizontal separation between two <b>cylinders,</b> ranging from 1. 1 to 10, on the motions of the <b>cylinders</b> and the flow structures were investigated {{and a variety of}} periodic and non-periodic vi-bration regimes were observed. The results show that when two <b>cylinders</b> are placed in close proximity to each other, compared with the case of an isolated cy-linder, the gap flow plays an important role. As the separation ratio is increased, the fluid-structure interaction decouples and the <b>cylinders</b> behave as two isolated <b>cylinders.</b> Key words: vortex-induced vibration, two tandem <b>cylinders,</b> channe...|$|R
50|$|Trojan {{also made}} another split-single engine {{later with the}} <b>cylinders</b> {{arranged}} in a 'V' formation. The unusual 'V6' design had two split-single sets of <b>cylinders</b> (4 <b>cylinders</b> total) on one bank of the V and two scavenge blower <b>cylinders</b> on the other bank of the V.|$|R
50|$|As per the F30 3 Series range, the F32/F33/F36 {{is powered}} by {{turbocharged}} petrol and diesel engines with 3 <b>cylinders</b> (petrol only), 4 <b>cylinders</b> and 6 <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>cylinder</b> valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} {{pressure}} vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. <b>Cylinder</b> valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the <b>cylinder</b> to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the <b>cylinder</b> getting into the gas passages when the <b>cylinder</b> is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoulder}} of the <b>cylinder</b> carries stamp markings providing required information about the <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{thickness}} of the <b>cylinder</b> walls {{is directly related to}} the working pressure, and this affects the buoyancy characteristics of the <b>cylinder.</b> A low-pressure <b>cylinder</b> will be more buoyant than a high-pressure <b>cylinder</b> with similar size and proportions of length to diameter and in the same alloy.|$|E
40|$|A {{centrifugal}} compressor is described which includes {{at least one}} pair of <b>cylinders</b> arranged in coaxial alignment and supported for angular displacement about a common axis of rotation normally disecting a common longitudinal axis of symmetry for the <b>cylinders.</b> The <b>cylinders</b> are characterized by ported closures located at the mutually remote ends thereof through which the <b>cylinders</b> are charged and discharged, {{and a pair of}} piston heads seated within the <b>cylinders</b> and supported for floating displacement in compressive strokes in response to unidirectional angular displacement imparted to the <b>cylinders...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{carrying}} axle {{was in the}} form of an Adams axle. The rear <b>cylinders</b> were the high-pressure <b>cylinders,</b> which drew all of their steam directly from the centrally located steam dome. The front <b>cylinders</b> were fed with the exhaust steam of the high-pressure <b>cylinders.</b> Steam was supplied to the <b>cylinders</b> by fixed pipes, the ball joint of which was located in the pivot. The exhaust steam was led to the blast pipe via an articulated exhaust pipe fitted with stuffing boxes. To start the locomotive, the low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> could be supplied with low-pressure steam.|$|R
50|$|The rear <b>cylinders</b> of the G 2/3+2/2 {{class were}} the {{high-pressure}} <b>cylinders,</b> which drew {{all of their}} steam directly from the centrally located steam dome. The front <b>cylinders</b> were fed with the exhaust steam of the high-pressure <b>cylinders.</b> Steam was supplied to the <b>cylinders</b> by fixed pipes, the ball joint of which was located in the pivot. The exhaust steam was led to the blast pipe via an articulated exhaust pipe fitted with stuffing boxes. To start the locomotive, the low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> could be supplied with low-pressure steam.|$|R
5|$|A {{hydrostatic}} test involves pressurising the <b>cylinder</b> to its test pressure (usually 5/3 or 3/2 {{of the working}} pressure) and measuring its volume {{before and after the}} test. A permanent increase in volume above the tolerated level means the <b>cylinder</b> fails the test and must be permanently removed from service.|$|E
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized <b>cylinder</b> as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching <b>cylinder</b> (it can come quite close to the other <b>cylinder).</b> If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the <b>cylinder</b> which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching <b>cylinder</b> (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E
5|$|A valve ejected due to {{incompatible}} thread (metric valve in imperial <b>cylinder)</b> injured commercial diver by {{impact on}} the back of the helmet during preparations for a dive. <b>Cylinder</b> had been under pressure for several days following hydrostatic testing, and no particular triggering event was identified. Diver was knocked down and bruised but protected from serious injury by the helmet.|$|E
50|$|For {{accuracy}} {{the volume}} on graduated <b>cylinders</b> is depicted on scales with 3 significant digits: 100mL <b>cylinders</b> have 1ml grading divisions while 10mL <b>cylinders</b> have 0.1 mL grading divisions.|$|R
50|$|Plunkett further relates {{that the}} <b>cylinders</b> of TFE being used {{contained}} about 1 kg each (2.2 pounds) {{which would be}} relatively small, lecture bottle sized <b>cylinders,</b> not large <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
40|$|As is {{theoretically}} {{indicated by}} Maniar & Newman (1997), waves incident {{to a long}} array of equally-spaced vertical <b>cylinders</b> can be trapped among the <b>cylinders</b> and extreme water-surface elevations among the <b>cylinders</b> or very large hydrodynamic forces on the <b>cylinders</b> can be induced. However, actual water-surface elevations or hydordynamic forces cause...|$|R
5|$|After {{the tests}} have been satisfactorily completed, a <b>cylinder</b> passing the test will be marked accordingly. Stamp marking {{will include the}} {{registered}} mark of the inspection facility and the date of testing (month and year). Records of a periodic inspection and test are made by the test station and kept available for inspection. These include: If a <b>cylinder</b> fails inspection or testing and cannot be recovered, the owner must be notified before making the empty <b>cylinder</b> unserviceable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cylinder</b> colour is Golden yellow with a French grey shoulder.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cylinder</b> threads {{may be in}} {{two basic}} configurations: Taper thread and {{parallel}} thread. These thread specifications are detailed in a previous section. The valve thread specification must exactly match the neck thread specification of the <b>cylinder.</b> Improperly matched neck threads can fail under pressure and can have fatal consequences.|$|E
40|$|We prove three {{fundamental}} {{properties of}} counting holomorphic <b>cylinders</b> in log Calabi-Yau surfaces: positivity, integrality and the gluing formula. Positivity and integrality {{assert that the}} numbers of <b>cylinders,</b> defined via virtual techniques, are in fact nonnegative integers. The gluing formula roughly says that <b>cylinders</b> can be glued together to form longer <b>cylinders,</b> {{and the number of}} longer <b>cylinders</b> equals the product of the numbers of shorter <b>cylinders.</b> Our approach uses Berkovich geometry, tropical geometry, deformation theory and the ideas in the proof of associativity relations of Gromov-Witten invariants by Maxim Kontsevich. These three properties provide an evidence for a conjectural relation between counting <b>cylinders</b> and the broken lines of Gross-Hacking-Keel. Comment: Improved presentatio...|$|R
