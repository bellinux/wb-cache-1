5|$|<b>Cattle</b> <b>raising</b> was {{the major}} {{industry}} in the 1840s with sheep becoming predominant in the 1860s. At this time many Victorians settled in the Riverina to breed sheep and cattle to feed the miners {{taking part in the}} Victorian Gold Rush. The herds were considered inferior at first, but these pastures were good for stock, and the land which seemed a desert was actually good fattening country.|$|E
5|$|All the inhabitants, {{including}} {{the young and}} elderly, were subject to a schedule of alternating work, religious practice, and rest. According to d'Orbigny, {{the inhabitants of the}} Chiquitos missions enjoyed considerably more freedom than those in the Mojos missions. There was also less time spent practicing religion. The catechumens were instructed by the Jesuits in various arts. They learned very quickly and soon became proficient carpenters, painters, weavers, sculptors and artisans. Each settlement had its own set of craftsmen; as a result, in addition to the caciques, a new social class of craftsmen and artisans emerged. This group {{and the rest of the}} population, who worked primarily in agriculture or <b>cattle</b> <b>raising,</b> were each represented by two alcaldes. Initially the main commercial products included honey, yerba maté, salt, tamarind, cotton, shoes, and leather. Later, artisans exported musical instruments, liturgical items, rosaries, and silverware.|$|E

25|$|Amazonian {{colonization}} {{was dominated}} by <b>cattle</b> <b>raising,</b> {{not only because it}} was possible to grow grass in the poor soil, but also because ranching required little labor, generated decent profits, and awarded social status in the community. However, the results of farming have led to extensive deforestation and have caused extensive environmental damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} Governor Don Mariano Tobias, on September 15, 1771, brought {{agricultural}} reforms, including making land {{available to the}} islanders for cultivation, encouraged the development of <b>cattle</b> <b>raising,</b> imported deer and water buffalo from Manila, donkeys and mules from Acapulco, established cotton mills and salt pans, free public schools, and the first Guam militia. Later, he was transferred to Manila in June 1774.|$|E
25|$|Zacatecas’s economy used to {{be almost}} {{completely}} centered on mining but has since diversified into <b>cattle</b> <b>raising,</b> agriculture, communications, food processing, tourism and transportation. Zacatecas is Mexico’s main producer of beans, chili peppers, guavas and nopal, along with significant grain, sugar cane, grape and peach crops. It is also a major producer of rum, pulque and mezcal and even produces red wine. These activities account for just over {{ten percent of the}} state’s GDP.|$|E

25|$|In {{areas where}} {{agriculture}} is more intense and developed, {{there are serious}} problems of soil erosion, siltation and sedimentation of streams and rivers, and pollution with pesticides. In parts of the savannas, where irrigated soybean production expanded in the 1980s, the water table has been affected. Expansion of pastures for <b>cattle</b> <b>raising</b> has reduced natural biodiversity in the savannas. Swine effluents constitute a serious environmental problem in Santa Catarina in the South.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the colonial}} period, Honduras' economy was based largely on mining, <b>cattle</b> <b>raising</b> and the export of {{tropical}} hardwoods. Unlike most of its neighbors, Honduras did not develop a significant coffee industry, and one of the results of this was that much of its export wealth ended up being generated by foreign firms, often creating little local capital. For much of the nineteenth century, Hondurans looked to mining as a means of improving their economic position.|$|E
25|$|Castor {{was born}} in 1926 to a family who was very {{involved}} in the jogo do bicho. His grandmother Iaiá was already known as a jogo do bicho lottery operator. His father, Eusébio de Andrade e Silva, invested in <b>cattle</b> <b>raising</b> and founded a transport company. Castor had a carefree infancy. He studied in the traditional school Colégio Pedro II, but frequently skipped classes {{to go to the}} beaches of the neighborhood of Flamengo. This, however, did not prevent him from graduating in law.|$|E

25|$|The Isleños, {{who were}} mostly farmers, {{harvested}} sugar cane and cut cypress trees. Although {{the area was}} settled by people from five of the Canary Islands (mostly by people from Tenerife (45%) and Gran Canaria (40%) {{and to a lesser}} extent by people from Lanzarote, La Palma and Gomera), it was the people of Tenerife who brought cattle to Saint Bernard. The traditional knowledge these rancher immigrants had of <b>cattle</b> <b>raising</b> was valued, and ranchers from Louisiana and eastern Texas sometimes brought herds to St. Bernard to be domesticated by the Canarians living there.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{evidence}} shows that over time Nilotic speakers, such as the Dinka, Shilluk, and Luo, took over. These groups spread from the Sudd marshlands, where archaeological {{evidence shows}} that a culture based on transhumant <b>cattle</b> <b>raising</b> had been present since 3000 BCE, and the Nilotic culture in that area may thus be continuous to that date. Archaeological evidence {{as well as the}} physical evidence in the livlihood of the Nilotes including their dome-shaped houses and tukuls shows that they may have made an enormous contribution to the governance and wealth of the Nubia Kingdom before and during the 25th Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|By {{the sixteenth}} century the most {{powerful}} group among the Nilotic speakers were Shilluk, who spread east to {{the banks of the}} white Nile under the legendary leadership of Nyikang, who is said to have ruled the Shilluk c.1490 to c.1517. The Shilluk gained control of {{the west bank of the}} river as far north as Kosti in Sudan. There they established an economy based on <b>cattle</b> <b>raising,</b> cereal farming, and fishing, with small villages located along the length of the river. The Shilluk developed an intensive system of agriculture, and the Shilluk lands in the 17th century had a population density similar to that of the Egyptian Nile lands.|$|E

25|$|Up {{to around}} 1500 the Sami were mainly {{fishermen}} and trappers, {{usually in a}} combination, leading a nomadic lifestyle decided by the migrations of the reindeer. Around 1500, due to excessive hunting, again provoked {{by the fact that}} the Sami had to pay taxes to Norway, Sweden and Russia, the number of reindeer started to decrease. Most Sami then settled along the fjords, on the coast and along the inland waterways to pursue a combination of <b>cattle</b> <b>raising,</b> trapping and fishing. A small minority of the Sami then started to tame the reindeer, becoming the well-known reindeer nomads, who, although often portrayed by outsiders as following the archetypical Sami lifestyle, only represent around 10% of the Sami people.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Spanish colonists {{on the shores of}} the Río de la Plata and the {{foundation}} of the city of Buenos Aires during the 16th century led directly to the first confrontations between the Spanish and the local Indian tribes, mainly the Querandí (also called the Pampas). The Spanish had purchased the Buenos Aires hinterland from the local Indians to be used for <b>cattle</b> <b>raising.</b> This use displaced most of the animals traditionally hunted by the natives. The Indians responded by attacking the towns, killing settlers and releasing or driving off many cattle and horses from the farms. In retaliation, the Spanish colonists built forts and defended themselves from the frequent attacks.|$|E
25|$|Western China, {{comprising}} Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, {{has little}} agricultural significance except for areas of floriculture and <b>cattle</b> <b>raising.</b> Rice, China's most important crop, is {{dominant in the}} southern provinces {{and many of the}} farms here yield two harvests a year. In the north, wheat is of the greatest importance, while in central China wheat and rice vie with each other for the top place. Millet and kaoliang (a variety of grain sorghum) are grown mainly in the northeast and some central provinces, which, together with some northern areas, also provide considerable quantities of barley. Most of the soybean crop is derived from the north and the northeast; corn (maize) is grown in the center and the north, while tea comes mainly from the warm and humid hilly areas of the south. Cotton is grown extensively in the central provinces, but it is also found to a lesser extent in the southeast and in the north. Tobacco comes from the center and parts of the south. Other important crops are potatoes, sugar beets, and oilseeds.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cattle</b> <b>raised</b> in the Ghibe {{valley of}} {{southwest}} Ethiopia {{are exposed to}} medium {{to high levels of}} trypanosomiasis risk and are often given trypanocidal drugs. A benefit-cost analysis was undertaken to evaluate the financial and economic returns generated by <b>cattle</b> <b>raised</b> in the area under a systematic regime of drug therapy. The results show that, despite the high level of trypanosomiasis risk and the prevalence of drug-resistant trypanosomes, cattle production can generate attractive economic returns for herd owners and the overall Ethiopian economy. Sensitivity analyses show that most herd owners would continue to obtain good returns on their investments even if they paid higher prices for trypanocidal drugs and the full costs of veterinary services...|$|R

25|$|The Rigveda {{offers no}} direct {{evidence}} of social or {{political system in}} Vedic era, whether ordinary or elite. Only hints such as <b>cattle</b> <b>raising</b> and horse racing are discernible, and the text offers very general ideas about the ancient Indian society. There is no evidence, state Jamison and Brereton, of any elaborate, pervasive or structured caste system. Social stratification seems embryonic, then and later a social ideal rather than a social reality. The society was pastoral with evidence of agriculture since hymns mention plow and celebrate agricultural divinities. There was division of labor, and complementary relationship between kings and poet-priests but no discussion of relative status of social classes. Women in Rigveda appear disproportionately as speakers in dialogue hymns, both as mythical or divine Indrani, Apsaras Urvasi, or Yami, as well as Apāla Ātreyī (RV 8.91), Godhā (RV 10.134.6), Ghoṣā Kākṣīvatī (RV 10.39.40), Romaśā (RV 1.126.7), Lopāmudrā (RV 1.179.1-2), Viśvavārā Ātreyī (RV 5.28), Śacī Paulomī (RV 10.159), Śaśvatī Āṅgirasī (RV 8.1.34). The women of Rigveda are quite outspoken and appear more sexually confident than men, in the text. Elaborate and esthetic hymns on wedding suggest rites of passage had developed during the Rigvedic period. There is little evidence of dowry and no evidence of sati in it or related Vedic texts.|$|E
500|$|Game {{had begun}} to become scarce in the region east of the Mississippi River. This could have been from over-hunting, or the game could have been driven westward as the colonial {{population}} increased. Fortunately, Irish and Scottish immigrants had been importing cattle into the American colonies during {{the early part of}} the 18th century. Consequently, when game was becoming scarce and mutton had a [...] placed upon it, cattle were available to take their place as a protein source. This change increased farmers' profit from animal husbandry. <b>Cattle</b> <b>raising</b> had begun on a small scale during the French-Indian War, but when the American Revolution came, farmers were able to increase their cattle holdings and increase the presence of beef in the American diet. In addition to beef production, the cattle also increased the production of milk and dairy products like butter. This may have contributed to the preference for butter over pork fat, especially in the northern colonies.|$|E
500|$|After 5000 BCE new {{waves of}} {{immigrants}} {{arrived from the}} south again, which accelerated the process of differentiation of the agrarian society into several distinct cultures {{during the first half}} of 5th millennium BC and afterwards. In the Oder River basin mostly there was the culture named after the punctured variety of Linear Band pottery - Stroked Pottery culture, while in the Vistula River basin the Lengyel and Polgár cultures appeared. The two regions developed in some separation, but within them the different cultural traditions of the younger Danubian circle often overlapped. The houses were now of an elongated trapezoidal shape, up to 40 meters long, grouped in larger complexes, often protected by beam and earth walls, moats and other fortifications, as such defensive measures apparently became necessary against people from the still Mesolithic native population or other Danubian settlements. These defensive structures, built from the mid 5th millennium BCE on, were complicated and consumed significant time and resources. Their design followed that of the similar construction that was taking place in the Danube River areas, starting in the early part of this millennium. Large cemeteries and graves supplied with fancier objects such as jewelry, including the first so-called [...] "princely" [...] graves (the princesses had imported copper necklaces, earrings and diadems in addition to locally made decorations), testify to the emergence of a relatively more affluent society. <b>Cattle</b> <b>raising</b> and trading (large varieties resulted from cross-breeding with the aurochs) and land tillage provided basic sustenance. Salt was obtained and traded and became a much sought after commodity, at first probably to help preserve stored food. The salt springs around Wieliczka were utilized already by the Lengyel culture people, who left ceramic vessels used in salt production there. The Danubian people produced many richly decorated objects, including clay containers with animal head ornaments and figurines of women.|$|E
