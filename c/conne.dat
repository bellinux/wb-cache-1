The system produced scattered precipitation across North Carolina, generally between 13inches (2575mm). On July 16, Arthur passed north of Bermuda, where it brought gusty winds and 0.57inches (14.5mm) of rainfall. As an extratropical storm, Arthur produced gusty winds and dropped about 1inch (25mm) of rainfall in Newfoundland. Strong waves capsized a {{boat in the}} <b>Conne</b> River, killing one person.|$|E

40|$|We present {{definitions}} of both <b>Connes</b> spectrum and strong <b>Connes</b> spectrum for actions of compact quantum groups on C*-algebras and obtain necessary and sufficient {{conditions for a}} crossed product to be a prime or a simple C*-algebra. Our results extend {{to the case of}} compact quantum actions the results in [8] which in turn, generalize results by <b>Connes,</b> Olesen and Pedersen and Kishimoto for abelian group actions. We prove in addition that the <b>Connes</b> spectra are closed under tensor products. These results are new for compact nonabelian groups as well. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
2500|$|Animism {{entails the}} belief that [...] "all living things have a soul", and thus a central concern of animist thought {{surrounds}} how animals can be eaten or otherwise used for humans' subsistence needs. The actions of non-human animals are viewed as [...] "intentional, planned and purposive", and they are understood to be persons because they are both alive and communicate with others. In animist world-views, non-human animals are understood to participate in kinship systems and ceremonies with humans, as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies. Harvey cited {{an example of an}} animist understanding of animal behaviour that occurred at a powwow held by the <b>Conne</b> River Mi'kmaq in 1996; an eagle flew over the proceedings, circling over the central drum group. The assembled participants called out kitpu ("eagle"), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle's actions reflected its approval of the event and the Mi'kmaq's return to traditional spiritual practices.|$|E
2500|$|A 2015 {{documentary}} by Al Jazeera English {{asserted that}} up to 10% of New Caledonia's population is descended from around 2,000 Arab-Berber people deported from French Algeria in the late 19th century to prisons on the island in reprisal for the [...] in 1871. After serving their sentences, they were released and given land to own and cultivate as part of colonisation efforts on the island. As {{the overwhelming majority of}} the Algerians imprisoned on New Caledonia were men, the community was continued through intermarriage with women of other ethnic groups, mainly French women from nearby women's prisons. Despite facing both assimilation into the Euro-French population and discrimination for their ethnic background, descendants of the deportees have succeeded in preserving a common identity as Algerians, including maintaining certain cultural practices (such as Arabic names) and Islamic religion. They commonly travel to Algeria as a rite of passage, though obtaining Algerian citizenship is often a difficult process. The largest population of Algerian-Caledonians lives in the commune of Bourail (particularly in the [...] district, where there is an Islamic cultural centre and [...] ), with smaller communities in Nouméa, <b>Conné,</b> Blambut, and Surianté.|$|E
6000|$|Dorothea by {{this time}} had looked deep into the ungauged {{reservoir}} of Mr. Casaubon's mind, seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine extension every quality she herself brought; had opened much of her own experience to him, and had understood from him the scope of his great work, also of attractively labyrinthine extent. For he had been as instructive as Milton's [...] "affable archangel;" [...] and with something of the archangelic manner he told her how he had undertaken to show (what indeed had been attempted before, but not with that thoroughness, justice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr. Casaubon aimed) that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical fragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally revealed. Having once mastered the true position and taken a firm footing there, the vast field of mythical constructions became intelligible, nay, luminous with the reflected light of correspondences. But to gather in this great harvest of truth was no light or speedy work. His notes already made a formidable range of volumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous still-accumulating results and bring them, like the earlier vintage of Hippocratic books, to fit a little shelf. In explaining this to Dorothea, Mr. Casaubon expressed himself nearly {{as he would have}} done to a fellow-student, for he had not two styles of talking at command: it is true that when he used a Greek or Latin phrase he always gave the English with scrupulous care, but he would probably have done this in any case.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new notion of biprojectivity, called WAP-biprojective for F(A), the enveloping dual Banach algebra associated to a Banach algebra A.

We prove that for a locally compact group G, F(L^ 1 (G)) is WAP-biprojective {{if and only if}} G is amenable. Also for an infinite commutative compact group G, we show that the convolution Banach algebra F(L^ 2 (G)) is not WAP-biprojective. Finally, we provide some examples of the enveloping dual Banach algebras associated to the certain Banach algebras and we study its WAP-biprojectivity and <b>Connes</b> amenability...|$|R
