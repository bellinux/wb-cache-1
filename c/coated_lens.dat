50|$|The young lens {{designer}} Ludwig Bertele, {{formerly of}} Ernemann, {{was charged with}} the responsibility of designing the lenses.The greatest advantage of the Zeiss lenses was the reduced number of air-to-glass surfaces in Bertele's designs. In the years before <b>lens</b> <b>coating</b> was generally practiced, this had advantages for contrast and resistance to lens flare. Zeiss also pioneered glass coating, and before the war <b>coated</b> <b>lenses</b> were offered.

50|$|Lenses did {{not need}} a great depth of field, but had to be capable both of {{producing}} a very sharp image with high resolution of a flat surface and of doing so at high speed.

40|$|Reflections from lens {{surfaces}} create parasitic beams {{that can}} damage optics in high-powered laser systems. These parasitic beams {{are low in}} energy initially, because of the low reflectivity of antireflection (AR) <b>coated</b> <b>lens</b> surfaces {{and because they are}} clipped by spatial filter pinholes, but subsequent amplification can raise them to damage fluence levels. Also, some of the pencil beams in multipass laser systems become pre-pulses at the output by by-pass one of more of the passes, arriving at the output ahead of the main pulse in time. They are insidious because pencil beams that are not initially a problem can become so due to a slow degradation of the AR coatings. Both the Nova and Beamlet laser systems at LLNL have had optics damaged by pencil beams. The best solution for pencil beams is to tip the lenses far enough to eliminate them altogether. This will be the approach taken for the National Ignition Facility (NIF) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{terahertz}} (THz) {{frequency range}} (f= 0. 3 - 10 THz, [lambda]= 30 - 1000 lam) {{is much less}} technologically developed that the adjacent microwave and infrared frequency ranges, but offers several advantages for imaging applications: THz wavelengths offer better spatial resolutions than microwave frequencies, and THz radiation is able to penetrate materials that are opaque at infrared frequencies (e. g. packaging, plastics, paints and semiconductors). These features, combined with the unique THz spectral signatures of chemicals have {{lead to the development}} of terahertz imaging systems for non-destructive test. However, the weak radiation sources in these existing systems result in single pixel scanning architectures requiring minutes to acquire images or enhanced speed at the expense of signal to noise ratio (SNR). In this thesis, a system for real-time imaging is demonstrated using recently developed terahertz quantum-cascade laser (QCL) sources, along with commercial, focal plane array thermal detectors. The system uses a high power (48 mW) 4. 3 -THz QCL, which is also used to characterize the focal plane array, resulting in a noise equivalent power (NEP) of 320 pW/Hz. The source and detector are used in a synchronous detection scheme, resulting in an SNR of ~ 25 dB/pixel at a 20 -Hz frame rate. This represents a two order of magnitude improvement in speed over previous systems at comparable SNRs. Real-time imaging over a 25 -m distance is described, using a QCL adjusted for emission in the narrow 4. 9 THz atmospheric transmission window. (cont.) The challenges posed by the long THz wavelengths in QCL waveguide design leads to a tradeoff between high temperature operation (< 186 K) and high power/good beam patterns (248 mW peak, l 2 deg FWHM). To mitigate these tradeoffs, a technique for buttcoupling a metal-metal waveguide QCL to an index matched lens is developed. The resulting device achieves the highest reported power for a MM waveguide (145 mW peak) and while retaining a high operating temperature (160 K) and achieving a narrow beam pattern (< 5 deg). The lens coupling technique is also used to add spectroscopic capability to the system, through the development of an external cavity QCL. The butt-coupling of an antireflection <b>coated</b> <b>lens</b> to a semi-insulating surface plasmon waveguide QCL results in increased optical losses and suppression of lasing. Lasing is recovered using an external optical system with a reflective grating for frequency selective feedback. A device is characterized showing 4 % tuning range at ~ 4. 4 THz, and is among the first demonstrations of tunable THz QLCs. by Alan Wei Min Lee. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Background: Wearing {{spectacles}} is {{the most}} common approach in correcting the refractive errors worldwide. Due to harmful effects of overexposure to solar ultraviolet radiations, the usage of multi-layer coatings in ophthalmic lenses has recently been increased. These lenses can reduce the reflections and hence increase the transmission of visible light; they can also decrease the transmission of ultraviolet rays. This study aims to compare the transmission of ultraviolet (A and B) and visible rays through coated and uncoated prescriptive ophthalmic plastic lenses. M aterials and Methods: In this study, 39 minus non-photochromic multi-coated white plastic single-vision lenses; 9 similar lenses but without any coatings were assessed by spectral transmittancemeter for evaluation of the transmission of visible and ultraviolet rays. R es ults: The transmission of visible light was 97. 9 %± 1. 07 % for <b>coated</b> <b>lenses</b> and 93. 5 %± 0. 54 % for <b>lenses</b> without <b>coating.</b> Ultraviolet-A transmission was 12. 15 %± 8. 02 % for <b>coated</b> <b>lenses</b> compared to 66. 27 %± 23. 92 % in <b>lenses</b> without <b>coating.</b> The transmission of ultraviolet-B rays was 1. 21 %± 0. 4 % and 23. 0 %± 15. 97 % for lenses with and without coatings, respectively. C onclusion: The transmission of visible light was significantly higher in multi-coated lenses compared to uncoated samples; whereas the transmissions of ultraviolet rays in multi-coated lenses were significantly lower than uncoated ones. Therefore, it is recommended that, except for particular cases, prescribed lenses be equipped with this multi-layer coating. </p...|$|R

The aim of {{the study}} is to {{determine}} the adhesion of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria onto conventional hydrogel (CH) and silicone hydrogel (SH) contact lens materials with and without lysozyme, lactoferrin, and albumin <b>coating.</b> Methods. Four <b>lens</b> types (three SH-balafilcon A, lotrafilcon B, and senofilcon A; one CH-etafilcon A) were coated with lysozyme, lactoferrin, or albumin (uncoated lenses acted as controls) and then incubated in Staphylococcus aureus (Saur 31) or either of two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Paer 6294 and 6206) for 24 h at 37 °C. The total counts of the adhered bacteria were determined using the H-thymidine method and viable counts by counting the number of colony-forming units on agar media. Results. All three strains adhered significantly lower to uncoated etafilcon A lenses compared with uncoated SH lenses (p 0. 05). Lactoferrin <b>coating</b> on <b>lenses</b> increased binding (total and viable counts) of Saur 31 (p < 0. 05).

The cameras went through a few minor modifications to become the Kiev III and eventually Kiev 4. There was also a Kiev 5 with a modernized upper part with integrated meter.
