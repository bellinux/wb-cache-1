5|$|Captain America {{was put on}} hold {{during the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. However, in January 2008, Marvel Entertainment reached an interim <b>comprehensive</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Writers Guild of America that would put writers {{immediately}} back to work on various projects that were under the company's development. On May 5, 2008 (after the success of Iron Man), Marvel announced the film The First Avenger: Captain America (the working title) for release in May 6, 2011 (before being pushed back to July 22). Louis Leterrier, director of The Incredible Hulk, viewed some of the concept art being created for the film and was impressed enough to offer his services, but Marvel turned him down. Johnston finally signed on in November 2008, and he hired Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely to rewrite. Feige cited Johnston's directorial work on October Sky and The Rocketeer and his special effects work on the original Star Wars trilogy {{to explain why he}} was an appropriate choice. Raiders of the Lost Ark was an influence on the film, because they hoped the film would not feel like a period piece.|$|E

25|$|The {{agreement}} gave ERC {{the authority}} to impose tolling on the roadway in order to recoup the private parties the money they put into the project. Initially, ERC estimated the toll rate to be between $2–3 (for cars), however the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Agreement</b> scheduled the tolls to begin at rates of $1.59/non-peak hours and $1.84/peak for cars and $4.77/non-peak and $7.34/peak for heavy vehicles after the infusion of VDOT and FHWA money and the extra eight years added to the concession. However, after public outcry at the rates, the incoming governor, Terry McAuliffe announced a further, $82.5 million buydown of the tolls through {{the completion of the}} construction. This buydown reduced tolls to 75-cents/off peak and $1.00/peak for the light vehicles, and $2.25 during non-peak or $4.00 during peak hours for heavy vehicles. Under Gov. McAuliffe's plan, toll rates would increase by 25-cents each year until January 2017 or until the new Midtown Tunnel is completed, at which point they would return to the rates set in the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|E

Venizelos even forwarded Atatürk's name for the 1934 Nobel Peace Prize, Even after his fall from power, Greco-Turkish relations remained cordial. Indeed, Venizelos' successor Panagis Tsaldaris came to visit Atatürk in September 1933 and signed a more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>agreement</b> called the Entente Cordiale between Greece and Turkey, which was a stepping stone for the Balkan Pact.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Union and the United States {{had first}} reached an {{agreement}} on a strategic arms limitation in May 1972 (SALT I) which limited the number of ballistic missiles that each nation could deploy to 2,360 for the Soviets and 1,710 for the Americans. The agreement was not comprehensive, however, as it did not restrict the number of heavy bombers or missiles equipped with multiple warheads (MIRVs) for either country, which by 1974 worked {{to the advantage of}} the United States. Because SALT I was due to expire in October 1977, both the Soviet Union and the United States were interested in reaching a more permanent and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>agreement,</b> but initial efforts made by President Richard Nixon and Gromyko were not successful.|$|E
25|$|After {{the lengthy}} review process {{required}} under the PPTA, then-Governor Bob McDonnell and VDOT executed the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Agreement</b> with ERC on December 5, 2011.

Funding is expected from tolls, private equity, contributions from the Commonwealth and a low-interest Federal Highway Administration loan. ERC is responsible for paying back all debt on the project, as well as assumes the entire risk of a decrease in toll revenue if traffic counts do not meet projections. However, if traffic exceeds projections and increases revenue, VDOT will receive {{a portion of the}} excess revenue, after all other costs and debt service has been paid for the period.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{assuming}} {{the presidency in}} January 1961, John F. Kennedy was committed to pursuing a comprehensive test ban and ordered {{a review of the}} American negotiating position in an effort to accelerate languishing talks, believing Eisenhower's approach to have been [...] "insufficient." [...] In making his case for a test ban, Kennedy drew a direct link between continued testing and nuclear proliferation, calling it the [...] "'Nth-country' problem." [...] While a candidate, Kennedy had argued, [...] "For once China, or France, or Sweden, or half a dozen other nations successfully test an atomic bomb, the security of both Russians and Americans is dangerously weakened." [...] He had also claimed that renewed testing would be [...] "damaging to the American image" [...] and might threaten the [...] "existence of human life." [...] On the campaign trail, Kennedy's test-ban proposal consisted of a continued US testing moratorium, expanded efforts to reach a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>agreement,</b> limit any future tests to those minimizing fallout, and expand research on fallout. Notably, early in his term, Kennedy also presided over a significant increase in defense spending, which was reciprocated by the Soviet Union shortly thereafter, thus placing the test-ban negotiations {{in the context of an}} accelerating arms race.|$|E

[...] As chair, McCain has tried to maintain a bipartisan approach and has forged a good relationship with ranking member Jack Reed. [...] In April 2015, McCain announced that he would run for a sixth term in Arizona's 2016 Senate election. [...] While there was still conservative and Tea Party anger at him, it was unclear if they would mount an effective primary challenge against him. During 2015, McCain strongly opposed the proposed <b>comprehensive</b> <b>agreement</b> on the Iranian nuclear program, saying that Secretary of State Kerry was [...] "delusional" [...] and [...] "giv away the store" [...] in negotiations with Iran. McCain supported the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, saying: “I’m sure civilians die in war.
