Baseball card collecting in 1973 was primarily a childhood activity and invariably abandoned by young adulthood. The authors' stated assumption is that the cards one collected in his youth are all gone, as revealed in the book's closing comments, [...] "We know, your mother, your own mother, threw them away." [...] Instead, the authors present a nostalgic look at the part of their youth that involved collecting, trading, and flipping baseball cards.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [40]- 41) Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) in most electronic {{applications are}} secured to the package chassis with {{some type of}} card-guide device. A typical <b>card</b> <b>guide</b> in commercial electronics is the "locking retainer" type. The evaluation of the structural edge conditions provided by this card-guide type is the topic of this thesis. In particular, {{an evaluation of the}} EG&G Birtcher Series 24 LOK-TAINER® is conducted to determine these characteristics. Finite Element Methods (FEM) are applied to the card-guide structure to determine its translational and torsional spring characteristics. Additional FEM analysis of various PCB and card-guide combinations are performed using the spring characteristics determined above and compared to test frequency measurements of these same combinations. Finally, the FEM and experimental results are compared to FEM results of similar PCBs, but modelled with the commonly assumed simply-supported and fixed-edge conditions. M. S.

40|$|Abstract—Existing risk {{simulations}} {{make the}} assumption that when a free tin whisker has bridged two adjacent exposed elec-trical conductors, {{the result is an}} electrical short circuit. This con-servative assumption is made because shorting is a random event that has a currently unknown probability associated with it. Due to contact resistance, electrical shorts may not occur at lower voltage levels. In this experiment, we study the effect of varying voltage on the breakdown of the contact resistance which leads to a short circuit. From this data, we can estimate the probability of an elec-trical short, as a function of voltage, given that a free tin whisker has bridged two adjacent exposed electrical conductors. In addi-tion, three tin whiskers grown from the same Space Shuttle Orbiter <b>card</b> <b>guide</b> used in the aforementioned experiment were cross sec-tioned and studied using a focused ion beam (FIB).

In this light, teachers are seen as producers of "learning environments " involving real-life environments (a town square, a river basin, a pond etc), by plans for activities to be performed by the students in those environments, and by tools (file <b>cards,</b> <b>guide</b> books etc) to help the students undertake the activities. In the approach discussed in this paper, teachers use the development of a hypermedia system as a means of supporting students' cooperative learning.

50|$|Less {{common is}} the Chalfant movement.

This movement has the advantage that pairs are often moving to a table that was not in use on a previous round, so a slow pair does not delay as many other pairs as in a Howell. Also, for several sizes, this movement is technically superior in that more pairs face all other pairs than in the corresponding Howell movement. This movement has the disadvantage of requiring a larger number of physical tables, and thus more space.
