5|$|Three {{spin-off}} {{versions of}} Jeopardy! have been created. Rock & Roll Jeopardy! debuted on VH1 in 1998 and ran until 2001; the show centered around post-1950s popular music trivia and was hosted by Jeff Probst.

50|$|Basal or basilar <b>crackles</b> (not to be {{confused}} with the basilar artery of the brain) are <b>crackles</b> apparently originating in or near the base of the lung. Bibasal or bibasilar <b>crackles</b> refer to <b>crackles</b> at the bases of both the left and right lungs. Bilateral basal <b>crackles</b> also refers to the presence of basal <b>crackles</b> in both lungs.|$|R

5000|$|Several sources {{will also}} refer to [...] "medium" [...] <b>crackles,</b> as a <b>crackling</b> sound {{that seems to}} fall between the course and fine <b>crackles.</b> <b>Crackles</b> are defined as {{discreet}} sounds that last less than 20 ms, while the continuous sounds (rhonchi and wheezes) last approximately 250 ms. Ronchi is usually caused by a stricture or blockage in the upper airway. Do not confuse with stridor.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crackles</b> {{are caused}} by {{explosive}} opening of small airways and are discontinuous, nonmusical, and brief. <b>Crackles</b> are much more common during the inspiratory than the expiratory phase of breathing, {{but they may be}} heard during the expiratory phase. <b>Crackles</b> are often associated with inflammation or infection of the small bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. <b>Crackles</b> that do not clear after a cough may indicate pulmonary edema or fluid in the alveoli due to heart failure, pulmonary fibrosis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. <b>Crackles</b> that partially clear or change after coughing may indicate bronchiectasis.|$|R
25|$|Hulu {{is unable}} to launch in Canada due to the {{relatively}} small size of Canada's online advertising market and because Canada's television networks already have the exclusive online streaming rights in Canada to several titles offered on Hulu, including many mainstream American television network programs. The absence of Hulu in the Canadian market raised concerns by fans of the sitcom The Mindy Project when it was cancelled by Fox {{in the spring of}} 2015 and subsequently picked up by Hulu; the show's Canadian broadcaster, City, subsequently announced it would continue to air the series in Canada. At present, Canadian consumers have access to several other streaming systems, including a Canadian version of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, CraveTV and <b>Crackle,</b> but with CraveTV streaming some programming from inaccessible-to-Canadian-viewers platforms such as Hulu.|$|E
25|$|Some {{films have}} been colorized by two {{separate}} companies. The first colorized DVD releases, distributed by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, were prepared by West Wing Studios in 2004. The following year, Legend Films colorized {{the public domain}} shorts Malice in the Palace, Sing a Song of Six Pants, Disorder in the Court and Brideless Groom. Disorder in the Court and Brideless Groom also appears on two of West Wing's colorized releases. In any event, the Columbia-produced shorts (aside from the public domain films) are handled by Sony Pictures Entertainment, while the MGM Stooges shorts are owned by Warner Bros. via their Turner Entertainment division. Sony offers 21 of the shorts on their web platform <b>Crackle,</b> along with eleven Minisodes.

25|$|Joubert did {{not plan}} on {{fighting}} at Novi Ligure, but {{the position that}} his troops held was well-suited for a defensive battle. Facing north, the French held an arc of high ground from Serravalle {{on the right to}} Pasturana on the left. In the center, Novi was surrounded by a wall and ditch dating to the Middle Ages. One weakness of the position was that the deep ravines of the Riasco and Braghena streams cut across the rear, obstructing any retreat. Kray had the Allied right wing in movement before dawn with Bellegarde on the right and Ott on the left. Seckendorf on the far right aimed for the place where the Riasco stream emerged from its ravine. The <b>crackle</b> of muskets began at 3:20 am as the Austrian columns bumped into French picket lines. This provoked a great racket in the French camps as their surprised troops rushed into formation. At first light, the Allies saw that the heights were crowned by the blue lines of French infantry. Instead of striking the flank of an enemy army on the move, the Austrians of the right wing were making a frontal attack on a strong position.|$|E
40|$|The inspiratory {{timing of}} lung <b>crackles</b> in {{patients}} with bronchiectasis was compared with the inspiratory timing of the lung <b>crackles</b> in chronic bronchitis and alveolitis. In severe obstructive chronic bronchitis the lung <b>crackles</b> are typically confined to early inspiration while in alveolitis the lung <b>crackles</b> continue {{to the end of}} inspiration but may begin in the early or the mid phase of inspiration. In uncomplicated bronchiectasis on the other hand, the lung <b>crackles</b> typically occur in the early and mid phase of inspiration, are more profuse, and usually fade by the end of inspiration. In addition in bronchiectasis, <b>crackles</b> are also usually present in expiration, they are gravity independent and become less profuse after coughing...|$|R
40|$|Auscultation of Velcro <b>crackles</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a key finding in physical lung examination in patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), especially in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, no studies {{have been carried out}} to assess the association of Velcro <b>crackles</b> with other clinical variables. We evaluated a cohort of 132 patients, prospectively and consecutively included in our ILD diagnostic program at a tertiary referral center. All patients were auscultated during the physical examination. The patients were divided into 2 groups: "presence" or "nonpresence" of bilateral Velcro <b>crackles.</b> Of all patients assessed, 83 (63 %) presented Velcro <b>crackles</b> in the respiratory auscultation. Patients with Velcro <b>crackles</b> usually had more frequently cough and dyspnea at the moment of diagnosis. Forced vital capacity (Pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 002) and lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (Pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 04) was lower in these patients. The ILD-GAP index was higher in the group with Velcro <b>crackles</b> (Pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 01). All patients with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) in high-resolution computed tomography and all patients with final IPF diagnosis presented Velcro <b>crackles.</b> In multivariate analysis, the presence of Velcro <b>crackles</b> was independently associated with an UIP pattern. In patients suspected of having ILD, the auscultation of Velcro <b>crackles</b> was associated with UIP, a possibility which must be taken into consideration in early ILD detection in primary care...|$|R

500|$|An Enta da Stage {{review on}} OhWord.com praises the {{production}} work, stating [...] "Though the album's success is largely attributable to Buckshot's performance, one cannot ignore the phenomenal production from the Beatminerz. They took the already dark sound of The Low End Theory and one-upped it, filtering out almost all treble and using spare, hardcore drum samples. The compositions of Mr. Walt and Evil Dee are also cleverly structured, propelling Buckshot's raps {{directly into the}} listener's psyche."..."The <b>crackle</b> of scratched vinyl pervades the album, contributing to the feel of warmth and timelessness.

500|$|From {{contemporary}} reviews, The Washington Post {{gave the}} album a mixed review, stating that [...] "even by rap standards, [...] work is artless." [...] The review compared the album negatively to other rappers, noting that they [...] "construct complex hip-hop concertos for voice, beat-box and borrowed sounds, Schooly's best-known work {{is little more}} than a beat accompanying his foul-mouthed, ill-tempered rants". The review also found that [...] "there's no denying that his harsh communiquÃ©s <b>crackle</b> with a mean-streets vitality as fascinating as his confrontational world view is disturbing." [...] Robert Christgau gave the Jive reissue of the album a B, stating [...] "What other rapper would write a rhyme about the night his mother pulled a gun on himâ€”or make it so clear that, just like in West Side Story, he's depraved on account of he's deprived. This doesn't speak too well of white critics, obviously, but it also doesn't take away his raps, his rips, or his muscleman groove." [...] Spin stated that it [...] "can't sustain an album with just reverb and a cowbell. Even if it is killer reverb and a way funky cowbell." [...] The NME placed Saturday Night! â€“ The Album at number 20 on their list of the top albums of 1987.

[...] Griet and Vermeer's relationship, Hall wrote, lacked [...] "... the sense of two people breathing easily in one another's company." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, remarked that Girl with a Pearl Earring [...] "... brings off something that few dramas about artists do. It gets you to see the world through newâ€“ which is to say, oldâ€“ eyes." [...] Gleiberman added that while Johansson is silent for most of the film, [...] "... the interplay on her face of fear, ignorance, curiosity, and sex is intensely dramatic." [...] In Sight & Sound, David Jays wrote that [...] "Johansson's marvellous performance builds on the complex innocence of her screen presence (Ghost World, Lost in Translation)." [...] Jays concluded his review by praising Webber and Serra's ability to [...] "... deftly deploy daylight, candle and shadow, denying our desire to see clearly just as Vermeer refuses to explicate the situations in his paintings. The film's scenarios may be unsurprising, but Webber's solemn evocation of art in a grey world gives his story an apt, unspoken gravity." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel {{met with}} [...] "a <b>crackle</b> of {{favorable}} reviews in major papers". The New Republic hailed it as [...] "an exceptional work", both [...] "thoughtful and irrepressibly imaginative". The Houston Chronicle described Clarke as [...] "a superb character writer", and the Denver Post {{called her a}} [...] "superb storyteller". The reviews praised Clarke's [...] "deft" [...] handling of the pastiche of styles, but many criticised the novel's pace, The Guardian complaining that [...] "the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace dawdles". In his review for Science Fiction Weekly, Clute suggested that [...] "almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately trimmed" [...] (emphasis in original) since they do little to advance the story. He argued that, at times, Clarke's Austenesque tone {{gets in the way}} of plot development. On the other hand, The Baltimore Sun found the novel [...] "a quick read". Complaining that the book leaves the reader [...] "longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry", The Washington Post reviewer noted, with others, that [...] "sex plays virtually no role in the story... one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent". The New Statesman reviewer, Amanda Craig, praised the novel as [...] "a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austenâ€“ or, perhaps, by the young Mrs Radcliffe, whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key." [...] However, she also criticised the book: [...] "As fantasy, it is deplorable, given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales. What is so wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than Morgan le Fay is not just their magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born. Far from caring about being gentlemen, wizards are the ultimate expression of rank's irrelevance to talent". However, reviewers were not in universal agreement on any of these points.
