25|$|The newer Stream <b>Control</b> <b>Transmission</b> Protocol (SCTP) {{is also a}} reliable, connection-oriented {{transport}} mechanism. It is message-stream-oriented—not byte-stream-oriented like TCP—and provides multiple streams multiplexed over {{a single}} connection. It also provides multi-homing support, in which a connection end can be represented by multiple IP addresses (representing multiple physical interfaces), such that if one fails, the connection is not interrupted. It was developed initially for telephony applications (to transport SS7 over IP), but {{can also be used}} for other applications.|$|E
25|$|Water purification: All {{water used}} for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, chlorination, ozone water treatment, {{ultraviolet}} light sterilization (e.g., by solar water disinfection), or antimicrobial filtration {{in any area}} where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. Cloth filters or sari filtration, though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in Bangladesh that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and <b>control</b> <b>transmission</b> of cholera and other diseases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Transmission control {{protocol}} veno is a wireless <b>transmission</b> congestion <b>control</b> algorithm which can better distinguish different loss. It determines whether the packets random loss or congestion loss through calculate to the packets number of backlog in the network. However, <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol veno {{does not change}} the congestion window in the slow start, and it is same to the traditional <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol. <b>Transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol adaptive delay and loss response controls the congestion window base on the sender judgments changes in the relevant window and measures round-trip time. It improves the performance of <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol than the conventional <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol on the satellite network <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol. Taking into account the characteristic of both congestion control algorithms respectively, we propose an enhanced <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol that introduces ideas of <b>transmission</b> <b>control</b> protocol veno distinguish between random packet loss and congestion loss. Our scheme can distinguish the different loss and increase the number of congestion window distinctively in the slow start.

This paper deals with electrochromic devices with a <b>controlled</b> <b>transmission.</b> Electrochromic glazings {{can be described}} as devices based on electrochromic materials that operate as reversible switching solar control shutters. These special glasses have found application not only for window glazing in hot climatic conditions but they are also recommended for buildings with large glazed shells where overheating and glare effect represent serious problem for daily service and operation...|$|R
