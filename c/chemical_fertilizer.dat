25|$|As {{political}} stability was gradually restored following the Cultural Revolution {{of the late}} 1960s, a renewed drive for coordinated, balanced development was set in motion {{under the leadership of}} Premier Zhou Enlai. To revive efficiency in industry, Communist Party of China committees were returned to positions of leadership over the revolutionary committees, and a campaign was carried out to return skilled and highly educated personnel to the jobs from which they had been displaced during the Cultural Revolution. Universities began to reopen, and foreign contacts were expanded. Once again the economy suffered from imbalances in the capacities of different industrial sectors and an urgent need for increased supplies of modern inputs for agriculture. In response to these problems, there was a significant increase in investment, including the signing of contracts with foreign firms for the construction of major facilities for <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> production, steel finishing, and oil extraction and refining. The most notable of these contracts was for thirteen of the world's largest and most modern <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> plants. During this period, industrial output grew at an average rate of 8 percent a year.|$|E

25|$|Reefs are chronically {{at risk of}} algal encroachment. Overfishing {{and excess}} {{nutrient}} supply from onshore can enable algae to outcompete and kill the coral. Increased nutrient levels can {{be a result of}} sewage or <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> runoff from nearby coastal developments. Runoff can carry nitrogen and phosphorus which promote excess algae growth. Algae can sometimes out-compete the coral for space. The algae can then smother the coral by decreasing the oxygen supply available to the reef. Decreased oxygen levels can slow down coral's calcification rates weakening the coral and leaving it more susceptible to disease and degradation. In surveys done around largely uninhabited US Pacific islands, algae inhabit a large percentage of surveyed coral locations. The algal population consists of turf algae, coralline algae, and macro algae.|$|E

25|$|Alfalfa can be sown {{in spring}} or fall, and does best on well-drained soils with a neutral pH of 6.8 – 7.5. Alfalfa {{requires}} sustained levels of potassium and phosphorus to grow well. It is moderately sensitive to salt levels {{in both the}} soil and irrigation water, although {{it continues to be}} grown in the arid southwestern United States, where salinity is an emerging issue. Soils low in fertility should be fertilized with manure or a <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> but correction of pH is particularly important. Usually a seeding rate of 13 – 20kg/hectare (12 – 25lb/acre) is recommended, with differences based upon region, soil type, and seeding method. A nurse crop is sometimes used, particularly for spring plantings, to reduce weed problems and soil erosion, but can lead to competition for light, water, and nutrients.|$|E
25|$|The term biosolids {{is used to}} {{differentiate}} treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizer</b> dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge, with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.|$|E
