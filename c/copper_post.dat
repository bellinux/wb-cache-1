The sapphire resonator consists of a sapphire ring separated into two parts with webs on the outer end of each to form two re-entrant parts which are separated by a <b>copper</b> <b>post.</b> The re-entrant parts are bonded to the post by indium solder for good thermal conductivity between parts of that subassembly which is supported on the base plate of a closed copper cylinder (rf shielding casing) by a thin stainless steel cylinder. A unit for temperature control is placed in the stainless steel cylinder and is connected to the subassembly of re-entrant parts and <b>copper</b> <b>post</b> by a layer of indium for good thermal conduction. In normal use, the rf shielding casing is placed in a vacuum tank which is in turn placed in a thermos flask of liquid nitrogen. The temperature regulator is controlled from outside the thermos flask to a temperature in a range of about 40 K to 150 K, such as 87 K for the WGH- 811, mode of resonance in response to microwave energy inserted into the rf shielding casing through a port from an outside source...|$|E

40|$|Compared with {{traditional}} flip chip solder bump, copper pillar (<b>copper</b> <b>post)</b> with greater conductivity could improve reliability, electrical and thermal characteristics. Intel last year announced to fully utilize this innovative double-layer copper pillar {{to replace the}} conventional single-layer bump in dual-core processor. Electroforming featuring higher deposition rate and finer pitch is widely recognized as the best method to form any solder bump. Poor coplanarity inducing two common packaging failures, short circuit and broken circuit, substantially decreases reliability and yield due to non-uniform electronic current distribution. This paper thus develops a novel micro-polishing process aimed at grinding the rugged electroformed copper pillar into uniform one. Predominately in mechanical polishing force gives the polisher higher material removal rate (MRR) to effectively narrow the overall coplanarity from 33 ± 2. 5 µm (Coplanarity= 7. 5 %) to 28 ± 1 µm (Coplanarity= 3 %) with only 90 µm pithch size within 2 minutes at the polishing rate of 4 - 7 µm/min. Its polishing rate is 40 - 70 times faster than that of CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing). Most importantly, the coplanarity at each single die after reflow could be precisely controlled to 26 ± 0. 5 µm (Coplanarity= 1 %). The surface roughness after polishing is simultaneously improved from Ra 0. 6 to Ra 0. 03. 1...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{actuation}} {{has been}} very successful in both macro and micro scales and magnetic microactuators with different microstructures have also been extensively studied. Almost all of these microactuators {{are based on the}} electromagnetic effect and the force is generated by the electromagnetic coil, between the soft magnetic core and the (magnetic) cantilever. To integrate all of these magnetic components on the same chip, microstructures with different aspect ratios were fabricated in a single layer by using a photolithography process using the negative photoresist SU- 8 2000. A copper microcoil, a permalloy core and a nickel metal post for suspending a cantilever beam were electroplated on the same seed layer with aspect ratios varying from 1 : 1, 5 : 1 to 10 : 1, and the dimensions of the features ranging from 25 µm to 500 µm. The three different features were fabricated separately in three layers. Different viscosity of SU- 8 2000 was used in three layers. 50 µm, 80 µm and 200 µm thick SU- 8 are used to pattern the molds for electroplating three different features. 25 µm thick copper microcoils with an aspect ratio 1 : 1 was first electroplated on the Ti/Cu/Ti seed layer. This is followed by electroplating of 50 µm thick permalloy layer with an aspect ratio 10 : 1 on the same seed layer. A 100 µm thick <b>copper</b> <b>post</b> with an aspect ratio 5 : 1 was electroplated on to the same seed layer in the next step. SU- 8 resist molds were removed between each of these layers. Finally, the residual SU- 8 was cleaned by CF 4 plasma etching. The coils have 19 turns with a footprint area of 10 mm 2. The microcoils were tested to ascertain their maximum current densities before burnout. Similarly, the magnetic properties of the Permalloy core were also tested.

40|$|Abstract. A novel way {{of three}} {{dimensional}} (3 D) chip stacking {{has been designed}} in a view to improve heat dissipation across the layers. Chip stacking using vertical interconnections forms microscale channels for coolant to circulate through the gaps. Solder-based self assembled (SBSA) 3 D structures have been designed as posts on simulated through silicon vias (TSVs) to prove the processing concept. The processing of SBSA structures using a low temperature solder alloy and dip soldering method is described. Additional processing steps to fabricate interconnected 3 D structures were demonstrated. Mechanical grinding of the 3 D structures shows that soldered SBSA structures were void free and robust enough {{to be used as}} a connection post for chip stacking. SBSA structures provide a solder bump that serves as a connection path in the integration of dissimilar electronic technologies. Conventional <b>copper</b> <b>posts,</b> developed in a previous project, can be an effective approach to integrated circuit (IC) stacking. However, the SBSA post provides more variety in size and shape with a potential to serve as a reservoir for solder to aid in chip bonding. The solder bumps are heat resistant and uniform thicknesses were obtained across a large array of SBSA structures. The electrical durability of SBSA posts were determined by completing I-V measurements after thermal treatments. Fabricated SBSA posts were subjected to thermal cycling with temperatures ranging from room temperature to 300 °C. The interconnected SBSA posts are shown to be stable until 165 °C with little variation in measured resistance...|$|R

40|$|In complex systems, {{control and}} {{understanding}} become intertwined. Following Ilya Prigogine, we define complex systems as having control parameters which mediate transitions between distinct modes of dynamical behavior. From this perspective, determining {{the nature of}} control parameters and demonstrating the associated dynamical phase transitions are practically equivalent and fundamental to engaging with complexity. In {{the first part of}} this work, a control parameter is determined for a non-equilibrium electrochemical system by studying a transition in the morphology of structures produced by an electroless deposition reaction. Specifically, changing the size of <b>copper</b> <b>posts</b> used as the substrate for growing metallic silver structures by the reduction of Ag+ from solution under diffusion-limited reaction conditions causes a dynamical phase transition in the crystal growth process. For Cu posts with edge lengths on the order of one micron, local forces promoting anisotropic growth predominate, and the reaction produces interconnected networks of Ag nanowires. As the post size is increased above 10 microns, the local interfacial growth reaction dynamics couple with the macroscopic diffusion field, leading to spatially propagating instabilities in the electrochemical potential which induce periodic branching during crystal growth, producing dendritic deposits. This result is interesting both as an example of control and understanding in a complex system, and as a useful combination of top-down lithography with bottom-up electrochemical self-assembly. The second part of this work focuses on the technological development of devices fabricated using this non-equilibrium electrochemical process, towards a goal of integrating a complex network as a dynamic functional component in a neuromorphic computing device. Self-assembled networks of silver nanowires were reacted with sulfur to produce interfacial "atomic switches": silver-silver sulfide junctions, which exhibit complex dynamics (e. g. both short- and long-term changes in conductivity) in response to applied voltage signals. Characterization of these atomic switch networks (ASNs) brought out interesting parallels to biological neural networks, including power-law scaling in the statistics of electrical signal propagation and dynamic self-organization of differentiated subnetworks. A reservoir computing (RC) strategy was employed to utilize measurements of electrical signals dynamically generated in ASNs to perform time-series memory and manipulation tasks including a parity test and arbitrary waveform generation. These results represent the useful integration of a complex network into a dynamic physical RC device...|$|R

In this thesis growth of copper, copper(I) oxide and copper(I) nitride on two different substrates, amorphous SiO 2 and single crystalline α-Al 2 O 3 by the so called Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) techniques has been studied. This technique allows precise control of the growth process at monolayer level on solid substrates. Other characteristic features of ALD are that it produces films with excellent step coverage and good uniformity even as extremely thin films on complicated shaped substrates. Alternative deposition schemes were developed for the materials of interest. It was demonstrated that use of intermediate water pulses affected the deposition pathways considerably. By adding water, the films are thought to grow via formation of an oxide over-layer instead of through a direct reaction between the precursors as in the case without water. For growth of copper(I) nitride from Cu(hfac) 2 and ammonia no film growth occurred without adding water to the growth process.

A competing post operated by the Shelikov Company was established in 1796 at Yakutat Bay. The Shelikov Company sent Dmitri Tarkhanov to explore the lower Copper River and to look for copper deposits, inspired by reports that the native peoples used implements and points made of pure copper.

The application of nanotechnology to waste water remediation vis-à-vis heavy metal ions removal cannot be over emphasized (Dada et al. 2014 a, b). The effectiveness of nanomaterials is majorly enhanced by its surface area (Jain et al. 2007; Prathna 2012). Copper is often released into the environment through anthropogenic activities. Soluble <b>copper</b> compounds <b>post</b> a number of threats to human health. Usually, water-soluble copper compounds occur in the environment through applications in agriculture. Copper toxicity affects human beings, aquatic organisms and plants (Roosta et al. 2014; Wojtysiak and Kudelski 2012). A number of adverse effects of copper exist due to over-exposure ranging from irritation of the nose, mouth and eyes, headaches, stomachaches, dizziness, vomiting, hematemesis, diarrhoea, hypotension, melena, coma, jaundice to liver and kidney damage and even death (Bonnie et al. 2007; Brewer 2010). However, several methods such as precipitation, cementation, reverse osmosis, ion-exchange, electro-dialysis have been used to remove these heavy metals; yet, the problems still persist because of myriad of limitations of these methods (Prasad and Elumalai 2011). Adsorption has proven to be an efficient and cost-effective method of combating this problematic and toxic heavy metal ion. Some researchers have reported the use of some nano-adsorbents such as amino-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (Kumar and Yadav 2011), pectin–iron oxide magnetic nanocomposite (Xi et al. 2011) for the adsorption of copper(II) ions. Nevertheless, to the best our knowledge, there has been no report on preparation, characterization and adsorption studies of copper onto nanoscale zerovalent manganese (nZVMn). There are no data on detailed kinetic and isotherm models of adsorption of Cu(II) onto nanoscale manganese. Therefore, the objectives of this study are: to investigate the synthesis of nanoscale zerovalent manganese (nZVMn) in a single pot system using bottom-up approach via chemical reduction; carrying out the characterization of nZVMn and investigate its application in adsorption of Cu(II) ions. The effect of adsorbent dose, stirring speed, contact time, pH, initial Cu(II) concentration and temperature was investigated. The kinetic data were tested with pseudo first-order, pseudo second-order, Elovich, Fractional Power (Power function), and intraparticle diffusion models to determine the rate of adsorption and mechanism of the process. The equilibrium data were also subjected to seven isotherm models: Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin–Kaganer–Raduskevich (DKR), Halsey and Harkin-Jura and Flory–Huggins. The thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy change (∆H), entropy change (∆S) and Gibb’s free energy change (∆G) were calculated. The post adsorption characterization of the adsorbent (nZVMn) was carried out using scanning electroscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). Finally, the effect of salinity on adsorption of Cu(II) onto nZVMn was determined.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{experiments}} in chapters II, III and IV was to evaluate the potential for Cu-peptide absorption through the di- and tri-peptide transporter, PepT 1. For each experiment, intestinal tissue was mounted in modified Ussing chambers and total ion flux was measured. Mucosal and serosal buffer Cu concentrations, as well as tissue Cu concentrations were also measured to evaluate the absorbtive capacity between Cu sources. The study in chapter II was designed to determine if absorption from Cu proteinate could be reduced {{in the presence of}} PepT 1 inhibitors. Results demonstrated that Cu absorption from Cu proteinate was decreased when PepT 1 was blocked, while no effect of PepT 1 inhibitors on Cu absorption from CuSO 4 were observed. Overall, more Cu from Cu proteinate was found in the intestinal tissue <b>post</b> <b>copper</b> challenge. In chapter III, a study was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} decreasing the nutrient density of the diet on copper and nutrient absorption in ileal tissue of broilers. As indicated by change in short circuit current, the reduced nutrient diet, increased for glucose, Cu (Cu proteinate and CuSO 4) and for the di-peptide (Gly-Sar). None of the parameters measured indicated differences in Cu absorption between sources. In Chapter IV, a more purified Cu source was used to demonstrate the ability of Cu Triglycine to be absorbed through PepT 1. The PepT 1 inhibitor Valine-Lysine was able to reduce Cu-triglycine absorption into intestinal tissue, deomonstrating the capacity of Cu to be absorbed as a Cu peptide chelate, which was not found for CuSO 4 or Cu-tetraglycine. However, PepT 1 inhibitors quinapril and aminomethylbenzoic acid were not effective inhibitors of Cu absorption from Cu-tryglycine. Current findings suggest species variation for organic and inorganic transport of Cu. There is also evidence to support larger length peptide bound Cu (Cu proteinate) and Cu-tryglycine transport through the di- and tri-peptide transporter, PepT 1. ...|$|R
