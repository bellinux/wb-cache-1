This study is a descriptive-correlation type. Its population consisted of all discordant couples referred to counseling centers of Mashhad in 2015. Among the referred 140 discordant couples, there were selected 110 discordant couples as the targeted and available sampling, based on Morgan Table. There were used the revised questionnaire of <b>communication</b> <b>patterns</b> (RFCP), self-consciousness scale (SCS) and defense style questionnaire (Defence Style questiinnair- 40), in order to collect the data.

5000|$|An event can {{be defined}} as [...] "a {{significant}} change in state". [...] For example, when a consumer purchases a car, the car's state changes from [...] "for sale" [...] to [...] "sold". A car dealer's system architecture may treat this state change as an event whose occurrence can be made known to other applications within the architecture. From a formal perspective, what is produced, published, propagated, detected or consumed is a (typically asynchronous) message called the event notification, and not the event itself, which is the state change that triggered the message emission. Events do not travel, they just occur. However, the term event is often used metonymically to denote the notification message itself, which may lead to some confusion. This is due to Event-Driven architectures often being design atop message-driven architectures, where such <b>communication</b> <b>pattern</b> requires one of the inputs to be text-only, the message, to differentiate how each communication should be handled.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{incident}} in Los Cabos, Guzmán reinstated a different network to communicate with his subordinates. If his men needed to communicate with him through text message, the message would first be sent to a trusted lieutenant at a public wireless network.

The message would then be sent to a second intermediary who would write the message on his cellphone {{and send it to}} Guzmán through public WiFi. This made it difficult for authorities to penetrate his communication network, given that Guzmán's cellphone only connected with another device.

The study used 122 {{parents and their}} children to find communication patterns of avoidance, like sexual issues and topics of drinking/drugs, money, and educational progress. The topics were relative to friendships and every day activities that would change the dialogue. The four topics of adolescent dating, family relationship rules, family relationship concerns, and traditions were the final grouped topics. Parental Rule Socialization for Preventive Health and Adolescent Rule Compliance looked into family rules rather than their <b>communication</b> <b>pattern.</b> Rules like nutrition, exercise, and sun protection in 164 families were examined. The outcome of this study showed that parents reported higher rule articulation than their children within the three topics. In 2014, another study was published about family communication. The study Discursive Constructions of the Meaning of “Family” in Online Narratives of Foster Adoptive Parents examined normativity of families, seeing if shared genetics established as a legitimate family. The study showed that it was the importance of dialogue of families that defined a “family”, rather than how the family is constructed.|$|E
50|$|Positive {{humor is}} {{expected}} to be related to intimacy and marital satisfaction. This relation was true for the wives, but not for the husbands. This suggests that whether or not husbands use positive humor, {{it has nothing to do}} with how closely they feel to their partner or their marital satisfaction. Research suggests that instrumental humor is negatively related to marital satisfaction and is an indicator of potential future marital deterioration. Results showed that husbands acknowledged using instrumental humor in their relationship in relation to demand-withdrawal, in which the wife demands and the husband withdraws. Wives, on the other hand, did not acknowledge the use of instrumental humor in this <b>communication</b> <b>pattern.</b> This seems to indicate that men more often withdraw than women, in this case, with the use of humor. Negative humor was not related to any of the other humor measure in the study. This makes sense considering that put-downs or hurtful humor does not tend to lead to laughter or humor appreciation. Negative humor items in the questionnaire given to the participants described expressing negative emotion. Negative humor somewhat correlated with demand-withdrawal for husbands and wives. This humor can be a form of passive aggressiveness where the one using the humor is not taking responsibility for the put-down or hurtful joke, and in doing so, avoiding, or withdrawing from, conflict.|$|E
