40|$|This article {{documents}} the rapid rise of <b>covert</b> <b>searching,</b> through delayed notice search warrants, {{and argues that}} <b>covert</b> <b>searching</b> {{in its current form}} presumptively violates the Fourth Amendment’s “rule requiring notice. ” Congress authorized these “sneak and peek” warrants in the USA Patriot Act, in 2001, and soon after added a reporting requirement to monitor this invasive search technique. Since 2001, the use of delayed notice search warrants has risen dramatically, from around 25 in 2002 to 5, 601 in 2012, suggesting that “sneak and peek” searches are becoming alarmingly common. In fact, {{it is not at all}} clear whether true “sneak and peek” searches are on the rise. The data are confounded with other types of searches and thus are failing to capture what Congress intended. This article proposes an amendment to the reporting requirement to fix this problem and allow adequate monitoring of “sneak and peek” searches. To date, most courts have concluded that delayed notice search warrants raise no Fourth Amendment concerns. This article argues to the contrary. As a matter of Fourth Amendment first principles, <b>covert</b> <b>searches</b> infringe on the privacy and sanctity of the home. Moreover, history shows that delayed notice warrants are a modern procedural innovation, and did not exist at common law in the years leading up to the drafting of the Fourth Amendment in 1791.

40|$|AbstractCovert visual search {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} in humans, and {{has been used as}} a tool for understanding visual attention and cueing effects. In contrast, much less is known about <b>covert</b> <b>search</b> performance in monkeys, despite the fact that much of our understanding of the neural mechanisms of attention is based on these animals. In this study, we characterize the covert visual search performance of monkeys by training them to discriminate the orientation of a briefly-presented, peripheral Landolt-C target embedded within an array of distractor stimuli while maintaining fixation. We found that target discrimination performance declined steeply as the number of distractors increased when the target and distractors were of the same color, but not when the target was an odd color (color pop-out). Performance was also strongly affected by peripheral spatial precues presented before target onset, with better performance seen when the precue coincided with the target location (valid precue) than when it did not (invalid precue). Moreover, the effectiveness of valid precues was greatest when the delay between precue and target was short (∼ 80 – 100 ms), and gradually declined with longer delays, consistent with a transient component to the cueing effect. Discrimination performance was also significantly affected by prior knowledge of the target location in the absence of explicit visual precues. These results demonstrate that covert visual search performance in macaques is very similar to that of humans, indicating that the macaque provides an appropriate model for understanding the neural mechanisms of <b>covert</b> <b>search...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{recovery}} of fissile or radiological material illegally removed from its site of operation or storage is tremendously {{important in the}} context of the possible threat of nuclear terrorism. The material must be retrieved prior to its potential use in Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDD) or Improvised Nuclear Devices (IND). The process of tracking the material during transport or storage by means of a <b>covert</b> <b>search</b> is preferable to an open search as it does not draw the attention of civilians, thus preventing counter-productive reactions of panic by the general public or even early release by the terrorists. The Fraunhofer-INT has engineered a measurement system with an additional battery powered energy supply which can be integrated in a standard station wagon, featuring built-in gamma and neutron detection techniques as well as portable detection devices. It is therefore well-suited for <b>covert</b> <b>search</b> routines with respect to nuclear or radiological material which is transported across or stored in residential or industrial areas. Realistic case scenarios were investigated where nuclear or radioactive material was concealed on a test area, partly even inside buildings. At first, the rough location of the material was determined by means of the car's built-in detection system from inside the vehicle. Then the search for the exact location was continued on foot, using a portable detector which provides the opportunity to locate and subsequently identify the material in question. This way a thorough search of an area where such material is suspected was conducted. The search strategies as well as the results of these search procedures are presented...|$|E
30|$|The target’s {{location}} probability {{not only}} enhanced search RT, but also induced {{a tendency to}} direct the first saccade toward the high-probability quadrant. Consistent with RT, the first-saccade bias acquired in the discrimination task did not transfer to the detection task. However, the saccade preference acquired in the detection task only gradually declined when the task changed to discrimination. This latter finding was not accompanied by an RT advantage. This discrepancy suggests that a habit involving saccades is harder to correct than the <b>covert</b> <b>search</b> habit indexed by RT. The lack of an RT advantage suggests that information gathered from the preferential saccades is discounted at a later level; hence, there was no RT advantage even though eye movements showed a residual preference toward the previously high-probability quadrant.|$|E

We demonstrate that monkeys shift their behaviors in a systematic way, and that they do so in a near optimal manner. We also fit the OU model to neural data and find that OU model behaves almost like a pure drift diffusion process.

The resulting efficiency, reduced search time, and <b>covert</b> <b>search</b> possibilities will facilitate larger mission areas requiring many agents searching for significant lengths of time (e. g., many weeks or months). In search areas of this scale, complete area coverage {{may not always be}} feasible. Therefore, this research investigates a path planning scheme for incomplete coverage. This scheme divides the search area into cells and surveys each cell using a conventional line-sweep pattern with a row spacing that is larger than the sensor footprint. The rows of the line-sweep pattern are randomly spaced near the boundaries of each cell to decrease the probability of missing a line of evenly spaced mines. The spacing of the rows near the center of each cell are specifically determined from estimated possible mine locations. Bounds placed on the row spacing limits the amount of uncovered area to maintain an acceptable probability of detection. This method results in a probability of missing a mine that is less than the percent of unsearched area. Keywords—Coverage path planning, mine countermeasures, unmanned underwater vehicles. I...|$|E
40|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that exogenous and voluntary factors jointly determine the locus of attention, the rules governing the integration of these factors are poorly understood. We investigated neural responses in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) to transient, distracting visual perturbations presented during task performance. Monkeys performed a <b>covert</b> <b>search</b> task in which they discriminated the orientation of a target embedded among distractors, and brief visual perturbations were presented at various moments and locations during task performance. LIP neurons responded to perturbations consisting of the appearance of new objects, {{as well as to}} abrupt changes in the color, luminance, or position of existing objects. The LIP response correlated with the bottom-up behavioral effects of different perturbation types. In addition, neurons showed two types of top-down modulations. One modulation was a context-specific multiplicative gain that affected perturbation, target, and distractor activity in a spatially nonspecific manner. Gain was higher in blocks of trials in which perturbations directly marked target location than in blocks in which they invariably appeared opposite the target, thus encoding a behavioral context defined by the statistical contingency between target and perturbation location.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the link between}} neuronal activity in the frontal eye field (FEF) and the enhancement of visual processing associated with covert spatial attention {{in the absence of}} eye movements. We correlated activity recorded in the FEF of monkeys manually reporting the identity of a visual search target to performance accuracy and reaction time. Monkeys were cued to the most probable target location with a cue array containing a popout color singleton. Neurons exhibited spatially selective responses for the popout cue stimulus and for the target of the search array. The magnitude of activity related to the location of the cue prior to the presentation of the search array was correlated with trends in behavioral performance across valid, invalid, and neutral cue trial conditions. However, the speed and accuracy of the behavioral report on individual trials were predicted by the magnitude of spatial selectivity related to the target to be identified, not for the spatial cue. A minimum level of selectivity was necessary for target detection and a higher level for target identification. Muscimol inactivation of FEF produced spatially selective perceptual deficits in the <b>covert</b> <b>search</b> task that were correlated with the effectiveness of the inactivation and were strongest on invalid cue trials that require an endogenous attention shift. These results demonstrate a strong functional link between FEF activity and covert spatial attention and suggest that spatial signals from FEF directly influence visual processing during the time that a stimulus to be identified is being processed by the visual system...|$|E

40|$|The EDEN (End-User Driven Demo for CBRNe) FP 7 Demonstration Project is an European {{collaborative}} project involving {{a consortium of}} 36 members across 15 countries, including practitioners, corporate stakeholders, universities and research institutes. In the three-year project, the central question is how and with which tools one can counteract attacks or accidents involving chemical, biological, radioactive, nuclear or explosive materials (CBRNE). Aim of the project is the demonstration of a comprehensive system of systems of measures against such events, which require prevention before they can happen, response if they occur, and recovery afterwards. In {{the framework of the}} project different related methodological and technical tools were compiled into systems, further developed, tested and demonstrated in exercise scenarios. The tools are for example measuring devices, communication systems or simulation programs. The EDEN solutions matured during the project allow the opportunity to evaluate large scale integration of CBRNE Security and Counter-Terrorism techniques whilst improving cross border cooperation and interoperability. A sustainable impact will be achieved by an open and secure internet platform, called EDEN Store, where a data base in a multidimensional structure with tools and expert services etc. can be addressed by suppliers and practitioners, also when the project has ended. Aside from large scale demonstrations regarding CBRNE risks several medium size demonstration exercises were performed. The present presentation focuses on a thematic demonstration, which was organized by Fraunhofer INT and executed at the ENEA Research Centre in Frascati in Italy. Scenario was the attempt to smuggle radioactive material across a border and to start blackmailing. During the demonstration tool suppliers who subscribed to the EDEN Store had the opportunity to get their tools involved. The demonstration comprised two parts: In part one it was demonstrated that the radioactive source, hidden in a vehicle, could be detected, localized and identified at the fictive border crossing station, where different types of detector systems were employed. In part two of the demonstration it was assumed that a group of fictive smugglers have been successful in transporting the radioactive material across the border and that there are hints, that the material is hidden on a parking place. Under these circumstances a <b>covert</b> <b>search</b> had to be performed. Special designed measurement systems were used to this purpose.

Consistent with the view that LFPs represent synaptic input, visual responses appeared first in the LFPs followed by visual responses in the spiking activity. However, spatially selective activity identifying the location of the target in the visual search array appeared in the spikes about 30 ms before it appeared in the LFPs. Because LFPs reflect dendritic input and spikes measure neuronal output in a local brain region, this temporal relationship suggests that spatial selection necessary for attention and eye movements is computed locally in FEF from spatially nonselective inputs...|$|R
40|$|The {{influential}} “premotor {{theory of}} attention” proposes that developing oculomotor commands mediate covert visual spatial attention. A likely {{source of this}} attentional bias is the frontal eye field (FEF), {{an area of the}} frontal cortex involved in converting visual information into saccade commands. We investigated the link between FEF activity and covert spatial attention by recording from FEF visual and saccade-related neurons in monkeys performing <b>covert</b> visual <b>search</b> tasks without eye movements. Here we show that the source of attention signals in the FEF is enhanced activity of visually responsive neurons. At the time attention is allocated to the visual search target, nonvisually responsive saccade-related movement neurons are inhibited. Therefore, in the FEF, spatial attention signals are independent of explicit saccade command signals. We propose that spatially selective activity in FEF visually responsive neurons corresponds to the mental spotlight of attention via modulation of ongoing visual processing...|$|R
