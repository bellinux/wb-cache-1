5|$|In 1848 the Hungarian Lazzlo Magyar {{ascended the}} Congo to the Yellala falls, before {{spending}} five years exploring {{the region to}} the south. Due to his lack of <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> the valuable information that he gathered received little circulation.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2005 {{profile in}} the book Madcap by biographer and {{journalist}} Tim Willis, Barrett, who had reverted to using his original name of Roger, continued to live in his late mother's semi-detached home in Cambridge, and had returned to painting, creating large abstract canvases. He was also {{said to have been}} an avid gardener and his main point of <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> was his sister, Rosemary, who lived nearby. He was reclusive, and his physical health declined, as he suffered from stomach ulcers and type 2 diabetes.|$|E

50|$|Marsupialization - the {{surgical}} {{opening of the}} (OKC) cavity and a creation of a marsupial-like pouch, so that the cavity is in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> for an extended period, e.g. three months.|$|R
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1999, Weezer had once again gone their separate ways. Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side-band The Special Goodness, guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield. Meanwhile, Cuomo focused his energy on songwriting, crafting 121 songs, nearly half of which would become demos. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs {{he was working on}} to Bell.|$|E
5|$|Much {{like the}} {{multicultural}} and metropolitan {{atmosphere of the}} earlier Tang capital at Chang'an, the Song capitals at Kaifeng and Hangzhou were home to an array of traveling foreigners and ethnic minorities. There was {{a great amount of}} <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> Trade and tribute embassies from Egypt, Yemen, India, Korea, the Kara-Khanid Khanate of Central Asia and elsewhere came to Song China in order to bolster trade relations, while the Chinese sent embassies abroad to encourage foreign trade. Song Chinese trade ships traveled to ports in Japan, Champa in southern Vietnam, Srivijaya in Maritime Southeast Asia, Bengal and South India, and the coasts of East Africa.|$|E
5|$|Aurora's {{passage from}} the ice towards safety proved slow and perilous. Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering. Even after making <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it {{was in danger of}} being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E
50|$|The {{collections}} are ordered chronologically, and include ceramics, sculptures, jewellery, wall paintings, and ritual objects. The monumental art of wall-painting {{is represented in}} great detail. The island's complex network of <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world is also explained.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} was the Iron Age. Three burials {{were associated}} with this period. Also, based on the distinct pottery types, it {{was considered to be}} <b>the</b> time before <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world through trade with China begun.|$|R
50|$|Since {{planishing}} hammers {{are generally}} in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> surface of <b>the</b> piece, they are flat, have rounded edges and are polished to avoid marring the work. Pneumatic (air powered) planishing hammers strike hundreds of blows per minute.|$|R
5|$|Ben then visits Jack, {{telling him}} his real name, {{and that he}} has lived on the island all his life. He offers that if Jack cooperates, he can be sent home. Jack {{believes}} the Others are also stranded just as he is, but Ben informs him of the exact time and date of his plane crash and that 69 days have since passed (making the date November 29, 2004) and insists that they are in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> He shows this by citing various current events, such as the re-election of George W. Bush to the American presidency, the sudden death of Christopher Reeve and that the Boston Red Sox have won the 2004 World Series. Once Ben tells him about the Red Sox, Jack starts laughing and says that proves he is lying. Ben then proves it by playing a recording of the final play in the game as Jack watches in shock.|$|E
5|$|Saint and Dayuma, in {{conjunction}} with SIL, negotiated {{the creation of an}} official Huaorani reservation in 1969, consolidating the Huaorani and consequently opening up the area to commerce and oil exploration. By 1973, over 500 people lived in Tihueno, of which more than half had arrived in the previous six years. The settlement relied on aid from SIL, and as a Christian community, followed rules foreign to Huaorani culture like prohibitions on killing and polygamy. By the early 1970s, SIL began to question whether their impact on the Huaorani was positive, so they sent James Yost, a staff anthropologist, to assess the situation. He found extensive economic dependence and increasing cultural assimilation, and as a result, SIL ended its support of the settlement in 1976, leading to its disintegration and the dispersion of the Huaorani into the surrounding area. SIL had hoped that the Huaorani would return to the isolation in which they had lived twenty years prior, but instead they sought out <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> forming villages of which many have been recognized by the Ecuadorian government.|$|E
25|$|The Sentinelese (also {{called the}} Sentineli or North Sentinel Islanders) are the {{indigenous}} people of North Sentinel Island in the Andaman Islands of India. One of the Andamanese peoples, they resist <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> and are among the last people to remain virtually untouched and uncontacted by modern civilisation.|$|E
5000|$|The Baduy {{are divided}} into two sub-groups; the Baduy Dalam (Inner Baduy), and the Baduy Luar (Outer Baduy). No foreigners were allowed to meet the Inner Baduy, though the Outer Baduy do foster some limited <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world.|$|R
50|$|Isconahua or Iscobaquebu is an {{indigenous}} American {{language of the}} Panoan family. It is spoken by the Isconahua tribe in Peru. The Isconahua is a very isolated tribe and has very little <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world.As of 2000, there were 82 speakers.|$|R
50|$|For local people, taka was an {{indispensable}} {{means of transport}} employed through {{all aspects of the}} daily life. Until the recent extension of the roads network in the region, Turkey's Black Sea region as a whole largely depended on sea transport in its economy, social life and <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world.|$|R
25|$|The Carthusians do {{not engage}} in work of a {{pastoral}} or missionary nature. Unlike most monasteries, {{they do not have}} retreatants, and those who visit for a prolonged period are people who are contemplating entering the monastery. As far as possible, the monks have no <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{building}} of the transcontinental railway, Portland’s <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> – California or the eastern US – was largely by sea. These journeys took a long time: they were made for business; to replenish stocks; visits to family; education in the East; or to see the world. Even the inland routes were largely along rivers.|$|E
25|$|Ibn al-Nafis {{philosophical}} {{views are}} mostly known from his theological novel, Theologus Autodidactus. The novel touches upon {{a variety of}} philosophical subjects like cosmology, empiricism, epistemology, experimentation, futurology, eschatology,and natural philosophy. It deals with these themes and others through {{the story of a}} feral child on a desert island, and the development of his mind after <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{xenophobia}} {{and intellectual}} introspection {{characteristic of the}} increasingly popular new school of neo-Confucianism, China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, particularly Japan, increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa <b>with</b> <b>the</b> voyages of Zheng He.|$|R
50|$|When Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said assumed {{power in}} 1970, Oman had limited <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, {{including}} neighbouring Arab states. A special treaty relationship permitted the United Kingdom close involvement in Oman's civil and military affairs. Ties <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom have remained very close under Sultan Qaboos along with {{strong ties to}} the United States.|$|R
50|$|Robinson {{was badly}} injured during an unsanctioned race at Phoenix International Raceway - the 1988 Copper World Classic. He was spun and his helmet made <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> {{retaining}} wall. Never recovering from head injuries, he remained hospitalised after the accident, {{until his death}} on December 28, 1995 {{as a result of}} complications from pneumonia.|$|R
25|$|The incarcerated bosses are {{currently}} subjected to strict controls on their <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> limiting {{their ability to}} run their operations from behind bars under the article 41-bis prison regime. Antonino Giuffrè is a close confidant of Provenzano who turned pentito shortly after his capture in 2002. He alleges that Cosa Nostra had direct contact in 1993 with representatives of Silvio Berlusconi who was then planning the birth of Forza Italia.|$|E
25|$|Apparently, the Sicilian Mafia {{at present}} is divided between those bosses who support {{a hard line}} against the Italian state, mainly bosses {{currently}} in prison such as Salvatore 'Totò' Riina and Leoluca Bagarella, and those who support the more moderate strategy of Provenzano. The incarcerated bosses are currently subjected to harsh controls on their <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> limiting their ability to run their operations from behind bars under the article 41-bis prison regime.|$|E
25|$|Riina is {{currently}} held in a maximum-security prison with limited <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> {{in order to prevent}} him from running his organization from behind bars, as many others have done. Over $US125,000,000 in assets were confiscated from Riina, probably just a fraction of his illicit fortune, and his vast mansion was also acquired by the crusading anti-Mafia mayor of Corleone in 1997. The mansion was subsequently converted into a school for local children.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the fighters}} cannot have <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world,TUF {{producer}} Lewis Massoll gets an emergency {{phone call from}} Abdel Medjedoub's wife Caroline and allows him to talk to her. Apparently, Medjedoub did something {{that she was not}} happy <b>with</b> before <b>the</b> show. She says that she is going to leave him if he does not come back home to Montreal.|$|R
50|$|When the {{restarted}} on lap 12, Busch had {{the lead}} followed by Newman, Martin, Kahne, and Vickers behind him. Shortly after, Harvick and Sam Hornish, Jr. made contact on the backstretch. On lap 17, Harvick made <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> wall entering turn 1, causing {{damage to his}} car and bringing out a caution. Busch reported an electrical problem with his car.|$|R
50|$|Compound {{depressed}} skull fractures {{occur when}} there is a laceration over the fracture, putting the internal cranial cavity in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> environment, increasing <b>the</b> risk of contamination and infection. In complex depressed fractures, the dura mater is torn. Depressed skull fractures may require surgery to lift the bones off the brain if they are pressing on it by making burr holes on the adjacent normal skull.|$|R
25|$|While {{there are}} no {{official}} reports on the activities of traffickers, the media reports that traffickers often present themselves as employment agencies or as individual recruiters. Credible sources also identify large organized crime networks, which sometimes consisted of extended families plus their business associates, including recruiters and brothel managers. Traffickers confiscated travel documents to prevent victims from appealing to authorities for protection. Victims, particularly women and girls in prostitution, at times are denied <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> Victims often are threatened or beaten.|$|E
25|$|Hearst's {{attorney}} F. Lee Bailey {{used the}} Stockholm Syndrome argument {{as part of}} the defense at trial. During Hearst's subsequent trial, her lawyer claimed that she had been confined in a closet barely large enough for her to lie down in; that her <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> was regulated by her captors; and that she was regularly threatened with execution. Hearst's lawyer contended that she had been raped by DeFreeze and Wolfe. Both died before Hearst's capture and trial. The SLA claimed to be holding Hearst according to the conditions of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
25|$|Japan was {{a closed}} country {{for more than}} two centuries, 1636 to 1853, since {{military}} rulers from the Tokugawa family wanted to keep foreigners away from Japanese society. The only exceptions were Chinese and some Dutch, but even they were discouraged from associating with Japanese citizens. Also, it was strictly prohibited by law for ordinary Japanese citizens to go abroad. Change came around the early 19th century when the visit of an American fleet commanded by Commodore Perry caused the new Japanese government to replace the Tokugawa system of economics and politics during the Meiji era in order to open its door to trade and <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 284. Exiting Turn 4 on lap 287, Erik Jones made <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> wall, {{came down}} across the nose of Austin Dillon going into Turn 1 and got nudged out of the groove. Hamlin got into Dillon and turned him, and the domino effect resulted in heavy damage to the cars of Kurt Busch and Daniel Suárez. This brought out the seventh caution.|$|R
50|$|The {{operating}} {{principle of the}} botijo is as follows: the stored water is filtered through the pores of the clay and in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> dry environment (characteristic of Mediterranean climate), it evaporates, producing a cooling (2.219 kilojoules per gram of evaporated water). The key for cooling it, is by the evaporation of bleed water, as the water evaporates, it extracts thermal energy from the water stored inside the jug.|$|R
60|$|They groped {{their way}} out and down the stairs. It was clear and cold, and Johnny shivered at <b>the</b> first <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> air. <b>The</b> stars had not yet begun to pale in the sky, and the city lay in blackness. Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked. There was no {{ambition}} in the leg muscles to swing the feet clear of the ground.|$|R
