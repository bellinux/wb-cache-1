Furthermore, ectopic expression of eve or runt {{is sufficient to}} locally reorient the polarity of nearby cells. This evidence argues that planar polarity is established by cell-cell interactions, and not by a long-range polarizing cue.

In zebrafish, regional differences of C&E movements have been observed; however, the underlying cell behaviors are poorly understood. Using time-lapse analyses and computational modeling, we demonstrate that C&E of the medial presomitic mesoderm {{is achieved by}} cooperation of planar and radial <b>cell</b> <b>intercalations.</b> Radial intercalations preferentially separate anterior and posterior neighbors to promote extension. In knypek;trilobite noncanonical Wnt mutants, the frequencies of <b>cell</b> <b>intercalations</b> are altered and the anteroposterior bias of radial intercalations is lost. This provides evidence for noncanonical Wnt signaling polarizing cell movements between different mesodermal cell layers. We further show using fluorescent fusion proteins that during dorsal mesoderm C&E, the noncanonical Wnt component Prickle localizes at the anterior cell edge, whereas Dishevelled is enriched posteriorly. Asymmetrical localization of Prickle and Dishevelled to the opposite cell edges in zebrafish gastrula parallels their distribution in fly, and suggests that noncanonical Wnt signaling defines distinct anterior and posterior cell properties to bias <b>cell</b> <b>intercalations...</b>|$|R

During vertebrate gastrulation and neurulation, PCP signaling is required for convergent extension movements, which are primarily driven by mediolateral <b>cell</b> <b>intercalations,</b> whereas the role for PCP signaling in radial <b>cell</b> <b>intercalations</b> has been unclear. In this study, we examine {{the function of the}} core PCP proteins Vangl 2, Prickle 3 (Pk 3) and Disheveled in the ectodermal cells, which undergo radial intercalations during Xenopus gastrulation and neurulation. In the epidermis, multiciliated cell (MCC) progenitors originate in the inner layer, but subsequently migrate to the embryo surface during neurulation. We find that the Vangl 2 /Pk protein complexes are enriched at the apical domain of intercalating MCCs and are essential for the MCC intercalatory behavior. Addressing the underlying mechanism, we identified KIF 13 B, as a motor protein that binds Disheveled. KIF 13 B is required for MCC intercalation and acts synergistically with Vangl 2 and Disheveled, indicating that it may mediate microtubule-dependent trafficking of PCP proteins necessary for cell shape regulation. In the neural plate, the Vangl 2 /Pk complexes were also concentrated near the outermost surface of deep layer cells, suggesting a general role for PCP in radial intercalation. Consistent with this hypothesis, the ectodermal tissues deficient in Vangl 2 or Disheveled functions contained more cell layers than normal tissues. We propose that PCP signaling is essential for both mediolateral and radial <b>cell</b> <b>intercalations</b> during vertebrate morphogenesis. These expanded roles underscore the significance of vertebrate PCP proteins as factors contributing to a number of diseases, including neural tube defects, tumor metastases, and various genetic syndromes characterized by abnormal migratory cell behaviors...|$|R

Analysis of mosaic transgenics revealed that the effects of mutant Dishevelled on notochord intercalation are cell-autonomous in Ciona, though such defects have nonautonomous effects in Xenopus.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Branching {{morphogenesis}} transforms an epithelial sheet into a tubular {{network with}} distinct features regarding {{the length and}} diameter of individual tubes. Branching is controlled by several signaling pathways, but the molecular consequences of these pathways in the responding cells are poorly understood. RESULTS: We have undertaken a detailed characterization of cell rearrangements during tracheal branching morphogenesis in Drosophila embryos with a GFP fusion protein labeling the adherens junctions (AJs) and high-resolution live imaging. To analyze the branching process at the cellular level, we further developed an imaging approach {{that allows us to}} follow single cells during the branching process. We find that controlled <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation,</b> which requires extensive AJ remodeling, is key to the formation of tracheal branches of different cellular complexities. In particular, most branches consist of tubes with individual cells wrapped around the lumen. These branches form through <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation,</b> which requires the transformation of most of the initial intercellular AJs into autocellular AJs. We propose a step-wise model explaining how this AJ remodeling occurs and use this model to better understand defects in various mutants. We find that Dpp and Wnt signaling control <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation</b> by regulating the expression of Spalt, a zinc finger transcription factor; Spalt inhibits intercalation, leading to the formation of large, multicellular tubes.

40|$|Germband {{extension}} (GBE) in {{the early}} Drosophila embryo provides a simple system in which to study convergence and extension, a type of tissue remodelling common in development. During GBE the embryonic trunk (“germband”) extends in the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, and narrows in the dorso-ventral (DV) axis. I have quantitatively analysed cell and tissue behaviours during GBE. Our collaborators have developed novel algorithms to measure the continuous impact of <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation</b> and cell shape change on tissue deformation. Here I apply these algorithms to describe the behaviours contributing to GBE. I find that wild type embryos not only undergo <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation,</b> but also cell shape change which accounts for up to 50 % of the extension rate during the fast phase of GBE. I find that this cell shape change is elevated in AP patterning mutants that have a defect in <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation,</b> and that this elevation accounts for the initial rapid pulse of extension in these mutants. Regional analysis of these cell behaviours in wild type and AP patterning mutants indicate that <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation</b> is regionally autonomous, but that cell shape change is controlled at a more global level. An external force may be present during early GBE, stretching cells in the AP axis {{if they fail to}} intercalate properly. Additionally, I have examined the impact that other morphogenetic movements of gastrulation have on GBE. Mutant analysis shows that the ventral furrow affects the rate but not overall extent of tissue deformation, while the posterior midgut invagination appears to be required only for correct displacement of the tissue as it deforms, and not for tissue deformation itself, at least during early GBE. Thus, the amount of tissue extension, the rate at which it occurs, and the tissue displacement by which it is accommodated are separable phenomena.

40|$|The {{cells of}} many {{embryonic}} tissues actively narrow in one dimension (convergence) and lengthen in the perpendicular dimension (extension). Convergence and extension are ubiquitous and important tissue movements in metazoan morphogenesis. In vertebrates, the dorsal axial and paraxial mesodermal tissues, the notochordal and somitic mesoderm, converge and extend. In amphibians {{as well as}} a number of other organisms where these movements appear, they occur by mediolateral <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation,</b> the rearrange-ment of cells along the mediolateral axis to produce an array that is narrower in this axis and longer in the anteroposterior axis.

40|$|SummaryMorphogenesis of the {{respiratory}} appendages on eggshells of Drosophila species provides a powerful experimental system for studying how cell sheets {{give rise to}} complex three-dimensional structures. In Drosophila melanogaster, {{each of the two}} tubular eggshell appendages is derived from a primordium comprising two distinct cell types. Using live imaging and three-dimensional image reconstruction, we demonstrate that the transformation of this two-dimensional primordium into a tube involves out-of-plane bending followed by a sequence of spatially ordered <b>cell</b> <b>intercalations.</b> These morphological transformations correlate with the appearance of complementary distributions of myosin and Bazooka in the primordium.

40|$|Most {{epithelial}} tubes arise {{as small}} buds and elongate by regulated morphogenetic processes including oriented cell division, cell rearrangements, {{and changes in}} cell shape. Through live analysis of Drosophila renal tubule morphogenesis we show that tissue elongation results from polarised <b>cell</b> <b>intercalations</b> around the tubule circumference, producing convergent-extension tissue movements.

Time-lapse imaging at subcellular resolution shows that the acquisition of planar polarity leads to asymmetric pulsatile Myosin II accumulation in the basal, proximal cortex of tubule cells, resulting in repeated, transient shortening of their circumferential length. This repeated bias in the polarity of cell contraction allows cells to move relative to each other, leading {{to a reduction in}} cell number around the lumen and an increase in tubule length.

40|$|Despite being implicated as a {{mechanism}} driving gastrulation and body axis elongation in mouse embryos, the cellular mechanisms underlying mammalian convergent extension (CE) are unknown. Here we show, with high-resolution time-lapse imaging of living mouse embryos, that mesodermal CE occurs by mediolateral <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation,</b> driven by mediolaterally polarized cell behavior. The initial events in the onset of CE are mediolateral elongation, alignment and orientation of mesoderm cells as they exit the primitive streak. This cell shape change occurs prior to, and is required for, the subsequent onset of mediolaterally polarized protrusive activity. In embryos mutant for PTK 7, a novel cell polarity protein, the normal cell elongation and alignment upon leaving the primitive streak, the subsequent polarized protrusive activity, and CE and axial elongation all failed. The mesoderm normally thickens and extends, but on failure of convergence movements in Ptk 7 mutants, the mesoderm underwent radial intercalation and excessive thinning, which suggests that a cryptic radial <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation</b> behavior resists excessive convergence-driven mesodermal thickening in normal embryos. When unimpeded by convergence forces in Ptk 7 mutants, this unopposed radial intercalation resulted in excessive thinning of the mesoderm. These results show {{for the first time}} the polarized cell behaviors underlying CE in the mouse, demonstrate unique aspects of these behaviors compared with those of other vertebrates, and clearly define specific roles for planar polarity and for the novel planar cell polarity gene, Ptk 7, as essential regulators of mediolateral <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation</b> during mammalian CE...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{cellular}} basis and tissue interactions regulating convergence and {{extension of the}} vertebrate body axis in early embryogenesls of Xenopus. Convergence and extension occur in the dorsal mesoderm (prospective notochord and somite) and in the posterior nervous system (prospective hindbrain and spinal cord) by sequential <b>cell</b> <b>intercalations.</b> Several layers of cells intercalate to form a thinner, longer array (radial <b>intercalation)</b> and then <b>cells</b> intercalate in the mediolateral orientation to form a longer, narrower array (mediolateral intercalation). Fluorescence microscopy of labeled mesodermal cells in explants shows that protrusive activity is rapid and randomly directed until the midgastrula stage, when it slows and is restricted to the medial and lateral ends of the cells. This bipolar protrusive activity results in elongation, alignment and mediolateral <b>intercalation</b> of the <b>cells.</b> Mediolateral <b>intercalation</b> behavior (MIB) is expressed in an anterior- posterior and lateral-medial progression in the mesoderm. MIB is first expressed laterally in both somitic and notochordal mesoderm. From its lateral origins in each tissue, MIB progresses medially. If convergence does not bring the lateral boundaries of the tissues closer to the medial cells in the notochordal and somitic territories, these cells do not express MIB. Expression of tissue-specific markers follows and parallels the expression of MIB. These facts argue that MIB and some aspects of tissue differentiation are induced by signals emanating from the lateral boundaries of the tissue territories and that convergence must bring medial cells and boundaries closer together for these signals to be effective.

While {{many of the}} cell behaviors involved in convergent extension are known, the molecular interactions required for this process remain elusive. However, past evidence suggests that regulation of cell adhesion molecule function is a key step in the progression of these behaviors. Results: Antibody blocking of fibronectin (FN) adhesion or dominant-negative inhibition of integrin β 1 function alters cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, promotes cell-sorting behaviors in reaggregation assays, and inhibits medial-lateral <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation</b> and axial extension in gastrulating embryos and explants.

For instance, during Drosophila melanogaster gastrulation, apical constriction and <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation</b> are mediated by medial-apical myosin II pulses that power deformations, and polarized accumulation of myosin II that stabilizes these deformations. It remains unclear how tissue-specific factors control different patterns of myosin II activation and the ratchet-like myosin II dynamics.

Quantitative blastomere aggregation assays revealed that activin induction reduced the calcium-dependent adhesion between blastomeres. Activin-induced blastomeres formed smaller aggregates, and a greater proportion of the population remained as single cells compared to uninduced blastomeres. The aggregation was mediated by C-cadherin because C-cadherin was present in the blastomeres during the aggregation assay, and monoclonal antibodies against C-cadherin inhibited the calcium-dependent aggregation of blastomeres. E-cadherin was not detectable until after the completion of the assay and, therefore, does not explain the adhesive differences between induced and uninduced blastomeres. L cells stably expressing C- cadherin (LC cells) were used to demonstrate that C-cadherin activity was specifically altered after activin induction. Blastomeres induced with activin bound fewer LC cells than uninduced blastomers. L cells not expressing C-cadherin did not adhere to blastomeres. The changes in C-cadherin-mediated adhesion occurred without detectable changes in the steady-state levels of C-cadherin or the amount of C-cadherin present {{on the surface of the}} cell. Immunoprecipitation of C-cadherin and its associated catenins revealed that the ratio of C-cadherin and the catenins was not altered by activin induction.

In this paper, we characterize the cellular mechanism underlying convergent extension of the neural ectoderm in theXenopus laevislate gastrula and neurula embryo. Neural ectoderm inX. laevisconsists of two components, a superficial layer of epithelial cells overlying deep mesenchymal cells. To investigate the force contribution of the deep cells to convergent extension, we explanted single layers of neural deep cells from late gastrula stage embryos. These “neural deep cell explants” undergo active convergent extension autonomously, implying that these cells contribute force for neural convergent extensionin vivo. Using time-lapse videorecording of these explants, we observed the neural deep cell behaviors (previously hidden behind an opaque epithelium) underlying convergent extension. We show that neural deep cells mediolaterally intercalate to form a longer, narrower tissue and that cell shape change and cell division contribute little to their convergent extension. Moreover, we characterize the neural deep cell motility driving mediolateral intercalation, also using time-lapse videorecordings. Analyses of these videos revealed that, on average, neural deep cells exhibit mediolaterally biased protrusive activity which is expressed in an episodic fashion. We propose that neural deep <b>cells</b> accomplish mediolateral <b>intercalation</b> by applying their protrusions upon one another, exerting traction, and pulling themselves between one another. This mechanism is similar to that previously described for convergent extension of the mesodermal cells. However, because the neural deep cells do not mediolaterally elongate during their convergent extension as the mesodermal cells do, we predict that a given intercalation will result in more extension for neural deep cells than for the mesodermal <b>cells.</b> <b>Intercalation</b> of neural <b>cells</b> also likely occurs in a more episodic manner than that of the mesodermal cells because the neural cells’ mediolateral protrusive activity is episodic, whereas the protrusive activity of mesodermal cells is more continuous. These differences in protrusive activity and cell shape changes between the neural and mesodermal regions may reflect specializations of the same basic mechanism of mediolateral intercalation, tailored to accommodate other aspects of patterning and development of each tissue. These descriptions of the active cell motility underlying neural convergent extension inX. laevisare the first high-resolution video documentation of protrusive activity driving neural convergent extension in any system.

Together these data suggest that the CR 1 and PDZ 1 domains mediate membrane compartmentalization that is modulated through aPKC phosphorylation, while the PDZ 3 domain is required for contact inhibition. In embryos, PAR- 3 is expressed throughout gastrulation and over-expression of PAR- 3 inhibits blastopore closure indicating a requirement during gastrulation. Inhibition is relieved when the construct lacking the CR 1 domain is over-expressed. PAR- 3 was localized to the cell periphery in axial mesoderm. Localization was abolished with deletion of the CR 1 domain indicating that membrane targeting of PAR- 3 is required for gastrulation and this targeting is dependent on oligomerization of PAR- 3. This investigation also suggests PAR- 3 functions independent of the PAR complex in Xenopus embryos indicating involvement of a different PAR- 3 signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{majority}} of membrane and secreted proteins, including many developmentally important signalling proteins, receptors and adhesion molecules, are cotranslationally N-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum. The {{structure of the}} N-glycan is invariant for all substrates and conserved in eukaryotes. Correspondingly, the enzymes are conserved, which successively assemble the glycan precursor from activated monosaccharides prior to transfer to nascent proteins. Despite the well-defined biochemistry, the physiological and developmental role of N-glycosylation and of the responsible enzymes has not been much investigated in metazoa. We identified a mutation in the Drosophila gene, xiantuan (xit, CG 4542), which encodes one of the conserved enzymes involved in addition of the terminal glucose residues to the glycan precursor. xit is required for timely apical constriction of mesoderm precursor cells and ventral furrow formation in early embryogenesis. Furthermore, <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation</b> in the lateral epidermis during germband extension is impaired in xit mutants. xit affects glycosylation and intracellular distribution of E-Cadherin, albeit not {{the total amount of}} E-Cadherin protein. As depletion of E-Cadherin by RNAi induces a similar <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation</b> defect, E-Cadherin may be the major xit target that is functionally relevant for germband extension...|$|E
40|$|Body axis {{elongation}} {{represents a}} common and fundamental morphogenetic process in development. A key mechanism triggering body axis elongation without additional growth is convergent extension (CE), whereby a tissue undergoes simultaneous narrowing and extension. Both collective cell migration and <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation</b> {{are thought to}} drive CE and are used to different degrees in various species as they elongate their body axis. Here, we {{provide an overview of}} CE as a general strategy for body axis elongation and discuss conserved and divergent mechanisms underlying CE among different species...|$|E

We find that a sequence of activities sweeps through the somitic mesoderm from anterior to posterior during gastrulation and neurulation, beginning with radial <b>cell</b> <b>intercalation</b> or thinning, continuing with mediolateral intercalation and cell elongation, and culminating in segmentation and somite rotation. Radial intercalation at the posterior tip lengthens the tissue, while mediolateral intercalation farther anterior con...|$|E
40|$|In novel dual-ion <b>cells</b> {{graphite}} <b>intercalation</b> compounds will be {{used for}} both electrodes. The consequent intercalation of both, cations and anions, in the respective electrodes enables voltage values above 5 V. Established liquid electrolytes do not resist these conditions. Therefore those are replaced by ionic liquids having a good electrochemical performance also at higher temperatures. Now the challenge is to overcome the corrosion of the aluminium current collector triggered by fluorinated anions like bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (TFSI). Our approach to protect the metal against corrosion is the deposition of an only electronically conductive, defect free and mechanically as well as electrochemically stable layer. Different material compositions in the range of oxidic ceramics are tested, first of all doped semiconductors, e. g. alumina doped zinc oxide. The preparation is based on a sol-gel route combined with several wet-chemical coating methods, because these are easily adjustable to different substrate sizes. Cyclic voltammetry is used to investigate the electrochemical performance of the protection layers on aluminium substrates...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} {{of a series}} of half-sandwich ruthenium complexes, [RuCl 2 (η 6 - p -cymene) (P*) ] (P* = S -PMeRR′) and [RuCl 2 (κ-P*- η 6 -arene) ], containing P -stereogenic phosphines is reported. The borane-protected P -stereogenic phosphines have been obtained by addition of the (H 3 B) PMe 2 R (R = t -Bu (1), Cy (2), Fc (3)) / sec -BuLi/(−) -sparteine adduct to benzyl halides, carbonyl functions, and epoxides with yields between 40 and 90 % and ee values in the 70 – 99 % range. Those containing an aryl secondary function have been used in the {{preparation of}} [RuCl 2 (η 6 -p-cymene) (P*) ] complexes. Borane deprotection has been performed using HBF 4, except for (H 3 B) PRMe(CH 2 SiMe 2 Ph) phosphines, where DABCO was used to avoid partial cleavage of the CH 2 –Si bond. In the case of (H 3 B) P(t-Bu) Me(CH 2 C(OH) Ph 2) (1 l) the dehydrated phosphine was obtained. The tethered complexes were obtained by p-cymene substitution in chlorobenzene at 120 °C, except for ferrocenyl-containing complexes, which decomposed upon heating. The presence of substituents in the aryl arm of some of the phosphines introduces new chiral elements in the tethered [RuCl 2 (κ-P*- η 6 -arene) ] compounds. Full characterization of all compounds both in solution and in the solid state has been carried out. Crystal structure determinations of four phosphine–borane molecules confirm the S configuration at the phosphorus atom (1 a, e, l and 2 d). Moreover, the crystal structure of one p -cymene complex (5 i) and four tethered complexes reveal the strain of the compounds with two atoms in the tether (7 c, g, l and 8 i). Tethering has a marked effect on the catalytic performance transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone and on the nature of hydridic species originating during the activation period. The chiral induction attains 58 % ee with complexes with the bulkiest substituents in the pendant arm of the phosphine. Three of the prepared complexes can interact with DNA and present a reasonable cytotoxicity toward cancer <b>cells.</b> <b>Intercalation</b> of the free aromatic pendant arm of the phosphines seems to be fundamental for such interactions...|$|R
30|$|The anticancer {{anthracycline}} chemotherapeutic drug Doxorubicin (here abbreviated consistently as “Dox”) {{is one of}} {{the first}} candidates for a more targeted nanodelivery due to life-threatening cardiotoxicity and other serious side effects [25, 26]. The main mechanism of Dox toxicity against cancer <b>cells</b> is its <b>intercalation</b> into nuclear DNA followed by inhibition of topoisomerase activity, DNA replication, and repair [26 – 28]. But Dox’s side effects on cardiomyocytes are considered to be determined by another mechanism, mainly, iron-related reactive oxygen species formation [27, 28]. The combination of C 60 antioxidant potential [2, 11, 13] and its ability for drug delivery [24, 25] makes the nanostructure very attractive for anticancer therapy.|$|R
