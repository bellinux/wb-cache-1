40|$|The {{form and}} {{seasonal}} development of in vivo mycorrhizas of P. sylvestris seedlings growing in forest nursery plots 458 FY 70 (Kennington) and 83 FY 7 O (Wareham) have been characterised; this enabled various characters of P. sylvestris seedlings (for example non mycorrhizal short roots, mycorrhizal roots, 'pioneer' and 'mother' and subordinate 'mother' roots) {{to be compared}} for different soil conditions. Examination of the heteroihyzic root systems of P. sylvestris and P. nigra showed that long roots, for example 'pioneer' roots, are possibly more capable of adapting {{to a variety of}} soil conditions. The effects of Simazine on measured aspects of the root systems of nursery grown P. sylvestris and P. nigra are unclear; equivalent Pines growing in the same soils contained in plant pots showed a demonstrable increase in both numbers of short roots and in mycorrhizas on the application of Simazine equivalent to 4 lbs Simazine per acre. Growth measurements of known mycorrhizal and root pathogenic fungal isolates,on agar plates with added herbicides, showed that increase in growth of some isolates ocourred in the presence of higher concentrations of Simazine or Atrazine. In contrast, equivalent experiments using Diehlobenil, Dichlobenzoate, <b>Chlorthiamid</b> and 245 T indicated that identical isolates, growing in the presence of these herbicides, were inhibited. These observations of herbicidal activity on mycorrhizas and their mycobionts were confirmed by measurement of respiration rates for Boletus elegans and Amanita rubescens, both mycobionts (the latter in very exceptional circumstances), and mycorrhizal roots of P. sylvestris. The extent of phosphate uptake by P. sylvestris mycorrhizas, estimated from buffered phosphate solutions containing herbicide, was also in agreement with the results. Using a number of established techniques, attempts to produce reliable numbers of in vitro mycorrhizas were of limited success. <p...|$|E
