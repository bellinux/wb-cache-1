25|$|The {{standard}} {{models have}} an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker {{located on the}} slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is <b>cammed</b> into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the firing pin springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|E

50|$|The P226, {{like the}} other members of the SIG Classic family, {{operates}} by the locked breech short-recoil method pioneered by John Browning. On firing, the slide and barrel are locked together for a few millimetres of rearward movement, after which the barrel is <b>cammed</b> down at the rear. By this time the bullet has left the barrel and the pressure has dropped to safe levels, whereupon the slide completes the rearward stroke, ejecting the spent cartridge. The recoil spring then propels the slide forward, stripping a round from the magazine and in the last few millimetres of forward movement the barrel is <b>cammed</b> upwards, locking the slide and barrel together again.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Examine {{stability}} {{of use of}} complementary and alternative medicine (<b>CAM)</b> of breast cancer patients, reasons for <b>CAM</b> use, and sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological predictors of <b>CAM</b> use. Methods: <b>CAM</b> use was assessed after adjuvant therapy and six months later. Following the <b>CAM</b> Healthcare Model, <b>CAM</b> use was divided into use of provider-directed (guided) and self-directed (self-help) <b>CAM.</b> Stability and reasons for <b>CAM</b> use were examined with McNemar's tests and descriptive statistics. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between predictors and <b>CAM</b> use were examined with univariate and multivariate logistical analyses. Results: Use of provider-directed and self-directed <b>CAM</b> was stable over time (N = 176). Self-directed <b>CAM</b> was more often used to influence the course of cancer than provider-directed <b>CAM.</b> Both were used to influence well-being. Openness to experience predicted use of provider-directed <b>CAM,</b> while clinical distress predicted use of self-directed <b>CAM,</b> after adjusting for other predictors. Perceived control did not predict <b>CAM</b> use. Conclusion: <b>CAM</b> use is stable over time. It is meaningful to distinguish provider-directed from self-directed <b>CAM.</b> Practice implications: Providers are advised to plan a 'CAM-talk' before adjuvant therapy, and discuss patients' expectations about influence of <b>CAM</b> on the course of cancer. Distressed patients most likely need information about self-directed <b>CAM.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

50|$|The 9422 action {{design was}} {{original}} and extremely reliable.

40|$|Abstract Two {{full-length}} cDNAs, named <b>CaM</b> 1 a and <b>CaM</b> 1 b, encoding {{the highly}} conserved calmodulin 1 (<b>CaM</b> 1) proteins, were {{isolated from the}} cDNA library of amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtauense. There are only two nucleotide differences between them, producing one amino acid difference between <b>CaM</b> 1 a and <b>CaM</b> 1 b. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of <b>CaM</b> 1 reveals that the B. belcheri tsingtauense <b>CaM</b> 1 a is identical with <b>CaM</b> 1 proteins of B. floridae and B. lanceolatum, Drosophila melanogaster <b>CaM,</b> ascidian Halocynthia roretzi CaMA and mollusk Aplysia californica <b>CaM,</b> and <b>CaM</b> 1 b differs only at one position (138, Asn to Asp). The phylogenetic analysis indicates that the <b>CaM</b> 1 in all three amphioxus species appears to encode the conventional <b>CaM</b> and <b>CaM</b> 2 might be derived from gene duplication of <b>CaM</b> 1.

Methods: Two general medical samples provider-based <b>CAM</b> consumers, undergraduates (N= 226) and community-dwelling adults (N= 128), completed a survey about their <b>CAM</b> use and disclosure, health-related control, <b>CAM</b> patient-centered care, and <b>CAM</b> outcomes.

5000|$|The K100 uses a rare locking system, {{similar in}} some ways to the Beretta Cougar, Px4 Storm, and Brügger & Thomet MP9 which employs a {{rotating}} barrel lock, which in the K100's case is <b>cammed</b> by a cross pin. When the pistol is fired the barrel and slide move backward together for about 3/8 of an inch while the barrel is <b>cammed</b> clockwise (with respect to the shooter) by a flat, twisting, helical [...] "cut" [...] in the barrel extension. Once the barrel and slide have moved back {{to the point where the}} barrel has twisted about 45°, the slide is free to continue traveling back while the barrel's travel is arrested by its interface to the frame via the barrel extension's square shoulders. On the K100, the Beretta's barrel extension cam cut, and transfer block's cam tooth, are replaced by a curled, twisting cut in the barrel extension, and a round, frame-embedded cross-pin respectively. As such, there is no transfer block (locking block) per se, and the barrel extension directly interfaces with the frame via the replaceable cross-pin. The design allows a low bore axis relative to the shooter's hand and avoids the use of the transfer/locking block typically found in rotating barrel pistols.|$|E

It was found that knowledge and attitudes towards <b>CAM</b> did not predict <b>CAM</b> recommendation, personal use, nor professional use among the participants. However, <b>CAM</b> knowledge was found to predict <b>CAM</b> referrals. It is assumed that positive attitudes towards <b>CAM</b> integration among participants has been conflicted with their concern for <b>CAM</b> safety. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
