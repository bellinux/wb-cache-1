His return to Peterborough was {{completed}} on an initial one-month loan on 8 August 2003. His first appearance after returning was in a 4–3 defeat home to Hartlepool United the following day, and in September 2003 Peterborough manager Barry Fry {{said he wanted to}} extend Boucaud's stay at the club. Having made nine appearances and scored one goal for Peterborough in two months, he returned to Reading on 7 October 2003.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Richie Unterberger {{awarded the}} album three stars out of five, {{describing}} Nico's songwriting as [...] "singularly morose". Dorian Lynskey wrote for The Guardian that The Marble Index forces {{the distinction between}} art and entertainment, comparing it to the [...] "terrifying" [...] output of musician Scott Walker (particularly the album Tilt), painter Mark Rothko and writer Philip Roth. Simon Reynolds described the record as [...] "psychic landscapes, glittering in their immaculate, lifeless majesty of someone {{cut off from the}} thawing warmth of human contact and fellowship" [...] and [...] "religious music for nihilists". Sputnikmusic's Louis Arp was less enthusiastic, finding the music [...] "pretentious" [...] and [...] "agitating" [...] in the aura it evoked while deeming Nico's lyrics repetitive and meaningless. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said, [...] "While The Velvet Underground and Nico plus Chelsea Girl convinced me that Nico had charisma; The Marble Index plus Desertshore <b>convince</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she's a fool." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 6, 1943, {{following}} {{the defeat of}} the U.S. II Corps by the German Afrika Korps, commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, at the Battle of Kasserine Pass, Patton replaced Major General Lloyd Fredendall as Commanding General of the II Corps and was promoted to lieutenant general. Soon thereafter, he had Major General Omar Bradley reassigned to his corps as its deputy commander. With orders to take the battered and demoralized formation into action in 10 days' time, Patton immediately introduced sweeping changes, ordering all soldiers to wear clean, pressed and complete uniforms, establishing rigorous schedules, and requiring strict adherence to military protocol. He continuously moved throughout the command talking with men, seeking to shape them into effective soldiers. He pushed them hard, and sought to reward them well for their accomplishments. His uncompromising leadership style is evidenced by his orders for an attack on a hill position near Gafsa which are reported to have ended [...] "I expect to see such casualties among officers, particularly staff officers, as will <b>convince</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a serious effort has been made to capture this objective." ...|$|E
500|$|Given {{the task}} of {{overhauling}} the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. [...] McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, {{but he was still}} interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, [...] "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to <b>convince</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> St. Louis was the place I wanted to be." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1880s, Stanford collaborated with the author Gilbert à Beckett on two operas, Savonarola, and The Canterbury Pilgrims. The former was well {{received}} at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, [...] "It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic." [...] The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre, whose reviewer wrote, [...] "The book of Savonarola is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. Savonarola has gone far to <b>convince</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> opera is quite out of [...] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, the better for his musical reputation." [...] The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden. It had a better reception than the latter, though reviews pointed out Stanford's debt to Die Meistersinger, and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music. George Grove agreed with the critics, writing to Parry, [...] "Charlie's music contains everything but sentiment. Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of. ... And I do think that there might be more tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely." [...] In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had [...] "just such a 'book' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline us to think that Die Meistersinger had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy." ...|$|E

He wrote: [...] "Though the basic thesis of the research seems wildly improbable, for many years I thought that an ironclad case had been made for the codes; I did not see how 'cheating' could have been possible. Then came {{the work of the}} 'opponents' (see, for example, McKay, Bar-Natan, Bar-Hillel and Kalai, Statistical Science 14 (1999), 149–173).

2500|$|I am {{a believer}} in {{that portion of the}} Declaration of American Independence in which it is set forth, as among self-evident truths, [...] "that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain {{inalienable}} rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." [...] Hence, I am an abolitionist. Hence, I cannot but regard oppression in every form – and most of all, that which turns a man into a thing – with indignation and abhorrence. Not to cherish these feelings would be recreancy to principle. They who desire me to be dumb on the subject of slavery, unless I will open my mouth in its defense, ask me to give the lie to my professions, to degrade my manhood, and to stain my soul. I will not be a liar, a poltroon, or a hypocrite, to accommodate any party, to gratify any sect, to escape any odium or peril, to save any interest, to preserve any institution, or to promote any object. <b>Convince</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> one man may rightfully make another man his slave, and I will no longer subscribe to the Declaration of Independence. <b>Convince</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> liberty is not the inalienable birthright of every human being, of whatever complexion or clime, and I will give that instrument to the consuming fire. I {{do not know how to}} espouse freedom and slavery together.|$|E
