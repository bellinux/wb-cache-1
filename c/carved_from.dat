5|$|Monument 141 is a {{very well}} {{preserved}} hieroglyphic panel <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> fine grained white limestone with almost the whole inscription intact. It describes the dedication of a ballcourt by K'inich B'aaknal Chaak.|$|E
5|$|Monument 7 is <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> yellow {{sandstone}} and {{has suffered}} only minor damage. It is a stela base with well-preserved hieroglyphs {{on all four}} vertical sides and was dedicated by K'inich Ich'aak Chapat in 728. It is currently in the Museo Regional in Tuxtla Gutiérrez.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, the Wisconsin Territory {{was formed}} {{from the western}} section of the Michigan Territory. Chapman became the first U.S. Attorney for this new {{territory}} when it was created. He was elected as colonel of the militia in 1836 after moving {{to what is now}} Dubuque, Iowa. Then in 1838, the Iowa Territory was <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> the Wisconsin Territory.|$|E

5|$|Instead of copying {{traditional}} academic postures, Rodin preferred his {{models to}} move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness). The sculptor often made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and cast in bronze or <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> marble. Rodin's {{focus was on}} the handling of clay.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the exterior, Pei {{borrowed from the}} tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby Kyoto. He created a concise spaceframe wrapped into French limestone {{and covered with a}} glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> a 350-year-old keyaki tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350million.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Spanish Room, {{the library is}} the most {{atmospheric}} of rooms, upon the wall of which are hung the huge keys of the destroyed Corfe Castle, handed back to Mary Bankes after her defence of Corfe Castle during the Civil War. The state bedroom is extremely ornate and has housed such important guests as Kaiser Wilhelm II who stayed with the family for a week in 1907. The main staircase is beautifully <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> stone and features three huge statues which look out onto the gardens from their seats. These depict Sir John Bankes and Lady Bankes, the defenders of Corfe Castle, and their patron, Charles I.|$|E

5|$|As of 2006, 304 stone monuments {{have been}} found at Takalik Abaj, mostly <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> local {{andesite}} boulders. Of these monuments 124 are carved with the remainder being plain; they are mostly found in the Central and Western Groups. The worked monuments {{can be divided into}} four broad classifications: Olmec-style sculptures, which represent 21% of the total, Maya-style sculptures representing 42% of the monuments, potbelly monuments (14% of the total) and the local style of sculpture represented by zoomorphs (23% of the total).|$|E
5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission to deviate from its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.|$|E
5|$|Idiophones were {{extremely}} important in Chinese music, hence {{the majority of}} early instruments were idiophones. Poetry of the Shang dynasty mentions bells, chimes, drums, and globular flutes <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> bone, the latter {{of which has been}} excavated and preserved by archaeologists. The Zhou dynasty saw percussion instruments such as clappers, troughs, wooden fish, and yǔ (wooden tiger). Wind instruments such as flute, pan-pipes, pitch-pipes, and mouth organs also appeared in this time period. The xiao (an end-blown flute) and various other instruments that spread through many cultures, came into use in China during and after the Han dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Potbelly monuments are {{generally}} crude in-the-round sculptures of extremely fat human figures; {{they are usually}} seated cross-legged and have enormous swollen stomachs gripped in the figure's arms and legs. The heads are round and normally have the eyes closed and possess puffy eyelids and prominent lips. The monuments {{are generally}} of indeterminate gender and are usually <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> porphyritic basalt, a kind of rock {{with a combination of}} large and small grains of mineral that is common along the foothills of Central America. There are occasional examples of potbelly figures crafted from other materials, such as pottery or from other types of rock.|$|E
5|$|The German graves {{were grouped}} {{according}} to military unit. Every grave in each grouping receiving a similar headstone, {{but not necessarily}} {{the same as that}} in other groupings. There were a number of organizations in Germany that were particularly opposed to mass-produced identical headstones and by consequence the cemetery contains a number of differently styled headstones. The German headstones were <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> locally quarried stone, principally bluestone and Belgian Petit Granit. German officers were offered larger headstones to illustrate their higher military rank. The cemetery contains a number of German regimental memorials within the cemetery which were paid and provided by the city or town where the regiment was based.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of a colossal head at Tres Zapotes {{in the nineteenth century}} spurred the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture by Matthew Stirling in 1938. Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán were re-carved from massive stone thrones. An additional monument, at Takalik Abaj in Guatemala, is a throne that may have been <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> a colossal head. This is the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.|$|E

5|$|The four Buddha statues, which {{depict the}} Dhyana mudra, are also <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> solid rock. Two {{of them are}} more or less intact today, while only parts of the other two remain. The stupa in the middle appears to have been of the Bubbulakara (bubble shaped) design {{commonly}} seen in Sri Lanka. The upper part has been destroyed, and only the dome shaped lower part now remains. However, it has only two Pesavas (the rings found at the base of stupas) rather than the traditional three.|$|E
5|$|The keep was {{surrounded}} by a curtain wall with probably four flanking towers and a fortified gatehouse protecting a relatively small bailey; these outer defences, rather than the keep, probably represented the main defences of the castle. The marshes nearby were drained turning the village of Orford into a sheltered port. The castle, including the surrounding ditch, palisade and stone bridge, cost £1,413 to build, with the work possibly being conducted by the master mason Alnoth. Some of the timbers were brought {{from as far away as}} Scarborough, and the detailed stonework being <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> limestone from Caen in Normandy, the remainder of the stone being variously from local mudstone and coralline, as well as limestone from Northamptonshire.|$|E
5|$|The limey oozes and mud {{were later}} lithified into the {{limestone}} and interbedded siltstone of the up-to-300foot (90m)-thick White Member of the Claron. This member erodes into white-colored monoliths {{that are found}} only at the highest elevations of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Fossils are rare in the White Member and consist mainly of freshwater snails and clams, indicating that the lakes supported little life. Most arches and natural bridges in the park, including the famous Natural Bridge, were <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> sandstone beds in the Claron.|$|E

5|$|Although much of Britain {{from this}} time is now beneath the sea, remains have been {{discovered}} on land that show horses were present, and being hunted, in this period. Significant finds include a horse tooth dating from between 55,000 and 47,000BC and horse bones dating from between 50,000 and 45,000BC, recovered from Pin Hole Cave, in the Creswell Crags ravine in the North Midlands; further horse remains from the same era have been recovered from Kent's Cavern. In Robin Hood Cave, also in Creswell Crags, a horse tooth was recovered dating from between 32,000 and 24,000BC; this cave has also preserved {{one of the earliest}} examples of prehistoric artwork in Britain– an engraving of a horse, on a piece of horse bone. A goddess figurine <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> horse bone and dating from around 23,000BC has been recovered from Paviland Cave in South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Burial 48 was <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> {{the bedrock}} under the terrace, upon the central north-south {{axis of the}} North Acopolis {{directly}} under Temple 33; it {{has been identified as}} the tomb of king Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The remains of the king were flanked those of two juvenile human sacrifices; one of these was a child and one was an adolescent. The walls of the tomb were coated in stucco, onto which were painted hieroglyphs indicating that the tomb was sealed in March 457, a year after the king had died. The king was interred bundled in a seated position and his remains lacked the skull, hands, and femurs. Grave goods included 27 ceramic vessels of mixed of local and imported origin, stone and shell artefacts including a well-used stone metate and accompanying handstone, a large quantity of jade artefacts, including jade discs and hundreds of beads that once formed a semicircular collar, two pairs of earspools and a great many more beads in small groups that did not form a part of the collar. Two obsidian blades also accompanied the burial.|$|E
5|$|Early Heian period works {{before the}} mid-10th century appear heavy {{compared}} to Nara period statues, <b>carved</b> <b>from</b> single blocks of wood, and characterised by draperies carved with alternating round and sharply cut folds. Stylistically, they followed high to later Tang style. In the Heian period the zōbussho were replaced with temple-run and independent workshops; wood became the primary medium; and a specific Japanese style emerged. By the mid-10th century, the style was refined presenting a more calm and gentle appearance, with attenuated proportions. Jōchō {{was the most}} important sculptor of this time, and he used the yosegi technique, in which several pieces of wood are joined to sculpt a single figure. He was the ancestor of three important schools of Japanese Buddhist statuary: the , Inpa and Keiha school. The Amida Nyorai at Byōdō-in is the only extant work by Jōchō.|$|E
