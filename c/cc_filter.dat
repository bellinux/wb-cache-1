40|$|In the {{recently}} proposed cosmological constant (<b>CC)</b> <b>filter</b> mechanism based on modified gravity in the Palatini formalism, gravity in the radiation, matter and late-time de Sitter eras is insensitive to energy sources with {{the equation of}} state - 1. This implies that finite vacuum energy shifts from phase transitions are filtered out, too. In this work we investigate the <b>CC</b> <b>filter</b> model at very early times. We find that the initial big bang singularity {{is replaced by a}} cosmic bounce, where the matter energy density and the curvature are finite. In a certain case this finiteness can be observed already on the algebraic level. Comment: 11 + 3 pages, 6 figures, one reference added, accepted by Class. Quant. Gra...|$|E
40|$|According to {{theoretical}} physics the cosmological constant (CC) {{is expected to}} be much larger in magnitude than other energy densities in the universe, which is {{in stark contrast to the}} observed Big Bang evolution. We address this old CC problem not by introducing an extremely fine-tuned counterterm, but in the context of modified gravity in the Palatini formalism. In our model the large CC term is filtered out, and it does not prevent a standard cosmological evolution. We discuss the filter effect in the epochs of radiation and matter domination as well as in the asymptotic de Sitter future. The final expansion rate can be much lower than inferred from the large CC without using a fine-tuned counterterm. Finally, we show that the <b>CC</b> <b>filter</b> works also in the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) metric describing a black hole environment with a CC compatible to the future de Sitter cosmos.

40|$|We {{study the}} role of the cosmological {{constant}} (CC) as a component of dark energy (DE). It is argued that the cosmological term is in general unavoidable and it should not be ignored even when dynamical DE sources are considered. From the theoretical point of view quantum zero-point energy and phase transitions suggest a CC of large magnitude in contrast to its tiny observed value. Simply relieving this disaccord with a counterterm requires extreme fine-tuning which {{is referred to as the}} old CC problem. To avoid it, we discuss some recent approaches for neutralising a large CC dynamically without adding a fine-tuned counterterm. This can be realised by an effective DE component which relaxes the cosmic expansion by counteracting the effect of the large CC. Alternatively, a <b>CC</b> <b>filter</b> is constructed by modifying gravity to make it insensitive to vacuum energy. Comment: 6 pages, no figures, based on a talk presented at PASCOS 201...|$|E

40|$|An {{end-to-end}} {{license plate}} recognition (LPR) system is proposed. It {{is composed of}} pre-processing, detection, segmentation and character recognition to find and recognize plates from camera based still images. The system utilizes connected component (CC) properties to quickly extract the license plate region. A novel two-stage <b>CC</b> <b>filtering</b> is utilized to address both shape and spatial relationship information to produce high precision and recall values for detection. Floating peak and valleys (FPV) of projection profiles are used to cut the license plates into individual characters. A turning function based method is proposed to recognize each character quickly and accurately. It is further accelerated using curvature histogram based support vector machine (SVM). The INFTY dataset is used to train the recognition system. And MediaLab license plate dataset is used for testing. The proposed system achieved 89. 45 % F-measure for detection and 87. 33 % accuracy for overall recognition rate which is comparable to current state-of-the-art systems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} a new method for the binarization of color document images. Initially, {{the colors of}} the document image are reduced to a small number using a new color reduction technique. Specifically, this technique estimates the dominant colors and then assigns the original image colors to them in order that the background and text components to become uniform. Each dominant color defines a color plane in which the connected components (CCs) are extracted. Next, in each color plane a <b>CC</b> <b>filtering</b> procedure is applied which is followed by a grouping procedure. At the end of this stage, blocks of CCs are constructed which are next redefined by obtaining the direction of connection (DOC) property for each CC. Using the DOC property, the blocks of CCs are classified as text or nontext. The identified text blocks are binarized properly using suitable binarization techniques, considering the rest of the pixels as background. The final result is a binary image which contains always black characters in white background independently of the original colors of each text block. The proposed document binarization approach can also be used for binarization of noisy color (or grayscale) document images. Several experiments that confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique are presented. VC 2007 Wile...|$|R
40|$|Targeting of {{agricultural}} conservation practices {{to the most}} effective locations in a watershed can promote wise use of conservation funds to protect surface waters from agricultural nonpoint source pollution. A spatial optimization procedure using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to target six widely used conservation practices, namely no‐tillage, cereal rye cover crops (<b>CC),</b> <b>filter</b> strips (FS), grassed waterways (GW), created wetlands, and restored prairie habitats, in two west‐central Indiana watersheds. These watersheds were small, fairly flat, extensively agricultural, and heavily subsurface tile‐drained. The targeting approach was also {{used to evaluate the}} model's representation of conservation practices in cost and water quality improvement, defined as export of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and sediment from cropped fields. FS, GW, and habitats were the most effective at improving water quality, while CC and wetlands made the greatest water quality improvement in lands with multiple existing conservation practices. Spatial optimization resulted in similar cost‐environmental benefit tradeoff curves for each watershed, with the greatest possible water quality improvement being a reduction in total pollutant loads by approximately 60 %, with nitrogen reduced by 20 ‐ 30 %, phosphorus by 70 %, and sediment by 80 ‐ 90 %...|$|E

40|$|Exposure to air {{pollution}} can elicit cardiovascular health effects. Children and unborn fetuses {{appear to be}} particularly vulnerable. However, the mechanisms involved in cardiovascular damage are poorly understood. It {{has been suggested that}} the oxidative stress generated by {{air pollution}} exposure triggers tissue injury. To investigate whether prenatal exposure can enhance oxidative stress in myocardium of adult animals, mice were placed in a clean chamber (<b>CC,</b> <b>filtered</b> urban air) and in a polluted chamber (PC, Sao Paulo city) during the gestational period and/or for 3 mo after birth, according to 4 protocols: control group-prenatal and postnatal life in CC; prenatal group-prenatal in PC and postnatal life in CC; postnatal group-prenatal in CC and postnatal life in PC; and pre-post group-prenatal and postnatal life in PC. As an indicator of oxidative stress, levels of lipid peroxidation in hearts were measured by malondialdehyde (MDA) quantification and by quantification of the myocardial immunoreactivity for 15 -F 2 t-isoprostane. Ultrastructural studies were performed to detect cellular alterations related to oxidative stress. Concentration of MDA was significantly increased in postnatal (2. 45 +/- 0. 84 nmol/mg) and pre-post groups (3. 84 +/- 1. 39 nmol/mg) compared to the control group (0. 31 +/- 0. 10 nmol/mg) (p <. 01). MDA values in the pre-post group were significantly increased compared to the prenatal group (0. 71 +/- 0. 15 nmol/mg) (p =. 017). Myocardial isoprostane area fraction in the pre-post group was increased compared to other groups (p <=. 01). Results show that ambient levels of air pollution elicit cardiac oxidative stress in adult mice, and that gestational exposure may enhance this effect.

30|$|Halogen lamps {{are used}} for VIS and IR {{photography}}. For UV photography (UVF and UVR) high-Flux 365  nm LED lamps are recommended. The advantages of UV LED lighting are obvious: instant start up, no heating up, very light­weight and sturdy. These LEDs are filtered to cut off any visible light with a UV-pass glass analogous to the B[*]+[*]W 403. This paper considers the UV Fluorescence excited by a 254  nm UV lamp (UVF 254) as an additional and separate imaging method. These lamps must be used with extreme care since this UV range (UVC) is dangerous for the eyes and skin. Infrared fluorescence (IRF) requires illumination in the visible range only, which can be implemented with a white light LED lamp filtered with the X-Nite <b>CC</b> 1 <b>filter</b> to cut off emission in the near-IR.|$|R
40|$|Designing a Business Card Reader (BCR) for mobile devices is a {{challenge}} to the researchers because of huge deformation in acquired images, multiplicity in nature of the business cards and most importantly the computational constraints of the mobile devices. This paper presents a text extraction method designed in our work towards developing a BCR for mobile devices. At first, the background of a camera captured image is eliminated at a coarse level. Then, various rule based techniques are applied on the Connected Components (<b>CC)</b> to <b>filter</b> out the noises and picture regions. The CCs identified as text are then binarized using an adaptive but light-weight binarization technique. Experiments show that the text extraction accuracy is around 98 % {{for a wide range of}} resolutions with varying computation time and memory requirements. The optimum performance is achieved for the images of resolution 1024 x 768 pixels with text extraction accuracy of 98. 54 % and, space and time requirements as 1. 1 MB and 0. 16 seconds respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} a method of color evaluation which can be used by the customer when reviewing color proofs. The method being proposed here incorporates the use of color compensating (<b>CC)</b> <b>filters</b> when evaluating proofs where an overall color correction is necessary. The color balance among pictures that are to appear in close proximity to each other is a major consideration in publication printing as well as certain aspects of commercial printing. There is a need for an effective means of obtaining good reproductions of individual subjects while maintaining a visual consistency between them. In such cases a deliberate departure from normal color balance for a particular image may be desired. By using CC filtration, the customer is able to evaluate a proof and specify the changes in color balance by physical means. However, once a filter is specified as giving the desired visual effect, it must be quantified as to how much and what kind of changes on film are necessary to achieve the correct result. This study attempted to determine if it was possible to quantify filter selections by means of dry dot etching. Manipulations in color balance on film were made to three levels of dot change in an increasing direction and three levels of change in a decreasing direction. These six levels (A, B, C, -A, -B, -C) were made in the cyan printer of one separation, the magenta of another, and the yellow printer of a third. This gave a total of eighteen samples being produced. The dot size changes were accomplished by dry dot etching overall with the assistance of the Kodak Dry Dot Etching System. A panel of judges was used to determine whether or not there is a correlation between CC filtration and the amount of dot change made to a separation in order to achieve the desired visual match between the reference proof and the sample proof. The judges were given the reference proof and one sample at a time to view. The panel attempted to make a visual match in one of two ways: to choose a filter that would allow the reference proof to match the altered proof, or to choose a filter to remove the color cast from the altered proof in order to match the reference proof. The evaluation procedure was followed for all eighteen samples. The correlation coefficients were calculated for each of the three colors changed. The correlation proved to be quite high thereby substantiating the objectives of the filter evaluation method. However upon calculating and plotting the standard deviations of the judges 2 ̆ 7 results, the filter evaluation method proved to be useful when correcting overall color balance only within a certain amount of dot change. The objective of this method was to apply the filter evaluation technique in order to minimize the trial and error approach involved in making color corrections. When applied, this method could result in less waste of labor and materials which in turn results in higher productivity. In the end the separation/correction procedure becomes more cost effective...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{original}} method using a low cost accelerometer and a Kalman-filter based algorithm to monitor cardiopulmonary resuscitation chest compressions (CC) depth. A three-axis accelerometer {{connected to a}} computer was used during <b>CC.</b> A Kalman <b>filter</b> was used to retrieve speed and position from acceleration data. We first tested the algorithm for its accuracy and stability on surrogate data. The device was implemented for CC performed on a manikin. Different accelerometer locations were tested. We used a classical inertial navigation algorithm to reconstruct CPR depth and frequency. The device was found accurate enough to monitor CPR depth and its stability was checked {{for half an hour}} without any drift. Average error on displacement was ± 0. 5 mm.

40|$|Bacteroides fragilis V 479 - 1 (also {{designated}} strain 92) {{has previously}} been shown to contain a conjugative plasmid, pBF 4, that specifies resistance to clindamycin (Cc). A report of inducible tetracycline (Tc) resistance in this strain suggested that this phenotype was also plasmid associated (G. Privitera et al., Nature [London] 278 : 657 - 659, 1979) and prompted further investigation. Mating experiments with V 469 - 1 and a Cc-sensitive derivative of V 479 - 1, V 598, showed that Tc resistance transfer occurred by a conjugation-like event which was insensitive to DNase, was not mediated by donor culture cell-free filtrates, and required cell-to-cell contact. Results from transfer experiments with V 479 - 1 indicated that Tc and Cc resistance determinants were not linked and segregated independently in matings. Progeny recovered from matings with the V 479 - 1 or V 598 donor strain were able to transfer the Tc resistance marker in secondary crosses. Tc resistance transfer from V 479 - 1 or V 598 was greatly stimulated by pregrowth {{in the presence of}} Tc but not Cc. pBF 4 -mediated Cc resistance transfer was not affected by pregrowth in the presence of <b>Cc</b> or Tc. <b>Filter</b> blot DNA hybridization studies revealed that pBF 4 sequences were not involved in either the Tc resistant phenotype or its associated conjugal transfer properties.

Efforts were next made to determine whether a filtrable virus is responsible for the disease. Method In the filtration experiments, 23 inch Berkefeld V and N candles and Seitz discs have been used. The Berkefeld candles were given a preliminary test of their ability to retain bacteria by the filtration of a young (6 to 24 hour) broth culture of a chromogenic strain of B. prodigiosus. A like test was made at each filtration. To determine whether B. prodigiosus or other bacteria were present, two or more blood or plain agar slants were inoculated with 1 loopful of the unfiltered suspensions and other tubes of the same culture media with 0. 5 to 2 cc. of the filtrates. In addition when the suspension was in broth a portion of the filtrate was incubated and examined for growth. The cultures were not discarded until they had been incubated at least 10 days. In all instances the media inoculated with unfiltered material yielded a profuse growth of B. prodigiosus whereas the media inoculated with filtrates remained sterile. The comparative porosity of the Berkefeld filters was determined by the waterflow test of Ward and Tang (2) by which measurement was made of the amount of water that will flow through them in 5 minutes at 10 cm. negative pressure. The Berkefeld V filters and some of the Berkefeld N filters usually permitted from 50 to 80 cc. of water to pass; others of the Berkefeld N filters passed from 28 to 36 <b>cc.</b> of water. <b>Filters</b> that passed a larger quantity of water were discarded irrespective of whether or not they retained bacteria...|$|R
