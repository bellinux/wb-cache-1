The mines in Bayan Obo near Baotou, Inner Mongolia, are currently the largest source of rare-earth metals and are 80% of China's production. In 2010 China accounted for 97% of the global production of 17 rare-earth elements.

5|$|A rising <b>China</b> <b>has</b> been {{increasingly}} interested in Central Asia and the Eurasian Economic Union.

Both China and the union have stated they would benefit from recreating trade routes modelled on the historic Silk Road.|$|E
