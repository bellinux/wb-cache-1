25|$|One of the {{adventure}} tour sites is boating upward on the Chay River into primitive forests, as the river becomes sinuous with several waterfalls and whirlpools until tourists arrive at Tro Mong. This tour sites have been surveyed and included in local travel agents besides cave exploration tour. In Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park, {{there is a}} 50 m-high waterfall, Chai Waterfall. There is a bull field called Ran Bo (Bull Field) because wild bulls usually comes and reproduce in mating season. There are also some interesting tourist attractions in this park like Nước Ngang ("Horizontal Spring"), a spring runs horizontally instead of vertically as usual; Ðá Nằm (Crouching Stone), a stone blockading a stream current; Chân Thớt (Chopping Board), a chopping-board-shaped stone. But above all, the most spectacular scene is this area is Nước Trồi (Surfacing Stream), a stream surfacing from the ground. Several streams here run for a long distance, then disappear under the ground. The provincial Centre for Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng's Ecotourism and Culture currently has 248 boats, <b>creating</b> <b>jobs</b> for 500 locals. Every boat has two trained boatmen earning VND70,000 per day.

500|$|After {{the tunnel}} {{proposal}} was rejected, {{it was once}} again proposed in February 1996 after Wynn officially announced plans for the new resort. The City of Atlantic City requested bids {{for the sale of}} the property in the northern section of the city near the marina, which at one time served as the city's landfill. Wynn won the bid against Donald Trump, {{chief executive officer of the}} Trump Organization. As disputes over the tunnel construction continued, Mirage Resorts announced they were given the options of purchasing the properties required for building the tunnel. Mirage Resorts deemed building the proposed [...] "off-island connector" [...] as [...] "virtually impossible", stating how permits would be difficult to obtain with a land-based alternative available, and the tunnel was determined to be the best option for construction of the Connector. The tunnel was designed to have as little impact on the surrounding environment as possible, with both portals on opposite ends of the community. The design included both portals on opposite ends of the community, with landscaping added between the construction site and adjacent homes. Deliveries of raw materials would take place by barge and construction vehicles would not be traveling via any local streets. Mirage subsidiary president Richard [...] "Skip" [...] Bronson referred to the project as [...] "the nicest tunnel you've never seen." [...] Some opponents described the project as an effort to destroy a stable, middle-class African-American community, while others supported the project as a means of lessening traffic and <b>creating</b> <b>jobs</b> at the new Mirage casino.|$|E
