5|$|This {{approach}} was first {{applied to the}} hydrolysis reaction catalysed by <b>chymotrypsin.</b> Often, the detection of an intermediate is a vital piece of evidence in investigations of what mechanism an enzyme follows. For example, in the ping–pong mechanisms that are shown above, rapid kinetic measurements can follow the release of product P and measure {{the formation of the}} modified enzyme intermediate E*. In the case of <b>chymotrypsin,</b> this intermediate is formed by an attack on the substrate by the nucleophilic serine in the active site and the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E
5|$|The same triad {{geometries}} been converged upon by serine proteases {{such as the}} <b>chymotrypsin</b> and subtilisin superfamilies. Similar convergent {{evolution has}} occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral C3 protease and papain superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The triad of {{cytomegalovirus}} protease uses histidine as {{both the}} acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to >10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from <b>chymotrypsin).</b> This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.|$|E
5|$|The enzymes trypsin and <b>chymotrypsin</b> {{were first}} {{purified}} in the 1930s. A serine {{in each of}} trypsin and <b>chymotrypsin</b> was identified as the catalytic nucleophile (by diisopropyl fluorophosphate modification) in the 1950s. The structure of <b>chymotrypsin</b> was solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1960s, showing {{the orientation of the}} catalytic triad in the active site. Other proteases were sequenced and aligned to reveal a family of related proteases, now called the S1 family. Simultaneously, the structures of the evolutionarily unrelated papain and subtilisin proteases were found to contain analogous triads. The 'charge-relay' mechanism for the activation of the nucleophile by the other triad members was proposed in the late 1960s. As more protease structures were solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1970s and 80s, homologous (such as TEV protease) and analogous (such as papain) triads were found. The MEROPS classification system in the 1990s and 2000s began classing proteases into structurally related enzyme superfamilies and so acts as a database of the convergent evolution of triads in over 20 superfamilies. Understanding how chemical constraints on evolution led to the convergence of so many enzyme families on the same triad geometries has developed in the 2010s. Of particular contention during the 1990s and early 2000s was the contribution of low-barrier hydrogen bonding to catalysis; however, current thinking is that ordinary hydrogen bonding is sufficient to explain the mechanism. The massive body of work on the charge-relay, covalent catalysis used by catalytic triads has led to the mechanism being the best characterised in all of biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. <b>Chymotrypsin,</b> a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E
5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{identity of}} enzymes was still {{unknown in the}} early 1900s. Many scientists observed that enzymatic activity was associated with proteins, but others (such as Nobel laureate Richard Willstätter) argued that proteins were merely carriers for the true enzymes and that proteins per se were incapable of catalysis. In 1926, James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was a pure protein and crystallized it; he did likewise for the enzyme catalase in 1937. The conclusion that pure proteins can be enzymes was definitively demonstrated by John Howard Northrop and Wendell Meredith Stanley, {{who worked on the}} digestive enzymes pepsin (1930), trypsin and <b>chymotrypsin.</b> These three scientists were awarded the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of {{mammalian}} chymotrypsin-like serine proteases in vitro, the best-studied example being barley serpin Zx (BSZx), {{which is}} able to inhibit trypsin and <b>chymotrypsin</b> {{as well as several}} blood coagulation factors. However, close relatives of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases are absent in plants. The RCL of several serpins from wheat grain and rye contain poly-Q repeat sequences similar to those present in the prolamin storage proteins of the endosperm. It has therefore been suggested that plant serpins may function to inhibit proteases from insects or microbes that would otherwise digest grain storage proteins. In support of this hypothesis, specific plant serpins have been identified in the phloem sap of pumpkin (CmPS-1) and cucumber plants. Although an inverse correlation between up-regulation of CmPS-1 expression and aphid survival was observed, in vitro feeding experiments revealed that recombinant CmPS-1 did not appear to affect insect survival.|$|E
5|$|The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by <b>chymotrypsin,</b> a model serine protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the pKa of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH− attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E
25|$|In vivo, <b>chymotrypsin</b> is a {{proteolytic}} enzyme (Serine protease) {{acting in the}} digestive systems of many organisms. It facilitates the cleavage of peptide bonds by a hydrolysis reaction, which despite being thermodynamically favorable occurs extremely slowly {{in the absence of}} a catalyst. The main substrates of <b>chymotrypsin</b> are peptide bonds in which the amino acid N-terminal to the bond is a tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, or leucine. Like many proteases, <b>chymotrypsin</b> will also hydrolyse amide bonds in vitro, a virtue that enabled the use of substrate analogs such as N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl amide for enzyme assays.|$|E

25|$|The Ge2 epitope is {{antigenic}} only on glycophorin D {{and is a}} cryptic antigen in glycophorin C. It {{is located}} within exon 2 and is sensitive to trypsin and papain but resistant to <b>chymotrypsin</b> and pronase. The Ge3 epitope is encoded by exon 3. It is sensitive to trypsin but resistant to <b>chymotrypsin,</b> papain and pronase. It is thought to lie in the between amino acids 42-50 in glycophorin C (residues 21-49 in glycophorin D). Ge4 is located within the first 21 amino acids of glycophorin C. It is sensitive to trypsin, papain, pronase and neuraminidase.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of trypsin is {{not affected by}} the enzyme inhibitor tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, TPCK, which deactivates <b>chymotrypsin.</b> This is important because, in some applications, like mass spectrometry, the specificity of cleavage is important.|$|E
25|$|The rare Duch (Dh) antigen was {{discovered}} in Aarhus, Denmark (1968) and is also found on glycophorin C. It {{is due to a}} C to T transition at nucleotide 40 resulting in the replacement of leucine by phenylalanine. This antigen is sensitive to trypsin but resistant to <b>chymotrypsin</b> and Endo F.|$|E
25|$|Proteases are {{involved}} in digesting long protein chains into shorter fragments by splitting the peptide bonds that link amino acid residues. Some detach the terminal amino acids from the protein chain (exopeptidases, such as aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidase A); others attack internal peptide bonds of a protein (endopeptidases, such as trypsin, <b>chymotrypsin,</b> pepsin, papain, elastase).|$|E
25|$|<b>Chymotrypsin</b> cleaves peptide bonds {{by attacking}} the unreactive {{carbonyl}} {{group with a}} powerful nucleophile, the serine 195 residue located in the active site of the enzyme, which briefly becomes covalently bonded to the substrate, forming an enzyme-substrate intermediate. Along with histidine 57 and aspartic acid 102, this serine residue constitutes the catalytic triad of the active site.|$|E
25|$|Aprotinin is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of several serine proteases, specifically trypsin, <b>chymotrypsin</b> and plasmin at {{a concentration of}} about 125,000 IU/ml, and kallikrein at 300,000 IU/ml. Its action on kallikrein leads to the inhibition {{of the formation of}} factor XIIa. As a result, both the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and fibrinolysis are inhibited. Its action on plasmin independently slows fibrinolysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of TEV protease has been solved by X-ray crystallography. It {{is composed of}} two β-barrels and a flexible C-terminal tail and displays structural homology to the <b>chymotrypsin</b> superfamily of proteases (PA clan, C4 family by MEROPS classification). Although homologous to cellular serine proteases (such as trypsin, elastase, thrombin etc.), TEV protease uses a cysteine as its catalytic nucleophile (as do many other viral proteases).|$|E
25|$|The {{cells are}} filled with {{granules}} containing the digestive enzymes. These are secreted in an inactive form called (termed zymogens or proenzymes). When released into the duodenum, they are activated by the enzyme enteropeptidase present in {{the lining of the}} duodenum. The proenzymes are cleaved, creating a cascade of activating enzymes: enteropeptidase activates the proenzyme trypsinogen by cleaving it to form trypsin. The free trypsin then cleaves the rest of the trypsinogen, as well as chymotrypsinogen to its active form <b>chymotrypsin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} multidomain organization seen in proteins {{is that of}} {{a single}} domain repeated in tandem. The domains may interact with each other (domain-domain interaction) or remain isolated, like beads on string. The giant 30,000 residue muscle protein titin comprises about 120 fibronectin-III-type and Ig-type domains. In the serine proteases, a gene duplication event has {{led to the formation of}} a two β-barrel domain enzyme. The repeats have diverged so widely that there is no obvious sequence similarity between them. The active site is located at a cleft between the two β-barrel domains, in which functionally important residues are contributed from each domain. Genetically engineered mutants of the <b>chymotrypsin</b> serine protease were shown to have some proteinase activity even though their active site residues were abolished and it has therefore been postulated that the duplication event enhanced the enzyme's activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the β-barrel pore is facilitated with a drop in pH. To form the barrel when the pH drops, PA63 domain 2 must undergo the greatest conformation change. Upon examination {{of the structure of}} domain 2 (Fig. 7), one can see that this domain contains a Greek-key motif (the gold portion in Fig. 7). A general schematic of a Greek-key motif is shown in Fig. 8. Attached to the Greek-key in domain 2 is a large disordered loop. The necessity of this loop in pore formation is shown through using mutagenesis and proteolysis of the loop with <b>chymotrypsin.</b> Additional electrophysiological measurements of cysteine substitutions place the amino acids of this loop inside the lumen of the membrane inserted pore. The disordered loop in domain 2 also has a pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, which is a pattern conserved in the membrane-spanning portions of porins. The only problem is that the loop is not large enough to span a membrane in a β-barrel. This membrane insertion could only occur with additional conformational changes. A large conformational change takes place where the Greek-key motif unfolds, forming a β-hairpin that projects downward into the membrane and forms a β-barrel with the other 6 monomers of the complex (figures 9a and 9b). The final pore has a diameter of 12 Å (1.2nm), which fits the theoretical value of this model.|$|E

[...] To show that it was DNA rather than some small amount of RNA, protein, or some other cell component that was responsible for transformation, Avery and his colleagues used a number of biochemical tests. [...] They found that trypsin, <b>chymotrypsin</b> and ribonuclease (enzymes that break apart proteins or RNA) did not affect it, but an enzyme preparation of [...] "deoxyribonucleodepolymerase" [...] (a crude preparation, obtainable from a number of animal sources, that could break down DNA) destroyed the extract's transforming power.|$|E
500|$|... a {{significant}} decrease of the larvae damage, indicating that {{a high level of}} constitutive protection is superior to an inducible defence mechanism. However, the continuous activation of prosystemin is costly, affecting the growth, the physiology and the reproductive success of tomato plants. [...] When systemin was silenced, production of protease inhibitors in tomato was severely impaired and larvae feeding on the plants grew three times as fast. HypSys caused similar changes in gene expression in tobacco, for example polyphenol oxidase activity increased tenfold in tobacco leaves and protease inhibitors caused a 30% decrease in <b>chymotrypsin</b> activity within three days of wounding. When HypSys was over-expressed in tobacco, larvae feeding on transgenic plants weighed half as much after ten days feeding, as those feeding on normal plants. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide increased in the vasculature tissues when the production of systemin, HypSys or AtPep1 is induced, this may also be involved in initiating systemic acquired resistance.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Chymotrypsin</b> ( [...] , chymotrypsins A and B, alpha-chymar ophth, avazyme, chymar, chymotest, enzeon, quimar, quimotrase, alpha-chymar, {{alpha-chymotrypsin}} A, alpha-chymotrypsin) is a {{digestive enzyme}} component of pancreatic juice {{acting in the}} duodenum where it performs proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins and polypeptides. <b>Chymotrypsin</b> preferentially cleaves peptide amide bonds where the side-chain of the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile amide bond (the P1 position) is a large hydrophobic amino acid (tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine). These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their sidechain that fits into a 'hydrophobic pocket' (the S1 position) of the enzyme. It is activated {{in the presence of}} trypsin. The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate P1 sidechain and the enzyme S1 binding cavity accounts for the substrate specificity of this enzyme. [...] <b>Chymotrypsin</b> also hydrolyzes other amide bonds in peptides at slower rates, particularly those containing leucine and methionine at the P1 position.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Chymotrypsin</b> is {{synthesized}} in {{the pancreas}} by protein biosynthesis as a [...] called chymotrypsinogen that is enzymatically inactive. Trypsin activates chymotrypsinogen by cleaving peptidic bonds in positions Arg15 - Ile16 and produces π-Chymotrypsin. In turn, aminic group (-NH3+) of the Ile16 residue {{interacts with the}} side chain of Glu194, producing the [...] "oxyanion hole" [...] and the hydrophobic [...] "S1 pocket". Moreover, <b>Chymotrypsin</b> induces its own activation by cleaving in positions 14-15, 146-147 and 148-149, producing α-Chymotrypsin (which is more active and stable than π-Chymotrypsin). The resulting molecule is a three-polypeptide molecule interconnected via disulfide bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Protein {{digestion}} {{occurs in}} the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes, pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and <b>chymotrypsin</b> secreted by the pancreas, break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids. [...] The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors, the zymogens. [...] For example, trypsin is secreted by pancreas {{in the form of}} trypsinogen, which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin. [...] Trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was found}} that the {{reaction}} of <b>chymotrypsin</b> with its substrate takes place in two stages, an initial “burst” phase {{at the beginning of the}} reaction and a steady-state phase following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The mode of action of <b>chymotrypsin</b> explains this as hydrolysis takes place in two steps. First acylation of the substrate to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate and then deacylation in order to return the enzyme to its original state. This occurs via the concerted action of the three amino acid residues in the catalytic triad. [...] Aspartate hydrogen bonds to the N-δ hydrogen of histidine, increasing the pKa of its ε nitrogen and thus making it able to deprotonate serine. It is this deprotonation that allows the serine side chain to act as a nucleophile and bind to the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon of the protein main chain. Ionization of the carbonyl oxygen is stabilized by formation of two hydrogen bonds to adjacent main chain N-hydrogens. This occurs in the oxyanion hole. This forms a tetrahedral adduct and breakage of the peptide bond. An acyl-enzyme intermediate, bound to the serine, is formed, and the newly formed amino terminus of the cleaved protein can dissociate. In the second reaction step, a water molecule is activated by the basic histidine, and acts as a nucleophile. The oxygen of water attacks the carbonyl carbon of the serine-bound acyl group, resulting in formation of a second tetrahedral adduct, regeneration of the serine -OH group, and release of a proton, as well as the protein fragment with the newly formed carboxyl terminus ...|$|E
2500|$|Typically, a high {{fraction}} of the protein's residues are mutated one by one to identify clusters of residues that are well-ordered in the folded transition state. [...] The interactions of these residues can be validated using double-mutant-cycle phi analysis, in which {{the effects of the}} single mutants are compared with those of the double mutant. [...] In general, the mutations are conservative and replace the original residue with a smaller one (cavity-creating mutations), most commonly alanine; however, others such as tyrosine-to-phenylalanine, isoleucine-to-valine and threonine-to-serine mutations are also used. [...] Examples of proteins that have been studied by phi value analysis include <b>chymotrypsin</b> inhibitor, SH3 domains, individual domains of proteins L and G, ubiquitin, and barnase.|$|E

Proteases present in blood serum (thrombin, plasmin, Hageman factor, etc.) play important role in blood-clotting, as well as lysis of the clots, and the correct action of the immune system. Other proteases are present in leukocytes (elastase, cathepsin G) and play several different roles in metabolic control. Some snake venoms are also proteases, such as pit viper haemotoxin and interfere with the victim's blood clotting cascade.

Amber Disease is a chronic {{infection}} of the stomach of grass grub larvae, and is caused by two strains of bacteria, Serratia entomophila and Serratia proteamaculans. The bacteria Serratia entomophila and is available for purchase commercially as a biocontrol agent. Once these pathogenic bacteria have been ingested, the infected larvae stop eating within 2–5 days, and gain an amber colouring due to the stomach emptying, and the levels of major digestive enzymes (trypsin and <b>chymotrypsin)</b> in the mid-gut decreasing. However, the infected larvae won’t die for another 1–3 months after becoming infected. Amber disease can carry over into following generations as it is applied at a subsurface level of soil.

These responses were dependent on prior treatment with tissue transglutaminase. Α2-gliadin differs from the other α-gliadins, specifically because it contains an insert of 14 amino acids. This particular insertion creates 6 T-cell sites where, in the most similar gliadins, there are 2 or less sites.
