40|$|We examine <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> {{energy use}} and <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> CO[subscript 2] {{emissions}} {{associated with the}} development of photovoltaics (PVs) on a global scale. The analysis is focused on the performance of five countries with the largest installed PV capacities—Italy, Japan, Germany, Spain, and the United States—and on the aggregate values for the world (23 countries). The historical record shows that, during the past 19 years of development, the installed base has grown to 64 GW, with an average annual growth rate of almost 40 %. During that period the manufacturing and use of photovoltaics has led to a <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> consumption of approximately 286 PJ of energy, and <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> emissions of 34 Mt of CO[subscript 2] {{as a result of a}} considerable payback time. While energy/CO[subscript 2] payback time is not unique to PV systems, it plays a larger role in the development of new energy systems than other low-carbon systems. PV energy/CO[subscript 2] payback time decreases with the following measures: installation of PVs in locations with a large PV potential and high CO[subscript 2] emissions of the electricity replaced, manufacturing PVs at locations with low CO[subscript 2] emissions/kW h of electricity used in the production, recycling PVs, and increasing PV conversion efficiency. The analysis is therefore extended into the future for three scenarios with different maximum capacities of photovoltaics (20 %, 50 %, and 100 % of total electricity production). In these scenarios, <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> CO 2 emissions can be reduced by 4 %, 9 %, and 18 %, respectively, over the long term (by the year 2050). Short-term CO[subscript 2] increases during growth versus long-term CO[subscript 2] reduction present a trade-off in developmental growth strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{modified}} {{theory of}} planned behaviour (acronym CASCADA) proposes that Conscious knowledge precedes {{a change in}} Attitude, which in turn precedes positive deviations from negative Subjective norms, intention to Change, perception of Agency to change, Discussion of possible action, and Action itself. We used this as a results chain to investigate gender-specific behaviour dynamics in chemical-free dengue prevention. Methods Secondary analysis of the Mexican arm of a cluster randomised controlled trial used household survey data on intermediate outcomes of dengue prevention behaviour. We used a matrix of odds ratios between outcomes, transformed to a symmetrical range (− 1, 1), to compute fuzzy transitive closure of the results chain for control and intervention clusters, then {{for male and female}} respondents separately in each group. Transitive closure of a map computes the influence of each factor on each other factor, taking account of all influences in the system. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>net</b> influence was the sum of influences across the results chain. Results Responses of 5042 women and 1143 men in 45 intervention clusters contrasted with those of 5025 women and 1179 men in 45 control clusters. Control clusters showed a distal block (negative influence) in the results chain with a <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> influence of 0. 88; intervention clusters showed no such block and a <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> influence of 1. 92. Female control respondents, like the overall control picture, showed a distal block, whereas female intervention responses showed no such blocks (<b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> influence 0. 78 and 1. 73 respectively). Male control respondents showed weak distal blocks. Male intervention responses showed several new negative influences and a reduction of <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> influence (1. 38 in control and 1. 11 in intervention clusters). Conclusions The overall influence of the intervention across the results chain fits with the trial findings, but is different for women and men. Among women, the intervention overcame blocks and increased the <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> influence of knowledge on action. Among men, the intervention did not reinforce prevention behaviour. This might be related to emphasis, during the intervention, on women’s participation and empowerment. The fuzzy transitive closure of the CASCADA map usefully highlights the differences between gender-specific results chains. Trial registration ISRCTN 27581154...|$|R

40|$|Multi-objective {{optimization}} method using {{genetic algorithm}} is employed {{in order to}} optimize design and operating parameters of a high temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cell based {{combined heat and power}} system. Net electrical efficiency of the plant, indicating the system's performance (to be maximized) and the total capital cost (to be minimized) are considered as optimization objectives. Current density (indicating the stack size), steam to carbon ratio, burner outlet temperature and auxiliary to process fuel ratio have been chosen as design parameters. Two different multi-objective optimization approaches have been utilized: steady state (without degradation) and long-term optimization while considering the degradation in fuel cell stack and the fuel processor. The results of the optimization procedures are Pareto frontiers which are a set of optimal points each of which is a trade-off between the considered objective functions. The performance indexes and operating conditions of three points with the maximum <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> electrical efficiency, minimum capital cost, and the same fuel cell area as that of the initial design are compared. It can be observed that while attempting to maximize the electrical efficiency, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> electrical efficiency of 29. 96 % can be achieved although it results in a total capital cost of 115711 €. On the other hand, the capital cost can be reduced down to 39, 929 € which significantly diminishes <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> electrical efficiency. Finally, by locating the point on the Pareto frontier in which the fuel cell area is {{the same as that of}} the initial design, a <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> electrical efficiency of 27. 07 % was achieved which is 1 % higher than the value obtained using the operating conditions of the initial design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Changes in {{the timing}} of phenological events may cause the annual carbon budget of {{deciduous}} forests to change. Therefore, one should take such events into account when evaluating the effects of global warming on deciduous forests. In this article, {{we report on the}} results of numerical experiments done with a model that includes a phenological module simulating {{the timing of}} bud burst and other phenological events and estimating maximum leaf area index. Results This study suggests that the negative effects of warming on tree productivity (net primary production) outweigh the positive effects of a prolonged growing season. An increase in air temperature by 3 °C (5 °C) reduces <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> primary production by 21. 3 % (34. 2 %). Similarly, <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> ecosystem production (the difference between <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> primary production and heterotrophic respiration) decreases by 43. 5 % (64. 5 %) when temperatures are increased by 3 °C (5 °C). However, the positive effects of CO 2 enrichment (2 × CO 2) outweigh the negative effects of warming (Conclusion Although the model was calibrated and validated for a specific forest ecosystem, the implications of the study may be extrapolated to deciduous forests in cool-temperate zones. These forests share common features, and it can be conjectured that carbon stocks would increase in such forests in the face of doubled CO 2 and increased temperatures as long as the increase in temperature does not exceed 5 °C. </p...|$|R

According to the US National Science and Technology Council, the environmental impacts of aircraft, including serious noise problems, are likely to limit air transportation growth in the 21 st century.

The model is designed to capture a first approximation of all aspects of the decision, and the findings give a broad picture of the current state of silent aircraft development. The model is simple, but probabilistic and comprehensive enough to make a first estimate of the business case of this long-term project with huge uncertainty.

40|$|In {{experimental}} ditches {{gross and}} net production were estimated from continuous dissolved oxygen measurements for individual days over a two year period. There are two {{series of three}} ditches: the first is dominated by benthic algae, and the second by submerged macrophytes. Each series receives three different levels of external nutrient (N,P) loading, referred to as reference, medium-loaded and highest-loaded level. Generally, there were no vertical oxygen gradients, and a one-box model satisfied. For periods with O 2 -stratification a two-box model has been developed. This model assumes that primary production only occurs in a well mixed top layer. In both series, the cumulative gross primary production over two years {{was positively related to}} the level of external nutrient input. In the ditches dominated by benthic algae, a continuous increase in <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> systems production, that was positively related to the level of external nutrient input, was observed. In the macrophyte ditches, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> systems production was positively related to the level of nutrient input during the first half year, but after that showed an irregular pattern.

40|$|Despite {{substantial}} {{consumer demand}} {{and willingness to}} pay premium prices for organically grown fruit, apple growers in Vermont and other New England states {{have been slow to}} adopt certified organic practices. Barriers cited in the past to increased adoption of organic apple production in the region include susceptibility of traditionally grown cultivars to apple scab, lack of effective insect pest management materials, and few available effective options for fruit thinning. Recent changes in apple cultivar plantings in the region, introduction of new insect pest management materials, and advances in crop thinning justified an evaluation of organic apple production systems containing cultivars identified as important {{to the future of the}} apple industry. In 2006, two apple orchards were established at the University of Vermont Horticulture Research and Education Center in South Burlington, VT to comprehensively evaluate the five commercially-important apple cultivars of `Ginger Gold 2 ̆ 7, `Honeycrisp 2 ̆ 7, `Liberty 2 ̆ 7, `Macoun 2 ̆ 7, and `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7 over eight growing seasons in two organically-managed orchard production systems, including a newly-planted high-density orchard (Orchard 1) and in an existing, medium-density orchard which was top-grafted to the new cultivars (Orchard 2). Parameters for tree growth and survival, crop yield, disease and arthropod pest incidence on foliage and fruit, and long-term economic return, including a twenty-year projection of net present value (NPV) of each cultivar in the two systems were evaluated in this study. `Ginger Gold 2 ̆ 7, despite high incidence of some diseases on foliage and fruit, performed the best in both orchard systems overall. The cultivar was among the cultivars with the highest measurements of tree growth. `Ginger Gold 2 ̆ 7, along with `Honeycrisp 2 ̆ 7, had the highest <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> crop yield per tree in Orchard 1 and the highest in Orchard 2. Notably, apple scab on `Honeycrisp 2 ̆ 7 foliage and fruit and `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7 fruit in both orchards was at a level that was not significantly different from `Liberty 2 ̆ 7, a scab-resistant cultivar on which no scab was observed. However, `Honeycrisp 2 ̆ 7 had the highest incidence of fruit rots in both orchards, but it was not significantly different than `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7 in Orchard 1. Management of lepidopteran pests of fruit was a major challenge on all cultivars over the years of the study. For most of the tree growth parameters and <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> crop yield, `Liberty 2 ̆ 7 was among the lowest group of cultivars in both orchards. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>net</b> crop yield of both `Macoun 2 ̆ 7 and `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7 were also among the lowest in both orchards with the top-grafted `Macoun 2 ̆ 7 and `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7 trees having significant tree death compared to the other cultivars in Orchard 2.

Studies were conducted to evaluate seasonal patterns of soil inorganic N pools as well as rates of nitrification and N mineralization of three soil layers under four tree spacing treatments. Results showed tree spacing significantly affected annual net N mineralization, whereas inorganic N content in surface soils was significantly affected by tree spacing only during the growing season. The total annual <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> N mineralization ranged from 80. 3 – 136. 0 mg·kg− 1 in the surface soils (0 – 20 cm), whereas the <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> N mineralization of 6 × 6 m and 4. 5 × 8 m spacings was 65 % and 24 % {{higher than that of}} the 5 × 5 m, respectively.

Interannual variations of daily mean air temperature and daily precipitation near the glacier and daily runoff rate at a proglacial stream averaged over the ablation period (June to September) indicate that the increasing rates of 1968 － 2010 and 1985 － 2010 are 0. 012 ℃/yr and 0. 014 ℃/yr, 0. 024 mm/yr and 0. 041 mm/yr, and 0. 092 mm/yr and 0. 25 mm/yr, respectively. Thus, the runoff rate and precipitation tend to increase greatly in the recent years. The daily glacier-melt runoff rate averaged over the ablation period was obtained on the assumption of zero englacial water storage change over the period. As a result, the glacier-melt runoff rate exhibits the linear relationship with the daily mean air temperature near the glacier. The summer ablation of the glacier was larger than the winter accumulation in many years, consequently indicating that the net mass balance is negative in almost all the years. Especially since 1988, the net mass balance is negative in any years.

Five precipitation-net snowmelt response categories were identified: flat; persistent melt; persistent accumulation; late melt; and late accumulation. Persistent melt events, which were characterized by concomitantly increasing <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> snowmelt and precipitation, had the highest mean peak flow and water available for runoff values of the response categories. Large, contiguous regions of significant wavelet coherence at multiple temporal scales were observed in both the persistent melt and persistent accumulation categories, but the phase difference distributions indicated differing snowpack dynamics with pulses of precipitation leading pulses of snowmelt in the former and precipitation being absorbed by the snowpack in the latter. High water available for runoff totals and peak flows were observed in each of the five response categories, but a dewpoint temperature consistently above 0. 5 °C, elevated wind speeds, and a high fraction of precipitation falling as rain in the persistent melt category facilitated rapid snowmelt rates which were often synchronized with precipitation. Wavelet coherence showed this synchronization to be significant across all temporal scales and time periods for the two largest peak flows in the study, indicating that tightly coupled rainfall-synchrony is essential in generating an extreme rain-on-snow flood. By quantifying the amount and timing of net snowmelt, the categorization scheme provides a means of distinguishing among rain-on-snow events and predicting peak discharge magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Generic {{advertising}} {{of fluid}} milk and cheese represents the principal promotional activity undertaken with the $ 370 {{million per year}} provided by dairy farmers and fluid milk processors. This article describes a stock-flow-feedback simulation model that includes 17 intermediate and final dairy products, short-term and long-term milk supply response and government policies that influence the impacts of generic advertising on net revenues for dairy farmers. Permanent increases in generic advertising expenditures increase net revenues for dairy farmers, with a <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> benefit to cost ratio of 2. 8. Permanent decreases produce a larger reduction in net revenues and indicate a net benefit to cost ratio larger than 4. 5. Spending {{a larger proportion of}} existing generic advertising funds on cheese rather than fluid milk would also markedly increased dairy farmer net revenues. Generic advertising increases net revenues for dairy farmers even when industry supply response and government regulation are accounted for...|$|R
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1973 a {{comprehensive}} measurement program was undertaken {{of the components of}} the surface energy balance over a tundra polygon near Tuktoyaktuk, N. W. T. It was found that under conditions where the development of an atmospheric boundary layer is incomplete, to prohibit the use of aerodynamic equations for calculating the sensible and latent heat flux components from wind, temperature and humidity data, simple index models may provide reasonable estimates of the ground heat flux. Two index models for predicting the ground heat flux during the thawing period are presented. One model is based on the use of <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> radiation; the other on cumulative air temperature measurements. The models are verified by measurements of ground heat flux taken at a depth of approximately 5 cm. The results suggest net radiation is the dominant energy source governing the supply of ground heat during th...|$|R
40|$|A {{main feature}} characterising the {{transition}} process of Eastern Germany is the scope with which east-west migration took place before, during, {{and after the}} German unification. Overall, roughly 2. 77 million East Germans left their territory to migrate to the west between 1989 and 2002 (gross migration). Taking into account west-east migration, <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> migration amounted to 1. 3 million persons. These figures not only highlight {{the relevance of the}} migration phenomenon in the east-west German context. They also raise questions about the reasons and the determinants of this migration movement. Dealing with the influencing factors of emigration is particularly important against the backdrop of high expected east-west European migration movements in the course of and due to the eastern enlargement of the EU. Thus it is the objective of this paper to give an overview over the current state of economic research to migration in the east-west German context and in particular its determinants. The main studies within this area will be described and critically discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{population}} 2 ̆ 019 s average stature reflects its <b>cumulative</b> <b>net</b> {{nutrition and}} provides important insight when more traditional measures for economic well-being is scarce or unreliable. Heights on the US Central Plains {{did not experience}} the antebellum paradox experienced in Eastern urban areas, and statures increased markedly in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Known for offering migrants economic opportunity, the Central Plains received migrant in-flows from Northern, Southern, and Eastern Europe, and US statures were the tallest in the World. Within the US, individuals from the South were taller than individuals from the North, East, and West. Whites were taller than blacks on the Central Plains where slavery was not the primary labor force, but whites were also taller than blacks in the American South where it was. Immigrants from industrialized Europe were shorter than black and white Americans but taller than Latin Americans and Asians...|$|R
