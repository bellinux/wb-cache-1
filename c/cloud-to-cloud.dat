The temporal history of RF radiation of these frequencies consists of a sequence of discrete pulses.

40|$|The {{universality}} of interstellar turbulence is examined from observed structure functions of 27 giant molecular clouds and Monte Carlo modeling. We {{show that the}} structure functions, dv=v 0 l^gamma, derived from wide field imaging of CO J= 1 - 0 emission from individual clouds are described by a narrow range in the scaling exponent, gamma, and the scaling coefficient, v 0. The similarity of turbulent structure functions emphasizes the {{universality of}} turbulence in the molecular interstellar medium and accounts for the <b>cloud-to-cloud</b> size-line width relationship initially identified by Larson (1981). The degree of turbulence universality is quantified by Monte Carlo simulations that reproduce the mean squared velocity residuals of the observed <b>cloud-to-cloud</b> relationship. Upper limits to the variation of the scaling amplitudes and exponents for molecular clouds are ~ 10 - 20 %. The measured invariance of turbulence for molecular clouds with vastly different sizes, environments, and star formation activity suggests a common formation mechanism such as converging turbulent flows within the diffuse ISM and a limited contribution of energy from sources within the cloud with respect to large scale driving mechanisms.

This is the most punctual work to devise an operator’s based Inter Cloud financial model for investigating shopper to-Cloud and <b>Cloud-to-Cloud</b> connections. While economic experiences in the middle of shoppers and Cloud suppliers are displayed as a numerous to-numerous arrangement, financial experiences among Clouds are demonstrated as a coalition diversion. To reinforce numerous to-numerous customer to-Cloud transactions, this work devises a novel association convention and a novel arrangement technique that is portrayed by both 1) Adaptive concession rate (ACR) and 2) Minimally sufficient concession (MSC). Scientific confirmations demonstrate that specialists receiving the ACR-MSC methodology arrange ideally {{on the grounds that they}} make least measures of concession. Via naturally controlling concession rates, observational results demonstrate that the ACR-MSC methodology is proficient in light of the fact that it accomplishes fundamentally higher utilities than the altered concession-rate time-subordinate procedure.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the dust {{properties}} of the diffuse interstellar medium exhibit variations towards different sight-lines on a large scale. We have investigated the variability of the dust characteristics on a small scale, and from <b>cloud-to-cloud.</b> We use low-resolution spectro-polarimetric data obtained {{in the context of the}} Large Interstellar Polarisation Survey (LIPS) towards 59 sight-lines in the Southern Hemisphere, and we fit these data using a dust model composed of silicate and carbon particles with sizes from the molecular to the sub-micrometre domain. Large (> 6 nm) silicates of prolate shape account for the observed polarisation. For 32 sight-lines we complement our data set with UVES archive high-resolution spectra, which enable us to establish the presence of single-cloud or multiple-clouds towards individual sight-lines. We find that the majority of these 35 sight-lines intersect two or more clouds, while eight of them are dominated by a single absorbing cloud. We confirm several correlations between extinction and parameters of the Serkowski law with dust parameters, but we also find previously undetected correlations between these parameters that are valid only in single-cloud sight-lines. We find that interstellar polarisation from multiple-clouds is smaller than from single-cloud sight-lines, showing that the presence of a second or more clouds depolarises the incoming radiation. We find large variations of the dust characteristics from <b>cloud-to-cloud.</b> However, when we average a sufficiently large number of clouds in single-cloud or multiple-cloud sight-lines, we always retrieve similar mean dust parameters. The typical dust abundances of the single-cloud cases are [C]/[H] = 92 ppm and [Si]/[H] = 20 ppm. Comment: A&A accepte...|$|E

We briefly review the analysis methods used to recover the velocity structure function from spectroscopic imaging {{and the application of}} these tools on sets of cloud data. These studies identify a near-invariant velocity structure function that is independent of local the environment and star formation activity. Such universality accounts for the <b>cloud-to-cloud</b> scaling law between the global line-width and size of molecular clouds found by Larson (1981) and constrains the degree to which supersonic turbulence can regulate star formation. In addition, the evidence for large scale driving sources necessary to sustain supersonic flows is summarized...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{scanning}} technologies {{has become}} an important tool in many engineering projects and applications. The output of laser measuring is the point cloud, which is processed {{in a way that}} makes it suitable for different applications. Processing of point cloud data is achieved through laser scanning software packages. Depending on the field of application, these packages have many different kinds of functions and methods that can be used. The main processing tasks used on a laser scanning software package include registration, modelling and texture mapping. Investigation and comparison of two laser scanning processing packages (Leica Cyclone and InnovMetric PolyWorks) are performed in this study. The theoretical and mathematical backgrounds of the above functions are presented and discussed. The available methods and functions used by each of the packages for these tasks are addressed and discussed. By using sample data, these functions are trailed and their results are compared and analyzed. The results from registration tests show the same results on both packages for the registration using target methods. Although, the results of <b>cloud-to-cloud</b> registration show some deviation from target registration results, they are more close to each other in both packages than to the target registration results. This indicates the efficiency of <b>cloud-to-cloud</b> methods in averaging the total registration error on all used points, unlike target registration methods. The modelling tests show more differences in the accuracy of generated models between the two packages. For both fitting and surface construction methods, PolyWorks showed better results and capabilities for three-dimensional modelling.
