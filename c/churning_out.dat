By the end of the year, others were writing Yiddish plays as well, such as Moses Horowitz with Der tiranisher bankir (The Tyrannical Banker), or Grodner with Curve un ganev (Prostitute and Thief), and Yiddish theater had become big theater, with elaborate sets, duelling choruses, and extras to fill out crowd scenes.|$|E

25|$|By March 1942, the {{completion}} {{date for the}} two-ocean Navy program, originally projected for 1947, had already been pushed forward to 1945-46. Every major shipyard in the United States was either building or repairing some kind of Navy vessel. Many vessels would be completed {{more than a year}} ahead of the schedules specified by their original contracts, including aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and other light warships.

Caresse grew up amid the social constraints imposed by her upper-class family in New York. She had a doomed and troublesome romanticism with Harry Crosby. She participated in a decade or more of intellectual lovers in Paris during the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|One primary underlining {{theme in}} Petals of Blood {{is the failure}} of the ruling Kenyan elite to {{adequately}} {{meet the needs of the}} people. After the new postcolonial governments come to power, the leaders maintain their connections with the outgoing colonizers, thus marginalizing the everyman. In the novel, the elite are portrayed as both government officials and businessmen who violate the villagers of Ilmorog in both passive and aggressive ways. The corrupt system acts like a chain—in the novel, when the government’s lawyers declare that they have solved the murder cases, the people of Ilmorog realize that as long as the corrupt system stays in place and continues <b>churning</b> <b>out</b> corrupt individuals, there will be no change.|$|E
25|$|The {{threat of}} America's entry into World War I had seriously {{weakened}} {{the real estate}} market, so in early 1915 Lane accepted a friend's offer of a stopgap job as an editorial assistant {{on the staff of}} the San Francisco Bulletin. The stopgap turned into a watershed. She immediately caught the attention of her editors not only through her talents as a writer in her own right, but also as a highly skilled editor for other writers. Before long, her photo and byline were running in the Bulletin daily, <b>churning</b> <b>out</b> formulaic romantic fiction serials that would run for weeks at a time. Lane's first-hand accounts of the lives of Henry Ford, Charlie Chaplin, Jack London, and Herbert Hoover were published in book form.|$|E
25|$|Most books either receive {{immediate}} {{attention in the}} market, or fail. The successful sell most of their copies {{within a year or}} two of publication. Now and then a book sells well and continues to sell for many years. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were drastic exceptions to both patterns. Both works sold enough to induce the publishers to continue printing, but for the first twenty-five years of The Hobbit's life, and the first ten years of that of The Lord of the Rings, sales {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic amounted to little more than a few thousand copies per year. It was not until the mid-1960s that social trends flowered into an acceptance and even hunger for the modern fantasy, which Tolkien had developed so long before almost on his own. Formerly an obscure author, Tolkien exploded into popularity. Despite the fact that The Hobbit had already gone through fifteen printing runs and two distinct editions by then, suddenly all of them were collectible. By that time, printing presses were <b>churning</b> <b>out</b> more copies every year than had been sold those first twenty-five.|$|E

500|$|In retrospect, Ogawa {{noted that}} the final period {{proved to be a}} large {{challenge}} for the team. Not only was the Xbox360 release imminent, but the PlayStation3 launch was scheduled not long afterwards. This put tremendous pressure on the team to develop for both systems. Similarly, series producer Takashi Iizuka recalled, [...] "we didn't have any time to polish and we were just <b>churning</b> <b>out</b> content as quick as we could." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Mars {{said that}} he was no longer {{interested}} in <b>churning</b> <b>out</b> songs for other artists, he explained [...] "There's a piece of me that's no longer there, which was basically let me write a song and then sell it. That was back in the day when I was struggling and hustling to pay rent. I was selling songs for 250 bucks." [...] Despite this, they have produced a song for Adele's third studio album 25, entitled [...] "All I Ask". This marked their last production as a team.|$|E
500|$|Echoing the magazine's earlier {{support for}} the tour, Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker praised Harrison's [...] "nifty slide guitar" [...] on the opening song and {{throughout}} the album, which he felt [...] "should certainly do a tremendous amount to salvage George's battered reputation". In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner similarly opined that [...] "Hari's on Tour" [...] "boasts some mean licks" [...] while commenting that neither the tour nor the album [...] "warrant all the abuse they got". Writing more recently for AllMusic, Richard Ginell describes the recording as [...] "Tom Scott's L.A. Express <b>churning</b> <b>out</b> all-pro L.A.-studio jazz/rock" [...] and adds that the song [...] "gets the doomed project off to a spirited start".|$|E

500|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} July 1999, David Ownby {{writes that the}} country's media apparatus [...] "was <b>churning</b> <b>out</b> hundreds of articles, books, and television reports against Falun Gong. The Chinese public had not witnessed such overkill since {{the heyday of the}} Cultural Revolution." [...] State propaganda initially used the appeal of scientific rationalism to argue that Falun Gong's worldview was in [...] "complete opposition to science" [...] and communism; the People's Daily asserted on 27 July 1999, that it [...] "was a struggle between theism and atheism, superstition and science, idealism and materialism." [...] Other rhetoric appearing in the state-run press centered on charges that Falun Gong had misled followers and was dangerous to health. To make the propaganda more accessible to the masses, the government published comic books, some of which compared Falun Gong’s founder to Lin Biao and Adolf Hitler.|$|E
500|$|Castellaneta studied art education, {{with the}} goal of {{becoming}} an art teacher. He became a student teacher and would entertain his students with his impressions. Castellaneta was also a regular participant in The Ron Petke and His Dead Uncle Show, a radio show at NIU. The show helped Castellaneta hone his skills as a voice-over actor. He recalled [...] "We did parodies and sketches, we would double up on, so you learned to switch between voices. I got my feet wet doing voiceover. The show was just barely audible, but we didn't care. It was the fact that we got a chance to do it and write our own material." [...] He took a play-writing class and auditioned for an improvisational show. A classmate first thought Castellaneta would [...] "fall on his face with improvisation" [...] but soon [...] "was <b>churning</b> <b>out</b> material faster than [...] could make it work." ...|$|E

Ann Powers of Blender called [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] "a decent bit of crunk where she raps in a cutesy-poo drawl that suggests she could have nabbed the Dukes of Hazzard sexpot role from Jessica Simpson". Spence D. of IGN considered the song [...] "interesting for its many interpretations, no less".|$|E

[...] Louis Pattison of the New Musical Express stated that the lyrics [...] "chime rather oddly with Britney’s much-vaunted desire to start a family".

500|$|The Industrial Records website {{explains}} that the musicians wanted to re-invent rock music, and that their uncensored records were about {{their relationship with the}} world. They go on to say that they wanted their music to be an awakening for listeners so that they would begin to think for themselves and question the world around them. [...] Industrial Records intended the term industrial to evoke the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more agricultural: P-Orridge stated that [...] "there's an irony in the word 'industrial' because there's the music industry. And then there's the joke we often used to make in interviews about <b>churning</b> <b>out</b> our records like motorcars —that sense of industrial. And ... up till then the music had been kind of based on the blues and slavery, and we thought it was time to update it to at least Victorian times—you know, the Industrial Revolution".|$|E

The New York Times music critic Kelefa Sanneh deemed it [...] "sounds like a cousin" [...] of [...] "Irreplaceable". The release of R singer Chris Brown's 2007 single [...] "With You" [...] produced similar impressions: Sheffield, in his review for Brown's album, noted that [...] "Stargate {{was just trying to}} roll out 'Irreplaceable' one more time". Hillary Crosley of Billboard magazine wrote that [...] "With You" [...] "leans a bit too heavily" [...] toward [...] "Irreplaceable". Stylus Magazine also noted that Rihanna's Stargate produced single, [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] was a rehash of Ne-Yo and Stargate's previous works saying, [...] "Here you've got the 'Sexy Love' drums, the 'Irreplaceable' strum, and a bit of the synth and chorus melody from 'So Sick'... is hardly the new twist all these old bits need to sound fresh." ...|$|E
