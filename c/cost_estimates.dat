The objectives of this study are identification of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> software features, analyzing the significant relation of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> software’s features towards job performance, Explore the problem faced during the implementation and lastly propose a plan to improve the <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> software usage among contractors in Malaysia. The study statistically reveals four features of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> software that significantly impact towards changes in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> job performance. These features were refined by performing interview to focus group of respondent to observe the actual possible problems during the implementation. Eventually, the proposed improvement plan was validated by the focus group of respondents to enhance the <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> software implementation among contractors in Malaysia. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Conceptual <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in project feasibility study. In practice, it is performed based on estimator’s experience. However, due to the inaccuracy of <b>cost</b> <b>estimate,</b> budgeting and <b>cost</b> control are planned and executed inefficiently. Support Vector Machines (SVMs), an Artificial Intelligent technique, is used to conduct the construction <b>cost</b> <b>estimate.</b> The algorithms of SVMs solve a convex optimization problem in a relative short time with satisfied accurate solution. Applying SVMs, the construction conceptual <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> model is developed for owners and planners to predict the construction cost of a project. The impact factors of <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> are identified through literature review and interview with experts. The cost data of 29 construction projects are used as training cases. Based on the training results, the average prediction error is less than 10 % and the computation time is less than 5 minutes. The error is satisfied for the conceptual <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> of a project during the planning and conceptual design phase. Case studies show SVMs can efficiently and accurately assist planners to predict the construction cost...|$|R

5|$|In April1995, when Parliament {{decided to}} nationalize twenty-six {{regional}} airports owned by their respective municipalities, they also debated {{a proposal to}} build a new airport in Båtsfjord. At the time Widerøe was obliged to operate routes to the airport until 31March1997. In December1995, Widerøe took delivery of their fifteenth Dash8 and thus their only need for a Twin Otter was to serve Båtsfjord. From 1994 to 1997, the <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> for the new airport increased from NOK95 to 125million. By June1998, Parliament approved additional funding which brought the cost to NOK178 million, including a new county road for NOK8million. The airport opened on 9 September 1999. From the opening Widerøe used the Twin Otter until 1April2000, when the route was taken over by larger Dash8 aircraft. Airport security was introduced on 1January2005.|$|E

The fledgling EH101, of which up to 50 were on order to replace the Canadian Armed Forces's (CAF) Sea Kings, found itself subject to a wider political battle between the Conservative and Liberal parties, the latter viewing the aircraft as too costly. Critics attacked the EH101 purchase as excessive and unnecessary after the Cold War's end in the early 1990s. Wide-ranging <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> were presented by both proponents and opponents of the EH101 procurement, with opponents backing life extensions of Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King and Boeing Vertol CH-113 Labrador helicopter fleets.

5|$|Ship {{services}} in Nordhordland started in 1866, and in 1923 {{the first car}} was purchased. A car ferry service between Isdalstø in Lindås and Steinestø in Åsane on the mainland was established on 7 July 1936. A plan was launched whereby all traffic from Nordhordland would be collected {{in one place and}} transported across Salhusfjorden to Åsane. By moving the ferry quay from Isdalstø to Knarvik, the length of the ferry service could be reduced. However, the fares would be kept the same and the extra revenue used to finance a bridge from Flatøy to Lindås. This allowed the Alversund Bridge to open in 1958, and the ferry service from Flatøy and Meland to move to Knarvik. The proposal to cross Salhusfjorden was launched during the planning of the Alversund Bridge. <b>Cost</b> <b>estimates</b> were made based on the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, but it proved too expensive for a suspension bridge crossing between Frekhaug and Salhus.|$|E

5|$|The strong winds, {{combined}} with saturated ground from the rainfall, brought down trees in widespread {{areas of the}} Hudson Valley and Capital District. Many of the trees would not have otherwise fallen in drier conditions. Some of the downed trees fell on structures. In a narrow swath in the Wolf Pond Valley of Warren County, where wind gusts are estimated to have reached , hundreds of trees were blown down. At the storm's worst, power outages affected over 100,000 people region-wide, and some individuals remained without power for a week. At the Albany International Airport, the storm forced the cancellation of flights, and throughout the region schools were closed. Several boats sustained damage along the shore of Lake Champlain.
