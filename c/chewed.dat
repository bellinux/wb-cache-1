5|$|Digestion {{starts in}} buccal cavity (mouth) as {{partially}} <b>chewed</b> food is {{broken down by}} saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly amylases), strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.|$|E
5|$|Scientists do not {{yet know}} what these dinosaurs ate. Having very small, ridged teeth they could not have <b>chewed</b> tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that pachycephalosaurs lived on a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, and fruits. The sharp, serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants.|$|E
40|$|The <b>cheW</b> gene from Escherichia coli {{has been}} cloned an {{inducible}} promoter, {{and the effects}} of the overproduction of the <b>CheW</b> protein on chemotactic behavior and receptor covalent modification have been examined. Plasmids that contain the <b>cheW</b> gene behind a regulatable promoter complement a <b>cheW</b> mutation when the <b>CheW</b> protein is produced at low levels. However, when the <b>CheW</b> protein is greatly overproduced in either a wild-type strain or a <b>cheW</b> mutant, chemotaxis is greatly inhibited, <b>cheW</b> null mutant cells swim smoothly as if they were constantly responding to an attractant. Surprisingly, cells in which the <b>CheW</b> protein is overproduced also swim smoothly. The behavioral defect produced by overproduction of the <b>CheW</b> protein does not require the presence of the cheR, cheB, or cheZ gene. Receptor demethylation is also inhibited by overproduction of the <b>CheW</b> protein, as it is by a mutation in the <b>cheW</b> gene or a response to an attractant. In all respects, therefore, overproduction of the <b>CheW</b> protein has the same consequences as does a mutation in the <b>cheW</b> gene or a response to an attractant. A model involving two states of the <b>CheW</b> protein is proposed to explain its role in bacterial chemotaxis...|$|R

The ibis was missing for nearly a week before being recaptured four miles from the zoo.|$|E
5|$|The Cretaceous period saw the {{appearance}} of more plant defense mechanisms. The diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms) at that time {{is associated with the}} sudden burst of speciation in insects. This diversification of insects represented a major selective force in plant evolution, and led to selection of plants that had defensive adaptations. Early insect herbivores were mandibulate and bit or <b>chewed</b> vegetation; but the evolution of vascular plants lead to the co-evolution of other forms of herbivory, such as sap-sucking, leaf mining, gall forming and nectar-feeding.|$|E

5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded into small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} <b>chewed.</b> The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be <b>chewed</b> a second time.|$|E
5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and <b>chewed,</b> and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that megalodon preyed upon many cetacean species, such as dolphins, small whales, cetotheres, squalodontids, sperm whales, bowhead whales, and rorquals. In addition to this, they also targeted seals, sirenians, and large sea turtles. However, the shark was also an opportunist and piscivorous, {{and it would have}} also gone after smaller fish and other sharks. Many whale bones have been found with deep gashes most likely made by their teeth. Various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the <b>chewed</b> remains of whales, and sometimes in direct association with them.|$|E

5|$|Premastication, pre-chewing, or kiss feeding is the act {{of chewing}} food {{for the purpose of}} {{physically}} breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of masticating the food by themselves. This is often done by the mother or relatives of a baby to produce baby food capable of being consumed by the child during the weaning process. The <b>chewed</b> food {{in the form of a}} bolus is transferred from the mouth of one individual to another, either directly mouth-to-mouth, via utensils, hands, or is further cooked or processed prior to feeding.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{depiction}} {{is common}} in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and <b>chewed</b> bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions {{with members of the}} same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named Labrosaurus ferox is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|Sugar {{has been}} {{produced}} in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times. It was not plentiful or cheap in early times and honey was more often used for sweetening {{in most parts of}} the world. Originally, people <b>chewed</b> raw sugarcane to extract its sweetness. Sugarcane was a native of tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia. Different species seem to have originated from different locations with Saccharum barberi originating in India and S. edule and S. officinarum coming from New Guinea.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between jaw-closing muscle spindle unit discharge and the hardness of foods were evaluated during <b>chewing</b> in awake rabbits. Spindle unit discharges recorded {{from the left}} mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus were correlated with the simultaneous recording of jaw movements and electromyographic (EMG) activities of the left masseter (jaw-closing) muscle during <b>chewing</b> soft and hard foods. A <b>chewing</b> cycle was divided into the fast-closing (FC), slow-closing (SC) and opening (OP) phases according to jaw movements. The <b>chewing</b> was classified as ipsilateral and contralateral <b>chewing</b> according to ipsilateral and contralateral to the recording side of the neuron, respectively. Spindle unit discharge was significantly higher during the FC and SC phases of the hard food than the soft food during both ipsilateral and contralateral <b>chewing.</b> The discharge was observed to be higher when the masseter muscle activity was higher. A comparison between the <b>chewing</b> sides reveals that the discharge was significantly higher during the slow-closing phase of ipsilateral <b>chewing</b> than contralateral <b>chewing.</b> From the above findings, {{the relationship of the}} spindle unit discharge with the hardness of foods was observed. Moreover, this relationship exists even when an animal <b>chews</b> food on the contralateral side suggesting the significance of the muscle spindle information for smooth <b>chewing.</b> In addition, the phase dependent difference of the spindle unit discharge between <b>chewing</b> sides suggests the distinct roles of the spindle information on the <b>chewing</b> and non-chewing sides...|$|R

5|$|The find of {{a herd of}} six Psittacosaurus {{individuals}} {{killed and}} buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence {{of at least two}} age groups from two distinct clutches gathered together. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they <b>chewed</b> their own food and may have been precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of different ages grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest. There is no evidence for parental care.|$|E

5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them through the hole they have just <b>chewed.</b> Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E
5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite.

The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme <b>chewed,</b> blistering his tongue.

40|$|Many {{instrumental}} {{techniques have}} been developed to provide quantitative data on food texture as an alternative to sensory methods for food texture characterisation. However, most instrumental measurements are not able to simulate whole <b>chewing</b> sequences, the jaw movements and the influence of teeth geometry involved in mastication. Several devices have been proposed to simulate human mastication but they either cannot simulate human <b>chewing</b> trajectory or are difficult to be controlled. A novel simple linkage <b>chewing</b> robot was previously developed to reproduce human <b>chewing</b> trajectory. The aim of this thesis is to simulate human <b>chewing</b> behaviour by applying compliant <b>chewing</b> forces and velocity on the food during mastication. In order to allow the entire mastication process to be continuously reproduced, the <b>chewing</b> robot was upgraded with a 3 D force sensor, an automatic food manipulation system with 3 D carved teeth and a spring mass system to apply passive force control. Aiming at the compliant <b>chewing,</b> the dynamic model of the <b>chewing</b> robotic system was developed, including the linkage mechanism, gear transmission, DC motor and food models. The simulation model of the <b>chewing</b> robot was validated by comparing the simulated torques and the experimental torques of the crank required to drive the robot. A control algorithm to achieve the compliant <b>chewing</b> for the robot is formulated in terms of adaptive fuzzy logic control, and is able to achieve fast coordination of <b>chewing</b> velocity and forces required for different type of foods, and validated in simulations in terms of <b>chewing</b> velocity and forces. The <b>chewing</b> experiments with the robot <b>chewing</b> on real foods were carried out and analyzed in terms of the adaptation of <b>chewing</b> velocity and force to the food texture changes during <b>chewing</b> process. Both simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is adaptive and able to simulate human <b>chewing</b> behaviour on foods with different texture, which indicates the usefulness of the developed robot in food texture evaluation. The <b>chewing</b> robot developed has been used routinely in our laboratory and exhibited a great potential as a tool for the evaluation of food properties and bolus preparation...|$|R
