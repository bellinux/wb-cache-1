5|$|Gulf Oil {{was most}} synonymous for its {{association}} with auto racing, as it famously sponsored the John Wyer Automotive team in the 1960s and early '70s. The signature light blue and orange <b>color</b> <b>scheme</b> associated with its Ford GT40 and Porsche 917 {{is one of the}} most famous corporate racing colors and has been replicated by other racing teams sponsored by Gulf. Much of its popularity is attributed to the fact that in the 1971 film Le Mans, Steve McQueen's character, Michael Delaney, drives for the Gulf team. As a result of McQueen's increasing popularity following his death and the increasing popularity of the Heuer Monaco which he wore in the film, TAG Heuer released a limited edition of the watch with the Gulf logo and trademark <b>color</b> <b>scheme.</b> In the same era, Gulf Oil also sponsored Team McLaren during the Bruce McLaren days, which used a papaya orange <b>color</b> <b>scheme</b> with Gulf blue for lettering.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many current program editors use syntax {{highlighting}} but {{effects of}} various <b>coloring</b> <b>schemes</b> are not known. This paper {{presents the results}} of an experiment where three <b>coloring</b> <b>schemes</b> were used by intermediate programmers in visual search tasks for local patterns in Java programs. Differences between the <b>coloring</b> <b>schemes</b> were small and not statistically significant. Especially, in contrast to intuition, the control scheme, black text on white background, resulted in the same overall search performance as the other <b>coloring</b> <b>schemes.</b> Differences between search target types were statistically significant and each <b>coloring</b> <b>scheme</b> turned out to be best for some target type but the interaction was statistically only almost significant. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of this {{research}} paper {{is to find out}} relationship between varying <b>color</b> <b>scheming</b> in advertising and buying behavior. Data for this purpose were collected from 200 people through questionnaire. Results indicated that buying behavior is greatly influenced by <b>color</b> <b>scheming</b> of a product and its advertisement. Strategies discussing how to enhance <b>color</b> <b>scheming</b> of product and use of colors in ads are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|While some Batman: The Ride clones {{opened with}} dark blue track and supports, others {{featured}} gray and yellow. Over the years {{there have been}} modifications in Batman: The Ride color schemes, with more incorporating yellows, blues, and purples. The original ride at Six Flags Great America retained the original black <b>color</b> <b>scheme</b> until 2004, when the track was painted yellow, and supports dark purple. Six Flags Great Adventure's originally featured a black <b>color</b> <b>scheme</b> with yellow rails until 2004, when the track was repainted yellow. For the 2010 season, the clone at Six Flags Magic Mountain was repainted medium blue with black supports.|$|E
5000|$|... the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) {{approved}} <b>color</b> <b>schemes</b> for {{street name}} signs including a green, blue, or brown background with white text, or a white background with black text. [...] Despite the MUTCD restriction {{only to the}} aforementioned <b>color</b> <b>schemes,</b> other <b>color</b> <b>schemes</b> are used in some cities; for example, the city of Mesa, Arizona uses ruby red colored street name signs at signalized intersections in the Fiesta District {{in the western part}} of the city. The city of Houston, Texas allows for street name signs in several of its neighborhoods (usually part of a management district, where property owners assess additional fees to themselves to pay for extra services) to be of significantly different <b>color</b> <b>schemes</b> and fonts than the citywide standard.|$|R

It does not use the Desktop Window Manager, and does not require a WDDM driver. As with previous versions of Windows, this visual style supports <b>color</b> <b>schemes,</b> which are collections of color settings. Windows Vista includes six color schemes: four high-contrast <b>color</b> <b>schemes</b> and the default <b>color</b> <b>schemes</b> from Windows 98 (titled [...] "Windows Classic") and Windows 2000/Windows Me (titled [...] "Windows Standard").|$|R

5|$|The current <b>color</b> <b>scheme</b> was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new <b>color</b> <b>scheme.</b> He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front quarter panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|E
5|$|The pre-release of the 2014 album 5. The Gray Chapter also {{witnessed}} {{a major change}} in the band’s logo and branding strategy.

5|$|Filming {{took place}} in September and October 2004. Although the story is set in 19th century Cardiff, the {{production}} was actually filmed in Swansea and Monmouth, as there were not enough Victorian-looking buildings left in Cardiff. Cardiff's New Theatre {{was used for the}} theatre in which Dickens is telling a story {{at the beginning of the}} episode. An empty Victorian children's home in Penarth was used for Sneed's parlour. Based on research of Victorian morgues, the production team selected red and sepia as the main <b>color</b> <b>scheme.</b>|$|E
5|$|Green Goblin's costume {{was mainly}} {{designed}} after his original comic book appearance. The basic structure {{was based on}} initial designs drawn by Alex Ross for the Goblin as he appeared in the 2002 film Spider-Man, which was never used. Alterations were made to make it resemble Medieval clothing. The suit displays the color green, which, in Cook's broad <b>color</b> <b>scheme</b> for the series, is used to symbolize negative situations in Peter's life, while positive settings and occurrences, such as Peter's biology class, feature other key colors like yellow.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Edward Bernays {{helped the}} Lucky Strike {{cigarette}} brand increase its sales among the female demographic. Research showed {{that women were}} reluctant to carry a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes, because the brand's green <b>color</b> <b>scheme</b> clashed with popular fashion choices. Bernays persuaded fashion designers, charity events, interior designers and others to popularize the color green. He also positioned cigarettes as Torches of Freedom that represent rebellion against the norms of a male-dominated society.|$|E
