40|$|It is {{necessary}} to find a proper arrangement of sentences in order to generate a well-organized summary from multiple documents. In this paper we describe an approach to coherent sentence ordering for summarizing newspaper articles. Since {{there is no guarantee}} that <b>chronological</b> <b>ordering</b> of extracted sentences, which is widely used by conventional summarization system, arranges each sentence behind presupposed information of the sentence, we improve <b>chronological</b> <b>ordering</b> by resolving antecedent sentences of arranged sentences. Combining the refinement algorithm with topical segmentation and <b>chronological</b> <b>ordering,</b> we address our experiment to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results reveal that the proposed method improves <b>chronological</b> sentence <b>ordering.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to determine a proper arrangement of extracted sentences to generate a wellorganized summary from multiple documents. This paper describes our Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) system for TSC- 3. It specifically addresses an approach to coherent sentence ordering for MDS. An impediment {{to the use of}} <b>chronological</b> <b>ordering,</b> which is widely used by conventional summarization system, is that it arranges sentences without considering the presupposed information of each sentence. We propose a method to improve <b>chronological</b> <b>ordering</b> by resolving precedent information of arranging sentences. Combining the refinement algorithm with topical segmentation and <b>chronological</b> <b>ordering,</b> we address our experiments and metrics to test the effectiveness of MDS tasks. Results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves <b>chronological</b> sentence <b>ordering.</b> At the end of the paper, we also report an outline/evaluation of important sentence extraction and redundant clause elimination integrated in our MDS system...|$|R

40|$|In non {{relativistic}} physics it {{is assumed}} that both <b>chronological</b> <b>ordering</b> and causal ordering of events (telling whether there exists a causal relationship between two events or not) are absolute, observer independent properties. In relativistic physics on the other hand <b>chronological</b> <b>ordering</b> depends on the observer who assigns space-time coordinates to physical events and only causal ordering is regarded as an observer independent property. In this paper it is shown that quantum theory can be considered as a physical theory in which causal (as well as <b>chronological)</b> <b>ordering</b> of probabilistic events happening in experiments may be regarded as an observer dependent property.

40|$|Single linear virtual {{timelines}} {{have been}} used effectively with undergraduates and primary school children to convey the <b>chronological</b> <b>ordering</b> of historical items, improving on PowerPoint and paper/textual displayas. In the present study, a virtual environment (VE) consisting of three parallel related timelines (world history and the histories of art and psychology) was used to convey both chronology and the cross-referencing and relatedness among the three domains of material. Undergraduate participants {{were able to use}} the VE more effectively than booklets, better remembering the <b>chronological</b> <b>ordering</b> of all materials and successfully cross-referencing from one domain to another. The paradigm arguably invokes the use of high capacity spatial memory, and could potentially be used to convey and remember large amounts of historical-chronological information...|$|R
