The work consists of theoretical, practical part and the annexes. The theoretical part is focused {{on the development of the}} child and how can this handicap influence its evolution. I also briefly mentioned/characterised the most common children's visual diagnosis. One of these chapters is focused on cerebral palsy - the most frequently type of handicap that can be accompanied eye disorder. The space in this work is devoted to the early care focused on the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> some <b>visual</b> and combined handicap. The practical part of the work consists of two case studies, the first one about the boy <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> and combined disability, and the other one about the boy <b>with</b> the purely <b>visual</b> handicap.

The literacy of a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> blindness in <b>visual</b> impairment is a process that starts with the definition of a literacy medium. Braille, black print, double or triple media are enabled for blind or visually impaired children. Teachers of students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments are faced with challenges of determining the initial literacy medium and learning media due to uniqueness of the children, various diagnoses and additional disorders.

Empirical part presents an instrument that provides information on the use of children's sensory channels, a list of its learning media, readiness for literacy program and the determination of literacy media. With the implementation of the instrument in six pre-school children learning media were assigned to everyone. We could also determine early literacy medium for three children. Results of empirical work indicate the appropriateness of the use of instrument in pre-school children and emphasize the importance of carrying out the assessment at this age period.

40|$|Background: A {{real-world}} visual scene {{consists of}} local elements (e. g. trees) that are arranged coherently {{into a global}} configuration (e. g. a forest).

Methods and Results: We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to study children during this developmental window to investigate changes in gray matter that underlie the shift from a bias for local to global visual information.

The measures of children’s sensory-motor understanding (SMU) and language ability were obtained using the Reynell–Zinkin scales of mental development. The videorecordings of these play-based assessments were coded for three categories of behavioural responses (Establish, Maintain, and Shift). The three groups were matched on verbal comprehension (VC), but differed significantly in their SMU and their chronological age. The groups of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> PVI and SVI were found to be comparable in their ability to establish and maintain attention on objects.
