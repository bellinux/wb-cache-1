40|$|Abstract. In {{the light}} of an {{increasing}} demand on business process compliance, the verification of process models against compliance rules has become essential in enterprise computing. To be broadly applicable <b>compliance</b> <b>checking</b> has to support data-aware compliance rules {{as well as to}} consider data conditions within a process model. Independently of the actual technique applied to accomplish <b>compliance</b> <b>checking,</b> data-awareness means that in addition to the control flow dimension, the data dimension has to be explored during <b>compliance</b> <b>checking.</b> However, naive exploration of the data dimension can lead to state explosion. We address this issue by introducing an abstraction approach in this paper. We show how state explosion can be avoided by conducting <b>compliance</b> <b>checking</b> for an abstract process model and abstract compliance rules. Our abstraction approach can serve as preprocessing step to the actual <b>compliance</b> <b>checking</b> and provides the basis for more efficient application of existing <b>compliance</b> <b>checking</b> algorithms...|$|R

50|$|The ECB {{publishes a}} Convergence Report {{at least every}} two years to check how well the EU members {{aspiring}} for euro adoption comply with the criteria. The first full convergence report was published in November 1996, and concluded that only 3 out of 15 EU member states (Denmark, Luxembourg and Ireland) were completely compliant with the criteria {{at that point in}} time. As a majority of states were not in compliance, the Council decided to delay the introduction of the euro by two years to 1 January 1999. In March 1998 a more positive second convergence report concluded that 11 out of 12 applying countries were prepared for the electronic introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, with only Greece failing to qualify by the deadline. Subsequent convergence reports have so far resulted in an additional 8 EU member states complying with all criteria and adopting the euro (Greece, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). The latest convergence report was published in June 2014, and checked for compliance in the reference year from May 2012 - April 2014, where Lithuania managed to fully comply - thus becoming the next 19th eurozone member. As the reference values for HICP inflation and long-term interest rates change on a monthly basis, any member state with a euro derogation has the right to ask the ECB for an updated <b>compliance</b> <b>check,</b> whenever they believe they have met all both economic and legal convergence criteria.

40|$|<b>Compliance</b> <b>checking</b> for {{clinical}} pathways (CPs) is getting increasing attention in health-care organizations due to stricter requirements for cost control and treatment excellence. Many compliance {{measures have been}} proposed for treatment behavior inspection in CPs. However, most of them look at aggregated data seen from an external perspective, e. g. length of stay, cost, infection rate, etc., which may provide only a posterior impression of the overall conformance with the established CPs such that in-depth and in near real time <b>checking</b> on the <b>compliance</b> of the essential/critical treatment behaviors of CPs is limited. To provide clinicians real time insights into violations of the established CP specification and support online <b>compliance</b> <b>checking,</b> this article presents a semantic rule-based CP <b>compliance</b> <b>checking</b> system. In detail, we construct a CP ontology (CPO) model to provide a formal grounding of CP <b>compliance</b> <b>checking.</b> Using the proposed CPO, domain treatment constraints are modeled into Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules to specify the underlying treatment behaviors and their quantified temporal structure in a CP. The established SWRL rules are integrated with the CP workflow such that a series of applicable <b>compliance</b> <b>checking</b> and evaluation can be reminded and recommended during the pathway execution. The proposed approach can, therefore, provides a comprehensive <b>compliance</b> <b>checking</b> service as a paralleling activity to the patient treatment journey of a CP rather than an afterthought. The proposed approach is illustrated with a case study on the unstable angina clinical pathway implemented in the Cardiology Department of a Chinese hospital. The results demonstrate that the approach, as a feasible solution to provide near real time conformance checking of CPs, not only enables clinicians to uncover non-compliant treatment behaviors, but also empowers clinicians with the capability {{to make informed decisions}} when dealing with treatment compliance violations in the pathway execution...|$|R
