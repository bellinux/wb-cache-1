40|$|Closer {{cooperation}} between neighbouring countries has throughout the ages {{been part of}} their respective political agendas. In many regions of the world, the desire to create efficient economic spaces, and eventually perhaps even political union, {{has been one of}} the driving forces behind political and institutional frameworks created in pursuit of such goals. Often, such goals have suffered setbacks, delays, changes in orientation, but also progress. The central banks of Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua — through their joint organisation, the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Council</b> (CMCA) — have recently inaugurated the regional interlinked payment system known as the SIP Sistema de Interconexión de Pagos de Centroamérica y República Dominicana). The SIP is the framework for the interlinking of the region’s payment systems, allowing for crossborder ‘electronic funds transfers’ between participants without the need for corresponding banking relationships with institutions inside or outside the region. The system is the result of a broad programme for financial infrastructure development in the region, which was formally initiated in 2004. This represents a large step forward towards further integration in the region. This paper offers an overview of the goals and practical functioning of SIP and the various steps leading up to its implementation within the context of regional integration. - NOTE: the full paper is available only to subscribers of the Journal...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} El Salvador’s {{transition to}} official dollarization by comparing {{aspects of this}} regime to the fixed exchange rate regime prevailing in the 1990 s. Commercial bank interest rates are analyzed under an uncovered interest parity framework, and {{it is found that}} dollarization lowered rates by 4 to 5 percent by reducing currency risk. This has generated net annual savings averaging Â½ percent of GDP for the private sector and Â¼ percent of GDP for the public sector (net of the losses from foregone seigniorage). Estimated Taylor rules show a strong positive association between Salvadoran output and U. S. Federal Reserve policy since dollarization, implying that this policy has served to stabilize economic activity more than it did under the peg and more than policy rates in Central American countries with independent monetary policy have done. Dollarization {{does not appear to have}} affected the transmission mechanism, as pass-through of monetary policy to commercial interest rates has been similar to pass-through under the peg and in the rest of Central America.

Through a detailed scrutiny {{of the influence of}} the <b>American</b> <b>Central</b> Bank on the economic activities it also tries to answer the question whether the Federal Reserve System could be considered as the main factor behind the causes and consequences of the Great Depression. This analysis can be divided into two periods. In the first period it explores the connection between the Federal Reserve System and the so-called New Era of American Capitalism in the 1920 s. In addition, it raises the question whether the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> Bank (through <b>monetary</b> policy tools) influenced the contemporary economic and political development {{to such an extent that}} it resulted into the Great Depression.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study {{preference}} heterogeneity in monetary policy committees of inflation-targeting (IT) countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) during the period 2005 - 2010. It employs (individual) voting records of the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Council</b> of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (the central bank of Hungary) and of the <b>Monetary</b> Policy <b>Council</b> of the National Bank of Poland. Preference heterogeneity in committees is not directly observable. Therefore, we pursue an indirect measurement and conduct an econometric analysis based on (pooled) Taylor-type reaction functions estimated using real-time information on economic and financial indicators and voting records. Recent evidence for the monetary policy committees (MPCs) of advanced economies (see Besley et al., 2008; and Jung, 2011) suggests that preference heterogeneity among its members is systematic. Unlike for monetary policy committees of advanced countries, the present paper finds preference heterogeneity to be random for both the members of the <b>Monetary</b> Policy <b>Council</b> of the National Bank of Poland (NBP), and the members of the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Council</b> of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB). But, similar to the committees of advanced economies, the diversity of views on the inflation forecast is measurable in both committees. A separate cluster analysis shows that different preferences of MPC members may be attributable to their status (chairman, internal member, external member) and that members may also differ in their desired response to changes in the economic outlook...|$|R
