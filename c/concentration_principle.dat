40|$|Isolated, {{purified}} small chondroitin (dermatan) sulphate proteoglycans from corneas of cow and {{rabbit and}} cow sclera were stained with Cupromeronic blue in 'model' experiments. The lengths and thicknesses {{of the images}} were {{compared with those of}} the same proteoglycans stained in the tissue, using the critical electrolyte <b>concentration</b> <b>principle</b> to give specificity for sulphated proteoglycans, and keratanase 1 or chondroitinase ABC digestion to distinguish between chondroitin and keratan sulphate. Corrections for orientation of the stained glycan filaments within the section plane were made to convert the observed lengths to true average lengths. Observed lengths of stained chondroitin (dermatan) sulphate were greater than those of keratan sulphate, both in models and tissues, in agreement with published data from biochemical and rotary-shadowing studies, in both species. Corrected (true) average lengths of stained isolated chondroitin (dermatan) sulphate proteoglycans were slightly, but not significantly, longer than expected from rotary shadowing or biochemical measurements. Keratan sulphate lengths were similarly somewhat longer. The data support the idea that Cupromeronic blue acts as a scaffold that helps maintain polyanion shape against distortion on staining. Stained filaments in tissues were sometimes over twice the length of isolated stained proteoglycans, suggesting that 2 glycan chains were aligned end-to-end. Thicknesses of proteoglycan filaments suggested that at least 2 glycan chains were aligned side-by-side, both in models and in tissues. A scheme for proteoglycan tertiary structure in cornea is proposed, in which glycan chains may bridge collagen fibrils in duplexed forms similar to those observed in rotary shadowed preparations...|$|E

40|$|My {{research}} {{is focused on}} functional inequalities related to the concentration of measure phenomenon, in particular the transport-entropy inequalities, also called transport inequalities. The chapters of this document are articulated around this inequality and its relation with other functional inequalities. We present an abstract general version of the measure <b>concentration</b> <b>principle</b> in order to unify the different results of my research. Moreover some elementary arguments are given for {{a better understanding of}} the mathematical tools. The first chapter introduces the concentration of measure principle. It's general setting allows to compare many results depending on the involved cost function. The second chapter is devoted to the so-called weak transport inequality related to the general concentration of measure principle. We also present the links between logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and transport inequalities in metric spaces. The third chapter develops different results around the so-called barycentric costs, the notion of convex order on probability measures and weak-transport inequalities associated to this barycentric cost. Chapter IV is based on examples of "universal" transport inequalities as the so-called Csizár-Kullback-Pinsker inequality and, by tensorization, their applications to Bernstein type of deviation inequalities for suprema of empirical processes. We also present recent transport inequalities obtained for the uniform law on the symmetric group obtained by using different tensorization arguments. Chapter V is about the Poincaré inequality and its characterization in terms of a weak dimension-free concentration principles. Chapter VI concerns the notion of curvature on metric spaces and functional inequalities as the so-called displacement convexity property. We explain how a concentration property may imply a logarithmic Sobolev inequality or a Poincaré inequality when this convexity property holds on a geodesic space. In another direction, we try to extend the notion of curvature to discrete spaces by considering a similar convexity property of entropy on discrete spaces. The last chapter is devoted to improved versions of the logarithmic Sobolev inequality and the HWI inequality for the standard Gaussian measure on ^n...|$|E
40|$|Logical {{connection}} between the structural organization of the studied classifications' elements and their essential (ideological) content was proved and illustrated. There were provided analysis and were revealed peculiarities of the scientific principles and the principles of bibliographic organization of information {{through the prism of}} content (qualitative) and semantic (quantitative) constituents of systematization, in particular: hierarchical, tetralogical principle, atomism, decimal meaning, coincidence of opposites, convolution/deployment, deism, dynamism, division, rational perception, emanation, subordination {{on the one hand and}} alphabetical, <b>concentration</b> <b>principle,</b> integration, decimality, consistency, encyclopedic ability, extensibility, versatility, mnemonic ability, internationalism, multidimensionality, scientific, logic, stability, description, conglomeration, regularity, systematization from the other hand. There was summarized the experience of predecessors, engaged in the study, design and implementation of library-bibliographic classification systems in the context of development of sciences classifications, and it was also proved that previous research, focused on the analysis of classification systems, was related to the study of library catalogues' organization in which a quantitative structural component of the library classification was taken for basis, but systematization as a scientific category of essential and knowledge organization of information was not considered. It was defined and analyzed the facts of structural and logical availability with essential and ideological features of classification systems' organization in the context of systematization, such as: a quadromeaning, fasetizing, hierarchy and decimality. The complex explanation of necessity and probability of optimization in system is described and unification and harmonization of processes in area related to the information organization is given as well. Prospects of the development approaches and mechanisms for classification of information as a basic direction of documentary scientific study are outlined, nevertheless, it was proved that the structure of the classification system does not affect the content of the latter, as it is appropriate to the dynamic of knowledge, but its "artificiality" is only applies to the contents, therefore a comprehensive indexing of information resources of the UDC tables in Ukraine is absolutely possible. The content of some concepts is specified, in particular: "content" is a quantitative (formal) characteristic of semantic and syntactic classification components; "richness of content" is a meaningful (cognitive) characteristic of its semantic and syntactic components; "conglomeration" is a process of collections formation, which consists of various IRL, preserving all its principles of indexing for the consolidated presentation of notations of indexing, i. e. combining the potential of different IRL preserving their main features and properties; "folkindexing" is a public index or indexing by means of collective mind; "regularity" is a structural characterization of system, which is formed as the result of information systematics, when there is no clear subordination, and system formation is provided by the regularity of components; "Systematyzatsiynist" (the hierarchic characteristic of the system) is a structural characteristic of the system, which consists of the hierarchical set of elements, and connections between them express subordination to each other; "Systemnist" (the linear characteristic of the system) is a principle of classification formation, in accordance to which the classification acquires certain structural characteristics and transforms directly into the system of classification. In general, the results of the thesis research allowed to present library bibliographic classifications not just from the position of functional cell organization of the library catalogues, but first of all from the point of view of these classifications' significance in provision of the documentary systematization implementation processes through the prism of historically conditioned link between the evolution of sciences classifications and library-bibliographic classification systems. Thus, the classification systems of bibliographic information occupy a prominent place among the other possible mechanisms of the library systematization of scientific information, specifying scientism and validity of richness of bibliographic information content. Therefore bibliography as a science, along with the library science, belongs to the established field of socio-cultural activity, and amounts a much broader area of cognizance that contains all branches of knowledge which are anyhow presented by means of library-bibliographic classification systems with a projection on classification of sciences, because knowledge is the classified information. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this note}} two main points are discussed: {{the first is}} about the reasons why Italy’s “Mezzogiorno” (the 5 Regions in the South of Italy) could be {{considered}} one of the main failures of the EU cohesion policy in the programming period 2007 - 2013. The second, based on the information currently available, is the risk that the lessons that could be learned from the past could be forgotten, not producing a significant positive impact on the strategy devised for the current programming period 2014 - 2020. For the first point the analysis will be mainly based on the information provided by recent academic research, the Open-Cohesion Data Base published by the Italian Ministry of Economic development (2014), and by European Sources, in particular the Reports on Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion by the European Commission. For the second point, the information available on the Italian Partnership Agreement and on the Operational programmes that are being prepared for the 2014 - 2020 programming period will be considered. Also, some recent governmental decisions that produce a direct impact on the implementation of the EU structural funds programmes will be discussed. Southern Regions have suffered the strongest impact of the global crisis, and showed the slowest rate of recovery among the European Regions, apart a few extreme cases, like Greece. The poor performance of Mezzogiorno Regions can be measured both in absolute terms and in relative terms, compared to the Northern regions of Italy and to other EU regions. In these comparisons, the performance of Italy’s Mezzogiorno has been the weakest, {{and at the end of}} the 2007 - 2013 period the distance in the level of economic development from the most developed regions in Italy and in Europe increased more than in any other less developed country of the EU. Demographic indicators of Mezzogiorno are among the worst in Europe, with a new growth of emigration rates, comparable only to those from the first decades after the Second World War, and a fertility rate largely below the minimum needed for demographic stability. Looking at efficiency and the effectiveness of structural funds implementation, very low rate of absorption of the European Structural Funds is still observable in all Southern Regions, for all Funds. Still now, less than a year to the end of the implementation period, in some regions more than 1 / 3 of committed funds are still to be spent. Since the beginning of the period, programming activities showed many delays, and frequent revisions of the programme financial allocation were approved to adjust the strategy initially designed. At the same time, a wide dispersion of interventions in all sectors and areas was planned and/or resulted in practice, missing in most cases the possibility to reach the critical mass needed to make a lasting impact. Looking at the financed operations, a very strong fragmentation can be observed, with thousands of micro projects, limited if not null lasting impact on economic and social development. The new regulatory framework approved for the 2014 - 2020 programming period has already faced in Italy some of the same difficulties that hampered the success of the cohesion policy in the previous programming period in Italy’s Mezzogiorno. A first misstep was the much delayed approval of the Italian Partnership agreement. In the new framework, the Partnership Agreement is supposed to establish the framework for the single programmes’ strategy at national level. By approving it much later than most of the European Countries, Italy has already lost the first year of implementation. A second example of a recurring issue from the previous period is that of excessive fragmentation. The <b>concentration</b> <b>principle,</b> one of the pillars of the new programming strategy, is again challeged: the new programmes have established hundreds of different action lines. The SMART specialization strategies, one of the main innovations of the new period, that are supposed to help European regions to concentrate resources on innovations capitalizing on the main natural, industrial and social assets, have been translated at Mezzogiorno level in broad and unbinding strategies, often simply replicating a structural description of the regional economies. The reduction of the National co-financing, proposed by the Italian government mainly to reduce the risk of low and delayed absorption, if implemented without addressing the structural factors that have multiplied the time needed for the execution of public investments in Italy, could just lead to a further decline in the investment rate in Mezzogiorno. The risk of further divergence of Mezzogiorno from Italy’s North and Centre looks again imminent, without substantial improvement of effectiveness of Structural Funds Programmes and, what’s more, without a new attention to Mezzogiorno of the national economic policy agenda...|$|E
