40|$|This study {{experimentally}} {{determined the}} effects of dominant geometric and flow parameters on the aerodynamic performance of an annular combustor-diffuser system. For each parametric configuration, data were obtained at 13 different flow rates through the inner annulus, outer annulus, and <b>combustor</b> <b>dome.</b> The parametric effects investigated included the dump gap dimension, flow splits, prediffuser inlet velocity profile, and combustor channel height. During these measurements, the average prediffuser inlet Mach number was 0. 305. The measured static pressure recovery coefficient and the total pressure loss coefficient in the prediffuser {{as well as the}} overall system are presented in this paper. The study found that the performance of the combustor-diffuser system improves with increasing dome flow rate or dump gap dimension...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this program}} are to establish an experimental data base documenting the behavior of gas turbine engine fuel injector sprays as the spray interacts with the swirling gas flow existing in the <b>combustor</b> <b>dome,</b> and to conduct {{an assessment of the}} validity of current analytical techniques for predicting fuel spray behavior. Emphasis is placed on the acquisition of data using injector/swirler components which closely resemble components currently in use in advanced aircraft gas turbine engines, conducting tests under conditions that closely simulate or closely approximate those developed in actual combustors, and conducting a well-controlled experimental effort which will comprise using a combination of low-risk experiments and experiments requiring the use of state-of-the-art diagnostic instrumentation. Analysis of the data is to be conducted using an existing, TEACH-type code which employs a stochastic analysis of the motion of the dispersed phase in the turbulent continuum flow field...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} in situ and exit plane {{emissions}} measurements from a model gas turbine combustor at practical air preheat temperatures and pressures {{for a range}} of operating conditions. The model combustor chosen for the study features two rows of jets (primary and dilution) with four jets per row, and utilizes effusive air cooling holes on the liner wall. The <b>combustor</b> <b>dome</b> is equipped with a flat-vaned swirler with a vane angle of 60 deg. Data are obtained at combustor pressures ranging from 2 to 10 atmospheres, air preheat temperatures from 204 C to 427 C, and combustor reference velocities from 10. 0 to 20. 0 m/s. An overall equivalence ratio of 0. 3 was constant for all conditions. Exit plane and in situ measurements are presented for HC, O 2, CO 2, CO, and NO(x). The results from exit plane NO(x) measurements illustrate that the model combustor is representative of current gas turbine combustors. The in situ data reveal effects of fuel/air and wall jet mixing on emission performance...|$|E
40|$|A sector {{combustor}} {{technology development}} program {{was conducted to}} define an advanced double annular <b>dome</b> <b>combustor</b> sized {{for use in the}} quiet clean short haul experimental engine (QCSEE). A design which meets the emission goals, and combustor performance goals of the QCSEE engine program was developed. Key design features were identified which resulted in substantial reduction in carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emission levels at ground idle operating conditions, in addition to very low nitric oxide emission levels at high power operating conditions. Their significant results are reported...|$|R
2500|$|The {{dome and}} swirler are {{the part of}} the {{combustor}} that the primary air (see Air flow paths below) flows through as it enters the combustion zone. Their role is to generate turbulence in the flow to rapidly mix the air with fuel. Early combustors tended to use bluff body domes (rather than swirlers), which used a simple plate to create wake turbulence to mix the fuel and air. Most modern designs, however, are swirl stabilized (use swirlers). The swirler establishes a local low pressure zone that forces some of the combustion products to recirculate, creating the high turbulence. However, the higher the turbulence, the higher the pressure loss will be for the <b>combustor,</b> so the <b>dome</b> and swirler must be carefully designed so as not to generate more turbulence than is needed to sufficiently mix the fuel and air.|$|R
40|$|A <b>combustor</b> {{includes}} a <b>dome</b> assembly having radially outer and inner liners joined thereto and defining therebetween a combustion zone. The dome assembly {{includes a}}t least one annular dome having a pair of axially extending first flanges between which are disposed a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart carburetors for discharging a fuel/air mixture into the combustion zone for generating combustion gases. An annular heat shield includes a pair of axially extending legs integrally joined to a radially extending face in a generally U-shaped configuration, with the face including a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart ports disposed concentrically with perspective ones of the carburetors for allowing the fuel/air mixture to be discharged therefrom through the heat shield. At {{least one of the}} heat shield legs includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart mounting holes disposed adjacent to a respective one of the dome flanges, and a plurality of mounting pins are fixedly joined to the dome flange and extend radially through respective ones of the mounting holes without interference therewith for allowing unrestrained thermal movement between the heat shield and the dome while supporting the heat shield against axial pressure loads thereon. In a preferred embodiment, the dome assembly includes three domes having respective ones of the heat shield, and respective baffles are spaced from the heat shields for providing impingement cooling thereof...|$|R
40|$|In LET Task 10, {{critical}} development {{issues of}} the HSCT lean-burn low emissions combustor were addressed {{with a range of}} engineering tools. Laser diagnostics and CFD analysis were applied to develop a clearer understanding of the fuel-air premixing process and premixed combustion. Subcomponent tests evaluated the emissions and operability performance of the fuel-air premixers. Sector combustor tests evaluated the performance of the integrated combustor system. A 3 -cup sector was designed and procured for laser diagnostics studies at NASA Glenn. The results of these efforts supported the earlier selection of the Cyclone Swirler as the pilot stage premixer and the IMFH (Integrated Mixer Flame Holder) tube as the main stage premixer of the LPP combustor. In the combustor system preliminary design subtask, initial efforts to transform the sector combustor design into a practical subscale engine combustor met with significant challenges. Concerns about the durability of a stepped <b>combustor</b> <b>dome</b> and the need for a removable fuel injection system resulted in the invention and refinement of the MRA (Multistage Radial Axial) combustor system in 1994. The MRA combustor was selected for the HSR Phase II LPP subscale combustor testing in the CPC Program...|$|E
40|$|The low-emissions {{combustor}} {{development at}} the NASA Glenn Research Center is directed toward advanced high-pressure aircraft gas turbine applications. The emphasis {{of this research is}} to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) at high-power conditions and to maintain carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons at their current low levels at low-power conditions. Low-NOx combustors can be classified into rich burn and lean burn concepts. Lean burn combustors can be further classified into lean-premixed-prevaporized (LPP) and lean direct injection (LDI) combustors. In both concepts, all the combustor air, except for liner cooling flow, enters through the <b>combustor</b> <b>dome</b> so that the combustion occurs at the lowest possible flame temperature. The LPP concept has been shown to have the lowest NOx emissions, but for advanced high-pressure-ratio engines, the possibly of autoignition or flashback precludes its use. LDI differs from LPP in that the fuel is injected directly into the flame zone and, thus, does not have the potential for autoignition or flashback and should have greater stability. However, since it is not premixed and prevaporized, the key is good atomization and mixing of the fuel quickly and uniformly so that flame temperatures are low and NOx formation levels are comparable to those of LPP...|$|E
40|$|A well {{integrated}} experimental/analytical {{investigation was}} conducted to provide benchmark quality relevant to a prefilming type airblast fuel nozzle and its interaction with the <b>combustor</b> <b>dome</b> air swirler. The experimental investigation included a systematic study of both single-phase flows that involved single and twin co-axial jets with and without swirl. A two-component Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) was used to document the interaction of single and co-axial air jets with glass beads that simulate nonevaporating spray and simultaneously avoid the complexities associated with fuel atomization processes and attendant issues about the specification of relevant boundary conditions. The interaction of jets with methanol spray produced by practical airblast nozzle was also documented in the spatial domain of practical interest. Model assessment activities included the use of three turbulence models (k-epsilon, algebraic second moment (ASM), and differential second moment (DSM)) for the carrier phase, deterministic or stochastic Lagrangian treatment of the dispersed phase, and advanced numerical schemes. Although qualitatively good comparison with data was obtained {{for most of the}} cases investigated, the model deficiencies in regard to modeled dissipation rate transport equation, single length scale, pressure-strain correlation, and other critical closure issues need to be resolved before one can achieve the degree of accuracy required to analytically design combustion systems...|$|E

However, since it is not premixed and prevaporized, good atomization is necessary and the fuel must be mixed quickly and uniformly so that flame temperatures are low and NOx formation levels are comparable to those of LPP. The LDI concept described is a multipoint fuel injection/multiburning zone concept. Each of the multiple fuel injectors has an air swirler associated with it to provide quick mixing and a small recirculation zone for burning. The multipoint fuel injection provides quick, uniform mixing and the small multiburning zones provide for reduced burning residence time, resulting in low NOx formation. An integrated-module approach was used for the construction where chemically etched laminates, diffusion bonded together, combine the fuel injectors, air swirlers, and fuel manifold into a single element. The multipoint concept combustor was demonstrated in a 15 sector test. The configuration tested had 36 fuel injectors and fuel-air mixers that replaced two fuel injectors in a conventional dual-annular combustor. During tests, inlet temperatures were up to 870 K and inlet pressures were up to 5400 kPa. A correlation was developed that related the NOx emissions with the inlet temperature, inlet pressure, fuel-air ratio, and pressure drop. At low-power conditions, fuel staging was used so that high combustion efficiency was obtained with only one-fourth of the fuel injectors flowing. The test facility had optical access, and visual images showed the flame to be very short, approximately 25 mm long...|$|E
