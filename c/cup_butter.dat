Woman on the Job-­Don't Lo. e That Grip! THEIR boy died last Janu­ary in a Japanese con­centration camp. He was their only child, born in their late 30 's. They'd never gotten over !he pride and wonder of it, having this merry, beautiful thing sc m­pering through their drab. exIst­ence, filling the days WIth,a warmth and excitement they d never known before. You couldn't blame them for worshipping him -centering evc:ry thought upon him, making them feel that they, too were like other people. Everything changed. They did the house over. He joined a club -she went in for settlement work. The house rang with youngsters. Presently the boy was out of grammar, out of high, headed for college. Going in for law. Their dreams soared. And suddenly incredibly, we were at war. Th boy was off-wild with excitement. They couldn't be­lieve it but somehow they got through the d!!ys. Then the news came. They sat for a long time, staring at the paper. He tried to speak but no sound came. After a while she walked slowly to the window, pulled down the shades. Drew Shade. on Lile He didn't go to the store next day-nor next week. She can­celed her settlement meetings. They stayed inside-eating out of paper bags. Their friends under stood. But presently they beg to worry. The weeks had len ­ened to months. The s ilea stayed down. No one saw People said he was sel g the store. Then the doctor e. She was down with pneum 18. Not a bad case-if !he'd y try to help. But she wouldn't, Some­thing had happened during those darkened hours. Bit by bit, {{the two of them had}} lost their grip on life-gone back into the soli­tude from which the boy had saved them. Now she doesn't care to go on. In desperation, a friend has written to me. "You've lost a boy. Maybe you'll know [...] " Yes, I know. So do those thou­lIands of 0 the r heartbroken parents whose letters pile on my desk. And my answer to one goes for all. ·Why should you go on? Your boy is why. This world he lov d is why. And all the boys who Will come after, are why. If you let yourself go, you're selling him out and his world and his dreams. You're being a quitter. You're dodging a debt. No Que. tion 01 Wanting You haven't a free choice in this matter. You can't go off into the darkness with a broken heart and call it a day. You have bonds, obligationR, ties you can't ignore. You're not just cruelly hurt in­dividuals. You're part of the' scheme of things and you can't lose your grip on that scheme. It isn't a question of whether you want to live. Living is your job. You've got to see it through. You don't belong to that lonely grave. You belong to life. Life gave you the greatest joy, the most glorious privilege and pride you've ever known. You never knew what rapture meant till the poy was born. Then you stopped being just two people. You be­came part of all people. You shared yourself and your happi­ness -and there isn't money enough in thc world to pay for what you received in return. You realize that, don't you? But do you also realize that you owe a debt for every laugh, every kiss, every dream, every happy hour together? Life gave. Your boy knew beautiful, wonderful days because other men and women had worked and sacrificed and bat­tled for that wonder and beauty. They paid their debt and passed their achievement along. Are you going to break the chain? Life gave. You took. Now it's up to you to pay-and abundantly. For it isn't enough to be brave. It isn't enough to go grimly through the gestures. You've got to repay the principal with in­terest. Otherwise you'll be leaving the world the poorer for his birth. You'll be telling the world that love wasn't worth its cost. Is that to be your memorial to him? think not. Then open those shades... get out of that bed,"-___•. and 1 11 ! Practices What She ·Teoches DOROTHY COON prepares rhubarb for a canning 1 Asparagus, anothf'r of the first spring canning monstration. Rhubarb and strawberrlell can be foods, requires pressure cooker. All home cannE'd afely canned by the watel' bath or preS 8 UrE' cannE'r. foods should be cooked 10 minutes before tasting, Director 01 Homemaker Center Foresees Big Canning Season MBy MARIAN KITTELL ANY a friendship starts with a seemingly insignificant detail such as a cake recipe or a valuable household hint. And where homemakers do it on small scale, Dorothy Coon, director of Homemakers' Center in one of Toledo's department stores indulges in such neighborliness on a mass scale. She estimates that 800 women each month attend sessions at the cen­ter, not to mention the many pi) rsonal requests that come In one by one. Right now, Mrs. Coon is busy launching the center's canning program for slimmer and perfect­ing plans for drying, brinlng and freezing demonstrations latcr on. She personally has canned dem­onstration jars of strawberries, asparagus and rhubarb. Time for canning them is just around the corner. "The Government," comments Mrs. Coon, "has asked all house­wives to can a little more in ' 44. They are backing up their request by releasing pressure canners for safe home canning. " Pre••ure Canner. Now is the time she says to check old canners and send faulty parts to the manufacturer for repairs. She stresses that the individual manufacturer's direc­tions should be followed in using a pressure canner. Every safety precaution in canning should be observed. Food lJ(lisoning is too deadly to gamble with by using slipshod methods. Plenty of lids will be available for canning even though the jars, such as wide mouth ones, are no longer being manufactured. In sealing glass coffee jars, Mrs. Coon advises punching a few holes in the can's lid that is used as a seal­ing ring. It will make removal easy later on. Although canning is of prime interest at the Homemakers' Cen­ter just now, conservation and meeting every day problems Is the year around theme. Helping women with their cur­rent problems, whether it be making dress forms, fighting moths, a problem In menu plan­ning or infant feeding, is Mrs. Coon's job. Also she likes to pass along good ideas that women who at­tend the center bring in. Current­ly her desk is decorated with the offering of one-a gay centerpiece of tulips, made from nearly whole, dyed egg shells. Wacky Cake Another woman who declared she couldn't bake a cake until someone told her about Wacky Cake bro ht in the recipe. Mrs. Coon triS 'lJis amazing cake that is miXS" he pan it's baked in [...] trlbuted the recipe far and wide. Here it is: WACKY CAKE: Sift flour and measure 1 ¥ [...] cupfuls. To it add 1 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon soda, ¥ [...] tea­spoon salt and 3 tablespoons cocoa. Sift together three times. Then place mixture in a greased loaf pan. Make 3 dents In top of flour mixture. In the fil'st dent place 1 teaspoon vinegar. In the second dent place 1 teaspoon va­nilla. In the third dent place 15 tablespoons melted shortening. POur 1 cup water over this and mix well. Bake 35 minutes in moderate (350 degree FJ oven. After it is cooled, the following icing is suggested: <b>cup</b> <b>butter</b> or margarine, 1 heaping cup of powered sugar, 3 tablespoons cocoa. Cream and add 2 table­spoons strong coffee and tea­Spoon vanilla. Spread over cake. And if anyone should be well equipped for adVice, it is Dorothy Coon. She practices what she preaches in her own maidless eight-room home. She is the wife of Charles F. Coon and mother of teen age Zanna and Charles (Sonny) Coon. A Spitz dog which Mrs. Coon gaily says looks like a moth-eaten throw rug com­pletes the family circle. The family helps, of course, each member having specific duties. Mrs. Coon believes in I J t j 1 v schedules, not only for food but work. They are made out a week In advance, so that the family will know what's coming up and be ready to help on them. Food. at Home Food Is purchased once a week and left overs are not only ex­pected, but planned for. A large enough Sunday roast is purchased 80 that It will provide mea. t bails or stew for two more meals. Mrs. Coon admits that meat points "peter out" by the end of the week when low point foods such as wieners and sauerkraut or macaroni and cheese are served. She and her family are all fond of soybeans, which she purchases at health food counters or In the country. They are served baked, in soup or cold in salads. But ahe makes a wry face when creamed soybeans are mentioned. One of the family's favorite ways of having this food Is to mix equal quantities of raw hamburger, cooked soybeans and a bit of chopped onion and salt. They are formed into balls and fried like meat patties. Always at the Coon home this 'oriental food is served with a crisp green salad. Mrs. Coon is undoubtedly one of the handsomest women in To­ledo and her beauty Is strength­ened by a charming and unaf­fected personality. She is ener­getic without being nervous and calm without being complacent. She enjoys a tremendous zest in everything she does and finds much pleasure in her family and their friends. The Coon home ap­parently is a neighborhood meet­ing place of tecn age youngsters. Beside her home and her job, IIhe finds time to be an active member of the Quota Club, Vernon McCune Post Auxiliary, and Psi Chi Phi alumni group.
