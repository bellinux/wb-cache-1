5000|$|Mr Stein was {{declared}} bankrupt by court order on 16 July 1990. At {{that time he}} was the recipient of legal aid, and was in litigation with Mr Blake. Mr Stein was suing for breach of contract, and Mr Blake had various counterclaims, including claims under <b>costs</b> <b>orders</b> which Lord Hoffman described [...] "indisputable". Mr Stein's trustee in bankruptcy executed a deed of assignment on 4 April 1991 under which he assigned the benefit of those claims back to Mr Stein in return for 49% of the net proceeds.

Malik believing the material amounted an accusation of racism. The defending newspaper suggested {{the case was}} attack on {{freedom of speech and}} a petition was presented to the Prime Minister protesting against Malik's legal action. In a trial at the High Court the jury failed to reach a majority verdict. A retrial was due to have taken place but with costs believed to have escalated beyond £300,000 the sides came to an agreement out of court and Malik dropped his claim. In an agreed statement Scott stated “I am happy to make clear that my letter was never intended to accuse Mr Malik of orchestrating gangs of thugs or playing the race card. This was an interpretation some people placed upon my letter and subsequent article, an interpretation with which I disagreed.” Lockwood said, “We {{want to make it clear}} that we never accused Shahid of any impropriety whatsoever during the elections.” Malik said, “I am very pleased that after a discussion with Danny Lockwood, he has been able to give me the assurances I required.” No <b>costs</b> <b>orders</b> were made against either side involved.|$|E
30|$|Initially, Porteus (1986) {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} capital investment in reducing <b>ordering</b> <b>cost</b> on the classical Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model for the first time. Ouyang et al. (1999) discussed lead time and <b>ordering</b> <b>cost</b> reductions in continuous review inventory systems with partial backorders. Later, Chang et al. (2006) presented lead time and <b>ordering</b> <b>cost</b> reduction problem in the single-vendor single-buyer integrated inventory model. They considered that buyer lead time can be shortened at an extra crashing cost which depends on the lead time length to be reduced and the ordering lot size, as well buyer <b>ordering</b> <b>cost</b> can be reduced through further investment. The main important single factor which influences the decision on re-order quantity is the total of carrying <b>cost</b> and <b>ordering</b> <b>cost.</b> Carrying cost increase with increase in re-order quantity while <b>ordering</b> <b>cost</b> decreases with increase order quantity. Thus, carrying <b>cost</b> and <b>ordering</b> <b>cost</b> move in opposite directions.

5000|$|In Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd {{the rule}} was {{established}} that irrespective of contract, if someone who possesses a special skill undertakes to apply that skill for {{the assistance of}} another person who relies upon that skill, a duty of care will arise. The fact that the barrister did not {{enter into a contract}} with his solicitor or client ceased to be a ground of justification for the immunity. Nevertheless, in a unanimous decision, Lord Reid said in Rondel v Worsley (1969) 1 AC 191 at 227 that the ancient immunity should be continued on considerations of [...] "public policy are not immutable." [...] (see Roxburgh: 1968). In Saif Ali v Sydney Smith Mitchell & Co. (1980) AC 198 the scope of the immunity was considered. Lord Wilberforce said at 213 that [...] "...barristers [...] [...] [...] have a special status, just as a trial has a special character: some immunity is necessary in the public interest, even if, in some rare cases, an individual may suffer loss." [...] (see Hill: 1986) When s51 Supreme Court Act 1981 (substituted by s4 Courts and Legal Services Act 1990) introduced the power to make wasted <b>costs</b> <b>orders</b> against legal practitioners, Ridehalgh v Horsefield (1994) Ch 205 ruled that orders could be made against barristers personally. As to criminal trials, prosecuting counsel owes no duty of care to a defendant: Elguzouli-Daf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (1995) QB 335. If a defendant is convicted after a full and fair trial, the remedy is to appeal. An attempt to challenge the convictions by suing the defence advocate would be an abuse of process: Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982) AC 529. If any challenge is to be made following an unsuccessful appeal, the only legitimate avenue would be the Criminal Cases Review Commission even though the body is under-resourced. But the question remained as to whether a civil action might be maintained if the appeal was successful (see Cane: 1996).|$|E

40|$|Using as a {{case study}} the recent {{decision}} on costs in the Biowatch matter, this article critically examines the traditional fundamental rules on costs {{in the light of the}} needs of constitutional and a fortiori public interest litigation. The fundamental rules on costs are taken to include the two traditional principles (that costs are a matter of judicial discretion and that to a successful party should be awarded his costs), the requirement that the discretion be exercised judicially, the test for interference in <b>costs</b> <b>orders</b> in a court of appeal, and the characterisation of <b>costs</b> <b>orders</b> as requiring the exercise of only a narrow discretion on appeal. In the light of the decisions in the Biowatch matter it is argued that the current rules do not meet the new needs of constitutional and/or public interest litigation as regards access to justice, equal protection and benefit of the law, proportionality, and the accountability of the judiciary.

3000|$|<b>Ordering</b> <b>Cost</b> (OC) is the <b>costs</b> of <b>ordering</b> a new {{batch of}} raw materials. These include cost of placing a {{purchase}} <b>order,</b> <b>costs</b> of inspection of received batches, documentation <b>costs,</b> etc. <b>Ordering</b> <b>costs</b> vary inversely with carrying costs. It {{means that the}} more orders a business places with its suppliers, the higher will be the <b>ordering</b> <b>costs.</b> However, more <b>orders</b> mean smaller average inventory levels and hence lower carrying costs. It is important for a business to minimize the sum of these costs which it does by applying the economic order quantity model. All the aforementioned integrated vendor–buyer inventory systems treat the <b>ordering</b> <b>cost</b> and/or lead time as constants. However, in the practical market, <b>ordering</b> <b>cost</b> and lead time can be controlled and reduced in various ways. For example, lead time can be reduced at an added crashing cost; <b>ordering</b> <b>cost</b> reduction can be attained through worker training, procedural changes, and specialized equipment acquisitions; in other words, the lead time is controllable, and the <b>ordering</b> <b>cost</b> can be reduced through further investment. It has been a trend by shortening the lead time and reducing ordering cost; we can lower the safety stock, reduce the stockout loss, and improve the service level to the customer.|$|R
