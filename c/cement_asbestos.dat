40|$|The K East (KE) Basin {{facilities}} are {{located near the}} north end of the Hanford Site's 100 K area. The facilities were built in 1950 as part of the KE Reactor complex and constructed within 400 meters of the Columbia River, which is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest and by volume the fourth largest river in the United States. The basin, located adjacent to the reactor, was used for the underwater storage of irradiated nuclear fuel discharged from the reactor. The basin was covered by a superstructure comprising steel columns and beams, concrete, and <b>cement</b> <b>asbestos</b> board (CAB) siding. The project's mission was to complete demolition of the structure over the K East basin within six months of tumover from facility deactivation activities. The demolition project team implemented open-air demolition techniques to demolish the facility to slab-on-grade. Several innovative techniques were used to control contamination and maintain contamination control within the confines of the demolition exclusion zone. The techniques, which focused on a defense-in-depth approach, included spraying fixatives on interior and exterior surfaces before demolition began; applying fixatives; misting using a fine spray of water during demolition; and demolishing the facility systematically. Another innovation that aided demolition was to demolish the building with the non-friable CAB remaining in place. The CAB siding covered the exterior of the building, portions of the interior walls, and was an integral part of the multiple layered roof. The project evaluated the risks involved in removing the CAB material in a radiologically contaminated environment and determined that radiological dose rates and exposure to radiological contamination and industrial hazards would be significantly reduced by removing the CAB during demolition using heavy equipment. The ability to perform this demolition safely and without spreading contamination (radiological or asbestos) demonstrates that similar open-air demolition ofcontaminated structures can be performed successfully...|$|E

A análise dos dados não evidenciou maior conforto térmico no galpão recoberto com telhas de barro, em razão da ausência de lanternim que dificultou a renovação do ar por "efeito chaminé". A concentração de amônia medida no interior de ambas as instalações ficou dentro do limite de conforto. O índice de temperatura e umidade do galpão recoberto com telhas de cerâmica apresentou valores maiores que do galpão recoberto com telha de cimento amianto, mesmo se verificando temperaturas de superfície menores nas telhas de cerâmica, evidenciando os efeitos positivos do lanternim na instalação. Com base nos resultados desta pesquisa, recomendam-se, para a região de Bastos, SP, que os aviários para galinhas de postura sejam construídos com lanternim e prolongamento do beiral e que sejam recobertos com telhas de cerâmica.

40|$|<b>Asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> {{pipelines}} {{constitute a}} significant portion of the potable and waste water systems in many countries in the world, including Australia. Most of the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes in the developed countries were installed before 1980, and many utilities are observing that the breakage rate is increasing with the ageing of the pipe. Condition assessment for <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes is of important necessity for prioritising rehabilitation and preventing catastrophic pipe failure; however, few techniques are available for direct assessment of the condition of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes and most of them are localised and destructive. This article outlines a pilot field study of the non-invasive and non-destructive condition assessment of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipelines using fluid transient pressure waves. Fluid transient analysis previously conducted by the authors for metallic pipelines is further developed and adapted to <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes for the detection of localised defects. A new sub-sectional condition assessment technique is proposed for determining the effective wall thicknesses of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> sub-sections within a section of pipe bounded by two measurement points. A field trial is conducted in Australia on an <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> water main (which has class changes with varying wall thicknesses) to verify the proposed techniques. The wave speeds, lengths and wall thicknesses of sub-sections in different classes are determined and the results are consistent with the information in the design drawings provided by the water utility.

40|$|O {{principal}} objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a influência ambiental nos índices de conforto térmico e produtivo, em instalações abertas de frangos de corte, cobertos com telha de cimento amianto, com três sistemas de acondicionamento térmico: ventilação artificial e aspersão sobre a cobertura (TAVA), ventilação artificial (TACV) e ventilação artificial e nebulização (TAVN), localizados no distrito de São José da Mata, município de Campina Grande, PB. A avaliação ambiental foi feita com base na umidade relativa do ar (UR), no índice de temperatura do globo negro e umidade (ITGU), na carga térmica radiante (CTR) e pela umidade da cama. Os índices produtivos foram avaliados pelo peso final, ganho de peso diário, conversão alimentar e taxa de mortalidade. Em todos os sistemas, os índices de conforto variaram ao longo do dia, sendo que o ITGU apresentou valores considerados acima do ideal e a UR e a CTR ficaram dentro da zona de conforto térmico recomendada. O sistema TAVN aumentou a umidade da cama em relação aos outros sistemas. Os valores dos índices de desempenho das aves estiveram dentre as faixas consideradas ideais para a indústria de frangos de corte, no Nordeste do Brasil.

Black globe temperature and humidity index presented above ideal values. Relative humidity and thermal radiation load indices were within the recommended thermal comfort zone. Artificial ventilation and humidification systems increased the humidity of the bed when compared to the other systems.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} mortality from {{lung cancer}} {{and the risk}} attributable to asbestos separately for <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers and for the general (non-occupationally exposed) population {{in the town of}} Casale Monferrato, where the largest Italian <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> factory had been in operation in 1907 - 86. According to cancer registry data, in the same town the incidence of malignant mesothelioma in the general population is about 10 times higher than in comparable Italian provinces. METHOD: Decedents from lung cancer in 1989 - 95 were nominally identified in the list of decedents kept at the Local Health Authority of Casale Monferrato. Workers in the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> factory have been identified with a search in the nominal list of workers and the same was done for the wives of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers. These lists have already been used in cohort studies. Sensitivity and specificity of the linkage procedure with occupational activity in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production have been evaluated in a previous study. Population at risk was estimated on the basis of official figures and on the results of the cohort study of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers. RESULTS: 227 deaths from lung cancer were included (184 men and 43 women). Among the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers mortalities were 234. 0 x 100, 000 person-years among men and 35. 5 among women. Corresponding figures in the general (non- occupationally exposed) population in Casale Monferrato were 80. 6 and 18. 7. The rates in the general population were not higher than {{in the rest of the}} region. Attributable risk (AR) among the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers (and wives) is 67. 5 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 56. 8 to 78. 2) for men and 51. 3 % (95 % CI 14. 9 to 87. 8) among women. Population AR to occupational or paraoccupational exposure in the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production is 18. 3 % (95 % CI 11. 1 to 25. 6) among men and 10. 1 % (95 % CI 0 to 24. 6) among women. CONCLUSION: This work did not show an increase in mortality from lung cancer for the population not exposed occupationally, but a large excess was found among men and women occupationally exposed in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production. The total burden of lung cancer due to occupational exposure to asbestos may be underestimated, as only occupational exposure in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production was taken into consideration. Nevertheless even a single factory can be responsible for a considerable proportion of deaths from lung cancer in a population...|$|R
