Eleven egg clusters in five caves at Gannoruwa were sampled and data on the environmental conditions inside the <b>caves,</b> <b>number</b> of hatched and unhatched eggs, hatchlings, adults and other faunal species in the nesting habitat recorded. Six eggs were incubated in the laboratory. At the nesting sites, ambient temperature varied from 23 - 30 ºC and light intensity from 0 - 350 lux. The eggs were predominantly laid as pairs (on 85 % occasions) suggesting that C. kandiana has invariant clutch size. The hatched and unhatched eggs at each location varied from 1 to over 100, though {{the maximum number of}} unhatched developing eggs found at a given time was 18, i. e., a cluster size to vary from 1 - 18 eggs. Eggs tend to hatch in pairs, after an apparent incubation period of 39 - 58 days. The hatchlings had a total length of 23. 5 - 25. 8 mm. No interaction with regard to reproduction was found between C. kandiana and any other animals at the breeding sites. The egg-laying in this species is probably a combined effect of site fidelity of a female and communal nesting. This might be due to relative scarcity of preferred habitats in the study area...|$|E

40|$|Longwall {{top coal}} caving (LTCC) is a {{relatively}} new method of mining thick coal seams that is currently achieving high productivity and efficiency in application, particularly in China. The technique is similar to traditional longwall mining in that a cutting head slices coal from the lower section of the coal seam onto a conveyor belt installed in front of the hydraulic support near the cutting face. In modern LTCC an additional rear conveyor belt is located behind the support, to which the flow of the caved coal from {{the upper part of the}} seam can be controlled by a moveable flipper attached to the canopy of the support. The mining method relies on the fracturing of the top coal by the front abutment pressure to achieve satisfactory caving into the rear conveyor. This paper develops a yield and caveability criterion based on in situ conditions in the top coal in advance of the mining face (yield) and behind the supports (caveability). Yielding and caving effects are combined into one single <b>number</b> called <b>caving</b> <b>number</b> (CN), which is the multiplication result of caving factor (CF) and yield factor (YF). Analytical derivations are based on in situ stress conditions, Mohr-Coulomb and/or Hoek-Brown rock failure criteria and a non-associated elastoplastic strain softening material behaviour. The yield and caveability criteria are in agreement with results from both numerical studies and mine data. The <b>caving</b> <b>number</b> is normalised to mining conditions of a reference Chinese mine (LMX mine) and is used to assess LTCC performance at fourteen other Chinese working longwalls that have had varying success with the LTCC technology. The <b>caving</b> <b>number</b> is found to be in good agreement with observations from working LTCC mines. As a predictive model, results of this analytical/numerical study are useful to assess the potential success of caving in new LTCC operations and in different mining conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

5000|$|The {{people in}} the cave {{could not afford to}} {{illuminate}} the darkness, but had to conserve candles and fuel. This meant that they only lit candles for a few minutes, several times a day, in order to prepare meals. All other times were spent in complete and total darkness. One of the survivors, Pepkala Blitzer, a four-year-old girl when she and her family sought shelter in the caves from the Nazis, later recalled how she had completely forgotten about the sun or daylight. Eventually, one day in early April 1944, one of the Jewish men found a bottle lying on the floor beneath the entrance to the cave. Inside was a message from a friendly Ukrainian farmer, which read: [...] "The Germans have already gone." [...] A few days later, the entire group of Jews hiding in the <b>cave</b> (<b>numbering</b> 38 people) finally left their refuge. Standing in the bright sunshine, Pepkala asked her mother to put out the bright candle, because it hurt her eyes too much. She was referring to the sun, which she could not remember having seen.|$|R

50|$|The {{present day}} Mumbai was {{originally}} an archipelago of seven islands. Pleistocene sediments found around Kandivali on Salsette Island {{north of the}} seven islands by Todd in 1939 indicate that these islands were inhabited since the Stone Age. The archipelago had been named after the Koli Goddess Mumbadevi. The port of Sopara (present day Nala Sopara near Mumbai) was an important trading centre during ancient times. In the 3rd century BCE, the islands were incorporated into the Maurya Empire under the expansion campaign of Emperor Ashoka of Magadha. The empire's patronage gradually made the islands a centre of Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture. Buddhist monks, scholars, and artists created the artwork, inscriptions, and sculpture of the Kanheri and Mahakali <b>caves.</b> The total <b>number</b> of Buddhist <b>cave</b> temples <b>numbered</b> 109, dating {{from the end of}} the 2nd century BCE.
