5|$|After {{a player}} makes the first baza, that player {{is allowed to}} {{announce}} declarations. Declaring is allowed until the last two <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> left in the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it). After these final two <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> picked up, all of the cards the players hold must be played in order to finish the round. When the round is over, the players start to count their scores (see Scoring below). After the counting ends, and their scores are calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stock to be dealt {{at the start of}} the next round.|$|E
5|$|All {{payments}} are by credit card; Wageworks and Transitchek prepaid commuter <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> not accepted, as bike sharing {{programs do not}} qualify as eligible commuting expenses under US tax law.|$|E
5|$|Dial-a-ride transportation, {{a type of}} {{paratransit}} service {{operated by}} Community Transit, has a flat fare of $2.25 without discounts or separate categories. ORCA <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> not accepted on DART, replaced by tickets and monthly passes for frequent users.|$|E
50|$|A typical dip {{reader is}} used for reading credit cards where the data are either encoded on a {{magnetic}} stripe or an internal computer chip. The magnetic stripe on a <b>card</b> <b>is</b> typically read as the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> extracted. If the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> a smart <b>card,</b> then the data transfer typically takes place when the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> fully inserted. In this case, the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> held while data transfer is taking place.|$|R
5000|$|... 4 Amalgam Preview <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> also {{randomly}} {{inserted into}} packs. These <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> {{of the same}} style as the soon-to-be-released Amalgam card set. Two <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> of Dark Claw and two cards of Spider-boy.|$|R
5|$|During the deal, {{each player}} {{receives}} eight cards. After the last <b>card</b> <b>is</b> dealt, one more <b>card</b> <b>is</b> drawn. It indicates which suit becomes the trump. The <b>card</b> <b>is</b> placed {{perpendicular to the}} stock, at the bottom.|$|R
5|$|In North America, Score Entertainment {{published}} the Case Closed Trading Card Game on June 29, 2005. The game entails {{the use of}} three customized decks of cards, which players buy and collect. Representing characters, events, and objects in Case Closed, these <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> used by players to fulfill certain conditions to solve a case and win the game. Certain <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> used to foil {{the progress of the}} player's opponents. An English unofficial guidebook to the series titled The Case Closed Casebook: An Essential Guide was published by DH Publishing Inc. on March 25, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Since March 6, 2016, SmarTrip <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> {{the only}} payment method {{accepted}} on Metrorail; paper farecards {{are no longer}} valid.|$|E
5|$|A player (or a pair), {{who wins}} {{at least one}} trick {{receives}} an ability to gain more round points upon declaring the card combinations. In Tute in Pairs the declarations can be performed {{until the end of}} round; in Two-player Tute this ability persists until only two <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> left in the deck.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the face}} up <b>card</b> <b>is</b> a face <b>card,</b> the coop <b>is</b> valid (unless the face down <b>card</b> <b>is</b> also a face card).|$|R
50|$|There are {{currently}} four different variants of CACs. The Geneva Conventions Identification <b>Card</b> <b>is</b> {{the most common}} CAC and is given to active duty/reserve armed forces and uniformed service members. The Geneva Convention Accompany Forces <b>Card</b> <b>is</b> issued to emergency-essential civilian personnel. The ID and Privilege Common Access <b>Card</b> <b>is</b> for civilians residing on military installations. The ID <b>card</b> <b>is</b> for DOD/Government Agency identification for civilian employees.|$|R
50|$|Serially {{numbered}} cards: Insert cards, memorabilia {{cards and}} parallel <b>cards</b> may <b>be</b> serially numbered. The rationale <b>is</b> that each <b>card</b> <b>is</b> numbered sequentially. The serial {{number of the}} <b>card</b> <b>is</b> stamped onto the card itself. A <b>card</b> may <b>be</b> numbered 1 of 500.|$|R
5|$|Baccarat is a {{game for}} up to 20 players, {{together}} with a banker and croupier; several packs of <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> used, depending {{on the number of}} players. The value of the ace to nine <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> as their pip value, while tens and court cards count as zero. A player is dealt two cards and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10's and court cards, and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court cards will count as zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for one extra card to be added to their hand. Betting is between the player and the bank, with the closest to reach 9 on a hand receiving the stake.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, {{the transit}} agency {{announced}} that it had found a replacement manufacturer for SmarTrip cards to avoid shortages until a new payment system goes into place. Customers will likely not notice any differences except that the new <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> slightly thinner and cheaper to produce.|$|E
5|$|In this test, {{a number}} of <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> {{presented}} to the participants. The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The participants are then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one {{to one of the}} previous cards. Typically, children between ages nine and eleven demonstrate the cognitive flexibility needed for this test.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>card</b> must <b>be</b> {{put on the}} row {{where the}} latest (end) <b>card</b> <b>is</b> the closest in value to the <b>card</b> that <b>is</b> about to be played (if your <b>card</b> <b>is</b> 33, then place it next to the 30 not the 29, for example) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{labeling}} of <b>cards</b> <b>is</b> {{a practice of}} French origin, Italians remembered their names by heart. The XIII <b>card</b> <b>is</b> generally left unlabelled in the various old and modern versions of the Tarot de Marseille, but {{it is worth noting}} that in Noblet's deck (circa 1650), the <b>card</b> <b>was</b> named LAMORT (Death). In at least some printings of the French/English bilingual version of Grimaud's pack, the XIII <b>card</b> <b>is</b> named [...] "La Mort" [...] in French and named [...] "Death" [...] in English. In many modern cartomantic tarot decks (e.g., Rider-Waite-Smith), the XIII <b>card</b> <b>is</b> named Death.|$|R
50|$|A further six {{limited edition}} <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> printed but, {{due to lack}} of {{interest}} in exclusive <b>cards,</b> <b>were</b> not distributed.|$|R

5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|An early {{criticism}} of the SmarTrip cards had been that they were only sold at suburban Metrorail stations, online, a few selected retailers, and Metro sales offices. However, in 2008, Metro reached an agreement with CVS/pharmacy to sell the cards at 187 DC-area locations {{in an effort to}} increase SmarTrip use. The SmarTrip <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> also sold at area grocery store chains. In late 2012 WMATA installed SmarTrip vending machines at all Metrorail stations.|$|E
