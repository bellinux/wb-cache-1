5000|$|In 1996, a report, “Putting the Food Handling Issue on the Table: the Pressing Need for Food Safety Education”, {{made the}} case for {{cooperation}} in consumer food safety education. The Partnership for Food Safety Education was formed in 1997 when federal government agencies, industry, and consumer groups signed a Memorandum of Understanding and pledged to work together to develop the first science-based, consumer education program in food safety. [...] This program, Fight BAC!®, and its four messages of Clean, Separate, <b>Cook,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chill</b> are the main programs for consumer education in safe food handling in the United States.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{implement}} a culturally appropriate food safety educational program using the conceptual change teaching method while preparing a meal. The food safety educational program was based on the FightBac!™ concepts (CLEAN, SEPARATE, <b>COOK</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CHILL).</b> Quantitative and qualitative date were collected, compared, and analyzed. Two pilot studies were conducted with Native American participants on non-reservation sites in Omaha and Lincoln. A total of 27 participants completed a pre and post knowledge survey and were video recorded preparing a meal. The majority of the participants were female (78 %), had at least a high school education or GED, and were unemployed. The educational component of the program started with an introduction and discussion. Next, participants formed groups of 3 - 4 and prepared a meal to implement food safety practices learned. Participants increased their washing hands knowledge (33. 3 % to 51. 9 %). When participants were asked “after you have used a cutting board to slice raw meat, chicken, or fish and need to cut other foods, which of these is the best way to prevent food poisoning?” an increase in knowledge was found (77. 8 % to 97. 6 %, p= 0. 0002). However, when asked about cleaning cutting boards when coming into contact with raw meats, a decrease in knowledge was found (77. 8 % to 51. 86 %). From video observations, the participants washed their hands prior to food preparation. However, this was the only time participants were observed washing their hands. Many of the participants wiped the counter tops and cutting boards with disinfectant wipes. To ensure doneness of the chicken, most participants used a food thermometer. The educational program was well perceived by the Native American participants at both non-reservation sites. However, this may not be indicative of the Native American population on reservations.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment Not ListedMark D. HaubResearch {{has shown}} that many {{consumers}} do not use the proper food safety practices when cooking in the home. Although many {{studies have been conducted}} to observe the food safety behaviors and practices in a domestic home kitchen, the food safety behaviors of consumers when using an outside grill has not been vastly explored. The objective {{of this study was to}} gain insight on consumers' food safety practices and behaviors when preparing meat and poultry on an outdoor grill. A nationwide survey of grilling consumers (n= 1024) was conducted to evaluate the food handling behaviors of consumers who use an outdoor grill to prepare meat and poultry. The survey consisted of 50 questions based on the four core practices of food safety: clean, separate, <b>cook,</b> <b>and</b> <b>chill.</b> The results showed that there was low adherence to consumers not rinsing meat or poultry before preparation, separating utensils for raw and cooked meat, and using a thermometer to ensure doneness. Respondents who grilled poultry followed safer food handling practices than respondents who grilled meat. An observational study (n= 30) was conducted to observe consumers prepare poultry products on an outdoor grill. Participants were assessed on handwashing skills, cross contamination behavior, and how they determined the doneness of the poultry. This study illustrated that consumers were not washing their hands thoroughly, especially after handling packaging. Many consumers were observed contaminating surfaces or items in their kitchen after touching the raw poultry. Consumers also failed to use clean utensils for the cooked poultry after using the utensil on raw poultry. Consumers used several methods to determine the doneness of the poultry. Visual cues such as looking at the appearance or color of the poultry was primarily used by consumers to check if the poultry was fully cooked, followed by piercing or cutting the poultry open and using a thermometer. Thermometer use in this study was found to be higher than the usage in prior studies. A separate study assessed poultry grilling recipes (n= 242) for a specified temperature of doneness and additional food safety information. Recipes from cookbooks, magazines, and online sources were evaluated. Over half of the recipes did not specify a temperature of doneness, but used time, visual or textural indications to determine doneness. The findings of this research show that consumers could benefit from education to improve their food handling skills when preparing meat or poultry on an outdoor grill. Educational efforts should focus on proper handwashing procedures, how to reduce cross contamination and the importance of using a thermometer to ensure doneness...|$|E

40|$|The {{bacterium}} Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, intracellular, ubiquitous, and facultative food-borne pathogen {{of humans}} and animals. They may occur naturally in environmental sources such as soils, faeces and intestinal tracts of animals and humans. The pathogen causes listeriosis characterized by gastroenteritis, meningitis, abortion, and sometimes death in systemic cases. Neonates, infants, immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and the elderly in particular are most susceptible to listeria infections. In recent times, contamination of foods by L. monocytogenes {{has become a major}} concern to all stake holders in the food industry and the health sector. Their infection has been associated with a number of food-borne outbreaks resulting from the consumption of various foods especially, <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> <b>chilled</b> ready-to-eat foods.

40|$|This is a {{guide to}} the growing, {{harvesting}} and use of spinach and swiss chard. Spinach Spinach is a cool season crop and belongs to the goosefoot family (Chenopodiaceae), along with Swiss chard and beets. Spinach is low in calories. It is a good source of vitamin C, vitamin A, and minerals, especially iron. After washing the leaves, cook them in a covered pan using only the water clinging to the leaves. After cooking, add salt and butter, vinegar, or mustard for added flavor. Spinach may be prepared in a souffle, creamed soup, or used raw in salads. Swiss Chard Swiss chard is a type of beet that is grown for its large leaf stalks and leaves. It produces no enlarged fleshy roots. It is low in calories and minerals and a good source of vitamins A and C. Chard leaves are best prepared like spinach or beet greens - cooking with only the water that clings to them following washing. A bit of garlic or nutmeg and butter enhances the flavor of chard leaves. Chard stems have a delicate flavor much like asparagus and are prepared in a similar way. Stems should be stripped of leaves, cut into conveniently sized pieces, and gently steamed in salted water until tender. <b>Cooked</b> <b>and</b> <b>chilled</b> stems are very good with salad dressing or mayonnaise. Leaves and stems may also be cooked together...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of diabetes mellitus {{is continuing to}} increase and is predicted to effect 439 million adults worldwide by 2030 (Shaw et al. 2010). The disease and its associated complications are a growing epidemic {{and there is a}} need for dietary intervention, for both management and prevention of the disease. The majority of the most popular staple sources of carbohydrates tend to be found in the upper glycaemic index range, rapidly increasing blood glucose levels post ingestion, resulting in poor glycaemic control. Recent research suggests these popular everyday carbohydrates can be readily made “healthier” via the way they are <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> prepared, related to the consumption of resistant starch and its ability to lower blood glucose during the post prandial period. This discovery has the potential to target poor glycaemic control and alleviate the risk of diabetes to the population. The aim of the current study was to investigate and compare the postprandial glycaemic effects of freshly <b>cooked,</b> <b>chilled</b> overnight <b>and</b> <b>chilled</b> <b>and</b> reheated pasta. Subjects consumed 75 g of pasta in a simple tomato sauce, on the first day the pasta was freshly cooked, the second day it had been <b>chilled</b> overnight <b>and</b> the final day it was reheated after being chilled over two nights. Blood glucose was measured at baseline and for 2 hours post prandial at 15, 30, 45, 75 and 120 minutes. Salivary glucose samples were also taken to examine the potential replacement of blood sampling. Mean blood glucose increased greater initially at 15 minutes following ingestion of the <b>chilled</b> <b>and</b> reheated pasta, however appeared lower during the remainder of the post prandial phase than the freshly <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> <b>chilled</b> pasta. Reflecting the ability of resistant starch to reduce blood glucose during the post prandial phase. However, there was no significant difference between the three pastas. Salivary glucose also did not appear to mirror blood glucose samples, suggesting it may not be a suitable replacement for blood sampling. However, the current study examined non-diabetic individuals, evidence suggests correlation is only found between salivary and blood glucose in diabetics. Further research is required on a larger scale to critically assess pasta that has been <b>chilled</b> <b>and</b> reheated as a “healthier” alternative for glycaemic control. Other starches also need to be analysed to examine if they may have the same potential. Future analysis within this field may be able to develop a dietary intervention capable of tackling the burden of diabetes.

40|$|Spores of {{foodborne}} pathogens can survive traditional thermal-processing schedules {{used in the}} manufacturing of processed meat products. Heat activated spores can germinate and grow to hazardous levels if these products are improperly <b>chilled.</b> Germination <b>and</b> outgrowth of Clostridium perfringens spores in cured and non-cured ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products that were <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> <b>chilled</b> according to commercial processing schedules was studied. Inhibitory effects of organic acid salts on germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens during <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> survival of vegetative cells and spores during subsequent storage at abusive refrigeration temperatures were evaluated. ^ Ready-to-Eat meat products were formulated to achieve final product concentrations of 1 % salt, 0. 2 % potassium tetrapyrophosphate and 0. 2 % starch. The products were subsequently ground and mixed with antimicrobials [sodium lactate (SL) and SL plus sodium diacetate (SD), 2. 5 %; buffered sodium citrate (BSC) and BSC plus SD, 1. 3 %]. The products were inoculated separately, with a three-strain cocktail of C. perfringens spores, mixed, vacuum packaged, commercially cooked to activate spores <b>and</b> <b>chilled</b> exponentially from 54. 5 to 7. 2 °C in 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 h. C. perfringens populations (vegetative and spore) were enumerated before and after cooking as well as during <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> subsequent refrigerated (10 °C) storage for up to 60 days. ^ Germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens spores was observed during all cooling scenarios. Addition of antimicrobials prevented outgrowth of C. perfringens spores, while refrigeration at 10 °C for 60 days was detrimental to survival of vegetative cells. Germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens spores at isothermal temperature conditions was determined for each inoculated product to develop modeling equations and relative growth rates using the modified Gompertz and Baranyi models for non-linear regression. A modified Ratkowsky equation (square-root) was {{used to analyze the}} effect of temperature on relative growth rate. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical method was used to develop final predictive models for each product. ^ Six predictive models were developed to describe germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens in cured and non-cured roast beef, turkey and pork during dynamic cooling. In general, all the models were capable of predicting growth when compared to most validation experiments. These predictive models will allow regulatory agencies as well as meat processors to evaluate product disposition in cases of cooling process deviations. Additionally, these models will allow processors to validate their processing operations with a food safety approach. ...|$|R
40|$|The Monte Carlo (MC) {{simulation}} {{approach is}} traditionally used in food safety risk assessment to study quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) models. When experimental data are available, performing Bayesian inference {{is a good}} alternative approach that allows backward calculation in a stochastic QMRA model to update the experts' knowledge about the microbial dynamics of a given food-borne pathogen. In this article, we propose a complex example where Bayesian inference is applied to a high-dimensional second-order QMRA model. The case study is a farm-to-fork QMRA model considering genetic diversity of [i]Bacillus cereus[/i] in a <b>cooked,</b> pasteurized, <b>and</b> <b>chilled</b> courgette puree. Experimental data are [i]Bacillus cereus[/i] concentrations measured in packages of courgette purees stored at different time-temperature profiles after pasteurization. To perform a Bayesian inference, we first built an augmented Bayesian network by linking a second-order QMRA model to the available contamination data. We then ran a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to update all the unknown concentrations and unknown quantities of the augmented model. About 25 % of the prior beliefs are strongly updated, leading {{to a reduction in}} uncertainty. Some updates interestingly question the QMRA model...|$|R

Department of Agriculture (USDA) stabilization guidelines requiring that the chilling process allow no more than 1 log total growth of C. perfringens in the finished product. This chilling method resulted in average C. perfringens increases of 0. 52 and 0. 68 log units in <b>cooked</b> beef <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> pork, respectively.

40|$|The natural {{contamination}} of foods with a bacterial pathogen frequently {{consists of a}} mixture of strains with their own characteristics of survival, growth potential and virulence. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) must account for this genetic diversity to reflect the variability of the pathogen risk and to identify the genetic groups present at key stages of the food pathway. To describe the transmission dynamics of a heterogeneous population of B. cereus, we developed an exposure model that covers a food processing chain from “farm to table”. The studied food was a <b>cooked,</b> pasteurised <b>and</b> <b>chilled</b> courgette purée used {{as an example of}} Refrigerated Processed Food of Extended Durability (REPFED). The B. cereus population consists of a continuum of genetic groups ranging from mesophilic and highly heat resistant, to psychrotrophic and moderately-heat resistant ones. At each step in a processing chain comprising cooking, blending, mixing with ingredients providing a secondary contamination, pasteurisation <b>and</b> <b>chilling</b> for several weeks, the prevalence of contaminated units (batches or packages) and the spore load within the units was determined for each genetic group, as well as their proportion to the total B. cereus population in the units. The model predicted that all packages contain mesophilic groups just after partitioning. The addition of mesophilic strains by the ingredients during the process of the courgette purée was an important contribution. At the end of the domestic storage, the model predicted a dominance of the mesophilic groups, while only some psychrotrophic groups were presen...|$|R
