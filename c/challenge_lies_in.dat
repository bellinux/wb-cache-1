25|$|Because {{conversion}} of one tree to another by a {{minimum number of}} SPR operations is NP-Hard, solving the problem becomes considerably more difficult as more nodes are considered. The computational <b>challenge</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> finding the optimal edit path, i.e., the one that requires the fewest steps, and different strategies are used in solving the problem. For example, the HorizStory algorithm reduces the problem by first eliminating the consistent nodes; recursive pruning and regrafting reconciles the reference tree with the gene tree and optimal edits are interpreted as HGT events. The SPR methods included in the supertree reconstruction package SPRSupertrees substantially decrease {{the time of the}} search for the optimal set of SPR operations by considering multiple localised sub-problems in large trees through a clustering approach.|$|E
2500|$|EBO has {{not been}} {{abandoned}} as an operating concept in the U.S. military. It is [...] mentioned 124 times in Joint Publication 5-0, Planning of Joint Operations. The U.S. Air Force has actually increased mention of 'effects-based' thinking in official doctrine and has codified it in AF Doctrine Document 2. [...] Lt Gen (Ret) Deptula {{makes the point that}} EBO is not service specific at all, and states, that [...] "EBO can be a springboard for the better linking of military, economic, information, and diplomatic instruments of power to conduct security strategy in depth. The <b>challenge</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> understanding and developing the potential of an effects-based approach to operations. Resistance to this kind of approach may be warranted when individuals mischaracterize EBO as (1) requiring complete knowledge of an adversary’s intentions, (2) discounting the enemy’s human dimension, and (3) being overly dependent on centralization to succeed. With an accurate understanding of the intent of EBO, none of these assertions has any validity." ...|$|E

50|$|If the {{detector}} {{lies in a}} region of high beam activity, it is hit continuously by neutrons and background noise at overwhelmingly high rates. This obfuscates collected data, since there is extreme overlap in measurement, and separate events are not easily distinguished from each other.

30|$|With {{increased}} competition, {{the challenge}} for established companies is {{to move from the}} exploitation-only mode to exploration [26, 27]. Buying a few promising startups and integrating those into established companies has not been proved to be a good strategy, as most of these kind of company acquisitions fail. Modern companies try to implement agile methods to create a corporate culture within the company that would better support exploration and software-enabled innovation, but their <b>challenges</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> what kind of future organizational structures, ways of working, management and investment models and calculations could support this [17].|$|R

This is so because the market and users often pursue a system full of features at the expense of proper operation and protection; although, conversely, as computing elements pervade our daily lives, the demand for stronger security schemes becomes greater than ever. Notably, there is a dire need for a secure mechanism able to encompass all aspects and manifestations of UbiComp, across time as well as space, and in a seamless and efficient manner.|$|R

Research {{demonstrates that}} such spaces can even undermine deliberative participation when they allow hostile, superficial and misinformed content {{to dominate the}} conversation (see also: Internet troll, shitposting). A necessary mechanism that enables these platforms to yield informed citizen debate and contribution to policy is deliberation. It is argued that the <b>challenge</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> creating an online context that does not merely aggregate public input but promotes informed public discussion that may benefit the policy-making process.|$|E
50|$|The final <b>challenge</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> {{the limited}} human resources. There is a {{shortage}} of helpers in provincial and district areas.
