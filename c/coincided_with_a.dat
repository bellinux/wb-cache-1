5|$|Gilchrist {{made his}} Test match {{debut in the}} First Test against Pakistan at the Gabba in Brisbane in November 1999 {{becoming}} the 381st Australian Test cricketer. He replaced Healy, who was dropped after a run of poor form, despite the incumbent's entreaties to the selectors to allow him a farewell game {{in front of his}} home crowd. Gilchrist's entry into the Test arena <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dramatic rise in Australia's fortunes. Up to this point, they had played eight Tests in 1999, winning and losing three.|$|E
5|$|Halliday and Hamilton {{left at the}} end of that championship-winning season, and Halliday was {{replaced}} by Davie Shaw. Aberdeen won the League Cup under his guidance, beating St Mirren in 1955–56, and reached another Scottish Cup final in 1959. However, Shaw stepped aside for another former favourite player, Tommy Pearson, in 1959. Pearson's time in charge <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high turnover of players, and yielded no trophies. He retired in 1965, making way for Eddie Turnbull.|$|E

Phát's promotion <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> coup by General Nguyễn Khánh against the officers who removed Diệm. Many of these, such as Generals Trần Văn Đôn, Lê Văn Kim, Tôn Thất Đính and Mai Hữu Xuân were put under house arrest, opening up vacancies for other generals.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional {{factor in the}} decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it {{spent a lot of}} time on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1169, an {{expedition}} of Cambro-Norman knights with {{an army of}} about six hundred landed at Bannow Strand in present-day County Wexford.

The invasion, which <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> period of renewed Norman expansion, was {{at the invitation of}} Dermot Mac Murrough, the king of Leinster.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg {{served as}} {{chancellor}} at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1958 to 1961. His term <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relaxation of McCarthy-era restrictions on students' {{freedom of expression}} that had begun under his predecessor, Clark Kerr. In October 1958, Seaborg announced that the University had relaxed its prior prohibitions on political activity on a trial basis, and the ban on communists speaking on campus was lifted. This {{paved the way for}} the Free Speech Movement of 1964-65.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after her}} sister Marie {{was married to}} Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania, a search was made for a {{suitable}} husband for Victoria. Her visit to her grandmother Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle {{in the autumn of}} 1891 <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> visit by her cousin Prince Ernest Louis of Hesse, heir to the grand ducal throne of Hesse. Both were artistic and fun loving, got along well and even shared a birthday. The Queen, observing this, was very keen for her two grandchildren to marry.|$|E
5|$|The Anahuac Disturbances in 1832 {{were the}} first open revolt against Mexican rule and they <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> revolt in Mexico against the nation's president.

They {{took advantage of the}} lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom. Texians met at the Convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood, among other issues. The following year, Texians reiterated their demands at the Convention of 1833.|$|E

5|$|The {{occupation}} <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> religious {{revival in}} Belgium which {{had always been}} overwhelmingly Catholic. The Primate of Belgium, Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier, became {{an outspoken critic of}} the German occupation regime. Mercier published a celebrated pamphlet entitled Patriotisme et Endurance (Patriotism and Endurance) on Christmas Day 1914 which called for civilians to observe occupation laws only which were consistent with Belgian patriotism and Christian values. The pamphlet attacked the authority of the German occupying government, stating that any rule legitimised by force alone should not be obeyed.|$|E

Basil II might have sought the support of other Balkan rulers for his fight against Samuel, and he intensified diplomatic contacts with Duklja for this purpose. A Serbian diplomatic mission, most likely sent from Duklja, arrived in the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 992 and was recorded in a charter of the Great Lavra Monastery, written in 993.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} thigh injury restricted Whalley's first-team involvement at {{the start}} of the following season, which also <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> change in management at the club, after a poor start to the season left Shrewsbury rooted to the bottom of the League One table. Whalley scored his first goal of the season against Oxford United, deep in injury time, to seal a 2–0 victory for new manager Paul Hurst in his first home league match in charge. After becoming a first-team regular under Hurst, and helping Shrewsbury avoid relegation once again in 2016–17, Whalley signed a two-year contract extension in May 2017.|$|E
5|$|An injury {{sustained}} on 25 August 1990 kept Gibbs out for two months, {{and once}} he had regained full fitness, his team were bottom of the table. His return <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> winless run of seven league matches, leaving Watford seven points from safety with nearly half the season gone. Nonetheless, Watford managed to climb to 20th place, and despite missing 14 games, Gibbs was once again shortlisted for the club's end of season award. In 1991–92 Gibbs finally became Player of the Season. Missing only three matches, he rounded off a good season by scoring his first goal in four years in Watford's last league game, cementing a top-ten finish in the Second Division.|$|E

5|$|Back to the Egg is {{the seventh}} and final studio album by the British-American band Wings, {{released}} in 1979 on Columbia Records in America, and on Parlophone in the UK. Co-produced by Chris Thomas, the album reflects band leader Paul McCartney's embracing of contemporary musical trends such as new wave and punk, and marked the arrival of new Wings members Laurence Juber and Steve Holley. Back to the Egg adopts a loose conceptual theme around {{the idea of a}} working band, and its creation <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> period of considerable activity for the group, which included making a return to touring and work on several television and film projects.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1810s and 1850s {{there were}} a series of changes in {{ownership}} and management. These <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Puritan revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; reductions in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial crises and fell into a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when James Henry Chute, who was {{the manager of the}} Bath Assembly Rooms and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready, took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise.|$|E
5|$|By 1209 de Gray was in Ireland {{serving as}} the king's governor, an office {{sometimes}} referred to as justiciar for Ireland. One possible reason for his appointment was to save him from being accused of ignoring the interdict on England. As a bishop, it was de Gray's ecclesiastical duty to enforce the interdict, but by going to Ireland, which was not under interdict, he could continue to serve the king without provoking the papacy. De Gray's chief policy in Ireland was to extend English rule, to which end he was involved in battles on the River Shannon and in Fermanagh. He also replaced the Irish coinage with English, and attempted unsuccessfully to make English laws applicable in Ireland. De Gray's term of office in Ireland <b>coincided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> time of change in Irish governmental practices.|$|E
