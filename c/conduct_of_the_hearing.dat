If the court should find that there is no probable cause, then typically the prosecution will cease. [...] Many jurisdictions, however, allow the prosecution to seek a new preliminary hearing, or even seek a bill of indictment from a grand jury.|$|R

Lodge stated [...] "I shall not attempt to characterize these methods of leaving out of the printed text parts of the testimony and proceedings... because I think they speak for themselves." [...] Lodge soon fell out with McCarthy and joined the effort to reduce McCarthy's influence.|$|E
50|$|It is the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> which underlines {{that the}} judge had become too {{personally}} involved in the decision he was being asked to make to guarantee the necessary judicial objectivity which would be required in the trustee proceedings. I identify three particular features. First, the witness who supported the application was in effect cross-examined by the judge in something of the style of an advocate instructed to oppose the application. Second, the submission by counsel for the applicant {{that the judge}} had given evidence was in the circumstances unsurprising, and the concerns he expressed on this topic were validly made. Finally, the judge impugned the good faith of the application, a conclusion repeated in the strongest terms in his judgment {{when there is no}} shred of evidence to suggest some ulterior or improper motive behind the application.|$|E

40|$|In the {{investigation}} of crimes against patrimony, {{an important role in}} {{the investigation}} methodology is played by the hearings. In general, we refer to three types of hearings, the hearing at the scene of the crime – in order to prepare the search of the crime scene and the subsequent investigation of the offence, a hearing as part of the criminal investigation and the hearing before the court. Throughout this article we will discuss particularly the forensic tactics of hearings as part of the criminal investigation, referring to the different statuses of the person undergoing the hearing, who may belong to different backgrounds/categories of various legal standings, namely those of: victim - injured party, witness, accused or defendant. In the first part of the article, we will present the provisions relevant for crimes against patrimony, contained in the Romanian Criminal Code. The Special Part, in the title reserved for the offences of this category, the structure of the title, and also short references to the legal content of each offence.
