5|$|A CNN film crew, {{who were}} there on a routine <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{possible}} Falun Gong protest, observed a man sitting down on the pavement northeast of the Monument to the People's Heroes at {{the centre of the}} square. He proceeded to pour gasoline over himself and set himself ablaze. Police officers quickly congregated on the scene and extinguished the flames. Shortly afterwards, another four people on the square set themselves alight. One of the four, a man, was detained and driven away in a police van.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E

2500|$|Four RCMP officers, Constables Gerry Rundel, Bill Bentley, Kwesi Millington, and {{supervisor}} Corporal Benjamin Robinson, {{arrived and}} entered the Customs room where Dziekański was pacing about. They apparently directed him to stand near a counter, to which Dziekański complied but picked up a stapler sometime after being told to place his hands on a counter. Shortly thereafter, about 25 seconds after arriving at the scene, Corporal Robinson ordered the Taser to be used. Constable Millington tasered Dziekański. He began to convulse and was tasered several more times after falling to the ground, where the four officers pinned, handcuffed, and continued to taser him. One eyewitness, who recorded the incident on her cellphone, told CBC News that Dziekański had been tasered four times. [...] "The third and fourth ones were at the same time" [...] delivered by the officers at Dziekański's right and left, just before Dziekański fell. According to B.C. Crown counsel spokesman Stan Lowe, Dziekański was tasered {{a total of five}} times. Constable Millington testified that he deployed the Taser four times, but he believed that in some of those instances the probes may not have contacted Dziekański's body. Dziekański writhed and screamed before he stopped moving. Cpl. Benjamin Monty Robinson stated he then checked for a pulse, but his heart had stopped. [...] Testimony from the other RCMP officers state they never saw anyone including Robinson <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pulse. Dziekański did not receive CPR until paramedics arrived on the scene approximately 15 minutes later. They were unable to revive him and pronounced him dead at the scene.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bounded model {{checking}} is a verification technique {{based on}} searching for counter-examples to {{the validity of}} the specification using an encoding to propositional sastisfiability. The paper identifies a number of inefficiencies in prior encodings <b>for</b> bounded model <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> logic of knowledge and branching time. An alternate encoding is developed, and theoretical and experimental results are presented that show this leads to improved performance of bounded model <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> range of examples. ...|$|R

25|$|As {{shown by}} the table above, because many {{procedures}} are optional, border guards have discretion in deciding how rigorously they check travellers at external border crossing points. As a result, {{the length of time}} taken to perform checks differs between Schengen countries. Under the previous regime (whereby those with the right to freedom of movement were subject only to a 'minimum check'), <b>an</b> entry <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> EU, EEA or Swiss citizen took around five seconds on average in Italy, whilst in Norway, on average it took around 1 minute. The disparities in checks on third-country nationals (who are subject to a more thorough check) are even greater. <b>For</b> example, <b>an</b> entry <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Annex II national takes around 15 seconds on average in Greece, whilst it takes three to five minutes on average in Slovakia. Similarly, <b>an</b> entry <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Annex I national on average lasts around 30–60 seconds in The Netherlands, whilst in Latvia, it lasts around two to five minutes on average.|$|R
