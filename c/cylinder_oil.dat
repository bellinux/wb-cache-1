As a result, the addition of oil to the asphalt has reduced the solvency of maltenes. The higher the added percentages of oil are seen, the softer the asphalt-UCO binders happen.

30|$|When an {{output curve}} {{force is applied}} to a {{horizontal}} servo cylinder with a heavy load, the piston rod bears a dynamic partial load based on the installation and load characteristics, which significantly affects the frequency response and control accuracy of the servo cylinder. Based on this partial load, increased friction can lead to cylinder bore scuffing, leakage, lack of output power, or even system failure. In this paper, a novel asymmetric static-pressure support structure is proposed based on the principle of hydrostatic support. The radial component force of a dynamic partial load is balanced by cooperation between the support oil cushion of the variable hydraulic pressure support structure, oil cushion of the supportive force, and the damper. Adaptive control of the servo cylinder piston rod, guide sleeve, and piston, as well as the <b>cylinder</b> <b>oil</b> film friction between lubricated surfaces is achieved. In this paper, theoretical design and analysis of the traditional hydrostatic bearing structure and novel structure are presented. A hydraulic dynamic shear scissor is used as a research target to derive a structural dynamic model. Comparative simulations are performed using Matlab Simulink. Additionally, flow field analysis of the novel structure is performed, which verifies the rationality and feasibility of the proposed structure and system.|$|E

In Korea, a motor-driven cylinder lubricator for a large two-stroke marine diesel engine manufactured by Wärtsilä Switzerland Co., Ltd. was first developed by authors through the joint research of industry-university in 2002. The characteristic of the developed product is that can control automatically the oil feed rate to a load fluctuation by the motor drive and the offset cam.

In this study, the effect of quill with and without accumulator on maximum discharge pressure, delivery delay duration and oil feed rate relative to motor revolution speed using plunger stroke as a parameter is experimentally investigated by using the developed cylinder lubricator. It is found that the maximum discharge pressure with accumulator is higher than that of no accumulator as plunger stroke and motor revolution speed are elevated, and the delivery delay duration with accumulator is shorter than that of no accumulator as plunger stroke and motor revolution speed are increased.

A motor-driven cylinder lubricator for Sulzer RT-flex large two-stroke diesel engines developed by authors {{is in need of}} mounting a quill system to lubricate cylinder parts for a smooth operation. In order to apply the common-rail lubricating system to the developed cylinder lubricator as the second research stage, the mechanical quill system with a progressively quantitative distributor (M. D. S.) is improved in the electronically controlled quill system with an accumulating distributor (E. D. S.). In this study, the effects of lubricator motor speed, plunger stroke and cylinder back pressure on oil feed rate and inequality rate are experimentally investigated by applying E. D. S. to the developed cylinder lubricator. It is found that the oil feed rate of E. D. S. is higher than that of M. D. S. because of the increase of delivery speed and volume by changing the role of accumulator in the same experimental condition. It can be also shown that, in E. D. S., the inequality rate is decreased a little or hardly unchanged as {{the cylinder}} back pressure and plunger stroke is elevated, while the inequality rate increased in M. D.

40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} reduction {{of more than}} 20 % can be achieved through engine friction reduction. Piston and piston rings contribute {{approximately half of the}} total engine friction and are therefore central to friction reduction efforts. The most common method to reduce mechanical losses from piston rings has been to lower ring tension, the normal force providing sealing between the piston ring and the cylinder liner. However tension reduction can result in additional lubricant consumption. The objective of this thesis is to understand and model the physical mechanisms resulting in flow of oil to the combustion chamber in order to achieve optimal designs of piston rings. The optimal design is a compromise between friction reduction and adequate gas and lubricant sealing performance. To do so a multi-scale curved beam finite element model of piston ring is developed. It is built to couple ring deformation, dynamics and contact with the piston and the <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Oil</b> flow at the interfaces between the ring and the cylinder liner and between the ring and the piston groove can thus be simulated. The piston ring model is used to study the sealing performance of the Oil Control Ring (OCR), whose function is to limit the amount of oil supplied to the ring pack. The contributions of the three main mechanisms previously identified, to oil flow past the OCR are quantified: - Deformation of the cylinder under operating conditions can lead to a loss of contact between the ring and the liner. - Tilting of the piston around its pin can force the OCR to twist and scrape oil from the liner. - Oil accumulating below the OCR can flow to the groove and leak {{on the top of the}} OCR The OCR is found to be flexible enough to limit the impact of cylinder deformation on oil consumption. Both ring scraping and flow through the OCR groove can contribute to oil consumption in the range of engine running conditions simulated. Reduction of scraping is possible by increasing the ability of both OCR lands to maintain contact with the liner regardless of piston groove tilt. The flow of oil through the OCR groove can be reduced by designing appropriate draining of oil in the groove and an adequate oil reservoir below the OCR. The piston ring oil transport model developed in this thesis will be a valuable tool to optimize ring pack designs to achieve further ring pack friction reduction without increasing oil consumption. by Camille Baelden.
