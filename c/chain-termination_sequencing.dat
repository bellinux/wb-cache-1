50|$|DNA sequencing, one of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} technologies developed to study genetics, allows researchers to determine the sequence of nucleotides in DNA fragments. The technique of <b>chain-termination</b> <b>sequencing,</b> developed in 1977 by a team led by Frederick Sanger, is still routinely used to sequence DNA fragments. Using this technology, researchers have been able to study the molecular sequences associated with many human diseases.|$|E

Researchers {{have been unable to}} exceed this average read size; like <b>chain-termination</b> <b>sequencing</b> alone, MS-based DNA sequencing may not be suitable for large de novo sequencing projects. Even so, a recent study did use the short sequence reads and mass spectroscopy to compare single-nucleotide polymorphisms in pathogenic Streptococcus strains.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, Walter Fiers and {{his team}} at the University of Ghent {{were the first to}} {{determine}} the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein. The subsequent development of <b>chain-termination</b> DNA <b>sequencing</b> in 1977 by Frederick Sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing {{and turned it into a}} routine laboratory tool. An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases of the Human Genome Project.|$|R
50|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} {{may be used}} {{to determine}} DNA sequences. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, or MALDI-TOF MS, has specifically been investigated as an alternative method to gel electrophoresis for visualizing DNA fragments. With this method, DNA fragments generated by <b>chain-termination</b> <b>sequencing</b> reactions are compared by mass rather than by size. The mass of each nucleotide is different from the others and this difference is detectable by mass spectrometry. Single-nucleotide mutations in a fragment can be more easily detected with MS than by gel electrophoresis alone. MALDI-TOF MS can more easily detect differences between RNA fragments, so researchers may indirectly sequence DNA with MS-based methods by converting it to RNA first.|$|E
40|$|Reproductive tract {{infection}} {{is a major}} initiator of preterm birth (PTB). The objective of this prospective cohort study of 88 participants {{was to determine whether}} PTB correlates with the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy. Total DNA was purified from posterior vaginal fornix swabs during gestation. The 16 S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction primers, followed by <b>chain-termination</b> <b>sequencing.</b> Bacteria were identified by comparing contig consensus sequences with the Ribosomal Database Project. Dichotomous responses were summarized via proportions and continuous variables via means ± standard deviation. Mean Shannon Diversity index differed by Welch t test (P =. 00016) between caucasians with PTB and term gestation. Species diversity was greatest among African Americans (P =. 0045). Change in microbiome/Lactobacillus content and presence of putative novel/noxious bacteria did not correlate with PTB. We conclude that uncultured vaginal bacteria {{play an important role in}} PTB and race/ethnicity and sampling location are important determinants of the vaginal microbiome. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|E
40|$|Two sets of {{synthetic}} oligonucleotides coding for amino acids in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions of wheat germ agglutinin were synthesized {{and used as}} hybridization probes to screen cDNA libraries derived from developing embryos of tetraploid wheat. The nucleotide sequence for a cDNA clone recovered from the cDNA library was determined by dideoxynucleotide <b>chain-termination</b> <b>sequencing</b> in vector M 13. The amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence indicated that this cDNA clone (pNVR 1) encodes isolectin 3 of wheat germ agglutinin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of clone pNVR 1 with published sequences indicates isolectin 3 differs from isolectins 1 and 2 by 10 and 8 amino acid changes, respectively. In addition, the protein encoded by pNVR 1 extends 15 amino acids beyond the carboxyl terminus of the published amino acid sequence for isolectins 1 and 2 and includes a potential site for N-linked glycosylation. Utilizing the insert of pNVR 1 as a hybridization probe, we have demonstrated that the expression of genes for wheat germ agglutinin is modulated by exogenous abscisic acid. Striking homology is observed between wheat germ agglutinin and chitinase, {{both of which are}} proteins that bind chitin...|$|E
40|$|The {{limiting}} {{factors of}} a cell-free system from rat brain for incorporating amino acids into protein were studied. The initial more rapid incorporation by microsomes, {{as opposed to}} that by ribosomes, is suggested {{to be due to}} damage of the ribosomes by detergent. The defect is rectifiable by incubation of the ribosomes in cell sap, so that ribosomes eventually incorporate more amino acid than do microsomes. This may be because ribonuclease, which is associated with the microsomes but removed by detergent treatment, inactivates the microsomal system. The factor that causes incorporation by microsomes to cease abruptly within 1 h is not the lack of any precursor or of adenosine triphosphate, of the inactivation of cell-sap factors or the accumulation of inhibitory substances, but is a deficiency of usable messenger ribonucleic acid. Chain initiation in the system is negligible. Ribosomes also become jammed at the end of messenger ribonucleic acid molecules, unable to terminate protein chains. This eventually leads to jammed polyribosomes, which can be partially relieved by very low concentrations of puromycin. A study of the release of polypeptides synthesized in response to the addition of synthetic messengers did not provide any conclusive information on <b>chain-termination</b> <b>sequences,</b> but did indicate some phenomena that were artifacts. It is concluded that ribonuclease action is sufficient to account for all the deficiencies of the cell-free system, but a lack of chain initiation may be a contributory factor...|$|R
50|$|With the newfound {{molecular}} understanding of inheritance came {{an explosion of}} research. A notable theory arose from Tomoko Ohta in 1973 with her amendment to the neutral theory of molecular evolution through publishing the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. In this theory, Ohta {{stressed the importance of}} natural selection and the environment to the rate at which genetic evolution occurs. One important development was <b>chain-termination</b> DNA <b>sequencing</b> in 1977 by Frederick Sanger. This technology allows scientists to read the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule. In 1983, Kary Banks Mullis developed the polymerase chain reaction, providing a quick way to isolate and amplify a specific section of DNA from a mixture. The efforts of the Human Genome Project, Department of Energy, NIH, and parallel private efforts by Celera Genomics led to the sequencing of the human genome in 2003.|$|R
2500|$|In 1977 Sanger {{and colleagues}} {{introduced}} the [...] "dideoxy" [...] <b>chain-termination</b> method for <b>sequencing</b> DNA molecules, {{also known as}} the [...] "Sanger method". This was a major breakthrough and allowed long stretches of DNA to be rapidly and accurately sequenced. It earned him his second Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1980, which he shared with Walter Gilbert and Paul Berg. The new method was used by Sanger and colleagues to sequence human mitochondrial DNA (16,569 base pairs) and bacteriophage λ (48,502 base pairs). The dideoxy method was eventually used to sequence the entire human genome.|$|R
40|$|X-linked {{ichthyosis}} (XLI) is an {{inborn error}} of metabolism caused by steroid sulfatase (STS) deficiency. In more than 80 % of XLI patients the enzyme deficiency {{is due to}} large deletions involving the entire STS gene and flanking sequences. However, some patients with the classical XLI phenotype and complete STS deficiency do not show any detectable deletions by Southern blot analysis using full-length STS cDNA as a probe. We have studied five unrelated patients who are such "nondeletion" mutants. Western blot analysis using anti-STS antibodies was performed on patients' fibroblast extracts and revealed absence of cross-reacting material. First-strand cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription from patients' RNA isolated from cultured fibroblasts and PCR amplification of overlapping segments of the entire STS polypeptide coding region were performed. Three point mutations were identified by chemical mismatch cleavage, sequenced by dideoxynucleotide <b>chain-termination</b> <b>sequencing</b> and confirmed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization of the patients' genomic DNA. The mutations resulted in the substitution of a tryptophan for an arginine at codon 1319, changing a hydrophobic to a basic hydrophilic amino acid, the substitution of a cysteine for a tyrosine at codon 1542, potentially losing a disulfide bond, and the substitution of a serine for a leucine at codon 1237. These are the first point mutations to be documented in the STS gene and may allow insight into functionally important domains of the protein...|$|E
40|$|Consensus {{sequences}} {{for both}} wt and ca B/Ann Arbor/ 1 / 66 viral PB 2, PB 1, PA, NP, M, and NS genes were directly determined from vRNA {{using a combination}} of chemical and <b>chain-termination</b> <b>sequencing</b> methods. There were 105 sites of difference between the wt and ca sets of these six RNA genes. The differences resulted in 26 amino acid substitutions distributed over the six proteins. The sequence changes were compared to the sequences of other known influenza type B wt viruses to pinpoint those changes that were unique to the ca B/Ann Arbor/ 1 / 66 virus. Of the 26 amino acid differences, only 11 were unique to the cold-adapted virus. These unique sites were distributed among five of the six genes. The NS protein had no amino acid substitutions. The sequence changes are discussed in terms of their probable mode of origin and selection, and in terms of their importance to the cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive, and attenuation phenotypes of ca B/AA/ 1 / 66 virus. The sequence and organization of the PB 2 gene and predicted protein are also given. The PB 2 gene was 2396 nucleotides long, and it encoded a predicted protein of 770 amino acids with a molecular weight of 88, 035 Da for the wt virus and 88, 072 Da for the ca virus.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether alternative resistance mechanisms, other than mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of DNA gyrase, could confer fluoroquinolone resistance in Clostridium difficile. An in vitro-generated C. difficile mutant exhibiting increased fluoroquinolone resistance was isolated through antibiotic selection on ciprofloxacin. The QRDR of this mutant was investigated by <b>chain-termination</b> <b>sequencing</b> and was found to be devoid of mutation. To determine the nature of the non-QRDR resistance mechanism in this strain, the genomes of the mutant and wild-type strains were sequenced. The gyrBA region from a collection of clinical isolates exhibiting variable fluoroquinolone resistance levels was also sequenced and was compared with that present in 918 publicly available C. difficile genomic data sets. Whole-genome sequence analysis of the fluoroquinolone-resistant mutant revealed a single non-synonymous substitution (Ala 384 Asp) at the predicted primary dimer interface of GyrA, far beyond the classically defined QRDR. This novel mutation caused increased resistance to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin while conferring hypersusceptibility to novobiocin. Several novel extra-QRDR polymorphisms in C. difficile DNA gyrase were identified among clinical isolates, whilst observed fluoroquinolone resistance in strains devoid of gyrBA mutations confirmed the existence of DNA gyrase-independent resistance mechanisms in this species. In conclusion, we report the first non-QRDR mutation to confer fluoroquinolone resistance in C. difficile. Although the Ala 384 Asp substitution was not detected in clinical isolates, this study revealed a diversity of alternative extra-QRDR polymorphisms in DNA gyrase whose association with fluoroquin- olone resistance warrants further investigation...|$|E

We have cloned {{the gene for}} MBHA and determined its sequence by the dideoxy <b>chain-termination</b> technique. The <b>sequence</b> data show the probable sites for translational initiation and termination and suggest that MBHA does not contain a cleaved leader signal peptide. The DNA sequence shows four strong internal homologies.

40|$|Abstractδ-Crystallin {{is a major}} lens protein {{present in}} the avian and reptilian lenses. To {{facilitate}} the cloning of the δ-crystallin gene, cDNA was constructed from the poly(A) + RNA of pigeon lenses, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR product was then subcloned into pUC 19 vector and transformed into E. coli strain JM 109. Plasmids purified from the positive clones were prepared for nucleotide sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide <b>chain-termination</b> method. <b>Sequencing</b> two clones, containing 1. 4 kb DNA inserts coding for δ-crystallin allowed {{the construction of a}} complete, full-length reading frame of 1, 417 bp covering a deduced protein sequence of 466 amino acids, including the universal translation-initiating methionine. The pigeon δ-crystallin shows 88, 83 and 69 % sequence identity to duck δ 2, chicken δ 1 crystallins and human argininosuccinate lyase respectively. It is also shown that, in contrast to duck δ 2 crystallin which has a high argininosuccinate lyase activity, pigeon δ-crystallin appears to contain very low activity of this enzyme, {{despite the fact that they}} share a highly homologous structure. A structural comparison of δ-crystallins with or without enzymatic activity suggested several amino acid replacements which may account for the loss of argininosuccinate lyase activity in the lenses of certain avian species...|$|R
40|$|In 1995 at a sea-farm in Ireland, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts from a {{freshwater}} hatchery {{were introduced}} in spring and autumn into two marine rearing sites, one with and one without a history of epizootic mortality believed due to parasitic encephalitis. No neurologic signs were observed, but parasites and encephalitis were detected in brains of smolts from both sites, with prevalences of each that were significantly greater in smolts from the site with a previous history of epizootic mortality. Parasites and encephalitis were first detected in smolts sampled at 26 and 4 days post-introduction, respectively. Histopathologic examinations of brains showed that parasites were detected with significantly greater frequency in the optic tectum of the mesencephalon than in the diencephalon, metencephalon, or myelencephalon, and were not detected in the telencephalon. Foci of encephalitis were non-suppurative, multifocal, and were detected in each neuroanatomical subdivision, with significantly greater frequency in the myelencephalon. The ultrastructure of the parasite was that of an intercellular, presporogonic, multicellular, developmental stage of a histozoic myxosporean. Parasite stages were branching tubular structures containing generative cells arranged individually or in cell-in-cell doublets, and were located between bundles of axons with compression of axons along segments of their plasmalemma. No mature spores were detected. Polymerase chain reaction, Southern hybridization, dideoxynucleotide <b>chain-termination</b> DNA <b>sequencing,</b> and in situ hybridization were used in concert to characterize segments of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Assessments of homology were made between sequences from the SSU rRNA gene of the parasite and those of seven myxosporeans from three separate genera, e. g., Myxobolus, Henneguya, and Ceratomyxa. The partial SSU rRNA gene sequence from the parasite was most homologous to SSU rRNA gene sequences from species of Myxobolus, and was 99 % homologous to sequences from the SSU rRNA gene of Myxobolus cerebralis. These sequence data represent the first molecular characterization of a myxosporean based entirely on genetic material from the vegetative stage, and indicate that the myxosporean associated with parasitic encephalitis of farmed Atlantic salmon is most likely a neurotropic species of the genus Myxobolus. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{genes for}} the alpha- and beta-subunit apoproteins of allophycocyanin (AP) were {{isolated}} from the cyanelle genome of Cyanophora paradoxa and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. The AP beta-subunit apoprotein gene was localized to a 7. 8 -kilobase-pair Pst I restriction fragment from cyanelle DNA by hybridization with a tetradecameric oligonucleotide probe. Sequence analysis using that oligonucleotide and its complement as primers for the dideoxy <b>chain-termination</b> <b>sequencing</b> method confirmed the presence of both AP alpha- and beta-subunit genes on this restriction fragment. Additional oligonucleotide primers were synthesized as sequencing progressed and {{were used to determine}} rapidly the nucleotide sequence of a 1336 -base-pair region of this cloned fragment. This strategy allowed the sequencing to be completed without a detailed restriction map and without extensive and time-consuming subcloning. The sequenced region contains two open reading frames whose deduced amino acid sequences are 81 - 85 % homologous to cyanobacterial and red algal AP subunits whose amino acid sequences have been determined. The two open reading frames are in the same orientation and are separated by 39 base pairs. AP alpha is 5 ' to AP beta and both coding sequences are preceded by a polypurine, Shine-Dalgarno-type sequence. Sequences upstream from AP alpha closely resemble the Escherichia coli consensus promoter sequences and also show considerable homology to promoter sequences for several chloroplast-encoded psbA genes. A 56 -base-pair palindromic sequence downstream from the AP beta gene could {{play a role in the}} termination of transcription or translation.

40|$|XveII 限制修飾系統是由 Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria 7 - 1 (Xcv 7 - 1) 菌株中所選殖出來，包含 xveIIM 及 xveIIR 基因，為一種 SmaI-like 限制修飾系統。xveIIM 基因可轉譯出 XveII 甲基轉移酶 (M. XveII) ，會將 5 ′-CCCGGG- 3 ′ 中第二個 C 進行甲基化，是屬於 m 4 C-甲基轉移酶。而 xveIIR 基因預測為一含 813 鹼基對之 ORF，但在第 484 至 486 個鹼基對 (即第 162 個胺基酸位置) 具有一內在 TAA 終止密碼，其表現出來的 XveII 分子量僅 18. 3 kDa 為一無功能蛋白。為探討第 162 胺基酸位置在 XveII 所扮演的角色，本研究針對 xveIIR 基因，以定點突變的方法將此基因內在 TAA 終止密碼以二十種不同胺基酸密碼子取代，並命名為 xveIIR-mut 基因。突變基因於 E. coli ER 2566 菌株表現與純化後，可得到約 31 kDa 的 XveII-mut，並發現大部份取代株可以恢復限制酶活性，切割在 5 ′-CCCGGG- 3 ′辨識序列的 C 與 G 之間形成平端的產物 (CCC↓GGG) ，且切割活性以 {{tryptophan}} 取代株 (XveII-W) 最高，但卻遠低於 SmaI 的切割活性；而與 DNA 的親和力則是以 XveII-S 為最佳 (KD = 97. 4 nM) 。藉由交聯反應與分子篩管柱分析，XveII-mut 是以雙隅體的構形呈現。因此亦利用四個連續 glycine 的密碼子 (GGC) 將二個相同之 xveIIR-mut 基因串聯，可以表現出由 555 個胺基酸所構成之單一胜肽雙隅體 (XveII-mutD) 。所表現之 XveII-mutD 並未改變其專一性，且其切割活性與 DNA 結合能力及穩定性等皆優於 XveII-mut。在第 162 位置由不同胺基酸取代株，會造成活性之差異，顯示此位置之胺基酸在 XveII 中可能扮演重要角色。根據 DNA 切割的結果分析，XveII-mut 對於帶有不同鄰邊序列的辨識切位，具有不同的切割效率與結合能力。利用帶有不同鄰邊序列的質體或線形 DNA 的切割實驗，顯示 XveII-WD 較偏好 A 或 T 之相鄰序列；至於 CC 的組合要視更外側的核苷酸序列才可決定其切割速率；對於 GC 鄰邊序列切割速率則最慢。進一步藉由 XveII-I 結構分析，了解 XveII 中第 162 胺基酸位置可能扮演之角色，同時推測 SmaI 中重要胺基酸位置。由 XveII-I 結晶繞射得到 2. 7 Å 的解析度，經比對與 NaeI 限制酶的 Endo domain 具有空間上的重疊性，推測活性中心區域為 E 80 -YD 105 -K 116 ，而參與 DNA 結合的胺基酸為 Asp 241 、Glu 245 與 Lys 247 ，將這些位置以 alanine 取代後皆喪失切割能力，其中 XveII-IK 247 A 則幾乎喪失了 DNA 結合能力。藉由胺基酸序列的比對，推測 SmaI 的活性中心胺基酸為 E 72 -HD 98 -K 109 ，與 XveII-I 的活性中心皆為非典型的 PD-(D/E) XK superfamily。XveII-I 形成雙隅體介面是位在 N-端區域 helix bundles 間形成疏水性作用力，即由胺基酸 Ile 21 、Val 24 和 Phe 69 所形成。至於第 162 胺基酸位置是座落於 α/β 結構中心的 α 4 與 α 5 之間，接近金屬離子結合區域，因此推測 XveII 第 162 位置由不同胺基酸的取代，會改變與 DNA 之間構形改變，進而導致活性的差異性。The XveII restriction-modification (R-M) system, xveIIM and xveIIR, is a SmaI-like R-M {{system and}} cloned from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria strain 7 - 1 (Xcv 7 - 1). The xveIIM encoding the XveII methyltransferase (M. XveII) methylates the second cytosine of the 5 '-CCCGGG- 3 ' recognition sequence and {{belongs to the}} m 4 C-methyltransferase family. However, an internal TAA stop codon was found to locate at nucleotide 484 - 486 (the 162 nd amino acid residue) of the predicted xveIIR ORF resulting in an 18. 3 kDa nonfunctional protein product. Site-directed mutagenesis was applied to replace the internal TAA stop codon of the xveIIR gene with twenty different amino acid codons and designated as xveIIR-mut. Each of the recombinant XveII-mut was overexpressed and purified from E. coli ER 2566 {{and most of the}} 31 kDa XveII mutant enzymes restore restriction activities. The specificities of XveII mutant enzymes, being identical to SmaI, cleave between C and G of the 5 '-CCCGGG recognition sequence and yield a blunt-ended product. The cleavage activity of the tryptophan substituted enzyme (XveII-W) is the highest among the mutants, however, still lower than that of SmaI. The mutant XveII-S was found to have the highest binding affinity to the cognate DNA (KD = 97. 4 nM). According to the results of glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments and size exclusion chromatography, XveII-mut was determined to exist as a dimer. XveII-mutD was constructed by ligating two xveIIR-mut genes with 4 continuous glycine codons and expressed as a single polypeptide dimer of XveII-mut with 63 kDa molecular weight. The specificities of XveII-mutD were the same as those of the XveII-muts while the DNA cleavage, binding activities, and stability of XveII-mutD were higher than those of the corresponding XveII-mut. The mutant enzymes exhibited different activities, indicating that different amino acid substitutions at the 162 nd position might {{play an important role in}} XveII. Results showed that the cleavage rate and the DNA binding activites of XveII-mut were influenced by different flanking sequences of the recognition site. Plasmid and linealized DNA with different flanking sequence of the recognition site were used for digestion and revealed that XveII-WD prefer A or T immediately adjacent to the SmaI sites. Base composition next to the CC flanking sequence of the SmaI site had influence on the cleavage rate. Moreover, the one with GC flanking sequence had the lowest cleavage rate. To explore the roles of the 162 nd amino acid in XveII-mut the crystal structure of the DNA-free XveII-I was determined and analyzed at 2. 7 Å resolution. Results showed that structure of XveII-I spatial superimposed with the Endo domain of NaeI and suggested that E 80 -YD 105 -K 116 is the active site motif and Asp 241, Glu 245 and Lys 247 are involved in DNA binding. Alanine-substitution at these predicted amino acid residues were constructed and found that these XveII-I mutants lost cleavage activity on double-stranded DNA. In addition, mutant XveIIK 247 A was almost completely lost DNA binding activity. Amino acid alignment revealed that E 72 -HD 98 -K 109 are the catalytic residues of SmaI and both of XveII and SmaI are not typical PD-(D/E) XK superfamily nucleases. Based on the crystal structure of XveII-I, we proposed that the three hydrophobic residues, Ile 21 and Val 24 and Phe 69, are responsible for its dimerization by hydrophobic contacts between helix bundles in its N-terminal region. The 162 nd amino acid residue of XveII is located between α 4 and α 5 of the α/β core structure near the metal ion binding region. The differences in cleavage activities of the XveII-mut may due to comformational change when variants of the XveII-mut binding with substrate DNA. 總 目 錄 縮寫字對照表	I 中文摘要	i 英文摘要	ii 第一章 緒論	 1 第二章 XveII-mut 限制酶突變株之特性探討	 2 第三章 不同鄰邊序列的辨識切位對 XveII-mut 限制酶切割之影響	 3 第四章 XveII-I 限制酶結構之分析	 4 附錄 A 培養基與緩衝溶液	A 附錄 B 發表之 paper	B 目 錄 一 一、前言	 1 - 1 二、研究之源起	 1 - 2 三、研究目的	 1 - 3 四、參考文獻	 1 - 5 表一、從 Xanthomonas 菌屬中分離且已知辨識序列之 Type II 限制修飾系統	 1 - 8 表二、XveI 與 XveII 限制修飾系統於 Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv) 菌株之分佈	 1 - 10 圖一、XveII 與類似蛋白胺基酸之比對。	 1 - 11 目 錄 二 中文摘要	 2 -i 英文摘要	 2 -ii 一、前人研究	 2 - 1 (一) 、限制修飾系統之分類	 2 - 1 1.

40|$|Measles {{virus is}} a highly {{contagious}} agent which causes a major health problem in developing countries. The viral genomic RNA is single-stranded, nonsegmented and of negative polarity. Many live attenuated vaccines for measles virus have been developed using either the prototype Edmonston strain or other locally isolated measles strains. Despite the diverse geographic origins of the vaccine viruses and the different attenuation methods used, there was remarkable sequence similarity of H, F and N genes among all vaccine strains. CAM- 70 is a Japanese measles attenuated vaccine strain widely used in Brazilian children and produced by Bio-Manguinhos since 1982. Previous studies have characterized this vaccine biologically and genomically. Nevertheless, only the F, H and N genes have been sequenced. In the present study we have sequenced the remaining P, M and L genes (approximately 1. 6, 1. 4 and 6. 5 kb, respectively) to complete the genomic characterization of CAM- 70 and to assess the extent of genetic relationship between CAM- 70 and other current vaccines. These genes were amplified using long-range or standard RT-PCR techniques, and the cDNA was cloned and automatically sequenced using the dideoxy <b>chain-termination</b> method. The <b>sequence</b> analysis comparing previously sequenced genotype A strains with the CAM- 70 Bio-Manguinhos strain showed a low divergence among them. However, the CAM- 70 strains (CAM- 70 Bio-Manguinhos and a recently sequenced CAM- 70 submaster seed strain) were assigned to a specific group by phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method. Information about our product at the genomic level is important for monitoring vaccination campaigns and for future studies of measles virus attenuation...|$|R
