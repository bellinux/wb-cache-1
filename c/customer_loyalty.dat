The travel 2.0 emerged a radical change in receiving information methods of travellers from business-to-customer marketing into peer-to-peer reviews. The user-generated contents become a vital tool for helping a number of travellers manage their international travels for the first time visiting. The travellers tend to trust and rely on peer-to-peer reviews and virtual communications on social media rather than the information provided by travel supplier. In addition, An autonomous review feature on social media would help traveller reduce risks and uncertainties before purchasing stages. Social media is also a channel for customer complaints and negative feedbacks which can damage images of organisations and destinations. For example, a majority of UK travellers read customer reviews before booking hotels and the bookings of hotels receiving negative feedbacks would be refrained by half of customers. Therefore, the organisations should develop strategic plans to handle and manage the negative feedbacks on social media. Although the user-generated content and rating system on social media are out of business controls, the businesses can monitor those conversations and participate in communities to enhance a <b>customer</b> <b>loyalty</b> and maintain customer relationships.|$|E
