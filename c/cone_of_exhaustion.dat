40|$|EN) The aim of {{this thesis}} is to provide an {{analysis}} of the principle <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> rights especially to computer programs in the comparative context of the legal regulation in the EU and US. The issue <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> rights to computer programs became a topical problem after the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in case UsedSoft v. Oracle, when the CJEU ruled that the principle <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> rights is applicable not only for sale of computer programs on tangible media such as CD/DVD, but also for distribution of computer programs in digital form via Internet. This decision, however, became widely criticized by legal experts, since CJEU accented rather economic arguments in favor of this principle than the European legal regulations and international conventions. Certain problematic aspects were also demonstrated in the decision of US court in case Capitol Records v. ReDigi, in which the court persuasively summarized legal and technical reasons why the principle <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> rights cannot be applicable for the sale of digital files distributed via Internet in the context of current legal regulation.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} {{the relationships among}} professional efficacy, emotional exhaustion, and job characteristics (job demands and job control) {{in the context of}} a two-wave panel study among 828 Dutch police officers. Based on the demand-control model, we expected that high demands/high control would be positively related to professional efficacy, and that high demands/low control would be related to high levels <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion.</b> Moreover, we hypothesized that high levels <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> would lead to lower levels of professional efficacy and that high levels of efficacy would lead to low levels <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion.</b> Structural equation modelling largely supported these predictions. High demands were longitudinally related to high levels of efficacy and high levels of exhaustion; high control was longitudinally related to high levels of efficacy. Further, efficacy and exhaustion were indeed mutually related. Finally, high levels <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> were longitudinally related to high levels of demands. We conclude that there are complex, yet theoretically, and practically interpretable relations among efficacy, strain and work characteristics. © 2010 The British Psychological Society...|$|R
2500|$|Iodine {{number is}} defined as the milligrams of iodine adsorbed by one gram of carbon when the iodine {{concentration}} in the residual filtrate is [...] Basically, iodine number {{is a measure of the}} iodine adsorbed in the pores and, as such, is an indication of the pore volume available in the activated carbon of interest. Typically, water-treatment carbons have iodine numbers ranging from 600 to 1100. Frequently, this parameter is used to determine the degree <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> a carbon in use. However, this practice should be viewed with caution, as chemical interactions with the adsorbate may affect the iodine uptake, giving false results. Thus, the use of iodine number as a measure of the degree <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> a carbon bed can only be recommended if it has been shown to be free of chemical interactions with adsorbates and if an experimental correlation between iodine number and the degree <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> has been determined for the particular application.|$|R
