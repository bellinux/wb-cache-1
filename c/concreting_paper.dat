40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} an interdisciplinary environmental characterization of the World Trade Center (WTC) area after September 11, 2001. The scientific investigation included two main aspects: imaging spectroscopy mapping of materials around the WTC, and laboratory analysis of samples collected in the WTC area. The report includes maps, graphs, and remotely sensed images of the area around Ground Zero, including mineral distribution maps, a sediment map, and a map of the dust plume. Analyses of ground sampling show that the dusts released from the WTC building collapse are largely composed of particles of glass fibers, gypsum, <b>concrete,</b> <b>paper,</b> and other miscellaneous materials commonly used in building construction, with minor asbestiform minerals.

40|$|Huge {{amounts of}} waste paper are {{discarded}} every year, of which {{only a minute}} fraction is recycled {{and the rest is}} dumped in landfills. Paper fibres can only be recycled a limited number of times before they become too short or weak to make high-quality recycled paper.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{methods for}} {{the characterization of}} fiber orientation and fiber bundles of medium density wood fiberboards (MDF). The strength and stiffness of MDF is significantly affected by the fiber orientation and fiber bundles. Proposed methods and results are necessary to virtually generate realistic fiber networks and optimize MDF by using computer simulations. Based on 3 D microCT images for laboratory manufactured MDF with oriented fibers, the fiber orientation is calculated in two ways. Firstly, we use an image processing method based on Hessian matrix directly on microCT image. Secondly, we computed the effective heat conductivity by solving PDEs on a segmentation of the microCT image to estimate the fiber orientation. A fiber bundle segmentation method based on local fiber orientations is introduced. Fiber bundles, which are segmented by this method show good agreement with manually segmented ones. It was observed that fiber bundles are oriented in MDF plane with log-normal distribution of bundle length. The proposed methods are general {{and can be used}} also to calculate fiber orientation and segment fiber bundles in fiber <b>concrete,</b> <b>paper,</b> glass and carbon fiber composites...|$|R

5000|$|In 2005, Le Va's {{work was}} the subject of a major {{retrospective}} exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (ICA). The exhibition, [...] "Accumulated Vision, Barry Le Va," [...] was accompanied by the publication of a comprehensive monograph of the artist's work. The ICA described Le Va's work as: [...] "Since the late 1960s, the American artist Barry Le Va has used broken glass, meat cleavers, wool felt, ball bearings, powdered chalk, cast <b>concrete,</b> <b>paper</b> towels, linseed oil, a typewriter and a gun, among other things, to make his art. Part of a generation intent on knocking art off its pedestal, Le Va claimed the floor as his field of operations by scattering massive amounts of materials, or forms, to create works which he called [...] "distributions." [...] Apparently random, even chaotic, these installations are in fact premeditated and executed according to plan. Not surprisingly, drawing plays a significant role in the work of this artist whose formative training is in architecture. Le Va's distributions make him one of the leading practitioners of Post-minimalism and Process Art. But his own, preferred frame of reference comes not from recent art history, but from mystery novels. He has likened his installations to crime scenes and invites viewers to look for clues to reconstruct the, often violent, act or concept that underlies them." ...|$|R
