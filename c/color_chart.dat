The document lists acrylic fiber and nylon as fibers {{that could be used}} in construction of flags used by the military. For acrylic, the red color is 5.7R 3.7/15.5 and white is N9.4; nylon has 6.2R 4/15.2 for red and N9.2 for white. In a document issued by the Official Development Assistance (ODA), the red color for the Hinomaru and the ODA logo is listed as DIC 156 and CMYK 0-100-90-0. During deliberations about the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem, there was a suggestion to either use a [...] shade or use one from the color pool of the Japanese Industrial Standards. Japanese flags produced in Japan often use vermilion dye.|$|E

The {{range of the}} colors he employed was determined by a mathematical system for mixing the primary colors in graduated amounts. Each color was then randomly ordered to create the resultant composition and form of the painting. Richter's second series of <b>Color</b> <b>Charts</b> was begun in 1971 and consisted of only five paintings. In the final series of <b>Color</b> <b>Charts</b> which preoccupied Richter throughout 1973 and 1974, additional elements to this permutational system of color production were added {{in the form of}} mixes of a light grey, a dark gray and later, a green.|$|R

40|$|Soil <b>color</b> <b>charts,</b> {{which contain}} {{standard}} color chips arranged following the Munsell system, are useful tools for visual assessment of soil {{color in the}} field and laboratory. Several editions of these charts, manufactured in USA and Japan, are used indifferently by soil scientists. One new and one old edition of both USA and Japanese soil <b>color</b> <b>charts</b> have been studied here in CIELAB color space, assessing the regular spread of their color chips. We plotted the loci of constant Munsell hue and chroma on the a*b * plane, and computed color differences between neighboring chips (∆L*, ∆C*, ∆H*). In the new editions, USA charts proved to have greater average lightness and chroma steps (∆L*= 9. 90, ∆C*= 5. 86) than Japanese charts had (∆L*= 8. 98, ∆C*= 5. 36). Irregularities in the measured values of L * C * h were found in the old Japanese chart with respect to the new one, including lower values of the average steps: lightness-, chroma- and hue-difference reduced by 18 %, 13 %, and 21 %, respectively. The same trend was also found for the old USA charts, but with less reduction. It can be concluded that chips with the same Munsell notation may have different colors in different soil <b>color</b> <b>charts...</b>|$|R
