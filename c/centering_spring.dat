25|$|American's {{engineers}} reworked {{the wing}} to a non-folding design, easing FAR Part 23 certification. Other changes included adding extended wing tips to improve rate-of-climb, an anti-servo tab {{on the elevator}} along with a <b>centering</b> <b>spring</b> system to increase longitudinal stability and stall strips to improve handling during a stall. The company designated the redesigned aircraft the AA-1 Yankee Clipper.|$|E
50|$|During the {{redesign}} process the aircraft was modified {{so that the}} wings did not fold, {{making it easier to}} achieve certification. Other changes included a longer wing to improve rate of climb, an anti-servo tab on the elevator along with an elevator <b>centering</b> <b>spring</b> system to increase longitudinal stability and stall strips to improve the stall performance. The resulting aircraft entered production in the fall of 1968 as the 1969 model American Aviation AA-1 Yankee Clipper.|$|E
50|$|The XV-4B was {{significantly}} {{different than the}} XV-4A in most internal design. The {{differences were found in}} the wings, fuselage, landing gear, power plant installations, hydraulics and controls. XV-4B contained two reaction control valves as a failsafe for the engine. One major change was the addition of 4 turbo jet engines faced vertically on the fuselage. This provided massive amounts of vertical thrust for VTOL flight. The addition of a stability augmentation system (SAS), along with hydro-mechanical clutches and feel springs, gave the pilot a good feel on the controls and more ability to control the SAS. The rudder included a new <b>centering</b> <b>spring</b> above the feel spring to reduce friction on the rudder. The Primary Flight Control System (PFCS) was a hybrid fly-by-wire system along with conventional flight controls as a back up. The difference between fly-by-wire and conventional flight systems is simply electronics: fly-by-wire is electronic, conventional is not. No fuel was carried in the wings, even though the wings had the basic box-beam structure. It had 2° of freedom in the pitch and sideslip, whereas the rolls only had 1° of freedom.|$|E

40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of measurements of the longitudinal stability and control characteristics of a large airplane using a mechanical feel device in combination with a booster incorporated in the elevator-control system. Tests were made to investigate the feasibility of eliminating the aerodynamic control forces through use of a booster and of providing control-feel forces mechanically. The feel device consisted of a <b>centering</b> <b>spring</b> which restrained the control stick through a linkage which was changed {{as a function of the}} dynamic pressure. Provisions were made for trimming and for manual adjustment of the force gradient. The system was designed to approximate the control-force characteristics that would result with a conventional elevator control with linear hinge-moment characteristics...|$|E
40|$|A 1 / 4 {{scale model}} of the Bell XS- 1 {{transonic}} aircraft was tested in the Langley 300 mile-per-hour 7 by 10 foot tunnel to determine its low speed longitudinal stability and control characteristics. Pertinent longitudinal flying qualities expected of the XS- 1 research airplane were estimated {{from the results of}} these tests including the effects of compressibility likely to be encountered at speeds below the force break. It appears that the static longitudinal stability and elevator control power will be adequate, but that the elevator control force gradient in steady flight will be undesirably low for all configurations. It is suggested that a <b>centering</b> <b>spring</b> be incorporated in the elevator control system of the airplane in order to increase the control force gradient in steady flight and in maneuvers...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{effective}} tool based on harmonic balance method {{to assess the}} forced response of these systems under parametric changes is developed. A flexible rotor with multiple masses supported on a squeeze film damper at one end is investigated and modeled using finite element method. The forced response of this asymmetrically supported system is calculated using the harmonic balance method with a predictor-corrector procedure by changing unidirectional loads, stiffness of <b>centering</b> <b>spring</b> of the damper and the gyroscopic effects of the disks. It is observed that under large unbalance forces, jump phenomenon occurs due to the nonlinear forces of SFD which indicates the presence of multiple harmonics within {{the response of the}} SFD operating at high eccentricity ratios and shows the insensitivity of the damper to surrounding gyroscopic variation...|$|E
