The aim of this project is to develop a general way (method and tool support) to calculate and analyse current consumption of the powertrain system. In this work several models with different levels of accuracy have been designed in order to simulate the current consumption of the urea dosing system, which is one of the main systems of the exhaust after treatment system (EATS). The main reason for selecting such a system was its independent characteristics, having its own controller known as the ACM (After treatment Control Module) and as well it is of primary interest of the Volvo system engineering group due to its new developing technology, designed for future Euro VI heavy duty engines. All the models and simulations have been implemented in Matlab®/Simulink®. Moreover the models were compared and verified with measurements that were carried out at Volvo Powertrain test labs. A user friendly graphical interface was also designed as an interface between the user and the Simulink® model. The tool was designed via Matlab®GUI with convenient viewing and post processing capabilities. The results show that the basic model, being a rather simple model with static simulation is sufficient for modeling the air valve, <b>coolant</b> <b>valve</b> and the hose heaters of the Urea dosing system. The accuracy of the implemented basic model structure is found to be 98 % of the real measured values.

The detailed model, which is based on dynamic simulation and detailed mechanical characteristics in addition to the detailed magnetic characteristics of the pump, produces reasonably good results with an error of 23. 8 % in the average coil current.

The new system used oil to cool exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) gases and incorporates a number of <b>coolant</b> flow control <b>valves</b> to reduce heat loss during warm-up. The engine was run over cold-start New European Drive Cycles with various flow strategies as a screening exercise to understand the behaviour of the system. Fuel consumption benefits of up to 4 per cent were observed, but these were accompanied by 3 per cent increases in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Detailed analysis of the coolant flows and temperatures showed that, when throttling the flow, the mass of coolant in the degas bottle and radiator could be isolated from the system during warm-up, essentially reducing the thermal inertia. Heat transfer directly to the oil from the EGR gases rather than via the coolant allowed more heat to be put into the oil, with engine oil supply temperatures up to 6 C hotter; however, {{it was not possible to}} verify that the oil was hotter at the bearings, valve train, and cylinder liner.

40|$|The work {{investigates the}} {{integration}} between tools for analysis and simulation of cooling system at Volvo Group Trucks Technology. At {{the same time}} it is a consequent step in evaluating GT-SUITE as a tool for analysis and simulation of cooling systems. The interaction between the truck's cooling system and the engine has so far not been modeled in its entirety in a completely integrated, detailed model capable of simulating transient runs. This work marks the first steps in this direction. A number of different methods for modeling cooling system performance exist. This project focuses on 1 D simulation tools, which are generally preferred in the context of transient simulations of power train and engine installation systems. The Cooling Analysis and Simulations group at Volvo Group Trucks Technology uses KULI as 1 D simulation tool for analysis of cooling performance. Volvo Powetrain, on the other hand, uses GT-SUITE for engine simulations. It is expected {{to improve the quality of}} the simulation, (i. e the accuracy of the results) and improve system integration by using one tool for both areas of simulation. GT-SUITE is a powerful tool for modeling the uid-dynamics and heat-transfer phenomena, which occur in the cooling system. The work includes a detailed model of the main coolant circuit since this is vital for the authenticity of the transient simulation. This thesis is a natural continuation of a project performed by the author during the summer of 2012, which evaluated GT-SUITE as a tool for steady-state simulation of cooling systems[13]. The basic models of the cooler package were developed and calibrated during this project. This work delivers two transient models of FH 13 liter Euro 6 cooling system integrated with a predictive engine model, provided by Volvo Powertrain. As a first step, all necessary models and control algorithms were obtained from different technical units within the organization and were further reworked and refined to fit the purpose of this work. Such are the engine model obtained from BF 66360 System Analysis and Simulation at Volvo Powertrain, the fan control model provided by BF 72362 Cooling Systems at Powertrain Installation and the coolant pump control model from BF 69317 Vehicle Functions. Component performance data was as well acquired for different components within the <b>coolant</b> circuit: thermostat <b>valve,</b> <b>coolant</b> pump, engine oil cooler, etc. GEM 3 D was used to ease the process of creating authentic models of the coolant logistic components (pipes, hoses, owsplits, etc) The first model produced in this work, delivers a basic representation of the physics in the system and its main aim is to prove the technical feasibility of the concept. It includes all necessary functional features : working fan control, coolant pump mode control, function for temperature compensation for the effect of air recirculation. The model was used to obtain critical cooling system-related parameters from Hamburg-Kassel drive cycle and critical parameters were compared to measurements from tests. The results, acquired from the first model have satisfactory consistency with the data from test. Average coefficient of determination achieved by the model is R 2 > 0. 85, which for most of the parameters is higher than the results given by the currently available program for transient simulations. The rate of execution of the model was successfully increased to 1 x Real Time. The second model implements two-way communication between the engine model and the cooling system model: the temperature on the outlet of the CAC and torque consumed by coolant pump and fan are fed back to the engine model and therefore the interaction between the performance of the two separate systems is partially accounted for. Average coefficients of determination achieved from this model are similar to the ones from the model with single connectivity. Execution time rate did not alter significantly in comparison to the previous model. The implemented interaction between the subsystems allows for a predictive model of the boost temperature and investigations on fuel economy. The work has proven the feasibility and the integrability of an engine model and a model of a cooling system in GT being controlled in Simulink environment. This paper can be seen as a comprehensive manual to building, tuning and executing such a model...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{design is}} a complex {{activity}} involving creative reasoning, decision-making and problem solving. Although {{a lot of work}} has been done in trying to automate several aspects of the design process, design nevertheless involves enormous human involvement. Therefore, any design-support system should ease the effort needed by the designers in understanding design information and expressing design decisions. ^ Designers reason about the design problem in multiple abstractions such as pure functional, geometric, and analytical representations. Moreover, each of these representations can themselves be represented in different levels of detail; for example, schematics, freehand sketches, 2 D drawings, and 3 D models can all be used to represent the geometry of a design at different stages. Designers are known to be visual thinkers and use several visual media such as diagrams, charts, and drawings for reasoning about the design problem. Yet existing design tools do not actively use these “visual tools” in a cohesive manner to support mechanical design. Apart from 3 D geometric models, there are very few visual representations of parametric designs. ^ A model of the knowledge involved in early design, what is termed working knowledge, is developed in this work to provide a basis for connecting these visual tools. The Working Knowledge Model (WKM) is developed by extending the state-of-the-art product representation models to include representations for multiple abstractions of product description and alternatives that are encountered during early design. The elements of the WKM are then used to describe commonly used visual tools in design in order to facilitate iterative exploration in early design. A prototype system has been developed that includes SysML (Systems Modeling Language) requirements 2 ̆ 6 parametric diagrams, House of Quality, Hierarchical Function Structures, Morphological Matrices and 2 D drawings. ^ In order to support visual exploration of parametric design sets this thesis introduces a new polytope-based representation for design spaces. These polytopes approximate the locally connected design space around an initial feasible point. The algorithm for constructing the design space is developed by adapting consistency algorithm for polytope representations. By transforming the parametric design problem into a geometric problem, this approach paves the way for using geometric processors and algorithms for design support. The work on polytope representation of design spaces can be viewed independently of the WKM. ^ The design of an automotive <b>coolant</b> flow control <b>valve</b> is used as a case-study to illustrate the use of WKM in supporting design exploration and creation of polytope approximations of the design space. ...|$|R
