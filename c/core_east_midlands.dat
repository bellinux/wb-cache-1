5000|$|The site, {{originally}} {{part of the}} Highfields Estate, {{belonged to}} Joseph Lowe who along with his son Alfred, developed the site in the late 18th century and were responsible {{for much of the}} landscaping that is visible today. In 1789 Joseph Lowe constructed 'Highfields House' which was to be used as his residence. [...] Lowe improved the estate with the creation of a fish pond from the existing Tottle Brook. The Lowes retained ownership up until 1920 when the land was purchased by Sir Jesse Boot (also known as Lord Trent) the founder of the Boot's the Chemist. His intention was to emulate Cadburys at Bournville and the levers at Port Sunlight and build high quality homes for his worker in the near adjacent purpose built factories. The company was bought out by the American, Louis K. Liggett of the United Drug Company. Liggett had no interest in model housing. Jesse Boot was cash rich and owned 121 acres of land which he proceeded to disperse to good causes. Boot used 35 acres of the estate to form the <b>core</b> of <b>East</b> <b>Midlands</b> University. He built a raised road to connect Nottingham to Beeston, and landscaped the area south of the Trent building given as a park for Nottingham City Council. The remains of the estate, also called Highfields park, the other side of University Boulevard, was given over to sport fields. Also on the land he built a very large Lido, which, in 1922 was the largest in England.|$|R
