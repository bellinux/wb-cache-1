40|$|Currently, {{the wind}} energy {{industry}} is swiftly changing its maintenance strategy from schedule based maintenance to predictive based maintenance. Condition monitoring systems (CMS) {{play an important}} role in the predictive maintenance cycle. As condition monitoring systems are being adopted by more and more OEM and O&M service providers from the wind energy industry, it is crucial to effectively interpret the data generated by the CMS and initiate proactive processes to efficiently reduce the risk of potential component or system failure which often leads to down tower repair or gearbox replacement. The majority of CMS are designed and constructed based on vibration analysis which has been refined over the years by researchers and scientists. This paper provides detailed description and mathematical interpretation of a comprehensive selection of <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> for gears, bearings and shafts.

40|$|The grazing {{lands of}} {{northern}} Australia contain a substantial soil organic carbon (SOC) stock {{due to the}} large land area. Manipulating SOC stocks through grazing management has been presented as an option to offset national greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and other industries. However, research into the response of SOC stocks {{to a range of}} management activities has variously shown positive, negative or negligible change. This uncertainty in predicting change in SOC stocks represents high project risk for government and industry in relation to SOC sequestration programs. In this paper, we seek to address the uncertainty in SOC stock prediction by assessing relationships between SOC stocks and grazing land <b>condition</b> <b>indicators.</b> We reviewed the literature to identify land <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> for analysis and tested relationships between identified land <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> and SOC stock using data from a paired-site sampling experiment (10 sites). We subsequently collated SOC stock datasets at two scales (quadrat and paddock) from across northern Australia (329 sites) to compare with the findings of the paired-site sampling experiment with the aim of identifying the land <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> that had the strongest relationship with SOC stock. The land <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> most closely correlated with SOC stocks across datasets and analysis scales were tree basal area, tree canopy cover, ground cover, pasture biomass and the density of perennial grass tussocks. In combination with soil type, these indicators accounted for up to 42 % of the variation in the residuals after climate effects were removed. However, we found that responses often interacted with soil type, adding complexity and increasing the uncertainty associated with predicting SOC stock change at any particular location. We recommend that caution be exercised when considering SOC offset projects in northern Australian grazing lands due to the risk of incorrectly predicting changes in SOC stocks with change in land <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> and management activities for a particular paddock or property. Despite the uncertainty for generating SOC sequestration income, undertaking management activities to improve land condition is likely to have desirable complementary benefits such as improving productivity and profitability as well as reducing adverse environmental impact...|$|R

40|$|A {{method to}} augment {{existing}} Helicopter Flight Data Monitoring (HFDM) systems using physics-based models was proposed. It was suggested that physics-based models can be utilized to derive <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> (“events” or “exceedances”) with improved detection performance {{within the framework}} of typical HFDM systems. Data were collected from computer simulations and real-world helicopter training flights. Model-based analyses were performed using static model evaluations using flight data and dynamic simulations for predictive examination of potential hazards. In the case of dynamic simulations, neural networks were used to combine the results from simulated flight trajectories into a parametric monitoring metric. Results indicate that <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> defined using model-derived quantities such as performance metrics and dynamic responses generate a reduction in false alarms and missed detections relative to the existing HFDM events. Furthermore, pre-emptive simulation of potentially hazardous conditions was shown to yield <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> that are available sooner than typical HFDM events, allowing for timely detection of adverse flight states. The approach is general in that extension to other vehicles and flight states requires changes to model parameters and additional evaluations, which reduces the reliance on past experience when defining <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> for new operators. The results suggest that the application of the model-based approach can lead to improved accuracy and availability of HFDM events, with a corresponding potential for safety improvement in operations. Results for several flight conditions, including implementation considerations and directions for future investigation are discussed. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|As South African road owners {{shift from}} a {{construction}} mode to a preservation mode, {{new techniques are required}} to record and monitor the cost-effectiveness of their pavement preservation efforts and to address asset preservation goals. Pavement Management Systems (PMS’s) that include routine preventive maintenance treatments, strive to keep good roads in a good condition through the timely application of these treatments. The integration of routine maintenance strategic planning into PMS’s is however lacking. The types of road <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> that are measured in most PMS’s, such as the International Roughness Index (IRI) and Visual Condition Index (VCI), do not support the identification of routine road maintenance treatments. Road owners that depend mostly on individual-distress road <b>condition</b> <b>indicators,</b> supplemented with an overall condition index in their PMS, might be in a better position than those that depend mostly on composite indices.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{estimate}} the asset reliability and the probability of failure is critical to reducing maintenance costs, operation downtime, and safety hazards. Predicting the survival time and the probability of failure in future time is an indispensable requirement in prognostics and asset health management. In traditional reliability models, the lifetime of an asset is estimated using failure event data, alone; however, statistically sufficient failure event data are often difficult to attain in real-life situations due to poor data management, effective preventive maintenance, and the small population of identical assets in use. <b>Condition</b> <b>indicators</b> and operating environment indicators {{are two types of}} covariate data that are normally obtained in addition to failure event and suspended data. These data contain significant information about the state and health of an asset. <b>Condition</b> <b>indicators</b> reflect the level of degradation of assets while operating environment indicators accelerate or decelerate the lifetime of assets. When these data are available, an alternative approach to the traditional reliability analysis is the modelling of <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> and operating environment indicators and their failure-generating mechanisms using a covariate-based hazard model. The literature review indicates that a number of covariate-based hazard models have been developed. All of these existing covariate-based hazard models were developed based on the principle theory of the Proportional Hazard Model (PHM). However, most of these models have not attracted much attention in the field of machinery prognostics. Moreover, due to the prominence of PHM, attempts at developing alternative models, to some extent, have been stifled, although a number of alternative models to PHM have been suggested. The existing covariate-based hazard models neglect to fully utilise three types of asset health information (including failure event data (i. e. observed and/or suspended), condition data, and operating environment data) into a model to have more effective hazard and reliability predictions. In addition, current research shows that <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> and operating environment indicators have different characteristics and they are non-homogeneous covariate data. <b>Condition</b> <b>indicators</b> act as response variables (or dependent variables) whereas operating environment indicators act as explanatory variables (or independent variables). However, these non-homogenous covariate data were modelled in the same way for hazard prediction in the existing covariate-based hazard models. The related and yet more imperative question is how both of these indicators should be effectively modelled and integrated into the covariate-based hazard model. This work presents a new approach for addressing the aforementioned challenges. The new covariate-based hazard model, which termed as Explicit Hazard Model (EHM), explicitly and effectively incorporates all three available asset health information into the modelling of hazard and reliability predictions and also drives the relationship between actual asset health and condition measurements as well as operating environment measurements. The theoretical development of the model and its parameter estimation method are demonstrated in this work. EHM assumes that the baseline hazard {{is a function of the}} both time and <b>condition</b> <b>indicators.</b> <b>Condition</b> <b>indicators</b> provide information about the health condition of an asset; therefore they update and reform the baseline hazard of EHM according to the health state of asset at given time t. Some examples of <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> are the vibration of rotating machinery, the level of metal particles in engine oil analysis, and wear in a component, to name but a few. Operating environment indicators in this model are failure accelerators and/or decelerators that are included in the covariate function of EHM and may increase or decrease the value of the hazard from the baseline hazard. These indicators caused by the environment in which an asset operates, and that have not been explicitly identified by the <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> (e. g. Loads, environmental stresses, and other dynamically changing environment factors). While the effects of operating environment indicators could be nought in EHM; <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> could emerge because these indicators are observed and measured as long as an asset is operational and survived. EHM has several advantages over the existing covariate-based hazard models. One is this model utilises three different sources of asset health data (i. e. population characteristics, <b>condition</b> <b>indicators,</b> and operating environment indicators) to effectively predict hazard and reliability. Another is that EHM explicitly investigates the relationship between condition and operating environment indicators associated with the hazard of an asset. Furthermore, the proportionality assumption, which most of the covariate-based hazard models suffer from it, does not exist in EHM. According to the sample size of failure/suspension times, EHM is extended into two forms: semi-parametric and non-parametric. The semi-parametric EHM assumes a specified lifetime distribution (i. e. Weibull distribution) in the form of the baseline hazard. However, for more industry applications, due to sparse failure event data of assets, the analysis of such data often involves complex distributional shapes about which little is known. Therefore, to avoid the restrictive assumption of the semi-parametric EHM about assuming a specified lifetime distribution for failure event histories, the non-parametric EHM, which is a distribution free model, has been developed. The development of EHM into two forms is another merit of the model. A case study was conducted using laboratory experiment data to validate the practicality of the both semi-parametric and non-parametric EHMs. The performance of the newly-developed models is appraised using the comparison amongst the estimated results of these models and the other existing covariate-based hazard models. The comparison results demonstrated that both the semi-parametric and non-parametric EHMs outperform the existing covariate-based hazard models. Future research directions regarding to the new parameter estimation method in the case of time-dependent effects of covariates and missing data, application of EHM in both repairable and non-repairable systems using field data, and a decision support model in which linked to the estimated reliability results, are also identified...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, one of {{the major}} goals of {{electricity}} utilities is to optimize the maintenance of the assets which can be achieved by a more accurate condition indexing. The maintenance activities and maintenance planning of the grid included in this research is based on the condition indexing process. Several process steps included in the condition indexing process will be optimized in order to achieve a more accurate condition index of the components. After analyzing the current condition indexing process, the process steps which have to be optimized are investigated. These process steps contains shortcommings such as lack of guidelines, categories with ambiguous interpretations and dependancy on experience. The process steps which should be optimized are: the assessment of the visual inspection, the determination of the condition of the asset, the interpretation and subdivision of the condition levels and the determination of the time intervals for the condition indicators. A model is designed in order to minimize the subjectivity of the assessment of the visual inspections. The model includes guidelines such as questions, answers and a transformation matrix. Furthermore, a strategy is constructed for the determination of the condition of the asset by including the weighting of the <b>condition</b> <b>indicator.</b> The weighting of each <b>condition</b> <b>indicator</b> is determined based on the failure frequency, failure impact and detection chance.

40|$|Body {{condition}} {{is a useful}} measure of the nutritional status and performance in ungulates. The most widely used <b>indicators</b> of body <b>condition</b> are based on fat reserves, mainly those surrounding the kidneys. To estimate the body condition in large herbivores, researchers often collect and pool the data from both kidneys and their perirenal fat in order to compensate for potential differences between the body <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> obtained from {{the left and right}} kidneys. Since these differences {{do not seem to be}} properly established in wildlife, we checked for the potential differences between the body <b>condition</b> <b>indicators,</b> derived from both kidneys, in wild ungulates. In the present study, we used red deer Cervus elaphus, both under experimental and field conditions, as a model to analyse the patterns of response of the body <b>condition</b> <b>indicators,</b> calculated from left and right kidneys, to supplementary feeding, sex, age class and season. By considering two analytical approaches-kidney fat index and fat weight (including kidney weight as a covariate) -we consistently obtained similar statistical results and the same ecological interpretations by using left, right and average indicators for all the factors tested. In the experimental study, supplementary feeding had a significant effect on all the body <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> of red deer hinds. Under field circumstances, the <b>condition</b> <b>indicators</b> were statistically higher in females than in males and they increased with age. Sex related differences were significant in the winter. Taking into account our results, we hypothesize that information from only one kidney will be enough to assess the body condition in red deer and probably in other wild ungulates. However, a standardized sample (i. e. always using the same kidney and associated fat) should be used, while a better understanding regarding possible asymmetries in the amount of the energy reserves on each side of the animals' bodies has not been reached. Our study has clear implications concerning wildlife monitoring since it represents a considerable reduction of time and effort, both in the field (collecting the samples) and in the laboratory (processing and weighing the samples) when evaluating the body condition of individuals and populations.
