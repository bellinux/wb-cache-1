50|$|Slip-casting methods provide {{superior}} surface quality, {{density and}} uniformity in casting high-purity ceramic raw materials over other <b>ceramic</b> <b>casting</b> techniques, such as hydraulic casting, since the cast part {{is a higher}} concentration of ceramic raw materials with little additives. A slip is a suspension of fine raw materials powder in a liquid such as water or alcohol with small amounts of secondary materials such as dispersants, surfactants and binders. Pottery slipcasting techniques employ a plaster block or flask mould. The plaster mould draws water from the poured slip to compact and form the casting at the mould surface. This forms a dense cast removing deleterious air gaps and minimizing shrinkage in the final sintering process.|$|E

40|$|Three Dimensional Printing, a rapid {{prototyping}} technology, fabricates <b>ceramic</b> <b>casting</b> shells directly from 3 -D CAD models. To create a shell, loose alumina powder in thin layers {{is joined by}} selectively depositing a colloidal silica binder. Firing fuses the silica to the alumina, and subsequent processing removes the unbound powder from the casting cavity. In some instances, it may be advantageous to perform powder removal before firing. This requires higher green strength than what is obtainable with the current binder. An alternative binder consisting of 18 vol. % colloidal silica co-dispersed with 10 vol. % acrylic emulsion in an aqueous medium was developed. The polymeric component imparts higher green strength to the part (3. 6 vs. 0. 4 MPa), yet decomposes during firing to minimize interference with the fusion of silica to alumina. The reduction of fired strength in samples printed with co-dispersions was less than 10 %. Through designed experiments, performance of the co-dispersion was quantified by additional criteria such as shrinkage, warping, and binder stability. Average linear shrinkage in parts printed with co-dispersions was 0. 05 % after firing at 900 °C. A simple model for warping, based on elastic response of a plate to free thermal strain, predicts that flat plates tend to warp into a paraboloid after firing.

40|$|Superalloy {{airfoils}} {{are produced}} by investment casting (IC), which uses ceramic cores and wax patterns with ceramic shell molds. Hollow cored superalloy airfoils in a gas turbine engine are an example of complex IC parts. The complex internal hollow cavities of the airfoil are designed to conduct cooling air through one or more passageways. These complex internal passageways have been fabricated by a lost wax process requiring several processing steps; core preparation, injection molding for wax pattern, and dipping process for ceramic shell molds. Several steps generate problems such as high cost and decreased accuracy of the ceramic mold. For example, costly tooling and production delay are required to produce mold dies for complex cores and wax patterns used in injection molding, resulting in a big obstacle for prototypes and smaller production runs. Rather than using separate cores, patterns, and shell molds, it would be advantageous to directly produce a mold that has the casting cavity and the ceramic core by one process. Ceramic stereolithography (CerSLA) {{can be used to}} directly fabricate the integrally cored <b>ceramic</b> <b>casting</b> mold (ICCM). CerSLA builds ceramic green objects from CAD files from many thin liquid layers of powder in monomer, which are solidified by polymerization with a UV laser, thereby “writing” the design for each slice. This dissertation addresses the integrally cored casting ceramic mold (ICCM), the ceramic core with a ceramic mold shell in a single patternless construction, fabricated by ceramic stereolithography (CerSLA). CerSLA is considered as an alternative method to replace lost wax processes, for small production runs or designs too complex for conventional cores and patterns. The main topic is the development of methods to successfully fabricate an ICCM by CerSLA from refractory silica, as well as related issues. The related issues are the segregation of coarse fused silica powders in a layer, the degree of segregation parameter to prevent segregation, and sintering and cristobalite transformation in fused silica compacts...|$|E
40|$|Porous {{titanium}} (Ti) {{products have}} many applications {{due to their}} excellent corrosion resistance, high strength-to-weight ratio, high specific surface area, etc. However, the major limitation is the expensive cost of porous Ti products {{because of the high}} raw materials costs and the difficulty of processing. The novelty of this research work is concerned with a study of a <b>ceramic</b> <b>casting</b> technique, slip casting, to create porous Ti products and the effect of porosity on the mechanical properties and gas permeability of Ti compacts. An optimised Ti slurry was developed from 43 vol. % of Ti powder, 0. 3 dw. % of dispersant, 0. 8 dw. % of plasticiser and 0. 8 dw. % of binder, mixed with a balance of distilled water, which produced a viscosity of 290 cP. It was then poured into a plaster mould to form compacts with a green density of 45 %. Thermal debinding was carried out at 320 °C with an argon flow for 2 hours, followed by vacuum sintering different samples at 1000 °C and 1200 °C for 0. 5 hours, respectively. The porous sintered compacts had satisfactory tensile strength with some plastic deformation. The increase in oxygen and carbon content during processing was minor. The results from this investigation suggested that slip casting is a potentially low-cost, simple manufacturing route for porous Ti products. Porous Ti compacts with porosity in the range of 12. 3 vol. % to 35. 3 vol. % were fabricated by slip casting. The mechanical properties, fracture morphology, gas permeability, pore size analysis and pore shape factors for the porous Ti compacts were determined for different porosity levels. A decreasing porosity level resulted in less open porosity and gas permeability, reduced pore size, and an increased tensile stress and elongation. The mechanical properties of porous Ti compacts produced by slip casting were comparable with more conventional press and sintered materials at the same porosity levels. Theoretical models for tensile stress and ductility as a function of porosity were examined and incorporated into the results and differences between the theoretical models and experimental results are discussed. The pore shape factor analysis showed that tensile loading would stretch the pores in the compacts to produce more irregular pores, which were acting as linkage sites to allow the propagation of cracks. Additionally, a novel interconnected pore characterisation method using ammonium meta-tungstate solution is presented. By using backscatter scanning electron microscopy, the interconnected pores can be directly observed. The packing behaviour and sintering behaviour of Ti compacts fabricated with different particles size distribution were characterised and studied, in terms of porosity, pore size analysis, tensile properties and gas permeability. Two different particles size (avg. 14 μm & avg. 56 μm) of pure Ti hydride-dehydride powder were used in five volume proportions (20 : 80, 40 : 60, 60 : 40, 80 : 20 & 100 : 0). A theoretical model predicted that the green density reaches a maximum when the volume fraction of fine particles is 0. 35. It was found that although experimental results showed similar behaviour there was no well-defined maximum green density. The sintered compacts showed that an increase in the volume fraction of fine powder particles reduced the porosity, permeability level and pore size, and increased the tensile properties. The relationship between permeability and porosity level was non-linear and this was caused by the differences in pore diameters in the compacts. The capillary tube model was used to discuss the relationship between the permeability, pore diameter and porosity. Using this information, a graded porosity compact was designed and fabricated by slip casting. A future study on this graded porosity compacts is recommended to undertake in more depth...|$|E
