5|$|During {{the process}} of meiotic cell division, an event called genetic {{recombination}} or crossing-over can sometimes occur, in which a length of DNA on one <b>chromatid</b> is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister <b>chromatid.</b> This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles. The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage.|$|E
5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister <b>chromatid</b> as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister <b>chromatid</b> (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{metaphase}} to anaphase transition, this cohesion between sister <b>chromatids</b> is dissolved, and the separated <b>chromatids</b> {{are pulled}} to {{opposite sides of}} the cell by the spindle microtubules. The <b>chromatids</b> are further separated by the physical movement of the spindle poles themselves. Premature dissociation of the <b>chromatids</b> can lead to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy in the daughter cells. Thus, the job of the metaphase checkpoint is to prevent this transition into anaphase until the chromosomes are properly attached, before the sister <b>chromatids</b> separate.|$|R
50|$|Cohesin is {{a protein}} complex that regulates the {{separation}} of sister <b>chromatids</b> during cell division, either mitosis or meiosis. Cohesins hold sister <b>chromatids</b> together after DNA replication until anaphase when removal of cohesin leads to separation of sister <b>chromatids.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{kinetochore}} ( [...] , [...] ) is {{a protein}} structure on <b>chromatids</b> where the spindle fibers attach during cell division to pull sister <b>chromatids</b> apart. Their proteins help {{to hold the}} sister <b>chromatids</b> together and {{also play a role}} in chromosome editing.|$|R
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a <b>chromatid</b> bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
25|$|When a cell enters in mitosis, it duplicates all {{the genetic}} {{information}} {{stored in the}} chromosomes, in the process termed DNA replication. At {{the end of this}} process, each chromosome includes two sister chromatids, which are two complete and identical DNA molecules. Both chromatids remain associated by cohesin complexes until anaphase, when chromosome segregation occurs. If chromosome segregation happens correctly, each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromatids, and for this to happen each sister <b>chromatid</b> has to anchor (through the corresponding kinetochore) to MTs generated in opposed poles of the mitotic spindle. This configuration is termed amphitelic or bi-orientation.|$|E
25|$|Nondisjunction usually {{occurs as}} the result of a {{weakened}} mitotic checkpoint, as these checkpoints tend to arrest or delay cell division until all components of the cell are ready to enter the next phase. If a checkpoint is weakened, the cell may fail to 'notice' that a chromosome pair is not lined up on the mitotic plate, for example. In such a case, most chromosomes would separate normally (with one <b>chromatid</b> ending up in each cell), while others could fail to separate at all. This would generate a daughter cell lacking a copy and a daughter cell with an extra copy.|$|E

Following chromosomal replication, the blue chromosome {{is composed of}} two identical sister <b>chromatids</b> and the pink chromosome is composed of two identical sister <b>chromatids.</b> In mitosis, the sister <b>chromatids</b> separate into the daughter cells, but are now referred to as chromosomes (rather than <b>chromatids)</b> {{much in the way}} that one child is not referred to as a single twin.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{variance}} analysis of lengths and brachial indices of human chromosomes 1, 2 and 3 in endoreduplicated cells. A) We compare the difference between: 1. the <b>chromatids</b> {{from the same}} chromosome with those of chromosomes belonging to the same doublet, 2. the <b>chromatids</b> from the same chromosome with those from homologous chromosomes, 3. the <b>chromatids</b> of chromosomes belonging to the same doublet with those belonging to homologous chromosomes. The results show that <b>chromatids</b> from the same chromosome are more equal {{than those of the}} same doublet or those from homologous chromosomes. In length, the <b>chromatids</b> from the same doublet are not more equal than those of homologous chromosomes, whereas in brachial index, <b>chromatids</b> of the same doublet are more equal than <b>chromatids</b> of homologous chromosomes. B) We compare the variance of brachial indices within and between endoreduplicated cells. The results show that the brachial indices are more similar within the cells than between different cells. © 1967 Springer-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|Rec8 is a meiosis-specific {{component}} of the cohesin complex that binds sister <b>chromatids</b> {{in preparation for the}} two divisions of meiosis. Rec8 is sequentially removed from sister <b>chromatids.</b> It is removed from the arms of chromosomes in the first division - separating homologous chromosomes from each other. However, Rec8 is maintained at centromeres so that sister <b>chromatids</b> are kept joined until anaphase of meiosis II, at which point removal of remaining cohesin leads to the separation of sister <b>chromatids.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} MTs {{attached}} to one kinetochore is variable: in Saccharomyces cerevisiae only one MT binds each kinetochore, whereas in mammals {{there can be}} among 15-35 MTs bound to each kinetochore. However, not all the MTs in the spindle attach to one kinetochore. There are MTs that extend from one centrosome to the other (and {{they are responsible for}} spindle length) and some shorter ones are interdigitated between the long MTs. Professor B. Nicklas (Duke University), showed that, if one breaks down the MT-kinetochore attachment using a laser beam, chromatids can no longer move, leading to an abnormal chromosome distribution. These experiments also showed that kinetochores have polarity, and that kinetochore attachment to MTs emanating from one or the other centrosome will depend on its orientation. This specificity guarantees that only one <b>chromatid</b> will move to each spindle side, thus ensuring the correct distribution of the genetic material. Thus, one of the basic functions of the kinetochore is the MT attachment to the spindle, which is essential to correctly segregate sister chromatids. If anchoring is incorrect, errors may ensue, generating aneuploidy, with catastrophic consequences for the cell. To prevent this from happening, there are mechanisms of error detection and correction (as the spindle assembly checkpoint), whose components reside also on the kinetochores.The movement of one <b>chromatid</b> towards the centrosome is produced primarily by MT depolymerization in the binding site with the kinetochore. These movements require also force generation, involving molecular motors likewise located on the kinetochores.|$|E
25|$|During mitosis, microtubules {{grow from}} centrosomes located at {{opposite}} ends of the cell and also attach to the centromere at specialized structures called kinetochores, one of which is present on each sister <b>chromatid.</b> A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are uncoiled and DNA can again be transcribed. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus.|$|E
25|$|At the meiotic {{metaphase}} I, the cytoskeleton put the bivalents under tension by pulling each homolog in opposite direction (contrary to mitotic division where the forces are exerted on each <b>chromatid).</b> The anchorage of the cytoskeleton to the chromosomes {{takes place at}} the centromere thanks to a protein complex called kinetochore. This tension results in the alignment of the bivalent {{at the center of the}} cell, the chiasmata and the distal cohesion of the sister chromatids being the anchor point sustaining the force exerted on the whole structure. Impressively, human female primary oocytes remains in this tension state for decades (from the establishment of the oocyte in metaphase I during embryonic development, to the ovulation event in adulthood that resume the meiotic division), highlighting the robustness of the chiasma and the cohesion that hold the bivalents together.|$|E

Chromosome {{line up in}} the middle plane, the mitotic spindle forms and the kinetochores of sister <b>chromatids</b> attach to the microtubules. Right: Anaphase of mitosis, where sister <b>chromatids</b> {{separate}} and the microtubules pull them in opposite directions. The chromosome shown in red fails to separate properly, its sister <b>chromatids</b> stick together and get pulled to the same side, resulting in mitotic nondisjunction of this chromosome.|$|R
50|$|Non-sister <b>chromatids,</b> on {{the other}} hand, refers to {{either of the two}} <b>chromatids</b> of paired {{homologous}} chromosomes, that is, the pairing of a paternal chromosome and a maternal chromosome. In chromosomal crossovers, non-sister (homologous) <b>chromatids</b> form chiasmata to exchange genetic material during the prophase I of meiosis (See Homologous recombination).|$|R
25|$|Nondisjunction is {{the failure}} of {{homologous}} chromosomes or sister <b>chromatids</b> to separate properly during cell division. There are three forms of nondisjunction: failure {{of a pair of}} homologous chromosomes to separate in meiosis I, failure of sister <b>chromatids</b> to separate during meiosis II, and failure of sister <b>chromatids</b> to separate during mitosis. Nondisjunction results in daughter cells with abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy).|$|R
25|$|Others have {{approached}} {{their study of}} the origins of genomic imprinting from a different side, arguing that natural selection is operating on the role of epigenetic marks as machinery for homologous chromosome recognition during meiosis, rather than on their role in differential expression. This argument centers on the existence of epigenetic effects on chromosomes that do not directly affect gene expression, but do depend on which parent the chromosome originated from. This group of epigenetic changes that depend on the chromosome's parent of origin (including both those that affect gene expression and those that do not) are called parental origin effects, and include phenomena such as paternal X inactivation in the marsupials, nonrandom parental <b>chromatid</b> distribution in the ferns, and even mating type switching in yeast. This diversity in organisms that show parental origin effects has prompted theorists to place the evolutionary origin of genomic imprinting before the last common ancestor of plants and animals, over a billion years ago.|$|E
500|$|In eukaryotes, {{two primary}} models for how {{homologous}} recombination repairs double-strand breaks in DNA are the double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathway (sometimes called the double Holliday junction model) and the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathway. In {{the case of}} double strand breakage, the 3' end is degraded and the longer 5' end invades the contiguous sister <b>chromatid,</b> forming a replication bubble. As this bubble nears the broken DNA, the longer 5' antisense strand again invades the sense strand of this portion of DNA, transcribing a second copy. When replication ends, both tails are reconnected to form two Holliday Junctions, which are then cleaved {{in a variety of}} patterns by proteins. An animation of this process can be seen [...]|$|E
500|$|The RPA protein, {{which has}} high {{affinity}} for single-stranded DNA, then binds the 3' overhangs. [...] With {{the help of}} several other proteins that mediate the process, the Rad51 protein (and Dmc1, in meiosis) then forms a filament of nucleic acid and protein on the single strand of DNA coated with RPA. [...] This nucleoprotein filament then begins searching for DNA sequences {{similar to that of}} the 3' overhang. [...] After finding such a sequence, the single-stranded nucleoprotein filament moves into (invades) the similar or identical recipient DNA duplex in a process called strand invasion. [...] In cells that divide through mitosis, the recipient DNA duplex is generally a sister <b>chromatid,</b> which is identical to the damaged DNA molecule and provides a template for repair. [...] In meiosis, however, the recipient DNA tends to be from a similar but not necessarily identical homologous chromosome. [...] A displacement loop (D-loop) is formed during strand invasion between the invading 3' overhang strand and the homologous chromosome. After strand invasion, a DNA polymerase extends the end of the invading 3' strand by synthesizing new DNA. [...] This changes the D-loop to a cross-shaped structure known as a Holliday junction. Following this, more DNA synthesis occurs on the invading strand (i.e., one of the original 3' overhangs), effectively restoring the strand on the homologous chromosome that was displaced during strand invasion.|$|E
