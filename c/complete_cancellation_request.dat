This paper provides a classification of task cancellation patterns, as well as a detailed analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. One promising approach is cooperative cancellation, where threads must be continuously prepared for external <b>cancellation</b> <b>requests.</b> Based on this pattern, we propose an extension of SCOOP, an object-oriented concurrency model. ...|$|R

By 1995, Sony stopped ordering Shintom's mechanism that was used for non-editing VHS VCRs, VCPs, and TV/VCR combos. Therefore, the VHS chassis mechanism business was dissolved.|$|R

The <b>cancellation</b> <b>request</b> must come from the Servicer of the mortgage to the PMI company who issued the insurance. Often the Servicer will require a new appraisal to determine the LTV.

50|$|In {{the reverse}} direction, {{on the other}} hand, the {{additional}} delay of the wave from the director (blue) due to the spacing between the two elements (about 35° of phase delay traversed twice) causes it to be about 180° (110° + 2 × 35°) out of phase with the wave from the driven element (green). The net effect of these two waves, when added (bottom, left), is almost <b>complete</b> <b>cancellation.</b> The combination of the director's position and shorter length has thus obtained a unidirectional rather than the bidirectional response of the driven (half-wave dipole) element alone.|$|R
50|$|Vista modifies the {{behavior}} of asynchronous I/O operations. With the new asynchronous I/O APIs, a thread, {{different from the one}} that issued the I/O request, can be notified when the operation completes. With this, a single thread can issue all the I/O requests, and then switch to a different worker thread. If this thread is the one that handles the data after the I/O request completes, then a thread-switch, which causes a performance hit, may be avoided. Windows Vista also introduces synchronous I/O cancellation. During a synchronous I/O request, the application is blocked until the request is serviced or fails. In Windows Vista the application may issue a <b>cancellation</b> <b>request.</b> Applications that cancel the operation on user feedback may prefer to enable user feedback during the time the issuing thread is suspended for usability.|$|R

Standard CMOS 0. 25 µm digital process is used to design a test chip which includes different pixel types, column-level discriminators and a digital control part.

Double sampling is functional and allows almost a <b>complete</b> <b>cancellation</b> of fixed pattern noise. I...|$|R
40|$|The gauge {{dependence}} of the conformal anomaly for spin 3 / 2 and spin 2 fields in non-conformal supergravities {{has been a long}} standing puzzle. In this Letter we argue that the `correct' gauge choice is the one that follows from requiring all terms that would imply a violation of the Wess-Zumino consistency condition to be absent in the counterterm, because otherwise the usual link between the anomaly and the one-loop divergence becomes invalid. Remarkably, the `good' choice of gauge is the one that confirms our previous result that a <b>complete</b> <b>cancellation</b> of conformal anomalies in D= 4 can only be achieved for N-extended (Poincaré) supergravities with N≥ 5...|$|R
