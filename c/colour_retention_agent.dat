40|$|Zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp. Wild.) is a {{sustainable}} {{choice for the}} Mediterranean area, being identified as grass species adapted to low-input environments (limited water requirements, no fertilizer or pesticides after establishment). A distinct drawback in the transition zone is winter dormancy, a temporary suspension of visible growth, followed by discoloration and loss of functionality. In order to investigate the genotype/species effect in relation with agro-meteorological conditions, 10 cultivars/experimental lines were screened {{for their ability to}} extend the winter <b>colour</b> <b>retention.</b> A two years field study was conducted on mature swards and evaluated during the onset of dormancy and spring green-up using digital image analysis. For both parameters, in both years, the Authors observed a wide range of cultivar responses. Zoysia japonica genotypes in our study provided significantly shorter dormancy period than fine-leaved genotypes. In some instances, there were as much as 35 and 20 d difference between entries in respect to the winter <b>colour</b> <b>retention</b> and spring onset, respectively. The identification of genotypes with shorter dormancy than 'Meyer' (industry standard) may reduce use of cultural practices, as late-season nitrogen or iron application, normally used to extend the winter <b>colour</b> <b>retention</b> of zoysiagrass in late fall or early spring, showing different levels of success...|$|R

40|$|This {{study shows}} that the {{political}} preferences of those responsible for retaining judges are strongly associated with judicial voting. The evidence supports the widespread belief that judges respond to political pressure {{in an effort to}} be reelected or reappointed. Using a data set of decisions in state supreme courts from 1995 - 98, I find that state supreme court judges who face retention decisions by Republicans tend to decide cases in accord with standard Republican policy. Judicial behavior is correspondingly liberal for judges facing retention decisions by Democrats. The results are strongest for judges facing partisan reelections. Among judges with conservative fundamental ideologies, those facing Democratic <b>retention</b> <b>agents</b> vote more liberally than those facing Republican <b>retention</b> <b>agents.</b> Similarly, judges' voting changes when the political preferences of the <b>retention</b> <b>agents</b> change.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{methodology}} to study the influence of the molecular weight of polysaccharidic admixtures on mortar properties.

The water retention capacity of the mortars mixed with ultrasonically degraded admixture solutions increases with molecular weight for a same admixture.

The coarse emulsion containing native beetroot juice as inner water phase, sunflower oil as oil phase and 0. 5 % whey protein isolate as outer water phase was prepared using a rotor stator system. The resulting coarse double emulsion had a typical average droplet size of 32 μm, that was refined further using a hybrid membrane premix emulsification system resulting in an average droplet size of 20 μm. Both double emulsions were exposed to heat threatment (70 °C for 30 min), and were physically stable due to the high viscosity (2. 9 Pa s). Besides these emulsions had high <b>colour</b> <b>retention.</b> When added to meat systems, both double emulsions showed good water and fat binding capacity, and they reduced the hardness and improved the colour of meat systems, which are both desirable characteristics.

40|$|The colour-fading of hair {{treated with}} {{oxidative}} dyes {{is attributed to}} the effects of ultraviolet light and other environmental factors, but mostly it occurs during shampooing. This effect is caused by the diffusion of chromaphores from within the cortex towards the cuticle surface. The colour fading of dyed hair during shampoo washing is determined by a range of factors, most significantly by the chemistry of the chromaphores, the porosity of the hair fibres, and the properties of the used surfactants. Optimising the cleansing efficacy of shampoos in relation to colour protection claims is of interest to formulators. This study investigates the effects of two co-surfactants and a range of conditioning additives, polycationic and silicone-based, on the colour fading of hair tresses treated with red oxidative hair dye and put through repeated wash-and-dry cycles. The results indicate that the choice of co-surfactant alone, and in combination with the conditioning additives, can significantly influence the colour fading of red oxidative dye treated hair during shampooing. The amphoteric co-surfactant offered statistically significant improved <b>colour</b> <b>retention,</b> compared to the nonionic.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} colour {{retaining}} efficacy of shampoo compositions, containing polymers and semi-permanent hair dyes, on hair tresses pre-coloured with permanent red oxidative dye.

40|$|Dynamic {{control system}} (DCS) is an interactive, {{patented}} storage concept, {{which can be}} regarded as the successor of traditional controlled atmosphere (CA) storage for some commodities. Instead of using static, fixed set-points for gas conditions like in CA, the oxygen concentration in the DCS storage facility is controlled upon product response. When applying DCS, the oxygen concentration is slowly lowered until the product emits a stress-signal. More specific, DCS uses ethanol, the final product of fermentation, to establish the lowest possible oxygen concentration under which a product can be stored. DCS was applied for the storage of apples (cv `Elstar¿). Experiments with this cultivar, as presented here, show that apples are firmer after DCS storage, especially after shelf life, and have a better <b>colour</b> <b>retention</b> compared with traditional CA.
