40|$|In {{the context}} of {{business}} intelligence (BI), the accuracy and accessibility of information consolidation play an important role. Integrating data from different sources involves its transformation according to constraints expressed in an appropriate language. The Conceptual Integration Modelling framework (CIM) acts as such a language. The CIM is aimed to allow business users to specify what information is needed in a simplified and comprehensive language. Achieving this requires raising the level of abstraction to the conceptual level, so that users are able to pose queries expressed in a conceptual query language (CQL). The CIM is comprised of three facets: an Extended Entity Relationship (EER) model (a high level conceptual model {{that is used to}} design databases), a conceptual schema against which users pose their queries, a relational multidimensional model that represents data sources, and mappings between the conceptual schema and sources. Such mappings can be specified in two ways: in the first scenario, the so-called global-as-view (GAV), the global schema is mapped to views over the relational sources by specifying how to obtain tuples of the global relation from tuples in the sources. In the second scenario, sources may contain less detailed information (a more aggregated data) so the local relations are defined as views over global relations that is called as local-as-view (LAV). In this thesis, we address the problem of expressibility and decidability of queries written in CQL. We first define the semantics of the CIM by translating the conceptual model so we could translate it into a set of first order sentences containing a class of <b>conceptual</b> <b>dependencies</b> (CDs) - tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) and equality generating dependencies (EGDs), in addition to certain (first order) restrictions to express multidimensionality. Here a multidimensionality means that facts in a data warehouse can be described from different perspectives. The EGDs set the equality between tuples and the TGDs set the rule that two instances are in a subtype association (more precise definitions are given further in the thesis). We use a non-conflicting class of <b>conceptual</b> <b>dependencies</b> that guarantees a query's decidability. The non-conflicting dependencies avoid an interaction between TGDs and EGDs. Our semantics extend the existing semantics defined for extended entity relationship models to the notions of fact, dimension category, dimensional hierarchy and dimension attributes. In addition, a class of conceptual queries will be defined and proven to be decidable. A DL-Lite logic has been extensively used for query rewriting as it allows us to reduce the complexity of the query answering to AC 0. Moreover, we present a query rewriting algorithm for the class of defined <b>conceptual</b> <b>dependencies.</b> Finally, we consider the problem in light of GAV and LAV approaches and prove the query answering complexities. The query answering problem becomes decidable if we add certain constraints to a well-known set of EGDs + TGDs dependencies to guarantee summarizability. The query answering problem in light of the global-as-a-view approach of mapping has AC 0 data complexity and EXPTIME combined complexity. This problem becomes coNP hard if we are to consider it a LAV approach of mapping...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Coupling metrics {{capture the}} degree of {{interaction}} and relationships among source code elements in software systems. A vast majority of existing coupling metrics rely on structural information, which captures interactions such as usage relations between classes and methods or execute after associations. However, these metrics lack the ability to identify <b>conceptual</b> <b>dependencies,</b> which, for instance, specify underlying relationships encoded by developers in identifiers and comments of source code classes. We propose a new coupling metric for object-oriented software systems, namely Relational Topic based Coupling (RTC) of classes, which uses Relational Topic Models (RTM), generative probabilistic model, to capture latent topics in source code classes and relationships among them. A case study on thirteen open source software systems is performed to compare the new measure with existing structural and conceptual coupling metrics. The case study demonstrates that proposed metric not only captures new dimensions of coupling, which {{are not covered by}} the existing coupling metrics, but also can be used to effectively support impact analysis.

40|$|Abstract. Semantic {{symbols are}} {{essential}} components of Chinese characters. ShuoWenJieZi (Xyu Shen 121), the oldest dictionary of Chinese, is organized {{according to the}} radical forms as semantic symbols. Characters are classified according radicals, and their meanings cluster around the basic concept of the semantic symbol. We believe that ShuoWenJieZi radicals systemreflect conventional conceptualization when Chinese character orthography was invented. In this research, we use the semantic symbols representing four hoofed-mammals in ShuoWenJieZi,“bovid, ” “deer, ” “cattle, ” and “horse, ” as our research objects. In principle we assume that semantic symbols represent basic concepts, and further more we distinguish the relations between derived characters and each basic concept to construct a conventionalized ontology headed by basic concepts expressed by the semantic symbols. Our analysis and comparative studies of the semantic symbol ontologies for the four hoofed-mammals show that they share similar conceptual structures strongly motivated by their functions in human society. In particular, we show that the <b>conceptual</b> <b>dependencies</b> between the basic concept of a radical and the meanings of the derived characters {{can be explained by}} an enriched version of the Generative Lexicon...|$|R
40|$|<b>Conceptual</b> <b>dependencies</b> (CDs) are {{particular}} {{kinds of}} key dependencies (KDs) and inclusion dependencies (IDs) that precisely characterize relational schemata modeled {{according to the}} main features of the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. An instance for such a schema may be inconsistent (data violate the dependencies) and incomplete (data constitute a piece of correct information, but not necessarily all the relevant information). While undecidable under general KDs and IDs, query answering under incomplete data {{is known to be}} decidable for CDs. The known techniques are based on the chase [...] a special instance, organized in levels of depth, that is a representative of all the instances that satisfy the dependencies and that include the initial instance. Although the chase generally has infinite size, query answering can be addressed by posing the query (or a rewriting thereof) on a finite, initial part of the chase. Contrary to previous claims, we show that the maximum level of such an initial part cannot be bounded by a constant that does not depend {{on the size of the}} initial instance.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explain why Axiomatic design {{has not been}} applied in large system of systems {{information}} technology architectures in health care organizations in the Netherlands. We have found in extensive case studies of IT systems that the Independence axiom {{could not be found}} in the existing Information systems. This causes great concern for the adaptability of systems. Although best practices in system engineering advice decoupling of system functionality, findings show that the Independence Axiom has not been applied to functional requirements. A number of difficulties was exposed to the researcher and IT architects, when they tried to identify and to demarcate functional requirements in existing systems. In IT systems a distinction is made between business and system functions and software engineers emphasize decoupling of system functions. That has resulted in a strong coupling of business information and technical application logic. This means <b>Conceptual</b> <b>dependencies</b> are often {{at the heart of the}} difficulties. Decoupling these dependencies in applications seems a candidate for ordering requirements in a way that keeps the functional requirements independent from each other. Conceptual independence signifies a complete decoupling of the concepts and relations of the Business domain from the technical functionality. The paper describes the difficulties when applying the Independence Axiom in the Information systems domain and argues that a combination of Conceptual independence and Axiomatic design is achievable. The authors adapt the Design matrix with Conceptual independence. We conclude that applying Conceptual independence is crucial when constructing IT systems based on Axiomatic design...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, object-orientation has gained more and more {{importance}} within several disciplines of computer science (e. g. programming languages, knowledge engineering, and database systems).

Nevertheless, papers investigating the dependencies and degrees of freedom of these concepts are rarely found. For this reason, the goal of this paper is not to add yet another definition of object-oriented concepts, but to identify existing relationships among these basic concepts that allow one to cover and classify various conceivable combinations of these <b>conceptual</b> building blocks. <b>Dependencies,</b> orthogonalities, and relations among concepts like object identity, encapsulation, classification, generalization, inheritance, etc. are revealed, showing numerous ways to compose different shades of object-orientation. This leads to alternatives encountered when constructing object-oriented systems, which are illustrated by classifying some well-known systems and prototypes from different areas. However, it is not our purpose to analyze the relative importance of these concepts. Instead, we investigate the concepts from a neutral point of view, presenting (but not evaluating) several degrees of object-orientation...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary water {{management}} practices worldwide are informed by two leading paradigms: integrated {{water resources management}} and adaptive management. While previous scholarship has already studied the two paradigms, {{as well as their}} central principles, in isolation, there are few attempts only to theorise their interaction and to explore empirically their parallel implementation and coexistence. This article contributes to this emerging literature. Its ambition is to review and complement current frameworks conceptualising the impact of integrated water resources management on adaptive capacity. To this end, the article analyses the involvement of non-state actors in UK water and flood risk management, specifically in England and Wales. This is an exciting case to study: for many decades, environmental management in England and Wales had a reputation for being a technocratic exercise. In the past 15 years, however, environmental authorities undertook major efforts to lay the foundations for enhanced collaboration and stakeholder participation, amongst others encouraged by two European Union initiatives reflecting integrated and adaptive management principles: the Water Framework Directive and the Floods Directive. The empirical evidence suggests a spurious link only between the two paradigms. This contradicts conventional wisdom which, so I argue, tends to oversimplify a complex relationship.

40|$|This {{presentation}} will {{propose a}} functional-cognitive account of cleft constructions with copular-type matrices {{such as it}} is (1), there is (2), we’ve got (3), in which their form and function are shown to match in accordance with the theoretical tenets of Halliday (1992), McGregor (1997) and Langacker (1987 : 305). Intriguingly, the two main structural accounts of it-clefts put forth in both the formal and functional tradition have posited some form-meaning mismatch, even if their authors in theory assume a natural coding relation between form and meaning. The first account views the matrix as semantically empty (e. g. Jespersen 1937, Ball 1994, Kiss 1998, Lambrecht 2001). In the second account, the relative clause is claimed to modify subject it, either syntactically (e. g. Halliday 1967, Bolinger 1972, Percus 1997, Patten 2012) or only semantically, with it and the relative clause functioning pragmatically as a discontinuous definite description (e. g. Hedberg 1990, Reeve 2011). 	Crucial to the analysis proposed here is a broader delineation of English cleft constructions with copular-type matrices than in the mainstream. The type with matrix it be is generally recognized and most authors view it as an exhaustively specificational construction: in (1) the postverbal NP only a chosen f (salient syllable bolded, falling tone, exhaustively specifies the value for the variable x, the ‘gap’ in the relative clause ‘x can understand him’. Like Lambrecht (2001), I (2000) have argued for the existence of non-exhaustive specificational clefts, whose matrix in English is either there be (2) or a matrix like I/you/we have (got) (3). Their complement NPs also specify a value for a variable, e. g. ‘x is also known’ in (2) and ‘x can look after ’em’ in (3), but without exhaustiveness implicature. (1) //yeah but Mr [] will make us w/ork in maths// it’s only a chosen f/ that can underst him// (COLT) (2) [in reaction to question if there are any known academics in the department] A: well ^first of ′all//there’s a ^man called ′′!H//who ^has I ′think :taken his de:gr//^in this de!p//and is ^kn//[@] who ^s [@:m]//to ^be [s @] !fairly ′strong//^and there is ′′!H//who is ^ ′known// (LLC: 2. 6) (3) you can always bring your kids here. … we 've got Herman who can look after `em. (WordbanksOnline) 	I argue that the three subtypes have the same structural assembly, which is motivated by the same <b>conceptual</b> <b>dependencies,</b> and which explains their different semantics and pragmatics. (i) 	They have a matrix whose predicate assigns a semantic role to its complement, such as identifier of identifying be in (1), existent of the existential predicate in (2), and patient of have in (3). (ii) 	The whole complement NP is the head being modified by (and the antecedent of) the cleft relative clause: it designates determined instances, e. g. a chosen few (1), Herman (2 - 3) (in contrast with restrictive relative clauses whose antecedent is the head noun only, designating a mere type of entity). (iii) 	The ‘secondary’ modification of the postverbal complement is similar to that in some secondary predication constructions (Nichols 1978, McGregor 1997, König & Lambrecht 1998), but, because of its specificational semantics, constitutes a ‘secondary specification’ construction. (iv) 	The identifying matrix construes the referent(s) of its complement as the only one(s) satisfying the variable, while the other matrices list the referent(s) of the complement as one(s), possibly among others, satisfying the variable. The exhaustiveness implicature of it-clefts and its absence in clefts with the other matrix types thus fall out naturally from this account. 	In further support of the proposed analysis, I relate this semantico-grammatical account to the different information structures (realized by prosody) that have been associated with it-clefts (e. g. Collins 2006) and argue that these generalizations can be extended to there- and have-clefts. References Ball, C. 1994. The origins of the informative-presupposition it-cleft.
