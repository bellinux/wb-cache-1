25|$|The second Bledisloe <b>Cup</b> <b>Test</b> of 1995 {{marked the}} first and only time in Campese's rugby career where he started a Test on the bench.

40|$|In this work, Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF), a {{state of}} art technique, was carried out on Aluminum AA 6061 alloy sheets and its forming limit was {{determined}} experimentally. The straight groove and <b>cupping</b> <b>tests</b> were carried using ball ended tool in CNC vertical milling machine. In order to investigate the effects step depth and depth of grove on formability, the straight groove and <b>cupping</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted. Straight groves were performed along the rolling and transverse directions. The sum of major strain and minor strain {{as a measure of}} formability was measured. The forming limit diagrams (FLD) for straight groove and <b>cupping</b> <b>tests</b> were plotted. Moreover the effect of anisotropy of SPIF in rolling and transverse directions was confirmed through the straight groove test. It is also found that the formability decreases as the step depth increases during the SPIF...|$|R

In 1971 an international sports boycott was instituted against South Africa to voice global disapproval of their racist selection policies and apartheid in general. South Africa became world sport's pariah, excluded from the Olympics, the FIFA World <b>Cup,</b> <b>Test</b> cricket and a host of minority sports.|$|E

40|$|The {{formability}} of AISI 202 {{austenitic stainless}} steel was {{compared with that of}} type AISI 304 stainless steel. Type 202 is a low-nickel {{austenitic stainless steel}} alloyed with manganese and nitrogen. In this study, the formability of the two grades was examined using Erichsen <b>cupping</b> <b>tests</b> and room temperature uniaxial tensile tests performed at various angles to the rolling direction. AISI 202 appears to work-harden at a slightly higher rate than AISI 304, even though the austenite in type 202 is more stable than that in 304 with respect to the formation of deformation-induced a¢ martensite. Although both grades are predicted to be susceptible to earing during deep drawing, AISI 202 displays a higher work-hardening exponent, higher average normal anisotropy, and a higher limiting drawing ratio than AISI 304. Similar cup heights were measured during Erichsen <b>cupping</b> <b>tests,</b> confirming that the two grades have very similar deep drawing properties. The results of this investigation therefore suggest that AISI 202 is a suitable alternative for AISI 304 in applications requiring good deep drawing properties...|$|R

His best effort of the series came in the second innings of the First test at Mohali scoring 144 and helping India salvage a draw after being bowled out for 83 runs in the First innings. Before this innings, Dravid had five test {{hundreds}} to his name from 29 tests, all of which came in away tests, this being his first test hundred on Indian soil. Except for this inning, he had a quiet time throughout the series.|$|E
25|$|Campese {{played in}} the one-off Bledisloe <b>Cup</b> <b>Test</b> in 1989 between Australia and New Zealand. The Test, which Australia lost 12-24, {{contains}} a Campese try. Australia's eightman Steve Tuynman took the ball {{from the back of}} a scrum and passed the ball to Nick Farr-Jones. Farr-Jones passed the ball to Campese, who stepped around John Kirwan causing him to slip over. Campese then passed to Farr-Jones who had looped him. As Farr-Jones and Campese were running down the sideline, and with Farr-Jones about to be tackled into touch, Campese pointed forwards signalling Farr-Jones to kick the ball forwards. Farr-Jones executed a grubber kick. Campese and All Blacks inside centre John Schuster were engaged in a sprint towards the ball. As Schuster tried to dive on the ball, Campese was able to kick the ball forwards and fall upon it.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Campese {{was dropped}} from the Australian team for their first Bledisloe <b>Cup</b> <b>Test</b> match against New Zealand in Auckland. Following an injury to Australian fullback Matthew Burke in the first Bledisloe <b>Cup</b> <b>Test</b> of 1995 in Auckland, the Australian {{selectors}} picked Rod Kafer to take Burke's place in the Australian team. Kafer then suffered a broken leg during a training session. Campese was then recalled to a training session with the Wallabies, with the information that if Matthew Burke proved his fitness, he would not play in the second Bledisloe <b>Cup</b> <b>Test.</b> Burke recovered from his injury {{to play in the}} second Bledisloe <b>Cup</b> <b>Test.</b> However, another injury to Australian centre Daniel Herbert led to Campese's selection on the bench in the second Bledisloe <b>Cup</b> <b>Test</b> of 1995.

25|$|Quade Cooper was {{suspended}} for two weeks for a spear tackle of Morné Steyn. As {{in the case of}} Jean de Villiers last week, Cooper's previously good disciplinary history was cited as a mitigating factor. The Australian Rugby Union appealed the length of the ban, presumably because the suspensions of Fourie and de Villiers kept them out of only one Test, but was denied. Cooper was sidelined for the first two Bledisloe <b>Cup</b> <b>Tests</b> in Melbourne and Christchurch.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: With {{the demands}} of {{environmental}} protection and energy conservation, increasing resources and improving environment, TWB (Tailor Weld Blank) as one of green re-manufacturing technologies will be a guiding orientation in industry. In this study, microstructure of welded joint, tensile <b>test,</b> fracture surface, <b>cupping</b> <b>test</b> of the TWB were carried out. Results show that the microstructure of weld is acicular ferrite and plate pearlite. The microstructure of HAZ beside SAPH 440 is pearlite and grain ferrite, and the microstructure of HAZ beside DP 600 is numbly pearlite and plate ferrite. The results of tensile test show that {{the shape of the}} materials after drawing is not easy to be rebounded, plastic deformation of the blanks is excellent, and the SEM of fracture morphology shows that the fracture is ductile and cleavage when the weld line parallels tensile axis. When the weld perpendicular to tensile axial, the deformation of the TWB is uneven, the plastic deformation is poor and the fracture is typical ductile rupture. The research results of the <b>cupping</b> <b>test</b> suggest that the bulging formability of the TWB is worse than that of base materials, and the bigger proportion of the thin blank in the TWB, the better bulging formability of the TWB...|$|R
