By determining and monitoring these levels, and following a proactive or predictive maintenance program, the user can reduce hydraulic failures, increase uptime and machine availability, and to reduce oil consumption. They {{can also be used to}} assure that hydraulic fluids have been cleaned using filtration, to acceptable or target cleanliness levels.

This information is useful in determining the amount of particles inside a building or in the ambient air.

Cleanrooms are used extensively in semiconductor device fabrication, biotechnology, pharmaceutics, disk drives, aerospace and other fields that are very sensitive to environmental contamination. Cleanrooms have defined particle count limits. Aerosol particle counters {{are used to}} test and classify a cleanroom to ensure its performance is up to a specific cleanroom classification standard. Several standards exist for cleanroom classification. The most frequently referred to classification is from the United States. Though originating in the United States, the standard Federal Standard 209E was the first and most commonly referred to.

40|$|Summary: Monitoring {{of system}} {{cleanliness}} levels and counting of particulate contaminant are fundamental to achieving hydraulic system reliability as any {{departure from the}} specified <b>cleanliness</b> <b>level</b> is often a precursor to future failures. On-line monitoring of cleanliness levels {{has the advantage of}} giving data both very quickly and accurately as environmental influences are eliminated. In this way, corrective actions can be promptly implemented. Most on-line instruments are sensitive to system conditions {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, but Automatic Particle Counters (APCs) working on light extinction principles are especially sensitive to the presence of optical interfaces caused by such conditions as fluid mixtures, emulsions, free water and air bubbles. These conditions give erroneous data and can result in drawing incorrect conclusions, wasting maintenance time and ultimately, reduced user confidence in cleanliness monitoring.

While it is not ideal to clean in a shop environment, some situations (e. g., field combat operations) require oxygen system hardware to be maintained and cleaned to prevent a fire hazard, even though it cannot {{be sent back to}} a precision cleaning facility. This study measured the effectiveness of basic shop cleaning. Initially, three items representing parts of an oxygen system were contaminated: a metal plate, valve body, and metal oxygen bottle. The contaminants chosen were those most likely to be introduced to the system during normal use: oil, lubricant, metal shavings/powder, sand, fingerprints, tape, lip balm, and hand lotion. The cleaning process used hot water, soap, various brushes, gaseous nitrogen, water nozzle, plastic trays, scouring pads, and a controlled shop environment. Test subjects were classified into three groups: technical professionals having an appreciation for oxygen hazards; professional precision cleaners; and a group with no previous professional knowledge of oxygen or precision cleaning. Three test subjects were in each group, and each was provided with standard cleaning equipment, a cleaning procedure, and one of each of the three test items to clean.
