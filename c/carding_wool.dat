500|$|Some {{children}} {{were trained in}} skills valuable to the area. [...] In Shrewsbury, the boys {{were placed in the}} workhouse's workshop, while girls were tasked with spinning, making gloves and other jobs [...] "suited to their sex, their ages and abilities". [...] At St Martin in the Fields, {{children were}} trained in spinning flax, picking hair and <b>carding</b> <b>wool,</b> before being placed as apprentices. [...] Workhouses also had links with local industry; in Nottingham, children employed in a cotton mill earned about £60 a year for the workhouse. [...] Some parishes advertised for apprenticeships, and were willing to pay any employer prepared to offer them. [...] Such agreements were preferable to supporting children in the workhouse: apprenticed children were not subject to inspection by justices, thereby lowering the chance of punishment for neglect; and apprenticeships were viewed as a better long-term method of teaching skills to children who might otherwise be uninterested in work. [...] Supporting an apprenticed child was also considerably cheaper than the workhouse or outdoor relief. [...] Children often had no say in the matter, which could be arranged without the permission or knowledge of their parents. [...] The supply of labour from workhouse to factory, which remained popular until the 1830s, was sometimes viewed as a form of transportation. [...] While getting parish apprentices from Clerkenwell, Samuel Oldknow's agent reported how some parents came [...] "crying to beg they may have their Children out again". [...] Historian Arthur Redford suggests that the poor may have once shunned factories as [...] "an insidious sort of workhouse".|$|E

6000|$|To quit {{this scene}} for the castle of Aigle was to plunge {{from the present}} into my {{favorite}} Middle Ages. We were directly in the times when the Lords of Berne held the Vaud by the strong hand, and forced Protestant convictions upon its people by the same vigorous methods. The castle was far older than their occupation, but it is chiefly memorable as the residence of their bailiffs before {{the independence of the}} Vaud was established after the French Revolution. They were hard masters, but they left political and religious freedom behind them, where perhaps neither would have existed without them. The castle, though eminently picturesque and delightfully Gothic, is very rudely finished and decorated, and could never have been a luxurious seat for the bailiffs. It is now used by the local courts of law; a solitary, pale, unshaven old prisoner, who seemed very glad of our tribute-money, inhabited its tower, and there was an old woman <b>carding</b> <b>wool</b> in the baronial kitchen. Her little grandson lighted a candle and showed us the oubliettes, which are subterranean dungeons, one above the other, and barred by mighty doors of wood and iron. The outer one bore an inscription, which I copied: ...|$|E
60|$|He made a {{sufficiently}} {{poor job of}} it; and to his surprise too, for the cleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed {{an easy thing to}} do. It was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he finished it at last. He was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now; however, he was not to lose this thrifty dame's society so easily. She furnished him some little odds and ends of employment, which he got through with after a fair fashion and with some credit. Then she set him and the little girls to paring some winter apples; but he was so awkward at this service that she retired him from it and gave him a butcher knife to grind. Afterwards she kept him <b>carding</b> <b>wool</b> until he began to think he had laid the good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the present in the matter of showy menial heroisms that would read picturesquely in story-books and histories, and so he was half-minded to resign. And when, just after the noonday dinner, the goodwife gave him a basket of kittens to drown, he did resign. At least he was just going to resign--for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere, and {{it seemed to him that}} to draw it at kitten-drowning was about the right thing--when there was an interruption. The interruption was John Canty--with a peddler's pack on his back--and Hugo.|$|E
5000|$|Woolen is a soft, short-staple, <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> yarn {{typically}} used for knitting. [...] In traditional weaving, woolen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is frequently {{combined with a}} worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom.|$|R

50|$|Early {{settlers}} {{were also}} {{attracted to the}} vicinity of Yocumtown because of the water power of Fishing Creek. Along its banks they built fulling mills that <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> for area farmers, woolen cloth mills, and grist mills.

50|$|Woolen (American English) or woollen (Commonwealth English) {{is a type}} of yarn {{made from}} <b>carded</b> <b>wool.</b> Woolen yarn is soft, light, stretchy, and full of air. It is thus a good insulator, and makes a good {{knitting}} yarn. Woolen yarn is in contrast to worsted yarn, in which the fibers are combed to lie parallel rather than carded, producing a hard, strong yarn.|$|R

2500|$|Such spinners {{generally}} {{buy their}} fibres pre-washed and carded, {{in the form}} of roving, sliver, or batts. This means less work for the spinners, as {{they do not have to}} wash out the lanolin.

50|$|The second {{function}} of fulling was to thicken cloth by matting the fibres together {{to give it}} strength and increase waterproofing (felting).

After this stage, water was used to rinse out the foul-smelling liquor used during cleansing.|$|E

50|$|The {{preparation}} of greasy wool demands several steps, and early procedures have been modified over the years. The oldest wool processing method followed by Cowichan women involved six basic steps: the wool was washed, dried, hand teased, hand carded, drawn out and loosely spun by hand {{to make a}} roving, then tightened with a spindle and whorl. Today, many of these steps have been mechanized or eliminated. Some knitters still buy shorn fleeces and go {{through most of the}} traditional preparation, but most buy the washed and <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> directly from a commercial carding mill.|$|R

50|$|Sheep's wool, or mah-too-EHL-kel, is {{the most}} common {{material}} used for modern Salish weaving. Some knitters still buy shorn fleeces and go through most of the traditional preparation, but most buy the washed and <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> directly from a commercial carding mill. The fleece is lightly washed in a tub of tepid water and then hung outside to dry. It is then teased or picked apart with fingers to remove any matted areas and loose dirt. The <b>wool</b> is then <b>carded,</b> leaving the <b>wool</b> in soft batts, where the fibers lie lengthwise. Taken to the spinning machine, the wool is deftly hand fed into the axle of the spindle. This separates sections of the batt of wool and allows the desired amount of spinning to take place before the tension is eased to wind the wool onto the spindle. When the spindle has filled, the wool is unwound and stored in balls or skeins.|$|R

5000|$|The alley {{is named}} Erik Ingemundssons gränd ("Alley of Erik Ingemundsson") in 1619, in {{reference}} to the mayor (1581-1622) who owned a property in the alley. While the present name appears in historical records as Öfwerskiärare gränden in 1684, and a certain Absalon överskärare is mentioned in 1643 as having bought a property near that of the major, it remains uncertain which of the masters of the trade gave his name to the alley. Notwithstanding, an överskärare was an occupation which could be translated to [...] "wool cloth finisher", a man who would go over <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> with a pair of scissors to remove upstanding hairs {{in order to make the}} cloth perfectly smooth, masters of the trade being merchants with their own workshops.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Carding</b> of <b>wool</b> {{can either}} be done [...] "in the grease" [...] or not, {{depending}} on the type of machine and on the spinner's preference. [...] "In the grease" [...] means that the lanolin that naturally comes with the wool has not been washed out, leaving the wool with a slightly greasy feel. The large drum carders do not tend to get along well with lanolin, so most commercial worsted and woollen mills wash the <b>wool</b> before <b>carding.</b> Hand carders (and small drum carders too, though the directions may not recommend it) can be used to <b>card</b> lanolin rich <b>wool.</b>|$|R
