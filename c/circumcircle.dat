25|$|The <b>circumcircle</b> {{of three}} {{collinear}} points {{is the line}} on which the three points lie, {{often referred to as}} a circle of infinite radius. Nearly collinear points often lead to numerical instability in computation of the <b>circumcircle.</b>|$|E
25|$|In coastal navigation, a triangle's <b>circumcircle</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} way of obtaining a position line using a sextant when no compass is available. The horizontal angle between two landmarks defines the <b>circumcircle</b> upon which the observer lies.|$|E

25|$|In geometry, the {{circumscribed}} circle or <b>circumcircle</b> of a polygon is a circle which passes {{through all the}} vertices of the polygon. The center of this circle is called the circumcenter and its radius is called the circumradius.|$|E
25|$|Through any three points, not all on {{the same}} line, there lies a unique circle. In Cartesian coordinates, it is {{possible}} to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See <b>circumcircle.</b>|$|E
25|$|As for {{any right}} triangle, the {{converse}} of Thales' theorem {{says that the}} diameter of the <b>circumcircle</b> equals the hypotenuse; hence for primitive triples the circumdiameter is m2+n2, and the circumradius is half of this and thus is rational but non-integer (since m and n have opposite parity).|$|E
50|$|This {{question}} was proposed by Fermat, {{as a challenge}} to Evangelista Torricelli. He solved the problem in a similar way to Fermat's, albeit using intersection of the <b>circumcircles</b> of the three regular triangles instead. His pupil, Viviani, published the solution in 1659.|$|R
50|$|If {{four points}} form an orthocentric system, then {{each of the}} four points is the {{orthocenter}} of the other three. These four possible triangles will all have the same nine-point circle. Consequently these four possible triangles must all have <b>circumcircles</b> with the same circumradius.|$|R
50|$|For {{modelling}} terrain {{or other}} objects given {{a set of}} sample points, the Delaunay triangulation gives a nice set of triangles to use as polygons in the model. In particular, the Delaunay triangulation avoids narrow triangles (as they have large <b>circumcircles</b> compared to their area). See triangulated irregular network.|$|R
25|$|Other, rarely used, {{names for}} {{this class of}} quadrilaterals are inscriptable quadrilateral, inscriptible quadrilateral, inscribable quadrilateral, circumcyclic quadrilateral, and co-cyclic quadrilateral. Due {{to the risk of}} {{confusion}} with a quadrilateral that has a <b>circumcircle,</b> which is called a cyclic quadrilateral or inscribed quadrilateral, it is preferable not to use any of the last five names.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{tangential}} quadrilaterals are the kites, {{which include}} the rhombi, which in turn include the squares. The kites are exactly the tangential quadrilaterals that are also orthodiagonal. A right kite is a kite with a <b>circumcircle.</b> If a quadrilateral is both tangential and cyclic, it is called a bicentric quadrilateral, {{and if it is}} both tangential and a trapezoid, it is called a tangential trapezoid.|$|E
25|$|The {{midpoints}} of {{the three}} sides and the feet {{of the three}} altitudes all lie on a single circle, the triangle's nine-point circle. The remaining three points for which it is named are the midpoints of the portion of altitude between the vertices and the orthocenter. The radius of the nine-point circle is half that of the <b>circumcircle.</b> It touches the incircle (at the Feuerbach point) and the three excircles.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To every cyclic {{quadrilateral}} corresponds naturally {{a complex}} of six-teen cyclic quadrilaterals. The radical axes of the various pairs of <b>circumcircles,</b> the various circumcenters and anticenters combine to interesting configurations.

25|$|A {{perpendicular}} bisector of {{a side of}} a triangle is a straight line passing through {{the midpoint of the}} side and being perpendicular to it, i.e. forming a right angle with it. The three {{perpendicular bisector}}s meet in a single point, the triangle's circumcenter, usually denoted by O; this point is the center of the <b>circumcircle,</b> the circle passing through all three vertices. The diameter of this circle, called the circumdiameter, can be found from the law of sines stated above. The circumcircle's radius is called the circumradius.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{triangle}} has two particular circles as its <b>circumcircle</b> and incircle, there exist {{an infinite number}} of other triangles with the same <b>circumcircle</b> and incircle, with any point on the <b>circumcircle</b> as a vertex.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} an {{extension}} of Mario Dalcı́n’s work on isotomic in-scribed triangles and their residuals [1]. Considering the <b>circumcircles</b> of resid-ual triangles with respect to isotomic inscribed triangles there are two congruent triangles of circumcenters. We show that there is a rotation mapping these tri-angles to each other. The center and angle of rotation depend on the Miquel points. Furthermore we give an interesting generalization of Dalcin’s definitive example. 1...|$|R
