40|$|<b>Correctional</b> <b>officers</b> occupy an {{important}} societal role in maintaining safety and assisting in {{the rehabilitation of}} inmates; however, both their performance and mental health are highly susceptible to fatigue because of working in a high stress environment. This study investigated the relationship between <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> 2 ̆ 7 demographic factors (level of education, marital status, gender, and race/ethnicity) and their psychological resilience. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 (CD-RISC- 10) {{was used to measure}} <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> 2 ̆ 7 resilience when responding and or coping with stress. This study utilized the stress-vulnerability model as a framework to investigate protective factors against and risk factors for psychopathological symptoms. Participants included 52 individuals who were over the age of 18, employed as <b>correctional</b> <b>officers,</b> and who worked for either the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Two tests measured the outcome variable of <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> 2 ̆ 7 psychological resilience. The first factorial 2 -way analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> 2 ̆ 7 levels of psychological resilience by gender and or race/ethnicity. The second factorial 2 -way analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> 2 ̆ 7 levels of psychological resilience by marital status and or educational level. The information gained from this study implies that the development of programs that improve <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> 2 ̆ 7 resilience and prevent the onset of psychopathology should be focused on factors other than races/ethnicities, genders, marital statuses, and levels of education...|$|R

40|$|Prisons {{have become}} the homes of {{thousands}} of inmates who have mental disorders. The stress of incarceration can cause morbidity among these individuals, resulting in more severe symptoms and more disruptive behavior.

Successful collaboration between <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> and treatment teams requires a foundation of mutual respect, shared training, and ongoing communication and cooperation.

40|$|Job {{satisfaction}} among jail <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> {{is important}} because it ensures the continuity of officers who can promote and maintain a safe environment inside the jail for all staff and inmates. Most job satisfaction studies on <b>correctional</b> <b>officers,</b> however, are focused on prison officers and not county jail officers. The purpose of this correlational study was to test and extend Herzberg 2 ̆ 7 s Motivation-Hygiene theory by exploring job satisfaction and motivation among jail <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> in Miami-Dade Florida. Survey data were collected from 149 <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> using Specter 2 ̆ 7 s (1994) Job Satisfaction Survey. Data were analyzed through correlational and multiple regression analyses. Findings of the correlation results indicated positive relationships at the. 05 level between the motivators and hygiene predictors with job satisfaction. Regression results indicated a statistically significant relationship between the motivators and hygiene predictors with job satisfaction (p = 0. 00). The implications for social change include recommendations to jail administrators to provide channels through which their employees can inform them of prevalent issues to aid in increasing job satisfaction. Implementation of this recommendation may improve job satisfaction among jail <b>correctional</b> <b>officers,</b> thereby improving perceptions that the jail <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> are appreciated and trusted, increase their sense of self-sufficiency, improve morale problems, and help jail administrators invest in the well-being of current and future jail <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> that are needed to maintain the safety and security of correctional facilities...|$|R

In April 2016, Judge Samuel Cappas denied a motion by Vann's attorneys to sever the murder cases of Anith Jones and Afrikka Hardy, and, as a result, the capital murder trial in said cases will continue as one. In a motion filed August 5, 2016, Vann's attorneys argued that Indiana's death penalty law is unconstitutional. In November 2016, Judge Samuel Cappas denied Vann's motion to declare the state's death penalty statute unconstitutional. In January 2017, a Lake County judge decided that Vann could make an appeal with his claims that Indiana's death penalty statute is unconstitutional. In April 2017, the Indiana Supreme Court turned down Vann's request to look at the constitutionality of the state's death penalty statute before he goes to trial. At a status hearing in April 2017, Judge Samuel Cappas set jury selection to begin the week of February 12, 2018, with the actual jury trial beginning around March 12, 2018.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{external}} and institutional stressors that <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> face while performing their duties, such as managing a demanding workload, staffing shortages, and monitoring potentially dangerous inmates, have received some {{attention in the}} literature. However, researchers have not examined correctional officers’ perceptions of how others view their role and professional identity—whether prisoners, their families, or members of the general public—and how these perceptions are believed to influence an officer’s perspective of their work and their well-being. To explore this gap in the literature, this project seeks to analyze whether or not <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> sense these perceptions while performing their duties and if acknowledging these attitudes influences their views of the job. This study is interpretive and framed around the emerging perceptions and experiences of <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> and sensitizing concepts of stigma (Goffman, 1963), the “looking-glass self” (Cooley, 1902) and symbolic interactionism (Blumer, 1969). Ten male and female <b>correctional</b> <b>officers</b> employed with the Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services were interviewed about their workplace experiences and about the portrayal and public engagement of correctional news media. The analyses found that officers view their work through three distinct perspectives (individual, media-centred and organizational).
