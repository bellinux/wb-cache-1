The languages we are using now may not sound like the languages of our ancestors, but it is the same work of art, continually changing as new artists lay their linguistic brushes at its tapestry. In the end this is why, even though I started out with the natural sciences, mathematics and computer technology, I had to study theoretical linguistics.
