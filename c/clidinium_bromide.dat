50|$|<b>Clidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> (INN) is an {{anticholinergic}} (specifically a muscarinic antagonist) drug. It {{may help}} symptoms of cramping and abdominal/stomach pain by decreasing stomach acid, and slowing the intestines. It is commonly prescribed {{in combination with}} chlordiazepoxide (a benzodiazepine derivative) using the brand name Librax.|$|E
5000|$|Chlordiazepoxide/clidinium bromide (marketed as Librax) {{is a drug}} {{consisting}} of chlordiazepoxide (marketed separately under the trade name Librium) and <b>clidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> and used to treat peptic ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and gastritis. It helps relieve stomach spasms, abdominal cramps, and anxiety related to gastric disorders. Librax is a fixed ratio of these two medications and, as such, is not typically prescribed with an accompanying dosage, but rather directions on how many capsules to take per day. It comes in a capsule taken by mouth, usually {{three or four times}} daily, before meals and at bedtime. [...] Chlordiazepoxide is an anti-anxiety medication belonging to the benzodiazepine class. [...] Its use in IBS is thought to be due to its calming ability for patients that have IBS symptoms that are worsened by anxiety. <b>Clidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> is a synthetic quaternary ammonium antimuscarinic, a sub-class of a family of drugs known as anticholinergics. It treats IBS by decreasing gastrointestinal motility.|$|E

In India, it is of a compound with paracetamol under the trade name Cyclopam. It is also marketed as Meftal-SPAS containing mefenamic acid along with dicyclomine hydrochloride as an analgesic and antispasmodic.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} and precise RP-HPLC method {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous estimation of <b>clidinium</b> <b>bromide</b> (CDB) and chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) in pure and pharmaceutical formulations. The separation was achieved on a Nucleodur C 8 ([*]mm i. d., 5 [*]μm particle size) column at 25 °C. CH 3 CN-MeOH-NH 4 OAc 0. 1 M (30 [*]:[*] 40 [*]:[*] 30, v/v/v) {{was used as the}} mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 0 [*]mL[*]min− 1 and detector wavelength at 218 [*]nm. Almotriptan (ALT) was used as internal standard. The validation of the proposed method was carried out for linearity, accuracy, precision, LOD, LOQ, and robustness. The method showed good linearity in the ranges of 2. 5 – 300. 0 and 3. 0 – 500. 0 [*]μg[*]mL− 1 for CDB and CDZ, respectively. The percentage recovery obtained for CDB and CDZ was 100. 40 – 103. 38 and 99. 98 – 105. 59 %, respectively. LOD and LOQ were 0. 088 and 0. 294 [*]μg[*]mL− 1 for CDB and 0. 121 and 0. 403 [*]μg[*]mL− 1 for CDZ, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of CDB and CDZ in combined dosage forms and the results tallied well with the label claim...|$|E
40|$|A simple, precise, {{accurate}} and reliable HPTLC method {{has been developed}} and validated for analysis of <b>Clidinium</b> <b>Bromide</b> (CLBr), Pantoprazole Sodium (PNT) and Chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) in their combined dosage form. Identification and analysis were performed on 100 mm x 100 mm layer thickness 0. 2 mm, pre-coated silica gel 60 F 254 aluminum sheet, prewashed with methanol and dried in an oven at 50 °C for 5 min. Chloroform: Acetone: 0. 5 M Ammonium acetate in Methanol: Formic acid (1. 0 : 5. 0 : 3. 0 : 1. 0) (v/v/v/v) was used as mobile phase. Calibration plots were established showing the dependence of response (peak area) on the amount chromatographed. The validated calibration ranges were 600 - 1600 ng/spot, 4800 - 12800 ng/spot and 1200 - 3200 ng/spot for CLBr, PNT and CDZ with correlation coefficient (R 2) 0. 998, 0. 994 and 0. 998 respectively. Average % recovery was between 99. 63 – 99. 89 %, 99. 87 – 100. 05 % and 99. 77 - 99. 93 % for CLBr, PNT and CDZ respectively. The spots were scanned at 220 nm in a reflectance mode. The proposed method has been validated as per ICH guidelines and successfully applied to the estimation of CLBr, PNT and CDZ in their combined Capsule dosage form...|$|E
