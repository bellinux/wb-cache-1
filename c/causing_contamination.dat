25|$|Then the {{prepared}} ash and sand were heated together, but not melted, {{at a relatively}} low temperature (up to about 900°C or 1650°F) in {{a process known as}} fritting. Theophilus specifies 'for the space of a day and night.' This process, which could be monitored by changes in colour as temperature increased, caused a decrease in volume, prior to charging crucibles for the final melting stage, thus minimising the number of times the furnace would need to be opened, and also, consolidating the light powdery ash that might blow about in the furnace <b>causing</b> <b>contamination.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Schneider began {{investigating}} asbestos-related {{deaths in}} Libby, Montana, for the P-I. His investigation found asbestos particles {{had been released}} by a closed vermiculite mine, <b>causing</b> <b>contamination</b> of workers' clothing. The mine operator, W.R. Grace and Company, was alleged to have known {{about the dangers of}} exposure to the asbestos processed at the Libby mine and failed to disclose the risks to workers and government agencies in a timely manner. The asbestos contamination, according to Schneider, had killed at least 192 people in Libby, including the wives and children of miners, and at least 375 people were diagnosed with potentially fatal diseases associated with asbestos. The release of the story, entitled [...] "Uncivil Action: A Town Left to Die", gained national attention and led to litigation against W.R. Grace and the indictment of executives on federal charges of knowing endangerment, obstruction of justice, and wire fraud after the company declared bankruptcy and illegally transferred funds and assets to new companies. The Environmental Protection Agency launched an investigation into the Libby mine after the release of the story, and later established a Superfund cleanup site in Libby, declaring in 2009 that the town was under a public health emergency.|$|E

50|$|Formerly an open-pit mine, {{this site}} housed a {{landfill}} from 1952 to 1978. During that time, {{the disposal of}} toxic materials <b>caused</b> <b>contamination</b> of local groundwater. Dorney Road Landfill {{was added to the}} National Priorities List in 1984.|$|R

This relationship is called the Ghyben-Herzberg equation. If too much ground water is pumped near the coast, salt-water may intrude into freshwater aquifers <b>causing</b> <b>contamination</b> of potable freshwater supplies. Many coastal aquifers, such as the Biscayne Aquifer near Miami and the New Jersey Coastal Plain aquifer, have problems with saltwater intrusion {{as a result of}} overpumping and sea level rise.|$|E
5000|$|There were twenty-three toilets for {{eighteen}} hundred {{people and the}} lines became extremely long in the morning. [...] The toilets never flushed since there was a limited water supply.

50|$|Japanese {{climbing}} fern (Lygodium japonicum) {{was added}} to the Florida Noxious Weed List in 1999. It is also a major problem in pine plantations, <b>causing</b> <b>contamination</b> and harvesting problems for the pine straw industry. Old World climbing fern (Lygodium microphyllum) infests cypress swamps and other hydric sites, forming a monoculture. This massive infestation displaces all native flora and fauna, completely changing the ecosystem of the area.|$|E

50|$|The {{water quality}} of Shing Mun River has {{improved}} {{from bad to}} good {{in terms of the}} Water Quality Index since 1993. Lifeforms including fish and invertebrates have also reappeared in the river. In 2001 bioremediation and dredging works began to further improve the river environment. Levels of odour-causing sulphides and E. coli subsequently dropped sharply.

5000|$|A [...] "Broken Arrow" [...] {{incident}} {{originated from}} a minimum interval takeoff incident on December 8, 1964. During a normal MITO at Bunker Hill Air Force Base, Indiana, a Convair B-58 Hustler, loaded with six nuclear weapons, suffered a landing gear failure. This caused the pilot to lose control, which also caused a rupture {{of the fuel}} cell holding JP-4 fuel, causing an immediate fire under the aircraft. The pilot and defensive systems operator survived the fire and abandoned the aircraft; the navigator ejected, but was killed. The resulting fire consumed the aircraft and some nuclear weapons, <b>causing</b> <b>contamination</b> in the immediate vicinity.|$|E

Seawater penetrates the aquifer diffusing in from the ocean and is denser than freshwater. For porous (i.e., sandy) aquifers near the coast, the thickness of freshwater atop saltwater is about 40 ft for every 1 ft of freshwater head above sea level.

50|$|Geological {{formations}} of {{shale gas}} are being explored {{as a new}} source of energy. A technique known as horizontal drilling is used to create a horizontal bore hole, through a formation. Water under high pressure is then pumped into the bore hole where it fractures the shale and allows the gas to escape the rock and seep up the bore hole. There are a number of shale gas fields in Canada including the Shallow Colorado basin in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Bakken, in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Antrim in Southern Ontario and the Utica in south east Quebec. The technique is not without problems for the fracturing can affect aquifers <b>causing</b> <b>contamination</b> and deviation. To date efforts at production in Canada have been limited to exploratory wells.|$|E

5000|$|Problems {{have been}} found where flasks [...] "sweat", when small amounts of {{radioactive}} material absorbed into paint migrate to the surface, <b>causing</b> <b>contamination</b> risks. Studies [...] identified that 10-15% of flasks in the United Kingdom were suffering from this problem, but none exceeded the international recommended safety limits. Similar flasks in mainland Europe were found to marginally exceed the contamination limits during testing, and additional monitoring procedures were put into place. In {{order to reduce the}} risk, current UK flask wagons are fitted with a lockable cover to ensure any surface contamination remains within the container, and all containers are tested before shipment, with those exceeding the safety level being cleaned until they are within the limit. A report in 2001 identified potential risks, and actions to be taken to ensure safety.|$|E
5000|$|On 8 December 1964, a B-58 {{carrying}} {{a nuclear weapons}} slid off an icy runway and caught fire during a training drill. While taxiing it {{was caught in the}} jet blast from the aircraft in front of it while making a turn onto the runway and applying power of its own. This caused the bomber to lose control and slide off the left hand side of the taxiway. The left main landing gear passed over a flush mounted taxiway light fixture, [...] further the landing gear grazed the left edge of a concrete light base. After traveling another 10 ft the left main landing gear struck an electrical manhole box which caused it to collapse, rupturing a fuel tank, the aircraft then caught on fire. The commander, Leary Johnson, and defensive system operator, Roger Hall, were able to escape with minor injuries, however, the navigator, Manuel [...] "Rocky" [...] Cervantes, ejected in his escape capsule, which landed [...] from the bomber, he did not survive. The five nuclear weapons on board were burned, <b>causing</b> <b>contamination</b> of the crash area. The Air Force claimed that the crash site was cleaned of contamination, however, it was discovered that the aircraft and some of the soil from the area were only removed to another site on the base and reburied. The burned bombs were shipped to Atomic Energy Commission facilities Clarksville, Tennessee, Medina Base, Texas, Rocky Flats Colorado, Miamisburg, Ohio, and Oakridge, Tennessee, where it was determined that none of the plutonium from the weapons was released. A 1996 survey found that the area of the crash were still contaminated and required further remediation of the site.|$|E
