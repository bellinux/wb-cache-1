25|$|CLI. O my Syrus, did you hear, do tell me! SYR. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not?</b> I {{was there}} with you.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly I’m here at {{the post}} office. The mail is going out today and how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> write to my Sarenka? Just now, my husband, little Bernhard was here. He looks good and feels well. I’m curious about how you are, how your health is. We are well and plan {{to go to the}} camp. Today is a {{gorgeous}} day, we are in the best of spirits and have great hopes for the future…Don’t worry, girl, it’ll be fine. Be brave, stay well. Warm regards from my entire family and our Bernhard.|$|E
500|$|American {{rock band}} The Flaming Lips {{recorded}} [...] "SpongeBob & Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy". They shot the song's music video, directed by band member Wayne Coyne and filmmaker Bradley Beesley, in Austin, Texas. Coyne said, [...] "Stephen [...] {{seems to be}} a fan of the weirder music of the late '80s and early '90s He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then." [...] Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused, saying [...] "I don't want any of those sort of commercial weirdos on there. I don't like those commercial people. I like you guys, and Wilco and Ween." [...] American band Wilco wrote and recorded [...] "Just a Kid". One of the film's producers contacted frontman Jeff Tweedy after seeing a SpongeBob air freshener hanging from Tweedy's rearview mirror in [...] Tweedy said, [...] "I fell in love with SpongeBob when I heard him describe the darkness {{at the bottom of the}} sea as 'advanced darkness' How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> write a song for this film? It automatically makes me the coolest dad on the block." [...] Avril Lavigne recorded the series' theme for the soundtrack. Other artists contributing to the soundtrack were Motörhead, singing [...] "You Better Swim" [...] (a derivative of their 1992 song [...] "You'd Better Run"); Prince Paul ("Prince Paul's Bubble Party"); Ween ("Ocean Man"), and the Shins ("They'll Soon Discover", partially written in 2001).|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help believing, {{although}} still <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> understand her.|$|R
60|$|Well, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> <b>I</b> {{had nothing}} to say who was utterly disgraced and overwhelmed.|$|R
60|$|He did not observe {{me as he}} passed. I {{tried to}} utter his name; but my tongue was tied. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> speak. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> move.|$|R
500|$|Ritvo {{then moved}} Mucho Macho Man to Santa Anita Park {{almost two months}} before the Breeders' Cup races because she felt he [...] "thrived" [...] in California. It was a major {{commitment}} for the horse's team, as Ritvo, Green, Petro, Tapia and Lopez had to leave their home base in Florida, and Reeves had to cover the expenses. Dean Reeves said, [...] "Everybody has basically put their lives and their family second to the benefit and {{the best we can do}} for Macho." [...] The horse's next race was the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28. [...] Because both Smith and Prado had prior riding commitments, Ritvo and Green decided to contact Gary Stevens. Stevens' contribution to the human interest saga included a comeback in 2013 after having been forced to retire seven years earlier due to debilitating knee pain. He also had his own near-death experience, having survived a major riding accident in 2003. [...] In a twist of serendipity, Stevens' agent, Craig O'Brien, came by the barn to inquire about the horse's availability about the same time Ritvo and Green had decided to see if Stevens was available. Stevens later claimed to be unaware of his agent's machinations. Noting that Stevens had portrayed Seabiscuit's jockey George Woolf in the eponymous film, Ritvo later joked, [...] "I was in Hollywood. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> use a film star?" [...] In the course of the Awesome Again, Mucho Macho Man settled behind the leaders before making a bid on the final turn. The horse led by three lengths in the homestretch, and accelerated clear of the field to win easily by [...] lengths over Paynter. It was his first win in 2013 and his first Grade I stakes win. [...] The victory was also a [...] "win and you're in" [...] qualifying race for the Breeders' Cup Classic, which included a waiver of the $100,000 entry fee for the Classic.|$|E
2500|$|A Democratic Progressive Party {{legislator}} in Taiwan, Yu Tien made offensive comments regarding Muslims, {{claiming they}} were a [...] "light hearted joke", linking terrorism to Muslims while campaigning. His wife had {{said she was a}} “Muslim terrorist early on … like Osama bin Laden.” Yu replied: “People have been saying that I am afraid of my wife. Faced with such a Muslim militant, how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> be afraid?” He then apologized after the incident, saying he was [...] "Deeply apologetic", and [...] "We weren’t trying to connect Muslims with terrorists and we hope the public doesn’t misunderstand us. We respect every religion.” ...|$|E
2500|$|McIntyre {{asked whether}} {{he was to be}} shot. Kelly replied, [...] "No, why should I want to shoot you? <b>Could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> have done it half an hour ago if I had wanted?" [...] He added, [...] "At first I thought you were Constable Flood. If you had been, I would have roasted you in the fire." [...] Kelly asked if the police came out to shoot him. [...] "No", replied McIntyre, [...] "we came to {{apprehend}} you." [...] "What", asked Kelly, [...] "brings you out here at all? It is a shame to see fine big strapping fellows like you in a lazy loafing billet like policemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{three or}} four days <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get no word with Mary. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> now come and go as I had been able to do in the days when we were still [...] "the children." [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> work, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> rest, <b>I</b> prowled as near as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to Burnmore House hoping for some glimpse of her, waiting for the moment when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> decently present myself again at the house.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> eat, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> sit still, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{continue}} steadfast to anything. Something within me, faintly answering to {{the storm}} without, tossed up the depths of my memory and made a tumult in them. Yet, in all the hurry of my thoughts, wild running with the thundering sea,--the storm, and my uneasiness regarding Ham were always in the fore-ground.|$|R
60|$|The words {{reminded}} me of something, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> recall what it was. The strange fear that was on me deepened. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> speak.|$|R
2500|$|The {{reintroduction}} of Vicki {{was part}} of the producers' plan to reform the Watts family, including the resurrection of Vicki's father Den, who had been presumed dead for 14 years. Discussing working with Leslie Grantham, who played Vicki's [...] "iconic" [...] father Den, Johnson said, [...] "I was 2 when he left EastEnders [...] so I never witnessed the hype surrounding him. I'm very aware of the legend. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> be? My only concern was that he should take me seriously [...] It's been fabulous. I can't wait for our scenes to be shown. They're really edgy and no one does edgy better than Leslie. It's been a massive challenge but I think the results are incredibly hard-hitting. EastEnders is becoming more like a serial drama than a soap. It's so well-written." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With every disadvantage!" [...] {{continued}} Dr. May; [...] "unable even {{to remember}} his father! Why <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> be more patient and forbearing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, {{that is a}} libel on my invention!" [...] exclaimed Harry. [...] "If I {{had drawn}} on that, <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> have told you {{something}} much droller?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{ought to}} have {{reasoned}} thus," [...] he replied, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> bring it into play; it was overwhelmed, buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of you only as one who had yielded, who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me. I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery. I {{had no reason to}} believe her of less authority now. The force of habit was to be added." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was not one}} instant, my dear, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> ring, {{for fear}} of {{disturbing}} Fred. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> call any one till it was too late." ...|$|R
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see her face, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{determine}} what answer I should make to this remark, and she continued, {{as she turned}} over the sheets:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{really thought}} that I was safe this time, for <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> see the drawers with their brass handles, the charming shelf for books, the pigeon-holes with their {{coverings}} of silk? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not he, {{as well as}} you? He {{is as much a}} man. If I {{could believe}} in your love after two days, Lord Lovel, <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> trust his after twenty years of friendship?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must think}} it--You {{need not be}} afraid to reproach me. I could bear it from you. What <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> bear from you? Oh, Phineas;--if I had only known myself then, as I do now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Snodgrass. Snodgrass. No, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> endure that. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{get used}} to it. No, I should call him by his first name. What is his first name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will <b>not</b> {{say that}} <b>I</b> ought {{to tell the}} world? you will <b>not</b> say that <b>I</b> ought to be disgraced? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> do it. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> bear it. <b>I</b> cannot have my mother know. <b>Not</b> if <b>I</b> were dead. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have her know. I must tell you; but you will not say that any one else should know." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{believe that}} she was dead, yet where she might be in this savage world, and under what frightful {{conditions}} she might be living, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> guess.|$|R
6000|$|... "Friend, it did {{not occur}} to me before, but the men {{we are about to}} fight with will {{recognise}} me again if we should ever chance to meet; <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> manage to disguise myself in some way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{waited in}} the stillness and loneliness, until it grew nearly dark. The servant brought in candles. Why <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> ask him whether my father and Clara had come home yet? Was I faltering in my {{resolution}} already? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There lay my hope,' said Diane, {{raising her}} head; and now, with {{glittering}} eyes and altered voice, 'How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> but hate her who had bereaved me of you; her for whose sake I could not earn your love?' ...|$|E
6000|$|My pride, {{that took}} [...] Fully easily all {{impressions}} from below, [...] Would not look up, or half despised the height [...] To which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> or <b>I</b> would <b>not</b> climb. [...] <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> breathe in that fine air.|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> did <b>not</b> {{want him}} to go on: <b>I</b> did <b>not</b> want to answer. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> feel a new spirit in him, {{something}} strange and pure and slightly frightening. He wanted something which was beyond me. And my soul was somewhere in tears, crying helplessly like an infant in the night. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> respond: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> answer. He seemed to look at me, me, an Englishman, an educated man, for corroboration. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> corroborate him. <b>I</b> knew the purity and new struggling towards birth of a true star-like spirit. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> confirm him in his utterance: my soul <b>could</b> <b>not</b> respond. <b>I</b> did <b>not</b> believe in the perfectibility of man. <b>I</b> did <b>not</b> believe in infinite harmony among men. And this was his star, this belief.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then perhaps <b>I</b> do <b>not</b> love you, Andor," [...] {{she said}} slowly, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> bear my mother's curse, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> break the pledge which I swore after Holy Communion! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> commit so great a sin, Andor, {{not even for}} your sake, for if I did remorse would break my heart, and all your love for me would not {{compensate}} me for the sin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, Tom; it is yours, {{with all}} my heart. Only, Tom, as it is so badly wanted, I would rather it was yours than Mr Rubb's. <b>Could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> do {{something}} that would make that share of the building yours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear father," [...] {{cried the}} young man [...] "you surely are not going out upon such a night. If you must have brandy <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> send Sarah for some? Please let me send Sarah; or I would go myself, or--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Herrick slowly {{rose to his}} feet; {{his heart}} throbbed hard, a hideous {{excitement}} shook him, but he was master of himself. Slowly he turned and faced Attwater and the muzzle of a pointed rifle. [...] "Why <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> do that last night?" [...] he thought.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{looked at}} it from every angle, but insurmountable {{difficulties}} seemed to be blocking the way. One thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford to do: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford to be a coward".|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides {{what can}} they tell me at this moment? They {{have gone to the}} Moors and are enjoying themselves. They asked me to go with them, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> go, because you see <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> leave Joan; though why <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> leave her, <b>I</b> really cannot understand, because Egerton has got some moors this year, and he leaves Lady Augusta with her father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> say <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> come, <b>I</b> mean <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see you; for I {{came with}} mamma {{the very day}} we heard what had happened. Mr. MacTurk then told us it was {{impossible}} to admit any stranger." ...|$|R
