5000|$|The {{beginnings}} of halakhic labour law {{are in the}} Bible, in which two commandments refer to this subject: The law against delayed wages (Lev. 19:13; Deut. 24:14-15) and the worker's right to eat the employer's crops (Deut. 23:25-26). The Talmudic law—in which labour law is called [...] "laws of worker hiring"—elaborates on many more aspects of employment relations, mainly in Tractate Baba Metzi'a. In some issues the Talamud, following the Tosefta, refers {{the parties to the}} customary law: [...] "All is as the <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> postulates". Modern halakhic labour law developed very slowly. Rabbi Israel Meir Hacohen (the Hafetz Hayim) interprets the worker's right for timely payment in a tendency that clearly favours the employee over the employer, but does not refer to new questions of employment relations. Only in the 1920s we find the first halakhic authority to tackle the questions of trade unions (that could easily be anchored in Talmudic law) and the right of strike (which is quite problematic in terms of Talmudic law). Rabbis A.I Kook and B.M.H. Uziel tend to corporatist settling of labour conflicts, while Rabbi Moshe Feinstein clearly adopts the liberal democratic collective bargaining model. Since the 1940s the halakhic literature on labour law was enriched by books and articles that referred to growing range of questions and basically adopted the liberal democratic approach.|$|E

5000|$|In 573, Emperor Xuan {{wanted to}} launch a {{campaign}} against Northern Qi to capture <b>the</b> <b>region</b> between <b>the</b> Yangtze River and the Huai River.

Emperor Xuan decided to carry out attack, and because Chunyu Liang was the senior general, most officials believed that he should command the mission. Xu Ling (徐陵), however, advocated making Wu the commanding general, pointing out that Wu was a good general and that his family was from north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yangtze and therefore he was familiar with <b>the</b> <b>customs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Emperor Xuan therefore put Wu in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main assault, while putting the general Huang Fachu (name not in Unicode) in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondary front. Wu quickly captured his home commandery (Qin Commandery). Northern Qi sent forces commanded by the general Wei Pohu (尉破胡) to try to stop Wu's advance, but Wu's subordinate Xiao Mohe defeated a group of Northern Qi's best warriors, leading to the Northern Qi army's collapse. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territory south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Huai River was quickly captured, and as Qin Commandery was Wu's home commandery, Emperor Xuan, in order to honor him, ordered him to publicly offer a sacrifice of an ox, a pig, and a sheep to his ancestors.

He captured Wang, Lu Qian (盧濳), Kezhuhun Daoyu (可朱渾道裕), and Li Taotu (李騊駼). Pi fled, and Wu captured his horses and camels. Because many of Wu's officers were Wang's subordinates and respected him, Wu became apprehensive and executed Wang, delivering the other Northern Qi officials to Jiankang. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> between <b>the</b> Yangtze and the Huai was now entirely in Chen hands, and Emperor Xuan created Wu <b>the</b> greater title <b>of</b> Duke of Nanping.

5000|$|According to Michael Hoppin Gallery, Naito {{was born}} in Tokyo in 1938. Masatoshi Naito {{graduated}} from Waseda University in applied sciences and trained as a research scientist. A keen interest in <b>the</b> folkloric traditions <b>of</b> Japan led him {{to pursue a career}} in photography. His work on <b>the</b> ethnological <b>customs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> Tohoku became <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> his seminal 70's series: Ba Ba Bakuhatsu (Grandma Explosion). Early on in his career, Naito photographed <b>the</b> mummies <b>of</b> Buddhist priests who had died fasting for <b>the</b> salvation <b>of</b> starving farmers in Dewa Sanzan and then started making photographs that focused on the folk religions and ethnology of Tohoku. In this body of work (1968-1970), Naito portrays female shamans [...] "Itako" [...] who invoke <b>the</b> spirits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead. Female Shamanism used to be a widespread phenomenon within Japan, today it is limited to this <b>region</b> where <b>the</b> more esoteric sides of Eastern religion are still practiced. These female shamans photographed starkly by Masatoshi Naito are celebrating death. They mourn the dead by performing rituals and dancing all night to evoke <b>the</b> spirits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased. These women are exuberant and celebrate death not life. Naito pays homage to this time-old tradition with his bright flash, graphically illuminating the characters he depicts. As Naito observed: [...] "The vitality of women comes from the earth. They embrace everything like goddesses and the title Ba Ba Bakuhatsu (Grandma Explosion) came to my mind naturally." [...] Tono Monogatari focuses on a similar subject matter in <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Tono, in <b>the</b> Iwate Prefecture. The title echoes that of a popular 1910 book by folklorist Yanagita Kunio. Again using an open flash and mostly working at night, Naito's images endow people and objects alike with a mystical aura. He weaves ancient tales into contemporary photographic narratives. Naito received the New Artist Award from the Japan Photo Critics Association in 1966. He participated in [...] "New Japanese Photography" [...] (<b>The</b> Museum <b>of</b> Modern Art, New York) in 1974 and [...] "Beyond Japan" [...] (London Barbican Art Centre) in 1991. He then had a solo exhibition [...] "MASATOSHI NAITO Photography and Folklore"（Kichijoji Art Museum）in 2009. Naito won second prize in the Domon Ken Award for his book Dewa Sanzan and Shugen, Kosei Publishing Co. 1982. Other books of photographs include Miira shinko no kenkyu (Study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mummy Faith), Daiwa Shobo, 1974 and Tohoku no sei to sen (Tohoku Sacred and Profane), Housei University Press, 2007.|$|R
