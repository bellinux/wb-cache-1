Gordon also explains that every time a player misuses the market to his advantage, the invisible hand of Adam Smith pushes the system to correct itself. The books tells about prominent finance personalities, such as Jacob Little, the first great Wall Street plunger; Commodore Vanderbilt, the Street's greatest tactician; Hetty Green, the [...] "richest woman in the world," [...] who was terrified of being poor; J. P.

Merrill, who brought Wall Street to Main Street and transformed both in the process.|$|E

40|$|Cradle to Cradle is a {{well-known}} sustainability concept introduced by Braungart and McDonough. It is a <b>concept</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> a product can be designed from the outset so that, after their useful lives, they will provide nourishment for something new, thus “waste equals food” (Braungart and McDonough, 2002). This eco-effective principle has been applied widely in products development; however, it is less known in the urban planning discipline where sustainable development is the main ‘key word’ in transforming the urban area. The question that this paper expands on is whether {{it is possible to}} apply the Cradle to Cradle concept into urban planning practice. This article explains the difference between the eco-efficient concept and the eco-effective concept and elaborate from there on a possibility to apply the Cradle to Cradle principle to urban planning practice. It is shown that the Cradle to Cradle principle offers an instrument for bringing complex sustainable concepts within reach of planning thinking and discussion, and for generating alternatives which may not otherwise be given serious consideration...|$|R

40|$|Naturally {{acquired}} immunity to falciparum malaria protects {{millions of people}} routinely exposed to Plasmodium falciparum infection from severe disease and death. There is no clear <b>concept</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> this protection works. There is no general agreement about the rate of onset of {{acquired immunity}} or what constitutes the key determinants of protection; much less is there a consensus regarding the mechanism(s) of protection. This review summarizes what is understood about naturally acquired and experimentally induced immunity against malaria {{with the help of}} evolving insights provided by biotechnology and places these insights in the context of historical, clinical, and epidemiological observations. We advocate that naturally acquired immunity should be appreciated as being virtually 100 % effective against severe disease and death among heavily exposed adults. Even the immunity that occurs in exposed infants may exceed 90 % effectiveness. The induction of an adult-like immune status among high-risk infants in sub-Saharan Africa would greatly diminish disease and death caused by P. falciparum. The mechanism of naturally acquired immunity that occurs among adults living in areas of hyper- to holoendemicity should be understood with a view toward duplicating such protection in infants and young children in areas of endemicity...|$|R

Although many fields have contributed to rapid progress in the fundamental knowledge of water at interfaces, detailed molecular-level understanding of water/solid interfaces comes mainly from studies on flat metal substrates. These studies have recently shown that a remarkably rich variety of structures form at the interface between water and even seemingly simple flat surfaces. In this Review we discuss the most exciting work in this area, in particular the emerging physical insight and general <b>concepts</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> water binds to metal surfaces.

40|$|Picture {{books are}} a {{frequent}} element of daily preschool activities (Damber, Nilsson & Ohlsson, 2013; Simonsson, 2004; SOU 2006 : 75). They are important pedagogical tools {{that can help}} children acquire {{an understanding of the}} everyday technology they come in contact with, as well as the human application of technology (Axell, 2015; Axell & Boström, 2015). These are skills that are emphasised in the Swedish preschool curriculum. In the curriculum it is also stated that the preschool should counteract traditional gender patterns and gender roles (Skolverket, 2010). However, an investigation of a selection of picture books aimed at preschool children shows that the books content is somewhat problematic. Many of the picture books provide a focus on the function of separate artefacts without any sort of context or explanation of their implications in a societal context. There also tends to be an emphasis on traditional masculine-coded technology in the books. Building and making and working with machines is depicted as a male activity. The male stereotype is essentially connected with different kinds of vehicles like cars, airplanes, motorbikes, tractors etc. (Axell & Boström, 2015; See also Holbrok, 2008). Based on these previous findings, the aim of this pilot study was to obtain an initial <b>concept</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> children’s literature may influence preschool children’s view on technological artefacts. The study was conducted through semi-structured interviews with four five-year-olds, two girls and two boys. Through a thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) three overarching themes were identified: The relationship between design and function, anthropomorphic animals as users of artefacts, and gender and artefacts. Some of the key findings were that the 5 -year-olds did not know what “technology” is, but had good knowledge about tools. Additionally, they did not genderise any of the artefacts included in the study...|$|R

The {{aim is to}} explore and validate the hypothesis, that a high quality visual layout exhibits a good quality hierarchical data clustering.

This scheme supports three related models of information, the underlying graph structure, the graph clustered according to some geometric attributes and, the graph represented according to some drawing mechanism. Also introduced is a method for reducing the computational complexity of a graph drawing algorithm called, force directed placement,fromO(n 2) to O(n log n). This method is adapted from an n-body hierarchical force calculation, that allows larger data sets to be draw and visualized on various levels of abstraction. Finally, this method provides the framework for the integration and testing of numerous <b>concepts</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the quality of layout and clustering are related...|$|E

Using long-term longitudinal data of deceased participants in national samples from Germany, the UK, and the US, we examine how long this period lasts.

40|$|For {{more than}} 30 years, {{researchers}} {{have focused on}} the important transition that children undergo between the ages of 3 and 5, when they start to solve mind-reading problems that require reasoning about complex mental states, such as beliefs. The main question for debate has been whether, during that transition, children acquire new <b>concepts</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the mind works (i. e. a more sophisticated 'theory of mind') or whether their more general cognitive abilities improve and help them deal with the general task demands. Recently, researchers have started to explore mind-reading abilities in individuals outside of the classic 3 - 5 age span, showing early theory of mind abilities in ever-younger children and infants, but also far from flawless performance in adults. In this article, we show how the results of these two new lines of research converge on {{the idea that there is}} more to mind reading than having theory of mind concepts: there are various processes required to efficiently implement theory of mind concepts in our reasoning, and there may be, in fact, multiple mind-reading routes available.
