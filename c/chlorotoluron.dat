40|$|The {{persistence}} and {{penetration of the}} herbicides isoproturon and <b>chlorotoluron</b> in an unconfined chalk aquifer has been monitored over a 4 -year period through soil sampling, shallow coring and groundwater monitoring. <b>Chlorotoluron</b> was applied on plots as a marker compound, having never been used previously on that, or surrounding fields. The fieldsite had a 5 degrees slope with soil depths of 0. 5 to 1. 5 m and a water table between 20 and 5 m from the soil surface. Where the water table was deepest (9 - 20 m below surface (mbs)) little or no positive herbicide detections were made. However, where the water table was at only 4 - 5 mbs, a regular pesticide signal of around 0. 1 ug/l for isoproturon and <b>chlorotoluron</b> could be distinguished. Over the winter recharge period automatic borehole samplers revealed a series of short-lived peaks of isoproturon and <b>chlorotoluron</b> reaching up to 0. 8 ug/l. This {{is consistent with a}} preferential flow mechanism operating at this particular part of the field. Such peaks were occurring over 2 years after the last application of these compounds.

40|$|The {{inheritance}} and linkage of enhanced metabolism-based herbicide cross-resistance {{was examined}} in a multiple resistant population of rigid ryegrass. F₁ hybrids between resistant and susceptible populations showed an intermediate response {{to all the}} four herbicides tested, with no indication of maternal inheritance. Segregation of F₂ families fitted a single-gene model for resistance to simazine, <b>chlorotoluron,</b> and chlorsulfuron. But {{there was more than}} the expected mortality from the low dose of tralkoxydim. Segregating F₂ populations were selected by high rates of each of the four herbicides to create selected F₂ families. Analysis of the response of these families demonstrated that simazine resistance is linked to <b>chlorotoluron</b> resistance. No other herbicide resistances were linked. Therefore, in this population of rigid ryegrass, at least three separate genes are responsible for metabolism-based cross-resistance. This study shows that multiple herbicide resistance in rigid ryegrass is the result of accumulation of a number of different resistance genes. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{ecotoxicological}} {{impact of}} nitrate-induced photodegradation products of diuron and <b>chlorotoluron</b> was studied through monospecific biotests conducted {{in conjunction with}} experiments in outdoor aquatic mesocosms. Organisms representing three trophic levels were used: two heterotrophic microorganisms, the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the ciliated protozoa Tetrahymena pyriformis, and one metazoa, the gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis. Among the variety of the phenylurea photoproducts, the N-formylated ones appeared clearly more toxic than the parent compounds towards the microorganisms, whereas the nitroderivatives showed a similar toxicity. Using photodegraded solutions of diuron, toxicity was maintained or even increased during disappearance of the initial herbicide, demonstrating {{that some of the}} photoproducts may have an impact additively or in synergy. Enzymatic biomarker assays performed on Lymnaea stagnalis exposed under monospecific conditions showed significant effects, due to the combination of nitrate with the pesticide and its photoproducts. A positive impact on snail fecundity was observed with <b>chlorotoluron</b> both under monospecific laboratory and integrated mesocosm conditions.

40|$|In a {{pear tree}} orchard planted on loam soil, each plot was treated in April 1998 with {{either one of}} the ureas diuron or <b>chlorotoluron,</b> or {{triazine}} simazine herbicides applied at 3, 4, and 2 kg AI ha(- 1), respectively. Some plots had not been previously treated {{with one of these}} herbicides. Other plots had been treated annually during the past 12 years with the same herbicide. One herbicide, and always the same, was thus applied to each plot. In the plots treated {{for the first time with}} either diuron, <b>chlorotoluron,</b> or simazine, the soil half-lives of these herbicides in the 0 - 10 cm surface soil layer were 81, 64, and 59 days, respectively. In the plots treated with the same herbicide for 12 years, the corresponding soil half-lives were 37, 11, and 46 days. Diuron thus produced a moderately enhanced biodegradation, <b>chlorotoluron</b> a high one, and simazine a low but significant one. In another pear tree orchard planted on sandy loam soil, each plot was treated in April 1998 with one of the amide propyzamide (1. 25 or 1. 0 AI kg ha(- 1)) or diflufenican (250 g AI ha(- 1)) herbicides. In the plots not previously treated with propyzamide, the propyzamide soil half-life was the same for both doses, i. e., about 30 days. In the plots treated annually for 3 or 14 years with propyzamide, the soil half-life was 12 and 10 days, respectively. In the plots treated for the first time with diflufenican and in those treated annually with diflufenican for 3 years, the diflufenican soil half-life was the same, i. e., 65 days. Propyzamide thus already showed a highly accelerated biodegradation after 3 years of repeated annual applications. Diflufenican, however, did not show enhanced biodegradation after 3 years of repeated annual applications...|$|E
40|$|In many {{agricultural}} catchments of Europe and North America, pesticides {{occur at}} generally low concentrations with significant temporal variation. This poses several challenges for both monitoring and understanding ecological risks/impacts of these chemicals. This study aimed {{to compare the}} performance of passive and spot sampling strategies given the constraints of typical regulatory monitoring. Nine pesticides were investigated in a river currently undergoing regulatory monitoring (River Ugie, Scotland). Within this regulatory framework, spot and passive sampling were undertaken to understand spatiotemporal occurrence, mass loads and ecological risks. All the target pesticides were detected in water by both sampling strategies. <b>Chlorotoluron</b> was observed to be the dominant pesticide by both spot (maximum: 111. 8 ng/l, mean: 9. 35 ng/l) and passive sampling (maximum: 39. 24 ng/l, mean: 4. 76 ng/l). The annual pesticide loads were estimated to be 2735 g and 1837 g based on the spot and passive sampling data, respectively. The spatiotemporal trend suggested that agricultural activities were {{the primary source of}} the compounds with variability in loads explained in large by timing of pesticide applications and rainfall. The risk assessment showed <b>chlorotoluron</b> and chlorpyrifos posed the highest ecological risks with 23 % of the <b>chlorotoluron</b> spot samples and 36 % of the chlorpyrifos passive samples resulting in a Risk Quotient greater than 0. 1. This suggests that mitigation measures might need to be taken to reduce the input of pesticides into the river. The overall comparison of the two sampling strategies supported the hypothesis that passive sampling tends to integrate the contaminants over a period of exposure and allows quantification of contamination at low concentration. The results suggested that within a regulatory monitoring context passive sampling was more suitable for flux estimation and risk assessment of trace contaminants which cannot be diagnosed by spot sampling and for determining if long-term average concentrations comply with specified standards.

40|$|A biotype of Lolium rigidum Gaudin (VLR 69) shows {{multiple}} {{resistance to}} at least nine dissimilar herbicide chemistries. This biotype has enhanced metabolism to herbicides that inhibit Photosystem II, acetolactate synthase, and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase. The potential for malathion and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) to act as synergists for herbicides from five different chemical classes was investigated in potted plants. Of the herbicide/synergist combinations examined, PBO only synergized <b>chlorotoluron,</b> and malathion only synergized chlorsulfuron in this resistant biotype. The ability of PBO, malathion, 1 -aminobenzotriazole (ABT), and tetcyclacis to inhibit metabolism of herbicides in vivo was also examined. ABT, PBO, and tetcyclacis inhibited metabolism of simazine and <b>chlorotoluron,</b> but malathion did not. Malathion alone inhibited metabolism of chlorsulfuron, ABT inhibited metabolism of diclofop, and none of these compounds affected tralkoxydim metabolism. These results suggest that at least four different herbicide- metabolizing enzymes have increased activity in this resistant biotype. In addition to enhanced metabolism this biotype also contains a resistant form of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase which shows 31 -, 4 -, and 20 -fold resistance to diclofop acid, fluazifop acid, and haloxyfop acid, respectively, but which shows no resistance to sethoxydim or tralkoxydim.

Laboratory tests lack environmental realism, while field trials are difficult to control. Addition of environmental complexity to laboratory systems is therefore desirable to mimic a field environment more effectively. We investigated the effect of non-UV light {{on the degradation of}} eight CPPs (<b>chlorotoluron,</b> prometryn, cinosulfuron, imidacloprid, lufenuron, propiconazole, fludioxonil, and benzovindiflupyr) by addition of non-UV light to standard OECD 307 guidelines. Time taken for 50 % degradation of benzovindiflupyr was halved from 373 to 183 days with the inclusion of light. Similarly, time taken for 90 % degradation of <b>chlorotoluron</b> decreased from 79 to 35 days under light conditions. Significant reductions in extractable parent compound occurred under light conditions for prometryn (4 %), imidacloprid (8 %), and fludioxonil (24 %) compared to dark controls. However, a significantly slower rate of cinosulfuron (14 %) transformation was observed under light compared to dark conditions. Under light conditions, nonextractable residues were significantly higher for seven of the CPPs. Soil biological and chemical analyses suggest that light stimulates phototroph growth, which may directly and/or indirectly impact CPP degradation rates. The results of this study strongly suggest that light is an important parameter affecting CPP degradation, and inclusion of light into regulatory studies may enhance their environmental realism...|$|E

40|$|Leaching {{of three}} {{pesticides}} (isoproturon, <b>chlorotoluron</b> and triasulfuron) and a tracer (bromide) were determined in four contrasting soils ranging in texture from sandy loam to clay. The compounds {{were applied to}} undisturbed columns of soil and four columns for each soil were randomly selected and leached with 24 -mm equivalent of water at prescribed time intervals (3, 9, 24, 37 and 57 d after application). A rapid decline in leached loads of isoproturon and <b>chlorotoluron</b> as time from application to irrigation increased was observed in all soils. In contrast, triasulfuron and bromide loads only decreased rapidly in the clay soil. Bromide losses decreased with decreasing clay contents of the soil and therefore with a decrease in structural development. Magnitudes of pesticide losses varied from soil to soil, depending on structural development and the organic carbon content. Pesticide degradation experiments on disturbed and undisturbed soil samples showed that the rapid decline of leached loads with time was faster than {{could be explained by}} degradation alone. Five physico-chemical processes are put forward to explain the different patterns of pesticide leached loads observed in the soils: (1) relative extent of preferential flow, (2) sorption capacity of the compounds to the different soils, (3) extent of degradation of the compounds in the soil, (4) variation in sorption kinetics between compounds associated with pesticide diffusion into soil aggregates, and (5) protection of the compounds by a combination of intra-aggregate diffusion and the presence of preferential flow pathways. ...|$|E

N 2, to degrade phenylurea herbicides, biotransformation assays were performed in mineral medium with resting cells of this soil bacterial strain on three phenylurea herbicides (diuron, <b>chlorotoluron</b> and isoproturon). Each herbicide considered, {{led to the formation of}} only one metabolite detected by HPLC analysis. After isolation, the metabolites were identified by NMR and MS, as the corresponding substituted anilines. According to the Microtox(R) test (realized on the bacterium Vibrio fischeri), these metabolites presented non-target toxicity far more important (up to 600 times higher for 4 -isopropylaniline) than the parent molecule. For isoproturon and <b>chlorotoluron,</b> the amount of substituted anilines obtained at the end of the biotransformation was very low, whereas the biotransformation of diuron into 3, 4 -dichloroaniline was almost quantitative. In this last case, the degradation product accumulated in the medium. In soil, other microorganisms are present that might degrade it. So the biotransformation of 3, 4 -dichloroaniline was then tested with four fungal strains: Aspergillus niger, Beauveria bassiana, Cunninghamella echinulata var. elegans and Mortierella isabellina. The aniline was further transformed with all the microorganisms tested. Only one metabolite was detected by HPLC analysis and after isolation, it was identified to be 3, 4 -dichloroacetanilide. This acetylated compound led to biological effects less important on V fischeri than 3, 4 -dichloroaniline. These results stress the importance of identifying the degradation products to assess the impact of a polluting agent.

In this study the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) evolution has been studied in a factorial lab experiment combining five substrates (a soil, two aged composts and their mixtures) treated with a co-application of three pesticides (azoxystrobin, <b>chlorotoluron</b> and epoxiconazole), with two extraction methods, and two incubation times (0 and 58 days). FAMEs extraction followed the microbial identification system (MIDI) and ester-linked method (EL). The pesticides showed high persistence, as revealed by half-life (t 1 / 2) values ranging from 168 to 298 days, which confirms their recalcitrance to degradation. However, t 1 / 2 values were affected by substrate and compost age down to 8 days for <b>chlorotoluron</b> in S and up to 453 days for epoxiconazole in 12 M. Fifty-six FAMEs were detected. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the EL method detected a higher number of FAMEs and unique FAMEs than the MIDI one, whereas principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted that the monosaturated 18 : 1 ω 9 c and cyclopropane 19 : 0 ω 10 c/ 19 ω 6 were the most significant FAMEs grouping by extraction method. The cyclopropyl to monoenoic acids ratio evidenced higher stress conditions when pesticides were applied to compost and compost+soil than solely soil, {{as well as with}} final time.

Similarity dendrograms showed that the microbial community structures of the herbicide-treated and nontreated soils were Significantly different, Moreover, the bacterial diversity seemed to decrease in sops treated with urea herbicides, and sequence determination of several DGGE fragments showed that the most affected species in the soils treated with diuron and linuron belonged to an uncultivated bacterial group, As well as the 16 S rDNA fingerprints, the substrate utilization patterns of the microbial communities were compared, Principal-component analysis performed on BIOLOG data showed that the functional abilities of the soil microbial communities were, altered by the application of the herbicides. In addition, enrichment cultures of the different soils in medium with the urea herbicides as the sole carbon and nitrogen source showed that {{there was no difference between}} treated and nontreated soil in the rate of transformation of diuron and <b>chlorotoluron</b> but that there was a strong difference in the case of linuron, In the enrichment cultures with linuron-treated soil, linuron disappeared completely after 1 week whereas no significant transformation aas observed in cultures inoculated with nontreated soil even after 4 weeks, In conclusion, this study showed that both the structure and metabolic potential of soil microbial communities were clearly affected by a long-term application of urea herbicides...|$|E

There was a tendency for slower degradation of cyanazine and bentazone in soil aggregates of 3 to 5 mm in diameter (DT 50 at 15 degrees C and 40 % maximum water holding capacity of 25. 1 and 58. 2 d, where DT 50 is the time for 50 % decline of the initial pesticide concentration) than in soil sieved to < 3 mm (DT 50 of 19. 1 and 37. 6 d), but the differences were not significant for most datasets. Degradation of cyanazine, isoproturon [3 (4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea], and <b>chlorotoluron</b> [3 -(3 -chloro-p-tolyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea] was measured in soil amended with different amounts of lignin. The effect of lignin on degradation was small despite considerable differences in sorption.

The enrichment culture isolated from treated soil showed specific degradation activity towards methoxy-methyl urea herbicides, such as linuron and metobromuron, while dimethyl urea herbicides, such as diuron, <b>chlorotoluron,</b> and isoproturon, were not transformed. The putative metabolic intermediates of linuron and metobromuron, the aniline derivatives 3, 4 -dichloroaniline and 4 -bromoaniline, were also degraded. The temperature of incubation drastically affected degradation of the aniline derivatives. Whereas linuron was transformed at 28 and 37 degreesC, 3, 4 -dichloroaniline was transformed only at 28 degreesC. Monitoring the enrichment process by reverse transcription-PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that a mixture of bacterial species under adequate physiological conditions was required to completely transform linuron, This research indicates that for biodegradation of linuron, several years of adaptation have led to selection of a bacterial consortium capable of completely transforming linuron, Moreover, several of the putative species appear to be difficult to culture since they were detectable by DGGE but were not culturable on agar plates...|$|E

This was followed by forced isotope exchange where the sorbed 14 C material was desorbed by adding an excess of non-radiolabelled compound. Experiments were concluded with solvent extraction and soil combustion to determine remaining radioactivity. The pesticide-soil systems took around four months to approach sorption equilibrium, resulting in strong asymmetry between the profiles of exchange for isotopes of all three compounds.

A fraction of sorbed pesticide is also often reported to bind irreversibly to the soil matrix. This {{has important implications for}} pesticide mobility and bioavailability. It is essential to understand sorption phenomena to allow accurate prediction of pesticide fate within the soil environment. This thesis describes the result of applying a sequential extraction procedure, based on the principles of isotope or “self-exchange”, to nine pesticide/soil systems. The significance of irreversible sorption in controlling pesticide mobility was assessed using isotope exchange (12 C and 14 C) to characterise pesticide exchange kinetics in-situ over protracted time-scales. Sequential extraction increased in harshness in the order: isotope exchange prometryn (≤ 1. 35 ± 0. 60 %) > hexaconazole (≤ 0. 50 ± 0. 06 %). Varying the soil composition had little effect on amounts of irreversibly sorbed pesticide, probably due to the small amounts of irreversible sorption observed overall. These results suggest {{that the vast majority of}} sorbed <b>chlorotoluron,</b> prometryn and hexaconazole (in the parent form) participated in very slow but reversible binding, a result also confirmed by the three-site sorption model. Pesticide sorption behaviour is a complex process. Although sorption phenomena are still not fully understood, these results provide a greater insight into the significance of irreversible binding for predicting pesticide fate.

40|$|Herbicide-resistant weeds are a {{constraint}} to weed {{management in}} many cropping regions around the world. Of the numerous populations of weeds with resistance to herbicides, {{it appears that}} most have resistance due to an alteration to the target enzyme. Use of herbicides with alternative modes of action has relatively easily controlled these populations. In stark contrast are a much smaller number of populations with resistance due to increased rates of herbicide detoxification. These populations may be cross-resistant to herbicides with other modes of action. Such cross-resistance can severely compromise weed control because alternative herbicides may fail on their first use. It has proved extremely difficult to predict cross-resistance due to increased herbicide detoxification in weed populations and hence, difficult to provide adequate advice to growers on how to avoid or manage the problem. Most commonly, such cross-resistance has been selected by certain aryloxyphenoxypropanoate herbicides such as diclofop-methyl and phenylurea herbicides such as <b>chlorotoluron</b> and isoproturon; however, other herbicides can also act as selecting agents {{for this type of}} resistance. Illustrative examples from rigid ryegrass in Australia and blackgrass in Europe demonstrate the breadth of the problem and the magnitude of the effort required to understand increased herbicide detoxification as a resistance mechanism. Recent work has elucidated the genetic basis of cross-resistance in some populations, but this has so far not provided new predictive tools useful to growers. Despite {{more than a decade of}} research aimed at unraveling the complexities of cross-resistance due to increased herbicide detoxification, management of these cross-resistant populations remains a significant challenge...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{studies were}} carried out to {{investigate}} solute leaching at different times from application in relation to temperature and initial soil moisture. Aggregates of a heavy clay soil were treated with a non-interactive solute (bromide) and the herbicides <b>chlorotoluron,</b> isoproturon and triasulfuron. The soil was incubated at 90 % field capacity and either 5 or 15 oC. The influence of application to initially dry and initially wet aggregates on the behaviour of isoproturon was also investigated. At intervals, samples were either leached in small columns, centrifuged to characterise the fraction of chemical available in pore water under natural moisture conditions or extracted with organic solvents to assess total residues in soil. Bromide concentrations in leachate and in pore water extracted by centrifugation were constant with time. In contrast, availability for leaching and concentration in pore water of the herbicides decreased with increasing time from application in soil incubated at 15 oC. The effect of residence time was much smaller at 5 than at 15 oC. At the higher temperature, pesticide concentrations in leachate and pore water declined faster than would be expected from degradation alone, probably due to slow diffusion of the pesticides into soil aggregates where they are less available for leaching and/or slow sorption-desorption. The faster decline in availability for leaching at 15 than at 5 oC was attributed to faster degradation of the readily available fraction. There was no significant influence of initial soil moisture on either the leaching behaviour of isoproturon or its availability in soil water...|$|E
40|$|The use of crop {{protection}} products (CPPs) is essential to improve crop production levels and feed the rising global population. Safety testing of CPPs is also essential {{to ensure that their}} use does not adversely affect human health or the environment. Currently, laboratory-based studies typically over-estimate the environmental persistence of CPPs in the environment. The inclusion of environmental variables that are currently omitted from laboratory studies, such as non-UV light, could reduce the disparity between laboratory and field degradation studies. The inclusion of light resulted in a significant reduction in extractable parent compound for benzovindiflupyr, <b>chlorotoluron,</b> prometryn, imidacloprid, and fludioxonil compared to dark conditions. In contrast, a significantly slower rate of cinosulfuron transformation was observed under light compared to dark conditions. In a separate experiment, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism showed that under light conditions, the soil surface (0 - 3 mm) harboured distinct phototroph, bacterial and fungal communities compared to the underlying bulk soil (3 - 12 mm), or dark incubated soil. 454 pyrosequencing revealed that light selected for diazotrophs at the soil surface, including Nostoc punctiforme, in addition to heterotrophic bacteria, particularly within the phylum Firmicutes. Metatranscriptomic analysis showed that light also selected for actively transcribing photosynthetic eukaryotes at the soil surface, such as Chlorophyceae and Saccharomycetes, in addition to heterotrophs, such as Nostocaceae. Finally, light selected for major soil functions such as photosynthesis, and reduced the alpha and beta diversity of predicted protein coding regions at the soil surface. This work has important implications for CPP regulatory studies and soil surface management practice...|$|E
40|$|A new {{analytical}} procedure using a two-step sample preconcentration (solid-phase extraction (SPE) and field-amplified sample stacking) prior to separation by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography {{was developed for}} the determination of 14 pesticides such as aldicarb, carbofuran, isoproturon, <b>chlorotoluron,</b> metolachlor, mecoprop, dichlorprop, MCPA, 2, 4 -D, methoxychlor, TDE, DDT, dieldrin, and DDE in drinking water. Good recoveries of pesticides were obtained using SPE with sample pH adjusted to 2 - 3. Field-amplified sample stacking was found to give enrichment factors up to 30 -fold preconcentration of various pesticides under reversed polarity at - 2 kV for 50 s. The optimized background electrolyte (BGE) consisted of 50 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mM borate buffer, 15 mM β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), and 22 % acetonitrile at pH 9. 6, running was under 25 kV and detection at 202 nm. Good linearity was obtained for all pesticides with detection limits down to 0. 04 - 0. 46 ng/mL and a working range of 0. 1 - 40 ng/mL. The repeatabilities of migration time and peak area were satisfactory with relative standard deviations (RSDs) between 0. 66 and 13. 6 % and 4. 1 and 28 %, respectively. All pesticides except dieldrin {{were found to be}} detected at concentrations at least tenfold lower than the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline values. The {{analytical procedure}} developed offers an economic method for fast screening of multiple pesticide residues in drinking water for health protection.

40|$|Compost biobeds {{can promote}} {{biodegradation}} of pesticides. The microbial community structure changes during the composting process, and simple methods can potentially {{be used to}} follow these changes. In this study the microbial identification (MIDI) and ester-linked (EL) procedures {{were used to determine}} the composition of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in composts aged 3 and 12 months, inoculated with 3 recalcitrant pesticides (azoxystrobin, <b>chlorotoluron,</b> and epoxyconazole and a coapplication of all three) after 0, 56, and 125 days of degradation. Pesticide persistence was high, and after 125 days the residue was 22 to 70 % of the applied amount depending mostly on the composting age. Seventy-one FAMEs belonging to nine groups were detected. The EL method provided three times as many detections as did the MIDI method and was more sensitive for all FAME groups except alcohol. Thirty-six and five FAMEs were unique to the EL and MIDI methods, respectively. The extraction method was of importance. The EL method provided a higher number of detections for 57 FAMEs, and the MIDI method provided a higher number for 9 FAMEs, while the two methods were equal for 5 FAMEs; thus, the EL method provided a more uniform overall FAME profile. Effects of the other factors were not always clear. Inoculation with pesticide did not influence the FAME profile with the MIDI method, while it influenced cyclopropane and monounsaturated content with the EL method. Composting age and degradation time had an effect on some groups of FAMEs, and this effect was greater with the EL method. The use of some FAMEs as biomarkers to follow microbial community succession was likely influenced by the type of compost and other factor...|$|E

Phenyl urea herbicide data is available for twelve sites in the Humber catchment within 1994 to 1995 and 1994 to 1997 and for three sites on the Tweed catchment within 1995. Phenoxy acid herbicide data is available for six sites (S 1, U 3, N 4, W 5 and O 6) over the period December 1994 to September 1995, for 7 sites (S 2, D 7, A 8, C 9, D 10, T 11 and O 12) over the period December 1994 to February 1997 and 3 sites (TW 13, TW 14 and TW 15) over the period January 1995 to September 1995. Attempts were made to sample the sites at weekly intervals. However sampling was halted for short periods when {{it was not possible to}} process the samples quickly. Linuron dissolved was only measured from April 1994 - October 1994. Samples were collected in chromic acid-washed 1 litre glass bottles. Herbicide levels were concentrated before being measured using High Performance Liquid Chromatography for Phenyl urea herbicides and Gas Chromatography for Phenoxy acid herbicides.

40|$|International audienceDiuron {{was found}} to be mineralized in buffer strip soil (BS) and in the sediments (SED) of the Morcille river in the Beaujolais {{vineyard}} repeatedly treated with this herbicide. Enrichment cultures from BS and SED samples led to the isolation of three bacterial strains transforming diuron to 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA) its aniline derivative. 16 S rRNA sequencing revealed that they belonged to the genus Arthrobacter (99 % of similarity to Arthrobacter globiformis strain K 01 - 01) and were designated as Arthrobacter sp. BS 1, BS 2 and SED 1. Diuron-degrading potential characterized by sequencing of the puhA gene, characterizing the diuron-degradaing potential, revealed 99 % similarity to A. globiformis strain D 47 puhA gene isolated a decade ago in the UK. These isolates were also able to use <b>chlorotoluron</b> for their growth. Although able to degrade linuron and monolinuron to related aniline derivatives they were not growing on them. Enrichment cultures led to the isolation of a strain from the sediments entirely degrading 3, 4 -DCA. 16 S rRNA sequence analysis showed that it was affiliated to the genus Achromobacter (99 % of similarity to Achromobacter sp. CH 1) and was designated as Achromobacter sp. SP 1. The dcaQ gene encoding enzyme responsible for the transformation of 3, 4 -DCA to chlorocatechol was found in SP 1 with 99 % similarity to that of Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7. This isolate also used for its growth a range of anilines (3 -chloro- 4 -methyl-aniline, 4 -isopropylaniline, 4 -chloroaniline, 3 -chloroaniline, 4 -bromoaniline). The mixed culture composed of BS 2 and SP 1 strains entirely mineralizes 14 C-diuron to 14 CO 2. Diuron-mineralization observed in the enrichment culture could result from the metabolic cooperation between these two populations...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{time-dependent}} sorption {{of pesticides}} in soil aggregates. We tested if the sorption kinetics of pesticides in soil aggregates {{can be described}} by modeling diffusion into aggregates {{for a range of}} soils and pesticides. Our hypothesis is that the rate of sorption is negatively related to sorption strength due to retardated diffusion. Natural aggregates of 3 - 5 mm diameter were separated from three soils: a clay, a silty clay loam, and a clay loam. The aggregates werestabilized with alginate gel, and adsorption of azoxystrobin, <b>chlorotoluron,</b> and atrazine was measured in batch experiments with eight equilibration times up to 28 days. Equilibrium sorption appeared to be reached within the 28 -day period for each pesticide. An intra-aggregate diffusion model was employed to describe the increase of sorption with time. The model describes diffusion of the dissolved pesticides through the pore space inside the aggregates and sorption on internal surfaces. Sorption could be described by pore diffusion into the aggregates with diffusion coefficients between 0. 5 × 10 - 10 and 1. 5 × 10 - 10 m 2 s- 1. The model fits support the theory that pore diffusion is the rate-limiting process for sorption of pesticides in aggregates, although the diffusion coefficients were a factor 3 - 10 smaller than the theoretical diffusion coefficient for diffusion in water. Comparing the results from the different pesticide - soil combinations showed that the extent of nonequilibrium increased with increasing sorption strength. This confirmed that sorption takes longer to reach equilibrium for pesticides and soils with stronger sorption. The differences between the different pesticides and soils were fully accounted for in the model by stronger retardation of the more strongly sorbed pesticides. The results imply that diffusion into aggregates may be the major time-limiting process for sorption of pesticides in structured soils. Commonly performed sorption experiments with sieved soil fail to account for this process. © 2009 American Chemical Society. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Although {{macropore}} flow {{is recognized}} as an important process for the transport of pesticides through {{a wide range of}} soils, none of the existing spatially distributed methods for assessing the risk of pesticide leaching to groundwater account for this phenomenon. The present paper presents a spatially distributed modelling system for predicting pesticide losses to groundwater through micro- and macropore flow paths. The system combines a meta version of the mechanistic, dual porosity, preferential flow pesticide leaching model MACRO (the MACRO emulator), which describes pesticide transport and attenuation in the soil zone, to an attenuation factor leaching model for the unsaturated zone. The development of the emulator was {{based on the results of}} over 4000 MACRO model simulations. Model runs describe pesticide leaching for the range of soil types, climate regimes, pesticide properties and application patterns in England and Wales. Linking the MACRO emulator to existing spatial databases of soil, climate and compound-specific loads allowed the prediction of the concentration of pesticide leaching from the base of the soil profile (at 1 m depth) for a wide range of pesticides. Attenuation and retardation of the pesticide during transit through the unsaturated zone to the watertable was simulated using the substrate attenuation factor model AQUAT. The MACRO emulator simulated pesticide loss in 10 of 12 lysimeter soil-pesticide combinations for which pesticide leaching was shown to occur and also successfully predicted no loss from 3 soil-pesticide combinations. Although the qualitative aspect of leaching was satisfactorily predicted, actual pesticide concentrations in leachate were relatively poorly predicted. At the national scale, the linked MACRO emulator / AQUAT system was found to predict the relative order of, and realistic regional patterns of, pesticide leaching for atrazine, isoproturon, <b>chlorotoluron</b> and lindane. The methodology provides a first-step assessment of the potential for pesticide leaching to groundwater in England and Wales. Further research is required to improve the modelling concept proposed. The system can be used to refine regional groundwater monitoring system designs and sampling strategies and improve the cost-effectiveness of the measures needed to achieve “good status” of groundwater quality as required by the Water Framework Direc...|$|E
