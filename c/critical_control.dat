Too often health is seen as being hard to manage because it may relate to chronic and/or extended exposure to harm. However proper application of risk management techniques including focussing on <b>critical</b> <b>controls</b> and the continued effectiveness of these controls works as well on occupational health issues as it does on safety issues. This paper will demonstrate that risk management can be successfully applied to health issues including respirable dust, fatigue and psychological impairment.

25|$|A <b>critical</b> <b>control</b> point (CCP) is a point, step, or {{procedure}} {{in a food}} manufacturing process at which control can be applied and, as a result, a food safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to an acceptable level.|$|E
25|$|The HACCP {{regulation}} {{requires that}} all plants maintain certain documents, including its hazard analysis and written HACCP plan, and records documenting the monitoring of <b>critical</b> <b>control</b> points, critical limits, verification activities, and {{the handling of}} processing deviations. Implementation involves monitoring, verifying, and validating of the daily work that is compliant with regulatory requirements in all stages all the time.

25|$|Up {{to half of}} the world's {{population}} is infected by toxoplasmosis but have no symptoms.G9a {{appears to be a}} <b>critical</b> <b>control</b> point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of ΔFosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while ΔFosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation.}} Widespread histone–lysine acetylation in cortical astrocytes appears to be another epigenetic mechanism employed by T. gondii.|$|E

2500|$|NASA's own {{requirements}} for <b>critical</b> <b>control</b> points (CCP) in engineering management {{would be used}} as a guide for food safety. CCP derived from failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) from NASA via the munitions industry to test weapon and engineering system reliability. Using that information, NASA and Pillsbury required contractors to identify [...] "critical failure areas" [...] and eliminate them from the system, a first in the food industry then. Baumann, a microbiologist by training, was so pleased with Pillsbury's experience in the space program that he advocated for his company to adopt what would become HACCP at Pillsbury.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, Pillsbury {{was confronted}} with a food safety issue of its own when glass {{contamination}} was found in farina, a cereal commonly used in infant food. Baumann's leadership promoted HACCP in Pillsbury for producing commercial foods, and applied to its own food production. This led to a panel discussion at the 1971 National Conference on Food Protection that included examining CCPs and good manufacturing practices in producing safe foods. Several botulism cases were attributed to under-processed low-acid canned foods in 1970–71. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked Pillsbury to organize and conduct a training program on the inspection of canned foods for FDA inspectors. This 21-day program was first held in September 1972 with 11 days of classroom lecture and 10 days of canning plant evaluations. Canned food regulations (21 CFR 108, 21 CFR 110, 21 CFR 113, and 21 CFR 114) were first published in 1969. Pillsbury's training program to the FDA in 1969, titled [...] "Food Safety through the Hazard Analysis and <b>Critical</b> <b>Control</b> Point System", {{was the first time}} that HACCP was used.|$|E
2500|$|Hazard {{analysis}} and <b>critical</b> <b>control</b> points or HACCP (...) is a systematic preventive approach to food safety from biological, chemical, and physical hazards in production processes {{that can cause}} the finished product to be unsafe, and designs measurements to reduce these risks to a safe level. In this manner, HACCP attempts to avoid hazards rather than attempting to inspect finished products {{for the effects of}} those hazards. The HACCP system can be used at all stages of a food chain, from food production and preparation processes including packaging, distribution, etc. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) require mandatory HACCP programs for juice and meat as an effective approach to food safety and protecting public health. Meat HACCP systems are regulated by the USDA, while seafood and juice are regulated by the FDA. All other food companies in the United States that are required to register with the FDA under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, as well as firms outside the US that export food to the US, are transitioning to mandatory hazard {{analysis and}} risk-based preventive controls (HARPC) plans.|$|E
