5|$|In 1946, the French army {{ceased to}} use the Mérens for drawing {{artillery}} in the mountains, and this <b>corresponded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beginning {{of the decline of}} the breed. The population fell dramatically {{during the second half of}} the 20th century, due to the modernization and mechanization of transport and agriculture. In 1950 in Senegal, the Mérens was used in attempts to create a horse tougher than the native M'Bayar, but the breeding program was not enough to significantly increase the Mérens population. The use of the Mérens in agriculture continued into the 1970s, and like many French draft breeds, it was also bred for slaughter to produce horse meat. The mountains of Ariege acted as a sanctuary, preventing the Mérens, as well as other breeds such as Gascon cattle and Tarasconnaise sheep, from disappearing completely. By the early 1970s, however, the Mérens was on the verge of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The State Trunkline Highway System {{was created}} on May 13, 1913, by {{an act of}} the Michigan Legislature; at the time, none of the system's {{divisions}} <b>corresponded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> modern I-69 either. In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) was required to signpost the highway system for the first time, and the state become the second after Wisconsin to do so. At the time, two different highways followed sections of the modern I-69 corridor. The original M-29 ran from the Indiana state line north to Charlotte and turned northeasterly to Lansing. The second highway was M-21 from Flint east to Goodells, a community west of Port Huron; the highway was extended to Port Huron by 1924.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} shot in one day in January 2009 in Nashville, Tennessee. Frolicking scenes between Swift and Colletti were filmed first; the lunch, outdoor, and indoor scenes followed. Coincidentally, {{on the day of}} filming, it rained heavily, {{something}} which Swift was enlightened by, since it <b>corresponded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> video's gloomy and dark feel. Swift said it aided in making the video less colorful lighting-wise, and more fixated on muted tones. The last scenes were more difficult for Swift because they involved crying. She attributed the difficulty to the number of people surrounding her and watching, something she was not accustomed to. However, Fanjoy, who was once an actress, guided her into thinking about what made her most solemn, and completing the scene effectively. Fanjoy said the scenes demonstrated what an exceptional actress Swift was, adding she took direction very well. The scene took approximately three hours to film.|$|E
5|$|When the UCI {{released}} {{its list of}} teams graded according to their hierarchy that decided who would receive a World Tour license, this team's signees put them at the top, making them world number one before they even existed.

Whether intentionally or incidentally, this <b>corresponded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> initial financial guarantee Becca put up for the team. Nygaard hailed the license acquisition as the fruition of many months of hard work. This afforded the team automatic invitations to all World Tour events, including the season's three Grand Tours.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signed in 1919, five {{separate}} highways were designated along US25's general route {{from the state}} line north through Detroit and Port Huron to Port Austin. From the state line north to Monroe, the roadway was given the first M-56 designation. From there northward, there was no state highway that <b>corresponded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future US25, but the first M-10 followed the future US24 into the Detroit area. Near Dearborn, M-10 ran further inland than the future US25 and included a concurrency with M-17 into Detroit. From Detroit northward, Gratiot Avenue was assigned the M-19 number into the Port Huron area. Through downtown Port Huron, the future US25 was numbered as the first M-27 and along the lakeshore north to Harbor Beach, the highway was M-31. From Harbor Beach into Port Austin, M-27 took over the route.|$|E

Service {{on the line to}} the Rockaways across Jamaica Bay was halted due to the 1950 fire on the Jamaica Bay trestle, and the LIRR sold the line to New York City due to its bankruptcy. The LIRR maintained service on the northern half of the line until 1962 while the NYCTA began operating subway service on the southern half in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reproductive heritability and {{the origin of}} new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis. In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements (later known as genes). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory. August Weismann made the important distinction between germ cells {{that give rise to}} gametes (such as sperm and egg cells) and the somatic cells of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only. Hugo de Vries connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cells structure. De Vries {{was also one of the}} researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits <b>corresponded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and Mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled.|$|E
5|$|With the {{hurricane}} situated {{to the southwest}} of the Hawaiian Islands, Hurricane Hunters conducted several weather reconnaissance missions into the storm.

At the time, Uleki displayed a well-organized, tight circulation. The hurricane meandered in the same general area {{over the next two}} days, executing several small loops, with a slight northward drift. During this time, its circulation increased in coverage but became less-organized as weakening ensued. Increased wind shear and restricted outflow took their toll on {{the hurricane}}. The cyclone's winds dropped to 80mph (130km/h) by 12:00UTC on September4 as it resumed its west-northwest track under the influence of a subtropical ridge away from the Hawaiian Islands. Uleki passed roughly halfway between Johnston Atoll and the French Frigate Shoals on September5. By September7, the weakened trend halted and environmental conditions favored reintensification. As Uleki neared the International Dateline, it regained winds of 105mph (165km/h).|$|E
