50|$|The Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) Fraud Unit is {{the state}} law {{enforcement}} agency responsible for enforcing laws relating to fraudulent insurance acts In the United States, insurance fraud {{is the second most}} costly white-collar crime next to tax evasion. TDI Fraud Unit criminal investigators work on a variety of cases; for example, <b>claimant</b> <b>fraud,</b> workers' compensation fraud, insurer fraud, life settlement fraud, and mortgage fraud. TDI Fraud Unit criminal investigators are licensed state of Texas peace officers, have full state police powers (armed, make arrests, and conduct investigations into violation of state laws), and have statewide jurisdiction. Fraud Unit criminal investigators specialize in financial crime and regularly conduct joint investigations with city, county, other state (DPS, Attorney General's Office), and federal law enforcement (FBI, IRS-CID, United States Postal Inspection Service, US Government OIGs, etc.), and other government agencies. Once a TDI Fraud Unit criminal investigator has completed a criminal investigation, the case is referred to a County, District and/or U.S. Attorney in order to seek indictment and prosecution. The TDI Fraud Unit employs criminal investigators, prosecutors, and crime analysts.|$|E
50|$|The CDI {{is charged}} with {{responsibility}} for investigating and arresting those who commit insurance fraud, {{in order to protect}} the public from loss and distress. Claimant, agent, and insurance company fraud is investigated and prosecuted by the agency. The agency maintains criminal investigators in many parts of the state. Investigators from the CDI work closely with the internal investigators at insurance companies in cases of suspected <b>claimant</b> and agent <b>fraud.</b> After concluding an investigation, the CDI will either close the case or refer the matter to the prosecuting agency in the jurisdiction where the alleged misconduct occurred.|$|R
40|$|This article {{summarizes}} the authors’ recommended reforms {{to the law}} of promissory fraud. These recommendations are presented as a Draft Prestatement of the Law of Insincere Promising. The basic propositions of the Prestatement are taken, with some modification, from the authors’ book, Insincere Promises: The Law of Misrepresented Intent (2005). This article adds extensive comments, {{in the style of the}} Restatements, and a prose introduction identifying three reforms we deem most important. First, courts should drop their insistence that every promise represents an intent to perform, and treat that representation instead as a default. Second, courts faced with claims of promissory fraud should pay more attention to scienter. This means both that promissory <b>fraud</b> <b>claimants</b> should be required to produce separate evidence of intent or recklessness, and that courts should recognize the largely overlooked possibility of negligent promissory misrepresentation. Finally, courts should acknowledge that promissory representations of intent are material only because they say something about the objective probability of performance, and should interpret a representation of intent to perform as saying, absent evidence to the contrary, that there is at least a fifty-percent chance that the promisor will perform...|$|R
