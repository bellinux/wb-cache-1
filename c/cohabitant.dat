40|$|ABSTRACT General Comment 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights asks {{states to}} {{recognize}} and protect all families but leaves {{how to do this}} to state discretion. It is silent on whether all families must be protected equally in all circumstances. Often, states make normative distinction between unmarried <b>cohabitants</b> and married spouses such that <b>cohabitants</b> are normally not given the quality of rights and protections guaranteed to married spouses (Barlow et al, 2005). Whereas some researchers found that this situation creates disadvantages for <b>cohabitants</b> and argued for equal treatment of <b>cohabitants</b> and married spouses in all matters of concern to the family, others would like to preserve the usual strict distinctions between them. My thesis uses Ghana’s intestate succession law as primary data to take a mid-way position in this debate. It proposes a context specific approach to assessing issues of interest to the family taking into consideration the human rights implications so as to determine how appropriate it is to distinguish between <b>cohabitants</b> and married spouses. This suggests that human rights concerns should normally determine the essence of differential treatment to avoid discrimination against <b>cohabitants...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the variety of}} ways state legal systems in the United States treat cohabitation, both by same-sex and heterosexual couples. The different approaches are described along a spectrum that ranges from one extreme, under which <b>cohabitants</b> have essentially no rights against one another or against third parties, to the other extreme, under which <b>cohabitants</b> are {{to be treated as}} though they were married under state law. Different areas of law are discussed, including the rights of <b>cohabitants</b> both against one another (remedies upon dissolution, inheritance) and against third parties, such as state benefits, tort claims, health-related benefits, and rights concerning children. The article concludes with speculations concerning why the remedies offered to <b>cohabitants</b> in the United States are so limited, as compared with other countries. The legal treatment of cohabitation in the United States has been radically and rapidly transformed during {{the first few years of}} the twenty-first century.

Forty-two cohabitating males and 39 cohabitating females lived together without marriage an average for 14 months, their average age was 24. 0 for males and 22. 5 for females. The above <b>cohabitants</b> were compared with control groups for personality differences. The control groups consisted of unmarried single individuals with no cohabitation experience. There were 85 males and 81 females, the average age was 25. 1 for males and 23. 5 for females. Subject and control groups were {{selected on the basis of}} demographic and sociological background to obtain subjects from similar populations. All subjects were administered a questionnaire and the California Psychological Inventory (CPI). For both males and females, 19 of the 36 comparisons on the CPI reached significance at or beyond the. 05 level. Five of the scales reached significance at or beyond. 01 level. The overall trend of the data supports the hypothesis that the CPI differenciates <b>cohabitants</b> from non-cohabitants. <b>Cohabitants</b> scored significantly higher on: Self-acceptance, Sociability, Tolerance, and Flexibility. There was no significant difference on the Dominance scale. In addition, the CPI significantly differentiates <b>cohabitants</b> from non-cohabitants on Socialization, Good-Impression (negative relation), Achievement via Independence, Psychological Mindedness, and Femininity scale. Male <b>cohabitants</b> are significantly more feminine than their control group, and female <b>cohabitants</b> are significantly less feminine than their non-cohabitating peers...|$|R
40|$|Background Secondhand smoke (SHS) {{represents}} a major preventable cause of morbidity for communities, especially for children, {{who are more}} susceptible than adults to the adverse effects of passive smoking. SHS contains several carcinogens, including benzene. Objective To investigate the role of household characteristics and the smoking behaviours of <b>cohabitants</b> in predicting SHS-derived benzene exposure levels. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 122 children (aged 5 - 11 years old) were selected from a school in rural Italy. Characteristics of their home environment and the smoking habits of the children's <b>cohabitants</b> were obtained via questionnaire, and urinary unmodified benzene (u-UB) and cotinine (a specific nicotine metabolite) levels were determined from spot urine samples. Results Significant differences between SHS-exposed and SHS-unexposed children were found with respect to u-UB levels (median values 359. 50 and 92. 50 ng/litre, respectively; p < 0. 001). The excretion of u-UB increased significantly in parallel to increased SHS exposure as follows: unexposed to SHS (median value 92. 50 ng/litre) < <b>cohabitant(s)</b> smoker(s) not smoking inside the home (282. 00 ng/litre) < <b>cohabitant(s)</b> smoking inside the home only when children are out (314. 50 ng/litre) < <b>cohabitant(s)</b> smoking inside the home even when children are in (596. 00 ng/litre). The difference between groups was significant (p = 0. 019). Conclusions Although smoke-free legislation has transformed the smoking behaviours of some, domestic environments remain {{an important source of}} SHS exposure for children. This fact holds true even in the case of parents and other <b>cohabitants</b> who believe they are fully protecting children by smoking only outdoors or at home only when the children are not present. These findings should be included in Italian community-level health promotion interventions for discouraging tobacco use...|$|R

40|$|The {{incidence}} of cohabitation and births outside marriage in France {{is similar to}} that in England and Wales. Although they have traditionally adopted very different approaches to family law, their response to the phenomenon of cohabitation has traditionally been surprisingly similar. In both, the law has developed piecemeal, leaving <b>cohabitants</b> with inadequate legal remedies, and the article first compares the current law in the two jurisdictions. However, the French government has now demonstrated its willingness to confront the legal needs of <b>cohabitants.</b> Proposed French legislation both acknowledges a legal status of cohabitation - whether heterosexual or homosexual and in addition will permit all unmarried <b>cohabitants</b> to enter into a civil union contract known as a PACS. This will approximate their position more closely to that of married couples for all purposes, including social security benefits, inheritance, maintenance and property division on relationship breakdown. In contrast, the British Government's Consultation Document Supporting Families (1998) virtually ignores the needs of <b>cohabitants</b> focusing instead on strengthening marriage. The article goes on, therefore, to analyse and contrast the impact of this new divergence in approach between the two jurisdictions, and assesses its significance in the light of reforms being implemented elsewhere in Europe...|$|R

The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of <b>Cohabitants</b> Act 2010 gives some rights to unmarried <b>cohabitants</b> (under this act same-sex couples can enter into civil partnerships, while long term unmarried couples - both heterosexual and same sex - who have not registered their relation have some limited rights and obligations).|$|R

Since cohabitation levels are increasing across Europe, understanding the role of union status in welfare state policies is increasingly important. By analysing data from the European Social Survey and a self-constructed policy database, we answer three questions: (1) How many couples live in cohabitation across 12 European countries today? (2) Which rights do they have in different policy areas? and (3) How many couples, therefore, are covered or fall outside the scope of policies in their country? We find that cohabitation is often, but not always, more strongly regulated in countries with high cohabitation levels, leaving more <b>cohabitants</b> legally unprotected in some countries than in other...|$|R
