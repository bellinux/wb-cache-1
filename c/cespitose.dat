50|$|It {{occurs in}} either corymbose or <b>cespitose</b> colonies {{consisting}} of interlocking branches, each locked to three other branches. Its thin branches contain {{a large number}} of corallites considerably contributing to their widths. Radial corallites of the species are tube-shaped and built into the branches, with nariform obvious tips. Its axial corallites are also tubular. Branches have blue, cream, pink or purple branch tips, and the species is either cream, pale brown or white in colour. It has a similar appearance to Acropora kimbeensis and Acropora plantaginea.|$|E
50|$|Both {{species are}} <b>cespitose</b> (the fronds arising from a central point as a clump rather than along a rhizome). The {{deciduous}} fronds are light yellow-green, 20 - 90 cm long and 5 - 25 cm broad. Sori appear as dots {{on the underside}} of the frond, 1-6 per pinnule. They are covered by a prominently whitish to brown reniform (kidney-shaped) indusium. Fronds are very dissected, being 3-pinnate. The stipe may bear long, pale brown, papery scales at the base. The spores are yellow on A. angustum and dark brown on A. asplenioides.|$|E
50|$|It is {{characterized}} by a <b>cespitose</b> growth with secondary stems, also called ramicauls, with the triangular upper section, wider in the base that in the leaf, subsessile inflorescence with few or many flowers, floral segments often thick, or slightly pubescents or papilloses in a group of more fibrous and resistant plants, with canaliculate ramicauls without wings or with narrow wings, that resembles an additional leaf. This species is similar to Acianthera oligantha but smaller than it with flowers smaller and all the lip, yellow, extended in the intermediate part.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} <b>cespitose</b> and {{perennial}} with the culms being 40 - 80 cm long. Leaf-sheaths are closed, tibular and scabrous wsith eciliate membrane being 1 - 2.5 mm long.

50|$|Psilocybe stuntzii {{is found}} growing {{scattered}} to gregarious to <b>cespitose,</b> rarely solitary, in conifer wood chips and bark mulch, in soils rich in woody debris, {{and in new}} lawns of freshly laid sod or any newly mulched garden throughout the western region of the Pacific Northwest. From late July through December, has been observed growing all year long in the Seattle, Washington area, also reported from California, rarely {{as far south as}} Santa Cruz.There was a time when this mushroom appeared in over 40 percent of all new lawns and mulched in areas in the Puget Sound region of the Pacific Northwest. Due to a disappearance of pastures south of Seattle in the Tukwila-Kent-Auburn areas, this mushroom now only appears sporadically in certain new lawns which are well fertilized and manicured.|$|E
