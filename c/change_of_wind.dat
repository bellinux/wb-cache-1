5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward off {{the coast}} of Africa on July 27. Initially, virgorous convection persisted throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly diminished the convection on July 28. The wind field remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection. On July 31 a buoy recorded a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> direction from northeast to west, indicating a small low pressure area formed. Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235miles (375km) east-southeast of Barbuda.|$|E
25|$|The {{island was}} {{purchased}} by wealthy stockbroker Charles van Raalte who used the island as a residential holiday retreat. During this time the castle was renovated and served as host to famous visitors such as Guglielmo Marconi. Robert Baden-Powell, {{a close friend of}} the van Raaltes, hosted an experimental camp for boys on the island in the summer of 1907. Brownsea was largely self-supporting, with a kitchen garden and a dairy herd. Many of the pottery factory workers had stayed on after it closed, farming and working for the owners. Charles van Raalte died in Calcutta in 1907 and his wife eventually sold the island in 1925. In 1927 the island was purchased at auction by Mary Bonham-Christie for £125,000. A recluse by nature, she ordered a mass eviction of the island's residents to the mainland. Most of the island was abandoned and gradually reverted to natural heath and woodland. In 1934, a wild fire caused devastation after burning for a week. Much of the island was reduced to ashes, and the buildings to the east were only saved by a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> direction. Traumatised by the event, Bonham-Christie banned all public access to the island {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{the haze}} {{returned}} again in late September when Muslim Malaysians were experiencing Ramadan. This was {{partly due to}} a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> direction towards the southwest, partially caused by Typhoon Xangsane. The worst hit place was Kuching. The Sarawak state government had declared that schools would close if the API breaches the 300 mark. The worst affected area in Peninsular Malaysia is Johor Bahru which recorded an API of 150 on 7 and 8 October. For now, many people are wearing masks to prevent themselves from inhaling excessive amounts of haze. On 7 October, visibility in parts of East Malaysia fell to 300metres. On or about 9 October, {{the worst of the}} haze in Peninsular seemed to be in the state of Negeri Sembilan, where visibility in Sepang fell briefly to 500metres and the API in Nilai reached 198, before the rain relieved the haze partially. Shortly thereafter changing winds caused conditions to improve rapidly. Sarawak has started cloud seeding attempts to try to encourage rainfall that will help relieve the haze. Each cloud seeding session costs at least RM50,000 (roughly US$14,000). On 21 October, the winds has changed direction and started to blow the hazes away from Malaysia, and the following day, heavy rain has cleared the haze. Later on 26 October, the heavy rain returned again, and there were isolated showers in Klang Valley. The Star reported that the hazy days are soon coming to an end as the monsoon season is approaching.|$|E

2500|$|Dryad {{was based}} at Cork {{for several months}} during 1800, in Admiral Lord Gardner's fleet; Gardner's son Valentine {{commenced}} his naval career in Dryad under Mansfield. At the beginning of April 1800, Dryad spent several days assisting Revolutionnaire, which had lost her rudder in a hurricane in the Atlantic. Dryad had lost her fore-yard and the two ships assisted each other towards Cork when an off-shore gale forced them to head for Plymouth. However, another change in the wind meant that they could neither weather the Scilly Isles nor return to Cork and they drifted up the St George's Channel. On 16 April Dryad tried to tow Revolutionnaire off the Waterford rocks, but the cable broke. Fortunately another <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> enabled Revolutionnaire to avoid the rocks and both ships finally arrived at Milford Haven on 19 April in a [...] "most distressed state".|$|E

Soon the Turks fired at a British cutter, killing lieutenant Fitzroy and igniting an all-out naval battle. Sources disagree on exact timing of events owing to different timekeeping practices and the confusion of the battle; the first shots were marked at either 2:00, 2:20 or even 2:45p.m.; ship log of Azov recorded them at 2:30. At this moment Azov was still on the move to its planned station and had just escaped the firing range of Turkish coastal artillery. The smoke of English-Turkish shootout obstructed their view to starboard; Azov fired its first shots to port at 2:45.|$|E
