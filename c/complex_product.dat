25|$|Even before {{becoming}} {{a president of the}} American Economic Association, Galbraith was considered as an iconoclast by many economists. This is partly because he rejected the technical analysis and mathematical modelling of neoclassical economics as being divorced from reality. Following Thorstein Veblen, he believed that economic activity could not be distilled into inviolable laws, but rather was a <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> of the cultural and political milieu in which it occurs. In particular, he posited that important factors, such as the separation between corporate ownership and management, oligopoly, and the influence of government and military spending had been largely neglected by most economists because they are not amenable to axiomatic descriptions. In this sense, he worked as much in political economy as in classical economics.|$|E

We find that: (1) the most <b>complex</b> <b>products</b> are in machinery, chemicals, and metals, while the least <b>complex</b> <b>products</b> are raw materials and commodities, wood, textiles, and agricultural products; (2) the most complex economies {{in the world are}} Japan, Germany, and Sweden, and the least complex, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, and Nigeria; (3) the major exporters of the more <b>complex</b> <b>products</b> are the high-income countries, while the major exporters of the less <b>complex</b> <b>products</b> are the low-income countries; and (4) export shares of the more <b>complex</b> <b>products</b> increase with income, while export shares of the less <b>complex</b> <b>products</b> decrease with income. Finally, we relate the measure of product complexity with the concept of <b>Complex</b> <b>Products</b> and Systems, and find a high degree of conformity between them.

Concerning the product categories and their complexity, the most <b>complex</b> <b>products</b> consist of machinery, chemicals and metal products. The main exporters of the most <b>complex</b> <b>products</b> are developed countries. This means that the countries have high export competitiveness. Considering the share of high-tech exports, it is seemed that Turkey is below the level it should be.
