Also, if the pit where the last seed was dropped is followed (counterclockwise) by a line of <b>empty</b> <b>pits,</b> each facing a non <b>empty</b> <b>pit</b> in the opponent's row, then all the seeds in those opponent's pits are captured as well.|$|R
50|$|Another {{exception}} {{is that if}} the capturing seed was dropped in the leftmost of the player's pits, and the opponent's opposite <b>pit</b> is non <b>empty</b> and it is followed by a sequence of non <b>empty</b> <b>pits,</b> then seeds from all those adjacent non <b>empty</b> <b>pits</b> are captured.|$|R

50|$|At game setup, two {{seeds are}} placed in each pit. At her turn, the player takes the seeds from any of her pits holding two or more seeds, and sows them {{counterclockwise}} in her two rows. If the last seed falls in an <b>empty</b> <b>pit,</b> the turn is over. If the last seeds falls in a non <b>empty</b> <b>pit</b> of the inner row, and there are any seeds in the opponent's player's pits in the same column, those seeds are captured. The capturing player will then sow these captured seeds starting from the pit where the capturing seed was dropped. If the last seed is dropped in a non <b>empty</b> <b>pit</b> but a capture is not possible, then relay-sowing applies.|$|R

30|$|Figure  5 {{shows the}} morphologies of {{untreated}} wood, treated wood with acid red GR dye (0.5 %), and treated wood with acid red GR dye (0.5 %) and BL-flame retardant (30 %). The untreated wood clearly contained <b>empty</b> <b>pits</b> and smooth vessel walls (Fig.  5 a). After dyeing, the <b>empty</b> <b>pits</b> were {{occupied by a}} number of dye molecules; dye molecules were also dispersed uniformly in the vessel walls (Fig.  5 b). After the combination dyeing and flame-retardancy treatment, the pits were filled with dye and BL-flame-retardant molecules, while the wood vessel walls were rough. The dye and BL-flame-retardant molecules in the sample also clustered and adhered to the cell walls and pits (Fig.  5 c).|$|R

50|$|When {{the last}} stone falls in an <b>empty</b> <b>pit</b> in the player's row and the {{opposite}} pit in the opponent's row contains exactly two stones, those are {{captured by the}} player and removed from the game. In this case, the player also gets another turn.|$|R
50|$|Another {{peculiar}} {{element of}} Lukho is that, once the opening move described above is done, {{all of the}} subsequent moves are set. In other words, {{the outcome of the}} game is decided by that single opening move described above. At his turn, the player must take all the seeds from the leftmost non-empty pit of his row, and relay-sow them counterclockwise. If the last seed is dropped in an <b>empty</b> <b>pit</b> of the player's row, and the opponent's opposite <b>pit</b> is non <b>empty,</b> then the seeds in that pit are captured, together with the capturing seed. If there is a continuous line of non <b>empty</b> <b>pits</b> after the one that has been captured, all the pits in that line are also captured.|$|R
50|$|If {{the last}} sowed seed lands in an {{occupied}} pit (without {{resulting in a}} capture, see below), then all seeds in that pit, including the one just placed, are immediately sown, before the opponent's turn. This continues until the last sowing ends in an <b>empty</b> <b>pit.</b>|$|R

50|$|Teams take turns. At one team's turn, one of {{the team}} members takes all of the seeds from {{one of the}} team's pits and relay-sows them counterclockwise. If the last seed falls in <b>empty</b> <b>pit</b> of the team's row, any seeds in the {{opposite}} pit are captured and removed from the game, together with the seed that captured them.|$|R
5000|$|The player's move ends {{when the}} last seed of a sowing is dropped in an <b>empty</b> <b>pit.</b> If that pit is in the player's own row, and the {{opposite}} pit in the opponent's row contains exactly two seeds, then a capture occurs. In this case, all of the opponent's seeds in any pit containing two seeds are removed from the board.|$|R
5000|$|At {{his or her}} turn, {{the player}} takes all the seeds from a pit and sows them counterclockwise. If the last seed of a sowing falls in a {{non-empty}} pit {{that is not a}} Uur (see below), relay-sowing applies. Thus, the player's turn ends when the last seed in a sowing is dropped in an <b>empty</b> <b>pit</b> or in a Uur pit. Depending on the pit where this last seed was dropped, the following situations may occur: ...|$|R
50|$|Since 1938 {{there has}} been much gravel {{extraction}} in the north of the parish, especially at Pingewood, which has led to the loss of many farms and cottages within the hamlet. In recent years the <b>empty</b> <b>pits</b> have been used for landfill waste. A number of earlier pits have been left to fill with water, and this has provided for various water sports, fishing and other leisure activities, as well as supporting a large water bird population along with other aquatic flora and fauna.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the last}} seed is sown in a pit that {{contains}} at least 3 seeds, relay-sowing applies. If the last seed falls in an <b>empty</b> <b>pit,</b> or in a pit with exactly one seed (called puta, [...] "son") or in a pit with exactly two seeds (naga, [...] "figlia"), any {{seeds in the}} opposite pit are captured. Note that the player can either capture seeds from her own or from the opponent's row, depending on whether her sowing ends in the opponent's or her own row.|$|R

25|$|The mound (mound 1) {{originally}} had {{a diameter of}} nearly 50 m and a height of 6 m. It {{was surrounded by a}} circular ditch 10 m wide. At the time, {{it must have been a}} visually extremely striking monument. The tumulus contained three features. An <b>empty</b> <b>pit</b> was placed at the centre, perhaps to mislead potential looters. To the northwest, a wooden chamber of 2 x 1 m contained an inhumation, and to the southeast, a cremation burial had been placed in some kind of wooden container. Cremations are more commonly associated with the Halstatt phase, inhumation with the La Tène one.|$|R

50|$|Players {{take turns}} moving the seeds. On a turn, a player chooses {{one of the}} pits under their control. The player removes all seeds from this pits, and {{distributes}} them in each pit counter-clockwise from this pit, in a process called sowing. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring pits. If the last seed ends in an occupied pit, then all the seeds in that pit including the last one are resown starting from that pit. These multiple turns continue until the sowing process ends, either in an <b>empty</b> <b>pit</b> or a capture of four seeds.|$|R
50|$|Since mining entails {{removing}} {{dirt and}} rock from its natural location, thereby creating large <b>empty</b> <b>pits,</b> rooms, and tunnels, cave-ins {{as well as}} ground and rock falls are a major concern within mines. Modern techniques for timbering and bracing walls and ceilings within sub-surface mines have {{reduced the number of}} fatalities due to cave-ins, but ground falls continue to represent up to 50% of mining fatalities. Even in cases where mine collapses are not instantly fatal, they can trap mine workers deep underground. Cases such as these often lead to high-profile rescue efforts, such as when 33 Chilean miners were trapped deep underground for 69 days in 2010.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sanded acrylic {{surfaces}} {{have been}} examined with optical microscopy for evidence of grit embedded by the sanding process. The number of surface imperfections (pits or particles) larger than 5 microns was a factor of {{two to three times}} larger in the sanded surface than on a surface that had not been sanded. It was usually possible to distinguish an <b>empty</b> <b>pit</b> from a foreign particle, and the analysis indicated that the larger number of imperfections on the sanded surface was associated with the presence of foreign matter, presumably particles of grit from the sanding. Estimates of the radioactivity that might be associated with such particles are made under various assumptions. I...|$|R
5000|$|Bayakou uses plastic buckets to <b>empty</b> <b>pit</b> latrines {{during the}} night. The bayakou {{work as a}} crew. One part of the bayakou team climbs through the toilet's squat hole into the pit under the latrine and fills the bucket. Then {{the person in the}} pit hands the bucket up to another crew-member. The human waste is put into sacks and placed into a {{wheelbarrow}} which a third person carts away. The waste is normally dumped on the ground, ravines or sometimes into vacuum trucks run by private companies who will take the waste to the treatment plant. Dumping waste anywhere other than in a treatment plant is illegal. Some bayakou have been arrested for transporting waste.|$|R

50|$|The vale is {{traditionally}} a brickmaking area, but brickmaking {{industry has been}} running down since the 1970s. It has left {{a large amount of}} spoiled countryside containing several large <b>empty</b> <b>pits</b> some of which have now been converted into lakes. The Forest of Marston Vale is one of twelve of community forest projects in the United Kingdom. It was initiated by the Countryside Agency and the Forestry Commission, in partnership with Bedfordshire County Council, Mid Bedfordshire District Council, and Bedford Borough Council. The total area covered is 61 square miles (158 km2), but most of this land is in private ownership. There are incentives for landowners to plant trees, and the target for community forests in general is to reach 30% tree cover.|$|R
25|$|UDDTs are {{sometimes}} considered too expensive compared to pit latrines, but this criticism {{does not include}} the cost of <b>emptying</b> <b>pits</b> and the potential value of fertilizers that can be recycled via UDDTs should the users wish to do so (noting that most UDDT installations worldwide currently do not reuse excreta in agriculture). Rather than looking only at construction costs, long-term operational costs and benefits should also be considered, especially since the regular emptying or re-building of pit latrines may be a significant expense. When a period of for example 10 years is considered, UDDTs may well be the more economical alternative, since the emptying of feces vaults is simple and safer, thus less expensive, even if users decide to enter into a contract with someone else to do this.|$|R
