The novel features of this work are 1 D reconstruction of the tracheobronchial tree structure on the basis of 3 D segmentation of the computed tomography (CT) data; 1 D− 0 D coupling of the models of 1 D bronchial tube and 0 D alveolar components; and the alveolar gas exchange model.

40|$|Apnoea {{remains an}} {{important}} {{problem in the}} prematurely born infant. Apnoeas {{can be divided into}} central, obstructed and mixed apnoea. Apnoeas frequently occur in association with periodic breathing, as well as isolated events. It remains unclear whether there is a common mechanism for all these types of disturbance in normal respiratory activity or whether there are additional factors which determine the type of apnoea. HYPOTHESES The hypotheses explored in this thesis were that isolated central apnoea was due to reduced chemoreceptor sensitivity, in mixed apnoea there was additional activation of the costophrenic inhibitory reflex and apnoea associated with <b>periodic</b> <b>respiration</b> was due to instability of respiratory control, with periods of over ventilation leading to apnoea. METHODS Polygraphic techniques were used to identify the frequency, type and length of apnoeic periods in infants born at/or less than 33 weeks gestation who were otherwise healthy sequential studies were undertaken to determine the pattern of apnoea and how it changed with time. Chemoreceptor sensitivity was assessed by measuring the ventilatory response to an added respiratory dead space of twice the anatomical dead space. The rate of response to the added dead space was assessed to determine if it related to the apnoea types and in particular was reduced in <b>periodic</b> <b>respiration.</b> The respiratory response to an imposed airway obstruction was used to determine the strength of the Hering Breuer and costophrenic inhibitory reflex, as respiratory efforts against an obstruction would induce chest wall distortion. RESULTS Twenty-eight infants with a mean gestation of 29 + 4 weeks and birth weight was of 1. 39 kg, were studied on 71 occasions. The prevalence of apnoea in this preterm population was nearly 100 %, with the more immature infants at greater risk. Ninety percent of apnoeas (> 5 secs) were central, 9 % mixed and 1 % obstructive; however, 50 % of apnoeas over 14 s had an obstructive component. Thirty-three percent of apnoeas were associated with a desaturation, the longer the apnoea the greater degree of desaturation. Apnoea associated with <b>periodic</b> <b>respiration</b> accounted for 72. 3 % of all apnoeas and <b>periodic</b> <b>respiration</b> increased with postmentrual age. In ninety-three percent of the studies there was at least one episode of periodic breathing. This relationship was not related to postmentrual age. A significant relationship was found between the rate of periodic central apnoeas and chemoreceptor sensitivity, as examined by the response to added dead space, related to a increased reliance on chemoreceptors in this group of infants The rate of response to the added dead space however shortened with increasing post menstrual age and that there was a significant inverse relationship between this and the rate of central periodic apnoeas. No significant relationship was found between the response to external obstruction and the rate of apnoea. Although an active Hering Breuer reflex was found in all infants, this was related to both to the gestational and postmenstrual age of the infants. CONCLUSIONS Apnoeas associated with <b>periodic</b> <b>respiration</b> are the commonest form of apnoea. As demonstrated in this thesis these occur most frequently in infants with the most rapidly responding chemoreceptors, these data support the hypothesis that this pattern of respiration is due to an underdamping of the chemoreceptor response. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that mixed apnoea was associated with activation of the costophrenic inhibitory reflex. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|A 79 -y-old {{man with}} {{generalized}} tetanus {{was admitted to}} the ICU. A left-forearm wound was surgically debrided, and the wound was closed. On postoperative day 1, after the patient experi-enced opisthotonos and convulsions, endotracheal intubation was performed. Propofol and diaze-pam were infused but failed to stop the convulsions. Morphine, midazolam, dantrolene, and rocu-ronium were used to ameliorate the muscle spasms. Magnesium sulfate was also infused. On postoperative day 15, patient-ventilator asynchrony was apparent. The patient showed recurrent tachypnea and bradypnea, which seemed typical of Cheyne-Stokes respiration. A neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) catheter was inserted transnasally, and electrical activity of the dia-phragm (Edi) was monitored. Readings showed regular attempts to breathe at 40 – 50 breaths/min with periodic changes in Edi amplitude. NAVA mode improved patient-ventilator synchrony. Pe-riodic breathing continued for 2 weeks. We stopped monitoring Edi on postoperative day 39. He began respiratory rehabilitation and was transferred to a hospital for rehabilitation on postoper-ative day 80. We encountered <b>periodic</b> <b>respiration</b> in a patient with tetanus. Edi monitoring revealed periodic amplitude change.

40|$|A high {{prevalence}} of sleep apnoea {{was found in}} a group of men occupationally exposed to organic solvents. Workers with long term exposure to organic solvents often report symptoms such as fatigue, forgetfulness, and concentration difficulties. These symptoms are strikingly similar to those reported by patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). This is a frequently diagnosed disorder characterised by disturbed sleep causing psychic or somatic complications and daytime sleepiness. A study was undertaken to evaluate whether people with long term occupational exposure to organic solvents have a higher {{prevalence of}} sleep apnoea than the general population. Patients exposed to solvents (66 men) were invited to participate in a screening for sleep apnoea. A static charge sensitive bed was used for the monitoring of respiration movements and pulse oximetry during one night. A classical sleep apnoea was diagnosed if <b>periodic</b> <b>respiration</b> movement exceeded 45 % of estimated sleep time and the oxygen desaturation index exceeded 6. The prevalence of sleep apnoea among the men exposed to solvents was compared with the prevalence in the general population (1. 4 %). The prevalence among the participating exposed men was 19. 7 % which gave a conservative relative risk estimate of 14. 1 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 7. 5 - 24. 2).

An alternative possibility is that people with sleep apnoea are misdiagnosed as cases of solvent induced toxic encephalopathy. The interpretation has importance for the caring of the patient...|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to the results brought out in the separate sections I wish to direct especial attention to the following conclusions: (1) In ten cases of Cheyne-Stokes respiration observed clinically, the alternate periods of respiratory activity and apnœa were associated with Traube-Hering waves of blood pressure. These cases may be separated into two groups characterized by {{the relation of the}} respiratory changes to the changes of blood pressure. In one group the period of respiratory activity was associated with a rise of blood pressure, the period of apnœa with a fall; in the other group, the reverse relations existed. The former group included two cases of Cheyne-Stokes respiration occurring with increased intracranial tension; the latter contained eight cases with cardiac and arterial disease. (2) By means of cerebral compression, <b>periodic</b> <b>respirations</b> may be produced experimentally, and the relation of the blood pressure changes to the respiratory variations are the same as in the clinical cases with increased intracranial tension, namely, a rise of pressure with each group of respirations and a fall with each period of apnœa. In the experiments, during each respiratory group, the blood pressure rises above the line of intracranial tension and with each period of apnœa it falls below this line. With the disappearance of this relation, the periodicity of the respirations likewise disappears. It is probable that the same relation between the blood pressure and intracranial pressure exists when Cheyne-Stokes respiration occurs clinically in association with increased intracranial tension. (3) Disappearance of the periodic respiratory activity in the clinical cases of both groups is accompanied by disappearance of the waves of blood pressure. (4) The waves of blood pressure cannot be regarded as a mechanical effect of the periodic respiratory activity; on the contrary the latter must be due to the changes of blood pressure, or both phenomena may be referable to a common cause. (5) Cheyne-Stokes respiration in states of increased intracranial tension, with blood pressure waves rising and falling above and below the line of intracranial tension, is due to periodic activity of the respiratory, vasomotor, and cardio-inhibitory centres, the underlying cause of which is an alternate anæmia and blood supply to the medullary centres. The vasomotor centre, as the result of periodic increase and decrease of the stimulus, shows periodic variations in its activity. It is stimulated to greater activity during the periods of anæmia, and partially relaxes with each period of blood supply. During the periods of anæmia, the respiratory centre loses its irritability for the acting stimulus, and is therefore apnœic. It is finally stimulated to activity, either {{as a result of an}} increase in its irritability from a preceding rise of blood pressure, or from a great increase in the respiratory stimulus. The cardio-inhibitory centre is stimulated by the periods of anæmia. This stimulation causes slowing of the pulse, which passes off to a considerable extent with the following period of blood supply. (6) Cheyne-Stokes respiration has heretofore been regarded as always the manifestation of the same conditions and capable of the same explanation; the results of this work, on the contrary, show that two distinct groups of cases may be recognized, depending upon the relation of the blood pressure changes to the periodic respiratory activity. 19 (7) The medullary centres show great differences in their susceptibility to anæmia. The respiratory centre is very susceptible to a much reduced blood supply; its irritability is rapidly reduced or lost upon the occurrence of marked or complete anæmia, and is rapidly regained when the blood supply is renewed if the anæmia has not been maintained too long. The effect of a considerable anæmia upon this centre is entirely different from that of a normal or somewhat reduced supply of blood which is more venous than normal, that is, contains more carbon dioxide and less oxygen, such as occurs with ordinary asphyxia. The vasomotor and cardio-inhibitory centres are not nearly so susceptible to anæmia. The former centre may, and frequently does, respond when in a condition of complete anæmia. (8) I am able to confirm, as a result of my experiments upon cerebral compression, in all essential details the conclusions of Cushing, and the general law formulated by him, namely that "an increase of intracranial tension occasions a rise of blood pressure which tends to find a level slightly above that of the pressure exerted against the medulla. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{potential}} to treat unstable ventilatory control (seen in <b>periodic</b> breathing, <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration,</b> and central sleep apnea) with carefully controlled dynamic administration of supplementary CO 2, aiming to reduce ventilatory oscillations with minimum increment in mean CO 2. We used a standard mathematical model to explore the consequences of phasic CO 2 administration, with different timing and dosing algorithms. We found an optimal time window within the ventilation cycle (covering ∼ 1 / 6 of the cycle) during which CO 2 delivery reduces ventilatory fluctuations by > 95 %. Outside that time, therapy is dramatically less effective: indeed, for {{more than two-thirds of}} the cycle, therapy increases ventilatory fluctuations > 30 %. Efficiency of stabilizing ventilation improved when the algorithm gave a graded increase in CO 2 dose (by controlling its duration or concentration) for more severe periodic breathing. Combining gradations of duration and concentration further increased efficiency of therapy by 22 %. The (undesirable) increment in mean end-tidal CO 2 caused was 300 times smaller with dynamic therapy than with static therapy, to achieve the same degree of ventilatory stabilization (0. 0005 vs. 0. 1710 kPa). The increase in average ventilation was also much smaller with dynamic than static therapy (0. 005 vs. 2. 015 l/min). We conclude that, if administered dynamically, dramatically smaller quantities of CO 2 could be used to reduce periodic breathing, with minimal adverse effects. Algorithms adjusting both duration and concentration in real time would achieve this most efficiently. If developed clinically as a therapy for periodic breathing, this would minimize excess acidosis, hyperventilation, and sympathetic overactivation, compared with static treatment...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedThe dynamic {{interactions}} and coupling among the multiple components that collectively constitute the cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and sleep-wake regulation systems play {{important roles in}} determining the short-term and long-term physiological effects of sleep-disordered breathing. In previous and current studies, a computational model, named PNEUMA, has been continuously developed {{to be capable of}} simulating the complex dynamics of cardiorespiratory control during sleep and transient changes in sleep-wake state. PNEUMA includes the autonomic control of the cardiovascular system, chemoreflex and state-related control of breath-to-breath ventilation, state-related and chemoreflex control of upper airway potency, as well as respiratory and circulatory mechanics.; Recent studies suggest that sleep-disordered breathing increases the risk of developing systemic hypertension and type 2 diabetes in the long term. To better understand the causal links, a computational metabolic model is developed to be capable of simulating glucose-insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) dynamics during sleep and wake states under normal breathing or sleep-disordered breathing conditions. The model incorporates the circadian regulation of epinephrine secretion, epinephrine regulation on the dynamic fluctuations in glucose and FFA in plasma, and metabolic coordination among tissues and organs provided by insulin, glucagon and epinephrine.; While many respiratory cardiovascular and metabolic models exist in the literature, none thus far has focused on characterizing the interactions that involve the respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic systems with sleep-wake state regulation. By incorporating the metabolic model into PNEUMA, we have developed an integrative model of cardiovascular and respiratory control with interactions between the autonomic and metabolic control in sleep-disordered breathing.; The extended integrative model provides realistic predictions of the physiological responses under a wide variety of conditions, including the day-to-day sleep-wake cycle, hypoxia-induced <b>periodic</b> breathing, <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> in congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleep-disordered breathing effects on glucose insulin and FFA dynamics.
