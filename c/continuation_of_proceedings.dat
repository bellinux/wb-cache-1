500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{procedural}} changes, including the Bill of Middlesex, the King's Bench's business rose tenfold between 1560 and 1640. The simplicity and low cost of this procedure drove much business to the King's Bench, which had a negative impact on the Court of Common Pleas and Court of Chancery. Historically, cases now covered by the Bill of Middlesex had been handled by the Common Pleas, using a specialist writ drafted by the Chancery. This writ was very expensive, and as such brought large amounts of revenue to the Chancery and the Common Pleas. Costs varied depending on the amount of money being claimed from the defendant; it was 6shillings and 8 pence to claim £40, 10 shillings for £100, and £5 for £1,000. In return, the Chancery began to bring injunctions against those who claimed Bills of Middlesex, [...] "whereby [...] are hindered of their fine which should have been paid in [...] upon the original of the said case". These injunctions were only temporary; [...] "once the fine had been paid there was nothing to prevent a <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> in King’s Bench". Relatively few injunctions were issued, and thanks to technical loopholes [...] "it was a weapon too infrequently used, and too easily parried" [...] to have any long-term impact. The issuing of injunctions finally ended in 1590, after an ordinance passed by James I increased the costs of King's Bench proceedings. The Bill of Middlesex itself was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.|$|E

He was accompanied by his fellow undersecretary, Jose Maria Robaina Anso. From that position Chiarino had to face a troubled period in which there were many reports of violations of Human rights by the military dictatorship during this government. This created a tense atmosphere at the Armed Forces, and Chiarino culminated, after a virtual insubordination of the Army Commander Hugo Medina, facing military citations for justice, with the sanction of the Law on the Expiration of the Punitive Claims of the State, in December 1986, which prevented the <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> the legal <b>proceedings</b> related to this issue.

50|$|A writ of {{prohibition}} is issued primarily to prevent an inferior court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction in cases pending before it or acting contrary {{to the rules of}} natural justice. It is issued by a superior court to inferior courts from usurping a jurisdiction with which it was not legally vested, or in other words to compel inferior courts to keep within the limits of their jurisdiction. Thus the writ is issued in both cases where there is excess of jurisdiction and where there is absence of jurisdiction. Prohibition is not a <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>proceedings</b> to be prohibited. Its object is on the contrary to arrest the inferior tribunal's proceedings. It is a collateral matter progress essentially between the two tribunals, an inferior one and other superior one by which the latter, by virtue its power of superintendence over the former, restrains it within its rightful competence. Its nature is held to depend upon the nature of proceeding to be prohibited. The writ can be issued only when the proceedings are pending in a court if the proceeding has matured into decision, writ will not lie. When the court, before whom the matter is pending, has ceased to exist, in that condition too, the writ {{of prohibition}} will not lie because there can be no proceedings upon which it can operate but on the other hand, if the court is functioning, the writ can be issued at any stage of the proceeding before the inferior court or tribunal. It can be issued only against a judicial and quasi-judicial bodyand not against a legislative or administrative body.|$|R

The {{projective}} limit technics derived for spaces of connections are extended to a new framework which for the associated projective limit plays a role of the differential geometry. It provides us with powerfull technics for construction and studding various operators. In particular, we introduce the commutator algebra of `vector fields', define a divergence of a vector field and find for them a quantum representation. Among the vector fields, there are operators which we identify as regularised Rovelli-Smolin loop operators linear in momenta. Another class of operators which comes out naturally are Laplace operators. Comment: 3 pp, <b>Proceedings</b> <b>of</b> "Cornelius Lanczos International Centenary Conference" (1994...|$|R
