Recently Neoral replaced the old Cya {{in the clinical}} ground. METHODS: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effectiveness, safety and advantages of this conversion in 90 adult renal transplant patients with stable renal function transplanted at least 24 months earlier. There were 48 males and 42 females with a mean age of 39 years (range: 18 - 56). Mean interval from transplant to conversion was 3. 6 years (range: 2. 7 - 5. 4). Conversion rate was 1 : 1. Mean Neoral dose at conversion was 3. 8 mg/kg/day (range: 2. 1 - 5. 7). RESULTS: One month after <b>conversion</b> <b>mean</b> Neoral dose was 3. 4 mg/kg/day (range: 2. 2 - 3. 9) and at six months was 3. 2 mg/kg/day (range: 2. 1 - 4).

The incidence of side effects due to CyA was slightly increased and there were not differences in terms of arterial pressure values and number of antihypertensive drugs given.

30|$|MGrC {{considers}} {{multiple levels}} of IG when solving a problem, {{and there have}} been a lot researches in this regard [41 – 45, 62 – 69]. Three basic mechanisms of MGrC can be summarized from these research works with regard to the way in which multi-granular levels are used in problem solving. They are granularity optimization, granularity conversion, and multi-granularity joint computation. In granularity optimization, the most suitable granular level of a domain is chosen for the multi-granular information/knowledge representation model (MGrR), and the most efficient and satisfactory enough solution is generated on it [41 – 43]. Granularity <b>conversion</b> <b>means</b> the working granularity layer will be switched between adjective layers or jump to a higher or lower granular layer, in accordance with the requirements of solving a problem [44, 45]. Multi-granularity joint computation takes a problem-oriented MGrR as input, and every layers of the MGrR are employed jointly to achieve a correct solution to the problem. Each of the three mechanisms has its particular type of problem to deal with.|$|E
