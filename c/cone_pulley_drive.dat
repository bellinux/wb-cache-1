40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{dynamics}} of continuously variable (CVT) chain drives. According to the discrete structure of the chain, which causes the polygonal actions, the mechanical model contains each chain link and pulley as a separate body. While a chain link {{is part of a}} strand, only joint forces including friction act on the chain links, whereas in the contact situation additional impulsive and frictional forces in the contact zones between the chain link's rocker pins and the tapered surfaces of the <b>cone</b> <b>pulleys</b> have to be taken into account. For the calculation of the contact forces Coulomb's friction law as well as a time sparing continuous approximation are applied. Simulation results show the influence of the <b>cone</b> <b>pulley's</b> deformation on the power transmission. They also show the repercussion of the polygonal action. Furthermore the chain's pitch influence on the vibrational behavior of the transmission is discussed. A comparison of calculated and measured tensional forces ver [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Engine lathe is {{the name}} applied to a {{traditional}} late-19th-century or 20th-century lathe with automatic feed to the cutting tool, as opposed to early lathes which were used with hand-held tools, or lathes with manual feed only. The usage of [...] "engine" [...] here is in the mechanical-device sense, not the prime-mover sense, as in the steam engines which were the standard industrial power source for many years. The works would have one large steam engine which would provide power to all the machines via a line shaft system of belts. Therefore, early engine lathes were generally 'cone heads', in that the spindle usually had attached to it a multi-step <b>pulley</b> called a <b>cone</b> <b>pulley</b> designed to accept a flat belt. Different spindle speeds could be obtained by moving the flat belt to different steps on the <b>cone</b> <b>pulley.</b> Cone-head lathes usually had a countershaft (layshaft) {{on the back side}} of the cone which could be engaged to provide a lower set of speeds than was obtainable by direct belt drive. These gears were called back gears. Larger lathes sometimes had two-speed back gears which could be shifted to provide a still lower set of speeds.|$|R

A friction method of transmitting the drive between a <b>drive</b> <b>pulley</b> and a track, which is often applied, is sensitive to adverse ambient conditions, whereas {{the influence of the}} ground on friction feedback conditions {{in the area of the}} ground working on the drive system is significant.

50|$|The Stringbike is {{a bicycle}} {{that uses a}} rope and <b>pulley</b> <b>drive</b> system instead of a {{traditional}} bicycle chain and sprockets. It uses two Dyneema ropes attached to pulleys attached to swinging lever and cam mechanisms, {{one on each side}} of the bike. These mechanisms replace the round sprockets found on chain-driven bikes. Unlike some traditional 10-speed gears using a derailleur, there is no slippage when changing gear ratios. The Stringbike uses a 19 gear ratio system with no duplicates and a total gear range of 3.5 to 1. The transmission ratio can be changed with a shifting knob located on the right-side handle grip. Gear ratios can be changed even when the bicycle is almost stationary.|$|R
50|$|Bridgeport manual milling {{machines}} {{have come in}} many types and sizes over the years, including (but not limited to) the C head (original), R head (heavy duty C head), M head, J head (and high speed, 5440 RPM version), 2J1 1/2 head (1.5 HP Vari-Speed), 2J2 (2HP Vari-speed), and Series II head (4HP Vari-speed). All of the heads offer variable speeds, the earlier ones via a step <b>pulley</b> (<b>cone</b> <b>pulley)</b> and the later ones via electrically or electronically modulated variable-speed drive. Typical table sizes are 9â€³ Ã— 49â€³ (Y and X, respectively) and 10â€³ Ã— 54â€³. Machine tapers for toolholding include Morse tapers (on early models) and the R8 taper (a widely used standard that Bridgeport created) on most models. Both Morse and R8 allow for both collets and solid holders; and a drill chuck can be held by either of the latter. Machine slides are of the dovetail type, and rotary bearings are mostly of the roller and ball types.|$|R
50|$|The DAF 600 was {{the first}} car to have a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) system - the innovative DAF Variomatic., the same system was carried over to the 750 and its variants. The DAF Variomatic employs centrifugal weights to control the drive ratio of the transmission and is enhanced by the engine manifold vacuum. The action of the bob weights and inlet vacuum combined to pull together the cheeks of two, variable diameter, driving <b>pulleys,</b> <b>driven</b> directly from the engine. These were connected, by rubber 'V' belts, to two similar <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys,</b> connected to the drive wheels. The cheeks of the <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys</b> were held together by spring tension, which was progressively overcome as the <b>drive</b> <b>pulleys</b> expanded and the tension of the belts increased. The DAF Variomatics were thereby the only cars ever produced which went faster by the simple expedient of gently and gradually releasing the accelerator once top engine speed had been reached, as the increased vacuum took over from the reducing bob weight speed. The Variomatic also permitted increased engine braking by operating a switch on the dashboard which reversed {{the action of the}} vacuum on the pulley's diaphragm, seeking a lower ratio with increased manifold vacuum. Two separate transmissions ran the two driving wheels, eliminating the need for a differential. The two transmissions could provide different drive ratios, permitting the wheels to rotate at different speeds. The duplication also provided redundancy. If one belt broke, the vehicle could still be driven.An interesting feature: putting the car in reverse reversed the entire drive system. This enabled the vehicle, at least the earlier examples, in theory to reach the same top speed in reverse as forward.|$|R

5000|$|Following the American Civil War, mills grew larger. They {{were built}} in the {{southern}} states of South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi where cheap labour and plentiful water power made operations profitable. Cotton could be processed into fabric where it grew, saving transportation costs. The mills were usually combination mills, (spinning and weaving) that were water powered and used a slow burn design technique. They used a belt and <b>pulley</b> <b>drive</b> system, and heavier ring frames rather than mules. At this point they only spun and wove coarse counts. The mills were mainly in open country and mill towns were formed to support them. New England mills found it increasingly difficult to compete, and as in Lancashire, went into gradual decline until bankrupted during the Great Depression. Cotton mills and their owners dominated the economy and politics of the Piedmont well into the 20th century.|$|R
