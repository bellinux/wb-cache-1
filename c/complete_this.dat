5|$|Breckinridge studied {{education}} at a classical school operated by Dr. Louis Marshall, {{the brother of}} Chief Justice John Marshall, then followed his brothers, Cabell and John, to Princeton in 1817. His behavior problems continued there; in one year, he spent more than $1200. He was suspended for fighting, and although he was later reinstated, the incident soured him on Princeton, and he was granted an honorable release. (The school later awarded him an honorary Master of Arts degree in 1832.) Breckinridge enrolled at Yale University, but after three months, discovered that a one-year residency was required for graduation. Unwilling to <b>complete</b> <b>this</b> requirement, he moved to Union College in Schenectady, New York, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1819.|$|E
5|$|He was {{studying}} for {{a degree in}} civil engineering at Leeds Metropolitan University while playing for Frickley and a degree in surveying in 2006. While at university, he worked on a building site.

He comes from a family of professional sportsmen; father Neil and grandfather Cyril were both rugby league players with Featherstone Rovers. He has cited his father's encouragement as the main influence in his footballing career. He is a supporter of Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|In March 1949, British Railways {{ordered a}} final 20 from Brighton works despite a {{pressing}} need for smaller tank locomotives. This imbalance was rectified by building forty-one {{examples of the}} LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for the Southern Region. Also at this time Brighton works staff were embroiled in the difficulties associated with Bulleid's experimental and problematic Leader class. As a result, Brighton sought assistance from the other Southern Region works to <b>complete</b> <b>this</b> final order. Ashford works cut the frames and constructed the tenders, and Eastleigh works constructed six of the final batch of locomotives.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th {{century and}} 19th century, more Arab blood was added by stallions who were {{turned out in}} the Welsh hills. Other breeds have also been added, {{including}} the Thoroughbred, Hackney, Norfolk Roadster, and the Yorkshire Coach Horse. Before the car was developed, the quickest mode of transport in Wales was the Welsh Cob. Tradesmen, doctors, and other businessmen often selected ponies by trotting them the 35 uphill miles from Cardiff to Dowlais. The best ponies could <b>complete</b> <b>this</b> feat in under three hours, never breaking gait. Formal breeding stock licensing was introduced in 1918, but before this, breeding stock was selected by such trotting tests.|$|E
5|$|Otto's early reign {{was also}} notable for his moving {{the capital of}} Greece from Nafplion to Athens. His first task as king {{was to make a}} {{detailed}} archaeological and topographic survey of Athens. He assigned Gustav Eduard Schaubert and Stamatios Kleanthis to <b>complete</b> <b>this</b> task. At that time, Athens had a population of roughly 4,000–5,000 people, located mainly in what today covers the district of Plaka in Athens.|$|E
5|$|Specialized export {{proteins}} {{exist for}} translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is <b>complete.</b> <b>This</b> quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' {{central role in}} protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.|$|E

5|$|The {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} transmitter pulse was not perfectly sharp and caused the receiver signals to ring {{for a short time}} even if they were turned on after the pulse was ostensibly <b>complete.</b> <b>This</b> leftover signal caused a large permanent blip known as the transmitter break through which appeared at the short-range end of the tubes (left and bottom). A control known as the Oscillator Bias allowed the exact timing of the receiver's activation relative to the transmitter pulse to be adjusted, normally so the remains of the pulse were just visible.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} tracks {{included}} in the game, with locations inspired {{from different parts of}} the globe, from Belize to Tokyo. Progression through the game is achieved by competing in and winning races against computer-controlled racers spread over different tracks and in different leagues. Players begin in the Rookie league, across three of the tracks, where the chances of detachment from the race surface are decreased and rates of acceleration reduced. Success in the Rookie league unlocks the less forgiving Pro league with more tracks on which to compete. Further success unlocks the most difficult league, the Ballistics league, competition in this league occurs across every track and to <b>complete</b> <b>this,</b> the player must place first in every race.|$|E
5|$|Implementing the {{deception}} operation {{did not go}} through entirely without incident. Initially the Soviets were {{kept in the dark}} about Egyptian intentions to go to war. Instead, on October 2, they were told that an Israeli raid was expected. Over the next two days the director of the Defense Intelligence Service, General Fouad Nassar, informed the Chief Soviet Liaison Officer, General Samakhodsky, that the raid was expected to be a large-scale attack, coupled with an air strike. Though Samakhodsky appeared at first to believe Nassar's story, it became clear to the Egyptians that the Soviets were suspicious. In particular Soviet advisors serving with Egyptian and Syrian units were by October 3 reporting the unusually heightened activities of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Both Sadat and Assad decided to inform the Soviets of their intention to go to war on October 3. Promptly, the Soviets requested permission to evacuate their personnel in Egypt, and both leaders reluctantly agreed. Egyptian commanders were taken completely by surprise, when, beginning late evening on October 4, Soviet experts serving with field units, embassy personnel and their families were hurriedly evacuated. By October 5, the evacuation was <b>complete.</b> <b>This</b> incident would be an important factor in convincing the Israelis that war was likely.|$|E

5|$|Mermaid and Loire joined {{battle at}} 07:00, and the {{artillery}} exchange became close and furious after a boarding attempt by Loire was foiled by the helmsman of the British ship. Both ships took severe damage, Mermaid knocking away {{several of her}} opponent's spars, but suffering in turn from the musketry of the soldiers still aboard the Loire. At 09:15, the French vessel lost another spar, and Newman determined to rake his opponent. As he attempted to <b>complete</b> <b>this</b> manoeuvre, a shot from Loire brought down Mermaid's mizzenmast, making her unmanageable and disabling a number of her guns. Seeing an opportunity to escape, the battered Loire disengaged, making significant distance before Newman's crew could clear {{the wreckage of the}} mast. High winds further hampered Mermaid's repair efforts by tearing away several sails and spars and drowning the ship's carpenter when he was blown overboard. By the time Mermaid was ready for action once more, Loire had escaped.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} on November 11, 1926, along {{a series of}} existing state highways from Lansing southward toward Toledo. In 1930, the southern end was rerouted south of Somerset in rural northwestern Lenawee County to a course that ran directly south to the Ohio state line; the remainder was renumbered US223. Starting in the 1950s, the highway was reconfigured to bypass Mason and other communities, converting US127 into a freeway from Jackson to the Lansing area by the mid-1970s. When the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) successfully petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in 1999 to remove US27 from the state, US127 was to be extended northward from Lansing to Grayling as the replacement designation. This change was made in 2002, resulting in the current configuration of the highway in Michigan. The United States Congress has designated an additional Interstate Highway, {{to be part of}} I-73, that would replace most or all of US127 through Central and Southern Michigan, but any plans by MDOT to <b>complete</b> <b>this</b> highway were cancelled in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The neotype {{skeleton}} {{had been}} uncovered in the Black Ven Marl or Woodstone Nodule Bed, marine deposits of the Charmouth Mudstone Formation, {{dating from the}} late Sinemurian stage, about 191 million years ago. It consists of a rather complete skeleton with skull and lower jaws. Only the snout tip, the neck base, the forelimbs and the tail end are missing. Hundreds of osteoderms were found {{in connection with the}} skeleton, many more or less in their original position. From the 1960s onward, this fossil was further prepared by Ronald Croucher using acid baths to free the bones from the surrounding matrix, a method perfected for the Charmouth fossils. In 1992, Charig reported that only a single block had yet to be treated, but he died before the results could be published. Norman, who intends to <b>complete</b> <b>this</b> task, has revealed some new anatomical details in 2004. Apart from these, a modern description is largely lacking.|$|E
