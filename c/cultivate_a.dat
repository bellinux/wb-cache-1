5|$|The testimonies of explorers {{and colonial}} administrators {{demonstrate}} that Carabane {{has participated in}} rice cultivation, fishery, trade, and palm wine production for a long time. The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role {{in the lives of}} the population. Palm oil and palm wine are very popular and traditional in the area. The fishery has long been dominated by artisan fishing, which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. Although there have been attempts to <b>cultivate</b> <b>a</b> tourism industry on the island, the inhabitants have been reluctant to participate. Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie star days. The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone, {{and even the}} style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided chignon. Additionally, her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of Christian Dior and the jewels of Cartier. In an attempt to <b>cultivate</b> <b>a</b> more serious political persona, Eva {{began to appear in}} public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did <b>cultivate</b> <b>a</b> variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus' health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir. It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.|$|E

5|$|Mahaleo {{performs}} a genre they pioneered, called tsentsigat, that draws from the acoustic folk and protest song genres {{as well as}} the diverse musical traditions of Madagascar. Each of the band members sings, and all but one also play acoustic guitar. In addition, the band makes use of traditional instruments like the kabosy guitar and sodina flute. While the band is acclaimed for its large catalog of hits, with over 300 songs composed since 1972, its members are also admired for their commitment to live the message of solidarity for national development that features in most of their music. Each band member has gone on to <b>cultivate</b> <b>a</b> primary career in addition to his participation in Mahaleo in areas ranging from medical care and sociology to farming and politics. The band has collectively launched two development initiatives, in addition to numerous other activities managed by individual members of the group.|$|E
5|$|That the Sacs and Foxes did {{claim the}} country generally, where this land lies, is not controverted; nor was their claim ceded to the United States till 1824. And {{this raises the}} {{question}} whether, according to Spanish usage, whilst that power governed Louisiana, an existing Indian claim to territory precluded inhabitation and cultivation under a permit to inhabit and <b>cultivate</b> <b>a</b> particular place designated in the permit, and {{which was in the}} Indian country. Spain had no treaties with any of the Indian tribes in Louisiana, fixing limits to their claims, so far as we are informed. The Indians were kept quiet, and at peace with Spanish subjects, by kind treatment and due precautions, which did not allow obtrusion on lands claimed by them, without written permits from the Governor; but that such permits were usual, cannot be doubted.|$|E

25|$|Carrying {{the first}} Israeli-issued passport, Meir was {{appointed}} Israel's minister plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union, with her term beginning on September 2, 1948, and ending in March 1949. At the time, {{good relations with}} the Soviet Union were important for Israel's ability to secure arms from Eastern European countries for the struggle that accompanied its independence, while Joseph Stalin and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov sought to <b>cultivate</b> <b>a</b> strong relationship with Israel as a means of furthering the Soviet position in the Middle East. Soviet–Israeli relations were complicated by Soviet policies against religious institutions and nationalist movements, made manifest in moves to shut down Jewish religious institutions as well as the ban on Hebrew language study and the prohibition of the promotion of emigration to Israel.|$|E
25|$|Confucius judged a good ruler by his {{possession}} of de ("virtue"): {{a sort of}} moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others {{without the need for}} physical coercion (Analects 2.1).

Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to <b>cultivate</b> <b>a</b> ruler's de include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.|$|E
