5000|$|The Venus 2000 {{consists}} of a main box linked to a cylindrical [...] "receiver" [...] that fits over the penis by a <b>connecting</b> <b>hose.</b> The [...] "receiver" [...] superficially resembles the teat cup of a milking machine, and contains an inner and outer chamber separated by a cylindrical flexible rubber liner. Only the outer chamber {{is linked to the}} main box, with the inner chamber open to the air at one end, and blocked at the other end by a cap that contains a one-way valve that leads to the open air.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} tubes {{were cut}} from a roll of rubber industrial tubing by his assistant, hence the natural curve of the tube. A curved metal adaptor was designed (Magill oral and nasal connectors) and a 4" [...] black rubber <b>connecting</b> <b>hose</b> to fit to the anesthetic circuit was adapted from an MG car brake hose and named the 'catheter mount' by Magill's theatre technician at Westminster Hospital. Originally, there was no inflatable cuff. The tube was packed {{either side of the}} sub-glottis by two green anaesthetic swabs, with ribbon gauze sewn on by hand to aid extraction at extubation of the endotracheal tube. Anaesthetic gel or ointment was used to lubricate the tube and provide some relief for the patient's sore throat post-procedure.|$|E
5000|$|... 1968 {{was a year}} {{of major}} change. The most {{noticeable}} of which were the new larger, higher mounted C-section bumpers. At the rear, new larger taillamps were adopted {{and were able to}} accommodate backup lamps, which were previously separate bumper-mounted units. Beetles worldwide received the '67 North American style vertical headlamp placement, but with replaceable-bulb headlamps compliant with ECE regulations rather than the US sealed beams. Other improvements were a new outside gas filler with spring-loaded flap, eliminating the need to open the trunk to refuel. The fuel gauge was integrated with the speedometer and was now electrically actuated rather than cable-operated. The windscreen washer was now pressured by the spare tire, which was to be maintained at a pressure of [...] A pressure valve in the <b>connecting</b> <b>hose</b> closed airflow to the fluid reservoir if spare tire pressure fell below , which was above the recommended pressures for the road tires. A ventilation system was introduced, which drew fresh air into the cabin from louvres on the front decklid. For improved shifting, the shift lever was shortened, stiffened and moved rearward by 78 mm.|$|E

50|$|Uncertainties {{commonly}} experienced, {{and possibly}} unaccounted for within a test when using bell provers {{can lead to}} incorrect proofs, by which an operator may adjust a gas meter incorrectly. Temperature inconsistencies between the bell air, meter and <b>connecting</b> <b>hoses</b> can account for most meter proof inaccuracies. Other factors may be mechanical such as stuck or sticky bell rollers or guides, loose piping connections or valves, {{a dent in the}} test area of the bell, incorrect counterweights, and human errors in the operation or calculations.|$|R
50|$|A tank {{container}} can be loaded and unloaded {{from the top}} and the bottom. On a standard {{tank container}} there is a manhole {{and at least one}} valve on the top, and there is a valve at the bottom. Loading and unloading is done by <b>connecting</b> <b>hoses</b> of the loading and unloading facility to the valves of the tank. The loading or unloading is often done using a pump. Depending on the installation and regulation of certain products, it is determined how the tank container should be loaded or unloaded.|$|R

Other available materials include silicone, rubber compounds, galvanized steel, and nylon. It is primarily used to <b>connect</b> <b>hoses</b> to valves, water pumps and deck drains. A 45º elbow, {{also known as}} a [...] "45 bend" [...] or [...] "45 ell", is commonly used in water-supply facilities, food, chemical and electronic industrial pipeline networks, air-conditioning pipelines, agriculture and garden production, and solar-energy facility piping.|$|R

In a parallel effort, the AWSS lines were inspected by city workers, temporary repairs made, and two high-pressure pump stations were brought back into operation at about 8 pm, supplying 10,000 U.S. gallons per minute. Phoenix worked until all the Marina fires were under control, pumping seawater continuously for 15 hours {{at the rate of}} 6,400 gallons per minute, a total of 5.5 million gallons (20.8 ML).|$|R

5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} is passing a coolant (usually water) {{through a series of}} holes drilled through the mould plates and <b>connected</b> by <b>hoses</b> to form a continuous pathway. The coolant absorbs heat from the mould (which has absorbed heat from the hot plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.|$|R
40|$|Bearings today {{need to be}} able to run at {{very high}} speed, {{providing}} high positional accuracy for the structure that it supports, and requiring very little or no maintenance. For this to happen, bearings must have tight tolerances and very low or zero friction during operation. This pushes many traditional contact-type bearings to their limits as they often fail due to friction, generating heat and causing wear. By comparison, existing non-contact bearings fare better because of their very low or zero friction. But some have their own problem too. For example, the fact that aerostatic bearings require an air supply means having to use a separate air compressor and <b>connecting</b> <b>hoses.</b> This makes the installation bulky. Aerodynamic and hydrodynamic bearings cannot support loads at zero speed. Both hydrodynamic and hydrostatic bearings may cause contamination to the work-pieces and the work environment because of the use of lubricating fluid. A potential solution to the above-mentioned problems is the new squeeze film ai...|$|R
