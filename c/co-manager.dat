5|$|Dalglish's {{successor}} Graeme Souness won the FA Cup in {{his first}} full season in charge. In the newly formed Premier League, he struggled to sustain the club's domestic successes, {{and was replaced by}} Roy Evans midway through the 1993–94 season. Liverpool improved to fourth the following season and won the Football League Cup. In 1998, Gérard Houllier was appointed <b>co-manager</b> alongside Evans. The arrangement lasted until November when Evans resigned and Houllier became the sole mananger. The club won a unique treble of trophies in 2001, and a year later finished second to Arsenal, their highest league finish in 11 years. Houllier departed the club in mid-2004.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies show}} that <b>co-managers</b> mainly affect initial public {{offering}} (IPO) aftermarket activities. We investigate the role of <b>co-managers</b> in IPO pre-market activities. We argue that <b>co-managers</b> help reduce IPO placement risk and hypothesize that IPO issuers hire more <b>co-managers</b> when placement risk is higher. We find the number of <b>co-managers</b> is positively associated with three proxies for placement risk. IPOs with more price uncertainty and high-tech IPOs hire more <b>co-managers,</b> while IPOs in regulated industries hire fewer <b>co-managers.</b> We also find larger IPOs, recent IPOs, and IPOs with more reputable lead underwriters hire more <b>co-managers.</b> Copyright 2006, The Eastern Finance Association. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effect on {{expected}} flotation costs of including <b>co-managers</b> in the underwriting syndicate. We consider five components of SEO flotation costs: announcement returns, underpricing, the probability of withdrawals, offering delays, and underwriting spreads. The {{results show that the}} characteristics of <b>co-managers</b> participating in syndicates have significant effects on flotation costs, while the effect of the number of <b>co-managers</b> is largely insignificant. Our results are consistent with the notion that highly reputable underwriters and commercial banks serving as <b>co-managers</b> serve a certification role, reducing information asymmetries and, as a result, lowering SEO flotation costs.

5|$|The {{character}} of Samson, the diminutive <b>co-manager</b> of the carnival, sets up each {{season with a}} monologue, giving glimpses of the show's complex story and good-versus-evil mythology. By telling the story visually and deploying dialogue sparely, Carnivàle is a demanding show {{with a lot of}} subtext, and similar to reading chapters of a book, viewers need to watch episodes of Carnivàle in the right order or risk being spoiled with too little or too much story information. Many reviewers found the story too slow and confusing, but praised the show for its cinematography and realistic portrayal of the 1930s. Carnivàle received much award recognition in mostly technical categories, including fifteen Emmy nominations with five wins.|$|E
5|$|Samson, {{in earlier}} drafts also called Edgar Leiber or Edgar Leonhardt, is the dwarf <b>co-manager</b> of the Carnivàle. His {{original}} biography gave his {{background as a}} dwarf strongman who started his career in 1904. Eight years later, he started working on traveling carnivals, including the Hyde&Teller Company. Samson's wit elevated him from performer to general manager until another character, Management, purchased the carnival (to be renamed Carnivàle) and briefly gave Samson's job to Lodz, a blind mentalist. The beginning of the series shows Samson delegating Management's orders to the carnies. Samson temporarily loses his position to Lodz {{for a second time}} {{near the end of the}} first season but retains Management's trust. The death of Management in season 2 leads to Samson's secret deal with Ben to make the boy the new commander of the carnival.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{appointed}} Frenchman Gérard Houllier as <b>co-manager</b> alongside Evans for the 1998–99 season. Poor results {{put pressure}} on the partnership and after a 3–1 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup, Evans resigned. Houllier's first game as sole manager was a 3–1 defeat to Leeds United. Liverpool's form did not improve under Houllier and early exits in the UEFA and FA Cup were followed by the club finishing the season in seventh place, missing the qualification spots for European competition. Houllier reshaped the squad {{at the start of the}} 1999–2000 season. New players were brought into the squad such as Dietmar Hamann, Sami Hyypiä and Sander Westerveld; David James, Ince and McManaman left the club. Houllier continued the reshaping into the season when he signed forward Emile Heskey for a club record £11million in March. Liverpool failed to secure a return to the UEFA Champions League, as they finished the season in fourth place. Their also performed poorly in the FA and League Cup, exiting early in both competitions.|$|E

5|$|From 1886, Worthington {{began to}} acquire public houses, which {{provided}} a captive market for their product. In order to raise capital for this expansion, the firm became {{a public company}} in 1889, and Horace Brown was created joint managing director alongside William Posnette Manners. By this time the company had an annual output of around 200,000 barrels, and employed 470 people. By 1890, the company's bottling operations equalled those of Bass, Guinness, Allsopp and Whitbread. When William Henry Worthington (1826–1894) died he left no direct heirs and was the fourth and final generation of the family to manage Worthington & Co. Horace Brown left the company in 1894 following a dispute with <b>co-manager</b> William Manners. By 1900, 73 per cent of the company's equity was {{in the hands of}} William Posnette Manners (1846–1915), who had joined the company in 1862 as a junior clerk, and under his astute leadership Worthington acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales. The company acquired the Burton Brewery Company in 1915. On Manners' death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (1879–1968) and Ernest. Arthur was the architect of the merger with archrival Bass in 1927, and proved {{to be more than a}} match for John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, the chairman of the much larger Bass. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger were such that Manners became chairman and joint managing director of Worthington, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass. The amalgamation, described as 'the biggest non-merger in the history of the brewing industry', failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer production and distribution, there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by Manners and his family.|$|E

25|$|The Last Song {{began when}} Disney {{executive}} Jason Reed met with Miley Cyrus to discuss her future career plans. At the time, Cyrus {{had been known}} mainly for starring as a pop star on Disney Channel's Hannah Montana, a children's television series that had expanded into a globally successful media franchise. As the series neared its end, Disney hoped to create a star vehicle to help Cyrus {{break out of the}} pop persona she had developed through the franchise and to introduce Cyrus to older audiences. During her meeting with Reed, Cyrus expressed a desire to film a movie similar to A Walk to Remember, a 2002 film based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks. A Walk to Remember helped Mandy Moore, then a teen pop star much like Cyrus, launch an acting career. Disney called Adam Shankman, director of A Walk to Remember, who signed on to produce the potential Cyrus film along with his sister and Offspring Entertainment production company partner, Jennifer Gibgot. Tish Cyrus, Cyrus' mother and <b>co-manager,</b> became the film's executive producer.

40|$|We examine syndicates for 1, 638 IPOs from January 1997 through June 2002. We find strong {{evidence}} of information production by syndicate members. Offer prices {{are more likely}} to be revised in response to information when the syndicate has more underwriters and especially more <b>co-managers.</b> More <b>co-managers</b> also result in more analyst coverage and additional market makers following the IPO. Relationships between underwriters are critical in determining the composition of syndicates, perhaps because they mitigate free-riding and moral hazard problems.
