Wherever possible avoid sewing in <b>cloth</b> <b>stitch,</b> in corners and in open ground, in other words: don't sew along a straight line but carefully choose the path for the sewings to make it as little visible as possible. Other methods are needle weaving, and the detour technique with knots or overlapping threads.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason the}} patiala dress is {{preferred}} {{by most of}} the women of Punjab and other regions of Northern India is its comfort and durability in summers. Since the patiala salwar is very loose and stitched with pleats it is a very comfortable outfit to wear. Its distinguishing characteristic is folds of <b>cloth</b> <b>stitched</b> together that meet at the bottom. Patiala salwars require double the length of material to get stitched, which is generally four meters in length. The fall of the pleats of the Patiala Salwar is such that it gives a beautiful draping effect. The pleats are stitched on the top to a belt.|$|R

However, she did not begin to exhibit work publicly until 1966 {{when she was in}} her early 30s. Ceridwen Lloyd Morgan attributes this relatively late flowering to {{the fact that she was}} a Welsh woman from a rural background. As Lloyd Jones has stated: [...] "At times I felt that I belonged to the wrong sex and was living in the wrong time and place to be a successful artist." [...] In 1989 she gave up her job as visual arts officer for Dyfed to become a full-time artist. From this point her work evolved to take the form of large irregularly shaped paintings which were unstretched. Such works were associated with <b>cloth,</b> <b>stitching</b> and dye-soaking into the cloth. Later she returned to more traditional forms of painting as well as producing proclamatory banners.|$|R

40|$|This paper focuses upon {{means and}} {{ways in which}} {{knowledge}} gained through textile practice can be expressed using language and imagery drawn from within that practice itself. In this it draws upon écriture feminine to develop a matrix of knowledge upon and within which text and textile intertwine. Here <b>cloth</b> and <b>stitch</b> are considered as co-agents for a disorderly text that dissolves boundaries between theoretical and practice-based concerns through a process that Bracha Ettinger refers to as ‘borderswerving’ (Ettinger 2006). In this paper such disorderly text or working in and through body, <b>cloth</b> and <b>stitch,</b> will be addressed through three points for departure: folding, fraying and seaming. Folding offers a focus upon {{ways in which the}} communication of tacit knowledge within practice initiates and generates new understandings and expressions of that tacit knowledge. The concept of fraying or frayage will be considered in terms of breaking down resistance at the edge, enabling a porosity between practice-based and theoretical perspectives. Seaming will consider how the processes of making can act as agency for written and aural modes of communication. The material processes of seaming suggest a generative and communicative conceptual-material model. These three models offer a materialisation and matrixiation of Barthes ‘Text means Tissue’ (1973, p. 64), suggesting that the material activities of writing textile and making text are allied and intertwined modes of knowledge-generation. Such a disorderly text offers a space for tacit and communicable knowledge and meaning to mingle. Cited Texts Barthes, R., 1973. The Pleasure of the Text, New York: Hill and Wang. Ettinger, B., 2006.

Textile work is still passed on from generation to generation in indigenous communities in the state and is an important source of income for these families.In Michoacán, women weave on back strap looms {{as they did in the}} pre-Hispanic period with most weaving on pedal looms done by men. Sheep are generally shorn twice a year, spring and fall, with the wool obtained in each season requiring different handling because of the types of impurities found. Most wool is white but brown and black is found as well. Wool textile products include sarapes, wrap belts, rebozos, rugs and blankets. Cotton is spun and woven mostly to create clothing and linens—including dresses, shirts, blouses, jackets, tablecloths, table runners, napkins, and bedspreads. The most representative work in cotton comes from Patzcuaro and Uruapan, as well as Zacán and Tócuaro. [...] Other notable cotton work is that of the Nahuas in the coastal areas. These textiles tend to be the most traditional, as they are made for self-consumption, with the pieces created from the growing of the cotton to weaving the cloth to sewing and embroidering the garment. The two towns best known for this work are Cachán and Maruata.|$|R

50|$|After World War II, various {{styles of}} {{camouflage}} cover were used at different times. In the 1960s through 1970s, the type commonly {{seen in the}} United States Army and Marine Corps was a reversible fabric cover called the Mitchell Pattern, with a leafy green pattern {{on one side and}} orange cloud pattern on the other. This type was nearly omnipresent in Vietnam, and where, for the first time, the army wore the cloth camouflage as general issue; whereas in World War II and the Korean War, the army traditionally wore their helmets only with nets, plain without anything on it, or with field-made, non-issue covers without camouflage. By contrast, United States Marines have consistently worn a cloth camouflage cover over their M-1 helmets in all three major wars—World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The Korean War (1950-1953) was largely fought using World War II weapons and equipment, and the Marine Corps helmets and camouflage covers were basically the same as those used during World War II. In Vietnam, the green portion of the reversible fabric camouflage was normally worn outermost. Helmet covers in the (European) woodland camouflage, were designed for fighting in the European Theater of Operations (NATO), and became the post-Vietnam (jungle pattern) camouflage cover used by the U.S. military from the late 1970s onward. The (European) Woodland pattern was not reversible; they were only printed on one side, though some rare desert camouflage examples do exist. These covers were all constructed from two semi-circular pieces of <b>cloth</b> <b>stitched</b> together to form a dome-like shape conforming to the helmet's shape. They were secured to the helmet by folding their open ends into the steel pot, and then placing the liner inside, trapping the cloth between the pot and the liner. An olive green elastic band, intended to hold additional camouflage materials, was often worn around the helmet to further hold the cover in place.|$|R
40|$|Net-shape weft {{knitting}} {{is used to}} produce preforms for complex shape composite parts, {{as illustrated by the}} wheel wells of the Sunrise all-composite electric vehicle. An integrated design for the manufacturing methodology links mechanical performance to <b>cloth</b> and <b>stitch</b> design. The use of drapable net-shape fabrics with tailored fiber reinforcement produced on automated knitting machines allows for a significant reduction in preform manufacturing costs. Net-shape two-dimensional knitted fabrics for the wheel wells are achieved by a combination of shaping techniques: holding, narrowing, widening, and binding off. An interlock stitch is chosen to guarantee sufficient mechanical performance and to protect the brittle knitting yam. The mechanical properties of the composites are studied, and the strength in the weak warp direction where only looped fibers are present is optimized by choosing a sufficiently large loop size. In the weft direction, lay-in yarns are tucked in to increase production speed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{back-stitching}} {{methods were}} experimentally sought, with No. 80 count cotton broadcloth and No. 80 count cotton sewing thread as materials and by sewing the <b>cloth</b> with <b>stitches</b> 4 mm long. The findings obtained {{are as follows}} : 1. When the cloth is sewn once and the seam thus formed is back-stitched, the most effective method is either to fill the interstitch spaces of the seam with each back-stitch (Fig. 1) or to make each back-stitch and the stitch of the seam lie one above the other by half a stitch-length (Fig. 1). 2. Two-threaded stitching differs little in its effectiveness from back-stitching. 3. There is not much to choose between 'hongaeshi nui' or putting in at each stitch a back-stitch of the same length (Fig. 2) and 'hangaeshi nui' or putting in at each stitch a back-stitch of half its length (Fig. 2). 4. Stitches are decidedly less effective and durable when the cloth is machine-sewed than when it is hand-sewed under the same condition. It is to be desired that means should be devised to obtain better stitching effectiveness by taking these experimental findings into consideration...|$|R
