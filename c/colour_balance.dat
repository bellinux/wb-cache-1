40|$|For {{the past}} few years, {{the size of the}} data grows {{exponentially}} with respect to volume, velocity, and dimensionality due to wide spread use of embedded and distributed surveillance camera for security reasons. In this paper, we have proposed an integrated approach for biometric-based image retrieval and processing which addresses the two issues. The first issue is related to the poor visibility of the images produced by the embedded and distributed surveillance cameras, and the second issue is concerned with the effective image retrieval based on the user query. This paper addresses the first issue by proposing an integrated image enhancement approach based on contrast enhancement and <b>colour</b> <b>balancing</b> methods. The contrast enhancement method is used to improve the contrast, while the <b>colour</b> <b>balancing</b> method helps to achieve a <b>balanced</b> <b>colour.</b> Importantly, in the <b>colour</b> <b>balancing</b> method, a new process for colour cast adjustment is introduced which relies on statistical calculation. It adjusts the colour cast and maintains the luminance of the image. The integrated image enhancement approach is applied to the enhancement of low quality images produced by surveillance cameras. The paper addresses the second issue relating to image retrieval by proposing a content-based image retrieval approach. The approach is based on the three features extraction methods namely colour, texture and shape. Colour histogram is used to extract the colour features of an image. Gabor filter is used to extract the texture features and the moment invariant is used to extract the shape features of an image. The use of these three algorithms ensures that the proposed image retrieval approach produces results which are highly relevant to the content of an image query, by taking into account the three distinct features of the image and the similarity metrics based on Euclidean measure. In order to retrieve the most relevant images, the proposed approach also employs a set of fuzzy heuristics {{to improve the quality of}} the results further. The results show the proposed approaches perform better than the well-known existing approaches...|$|R

40|$|The usual {{first step}} in {{automatic}} <b>colour</b> <b>balancing</b> of digital imagery is to estimate the chromaticity of the illumination. Although there are some recent exceptions (Beigpour et al. 2014. Gijsenij et al. 2013), most illumination-estimation methods assume that the relative spectral power distribution of the illumination is constant throughout the scene. However, many scenes contain multiple illuminants with differing SPDs, and we investigate the effect this has on automatic <b>colour</b> <b>balancing.</b> Somewhat surprisingly, the Gehler-Shi data set of 568 images, which is widely used in evaluating competing illumination-estimation methods, contains many images of multiple-illuminant scenes: for example, indoor scenes that also include a window through which daylight is visible. Each image in the dataset contains an Xrite/Macbeth ColorChecker {{that is used to}} provide a ground-truth measure of the illumination’s ‘colour’. However, since many of the scenes do contain multiple illuminants, a single such measurement cannot possibly represent the colour of all the illuminants correctly, but rather must represent some sort of compromise. We investigate how much of an effect this has on a representative set of illumination-estimation methods; namely, MaxRGB, Greyworld, Shades-of-Grey, Edge-based, N-jet and Thin-plate-Spline. We manually sorted the original 568 images into two groups accordin...|$|R

40|$|Security methods {{based on}} {{biometrics}} have been gaining importance increasingly {{in the last}} few years due to recent advances in biometrics technology and its reliability and efficiency in real world applications. Also, several major security disasters that occurred in the last decade have given a new momentum to this research area. The successful development of biometric security applications cannot only minimise such threats but may also help in preventing them from happening on a global scale. Biometric security methods take into account humans’ unique physical or behavioural traits that help to identify them based on their intrinsic characteristics. However, there are a number of issues related to biometric security, in particular with regard to surveillance images. The first issue is related to the poor visibility of the images produced by surveillance cameras and the second issue is concerned with the effective image retrieval based on user query. This research addresses both issues. This research addresses the first issue of low quality of surveillance images by proposing an integrated image enhancement approach for face detection. The proposed approach is based on contrast enhancement and <b>colour</b> <b>balancing</b> methods. The contrast enhancement method is used to improve the contrast, while the <b>colour</b> <b>balancing</b> method helps to achieve a <b>balanced</b> <b>colour.</b> Importantly, in the <b>colour</b> <b>balancing</b> method, a new process for colour cast adjustment is introduced which relies on statistical calculation. It can adjust the colour cast and maintain the luminance of the whole image at the same level. The research addresses the second issue relating to image retrieval by proposing a content-based image retrieval approach. The approach is based on the three welliii known algorithms: colour histogram, texture and moment invariants. Colour histogram is used to extract the colour features of an image. Gabor filter is used to extract the texture features and the moment invariant is used to extract the shape features of an image. The use of these three algorithms ensures that the proposed image retrieval approach produces results which are highly relevant to the content of an image query, by taking into account the three distinct features of the image and the similarity metrics based on Euclidean measure. In order to retrieve the most relevant images the proposed approach also employs a set of fuzzy heuristics to improve the quality of the results further. The integrated image enhancement approach is applied to the enhancement of low quality images produced by surveillance cameras. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by applying three face detection methods (skin colour based face detection, feature based face detection and image based face detection methods) to surveillance images before and after enhancement using the proposed approach. The results show a significant improvement in face detection when the proposed approach was applied. The performance of the content-based image retrieval approach is carried out using the standard Precision and Recall measures, and the results are compared with wellknown existing approaches. The results show the proposed approach perform s better than the well-known existing approaches...|$|R

40|$|When {{producing}} {{a mosaic of}} multiple multi-spectral images one needs to harmonize the colours so that the tone transition is smooth from one image to the other. Given two images Ima and Imb, a transform T is sought to map Imb to an image that is harmonious in multi-spectral appearance to Ima. We give the above problem of tonal harmonization an analytical framework, in which both ideal and practical solutions of the problem are studied. Using a physi-cally motivated image formation model, we prove that a perfect tonal harmonizing operator cannot in general be found, but that whenever such an operator exists it is linear. In the latter case, finding the op-timal harmonizing transformation can be cast as a linear programme (LP), which {{is a type of}} problem that can be efficiently solved using known techniques.
