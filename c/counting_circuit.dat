50|$|Prescalers are {{typically}} used {{at very high}} frequency to extend the upper frequency range of frequency counters, phase locked loop (PLL) synthesizers, and other <b>counting</b> <b>circuits.</b> When {{used in conjunction with}} a PLL, a prescaler introduces a normally undesired change in the relationship between the frequency step size and phase detector comparison frequency.

A dual-modulus prescaler is one that has the ability to selectively divide the input frequency by one of two (normally consecutive) integers, such as 32 and 33. Common fixed-integer microwave prescalers are available in modulus 2, 4, 8, 5 and 10, and can operate at frequencies in excess of 10 GHz.|$|R

40|$|Abstract only availableThe Missouri University Research Reactor has {{the ability}} to measure Mercury (Hg), an {{environmental}} contaminant, using neutron activation analysis. This process turns Hg into radioactive Hg- 203 which emits a 279 keV gamma-ray that can be easily detected using a High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector. The result can be used to determine the percentage of Hg in the sample. Unfortunately, samples containing Hg may contain Selenium (Se) which is activated to Se- 75, also resulting in a 279 keV gamma-ray. The problem is that these two signals can not be separated by the HPGe detector. Fortunately, Se- 75 also emits another gamma-ray at 121 keV in coincidence with the 279 keV gamma-rays.

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the last}} decade multiple-input and multipleoutput (MIMO) systems have been {{actively}} researched and started to be deployed in wireless communications owing to the significant increase in channel capacity. In this paper, we propose an Energy Saving MAC protocol in MIMO (ESMACM) systems by focusing on energy efficiency instead of capacity maximization. ESMACM considers the energy consumption together with the tradeoff between reliability (i. e., diversity) and throughput (i. e., multiplexing gain), and dynamically chooses an appropriate number of antennas for transmission. In computing the total energy consumption, ESMACM <b>counts</b> <b>circuit</b> energy as well as transmission energy. Naturally the circuit energy consumption is directly proportional {{to the number of}} active antennas. Through numerical analysis, we confirm that our ESMACM considerably saves energy consumption compared to conventional capacity maximization schemes that use a fixed number of MIMO channels, for a given outage constraint.
