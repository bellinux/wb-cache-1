25|$|In September 1967 MacInnis {{took part}} in a {{classified}} Ocean Systems mission aboard Deep Diver on the Grand Banks south of Newfoundland. A <b>cable</b> <b>plow,</b> rumored to be used for burying a strategic communications cable, had been lost in 400 feet of water. Two Navy divers had already been killed trying to recover it. MacInnis was one of a crew of four Ocean Systems personnel who unsuccessfully attempted to recover the <b>cable</b> <b>plow</b> using the submersible. The mission was called off due to rising winds, and Deep Diver was barely brought safely back aboard the Canadian Coast Guard vessel CCGS John Cabot. In 1968 MacInnis {{took part in}} a saturation dive aboard the Hydrolab underwater habitat with two other aquanauts, spending 50 hours at a depth of 50 feet, and in the search for the lost submarine USS Scorpion. In late 1968 and early 1969, MacInnis took part in salvage operations after the crash of Pan Am Flight 217 near Caracas, Venezuela.|$|E
25|$|Deep Diver {{carried out}} many {{scientific}} missions in 1967 and 1968 operated from Link's underwater research vessel, Sea Diver. These included a 430-foot lockout dive in 1967 (at {{the same location}} as the 1964 Man in Sea dive by Robert Sténuit and Jon Lindbergh) and a 700-foot lockout dive near Great Stirrup Cay in 1968. Dr. Joseph B. MacInnis participated {{in both of these}} dives as an observer in Deep Divers forward chamber.

50|$|In 1976, Michels began {{producing}} {{crushed aggregates}} to supply materials for various road and building construction projects throughout eastern Wisconsin. The next year, 1977, Michels began constructing rural water distribution systems throughout the Northern Plains. As {{part of this}} development, the company constructed water mains, laterals and residential water service. Michels branched out into fiber optic cable systems in 1983. The company built customized equipment, including the design and fabrication of rail-mounted <b>cable</b> <b>plows.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{arrival of}} the train {{at one of the}} {{approximately}} 60 different dumping grounds, a three-ton steel plow was put on the last car (or a car carrying the plow was attached as the last car) and a huge winch with a braided steel cable stretching the length of all cars was attached to the engine. The winch, powered by the train’s steam engine, pulled the plow the length of the dirt loaded train by winching up the steel <b>cable.</b> The <b>plow</b> scraped the dirt off the railroad cars, allowing the entire trainload of dirt cars to be unloaded in ten minutes or less. The plow and winch were then detached for use on another train. Another plow, mounted on a steam engine, then plowed the dirt spoils away from the track.|$|R
50|$|Deerfield, MO, near Richards, MO, {{was still}} a mutual {{exchange}} in 1971 with magneto service. Some customers within the area petitioned the Missouri Public Service Commission for Bell telephone service because they wanted dial telephone service. Mr. Kern made arrangements to rent some Stromberg-Carlson equipment and <b>plowed</b> <b>cable</b> through the winter of 1972. The Deerfield area was converted to dial within six months. Missouri Union Telephone Company, Deerfield's service provider, was merged into the KLM Telephone Company in 1973.|$|R
