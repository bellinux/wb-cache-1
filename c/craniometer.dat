50|$|He {{concluded}} that skull and facial features were clues to genetic criminality, {{and that these}} features could be measured with <b>craniometers</b> and calipers with the results developed into quantitative research. A few of the 14 identified traits of a criminal included large jaws, forward projection of jaw, low sloping forehead; high cheekbones, flattened or upturned nose; handle-shaped ears; hawk-like noses or fleshy lips; hard shifty eyes; scanty beard or baldness; insensitivity to pain; long arms, and so on.|$|R
25|$|Broca {{first became}} acquainted with {{anthropology}} through {{the works of}} Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1805–1861), Antoine Étienne Reynaud Augustin Serres (1786–1868) and Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau (1810–1892), and anthropology soon became his lifetime interest. He spent much time at his Anthropological Institute, studying skulls and bones, and vigorously attempting to use the measurements obtained by these studies as his main criteria for ranking racial groups in order of superiority. In that sense, Broca was {{a pioneer in the}} study of physical anthropology and scientific racism. He advanced the science of cranial anthropometry by developing many new types of measuring instruments (<b>craniometers)</b> and numerical indices.|$|R
5000|$|Physiognomy {{claimed a}} {{correlation}} between physical features (especially facial features) and character traits. It was made famous by Cesare Lombroso (1835-1909), the founder of anthropological criminology, {{who claimed to be}} able to scientifically identify links between the nature of a crime and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. The originator of the concept of a [...] "born criminal" [...] and arguing in favor of biological determinism, Lombroso tried to recognize criminals by measurements of their bodies. He concluded that skull and facial features were clues to genetic criminality and that these features could be measured with <b>craniometers</b> and calipers with the results developed into quantitative research. A few of the 14 identified traits of a criminal included large jaws, forward projection of jaw, low sloping forehead; high cheekbones, flattened or upturned nose; handle-shaped ears; hawk-like noses or fleshy lips; hard shifty eyes; scanty beard or baldness; insensitivity to pain; long arms, and so on.|$|R

5000|$|John Grattan was an apothecary in Belfast. He had wide {{interests}} in {{natural history and}} {{was a member of the}} Belfast Natural History Society but is best known for his work on ancient Irish skulls collected by his friend Edmund Getty.He devised a system of skull measurements using an ingenious <b>craniometer.</b> [...] "Grattans work was almost contemporaneous with that of Anders Retzius, and nearly all of it was done before the German and French Schools had elaborated their schemes of skull measurements ...|$|E
50|$|Phrenology is {{a process}} that {{involves}} observing and/or feeling the skull to determine an individual's psychological attributes. Franz Joseph Gall believed that the brain was made up of 27 individual organs that determined personality, the first 19 of these 'organs' he believed to exist in other animal species. Phrenologists would run their fingertips and palms over the skulls of their patients to feel for enlargements or indentations. The phrenologist would often take measurements with a tape measure of the overall head size and more rarely employ a <b>craniometer,</b> a special version of a caliper. In general, instruments to measure sizes of cranium continued to be used after the mainstream phrenology had ended. The phrenologists put emphasis on using drawings of individuals with particular traits, to determine the character of the person and thus many phrenology books show pictures of subjects. From absolute and relative sizes of the skull the phrenologist would assess the character and temperament of the patient.|$|E
