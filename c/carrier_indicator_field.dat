40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{association}} between <b>fielding</b> <b>indicators</b> and successful performance in cricket. Ten teams qualified for competition in the Champions League T 20 (2012, South Africa), which was observed and analysed. Looking at three <b>fielding</b> <b>indicators</b> including ground <b>fielding,</b> catching and return throw within the two different areas (inside and outside the 30 yd circle). The Sportscode (Sportstec Ltd 3. 5. 3, Australia) software was used for data collection. A step-wise discriminant analysis was used for prediction of successful performance (winning and losing a match) from <b>fielding</b> <b>indicators.</b> The results showed that <b>fielding</b> <b>indicators</b> were significant predictors (χ 2 = 10. 60, df = 2, p < 0. 01) of the match outcome. The results of a follow-up test showed that catches inside the 30 yd circle (r = 0. 81) and outside the 30 yd circle (r = 0. 85) were significant predictors of match outcome. In conclusion, the successful execution of the catching skill during a game, regardless of the location, could facilitate the team performance at the elite level. Implications of these findings for coaches include showing the importance of the catching skill to predict match outcome, therefore this should be focussed upon throughout the age groups to elite level in training...|$|R

40|$|Can the {{organization}} of local edge measurements into curves be directly related to natural image structure? By viewing curve organization as a statistical estimation problem, we suggest that it can. In particular, the classical Gestalt perceptual organization cues of proximity and good continuation [...] -the basis of many current curve organization systems [...] -can be statistically measured in images. As a prior for our estimation approach we introduce the curve <b>indicator</b> random <b>field.</b> In contrast to other techniques that require contour closure or {{are based on a}} sparse set of detected edges, the curve <b>indicator</b> random <b>field</b> emphasizes the short-distance, dense nature of organizing curve elements into (possibly) open curves. Its explicit formulation allows the calculation of its properties such as its autocorrelation. On the one hand, the curve <b>indicator</b> random <b>field</b> leads us to introduce the oriented Wiener filter, capturing the blur and noise inherent in the edge measurement process. On the other, it suggests we seek such correlations in natural images. We present the results of some initial edge correlation measurements that not only confirm the presence of Gestalt cues, but also suggest that curvature has a role in curve organization...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} high-fidelity surface {{approximation}} technique that aims at a faithful reconstruction of piecewise-smooth surfaces from a scattered point set. The presented method builds on the Moving Least-Squares (MLS) projection methodology, but introduces a fundamental modification: While the classical MLS uses a fixed approximation space, i. e., polynomials of a certain degree, the new method is data-dependent. For each projected point, it finds a proper local approximation space of piecewise polynomials (splines). The locally constructed spline encapsulates the local singularities which may exist in the data. The optional singularity for this local approximation space is modeled via a Singularity <b>Indicator</b> <b>Field</b> (SIF) which is computed over the input data points.

Hence, the predictions from a deterministic model (duros+) can be captured in a probabilistic model (Bayesian Network) such that both the process knowledge and uncertainties can be included in impact and vulnerability assessments.

This study aimed to investigate whether the choice of steric molecular field settings significantly influences the predictive performance of CoMFA and, if so, which is the best. The three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3 D-QSAR) models based on Lennard–Jones, indicator, parabolic and Gaussian steric fields were compared using 28 datasets taken from the literature. The analysis of the predictive ability of these models (cross validated R 2) indicates that steric fields in which the value drops off quickly with distance (i. e. Lennard–Jones and <b>indicator</b> <b>fields)</b> tend to perform better than the Gaussian version, which has a slower and smoother decrease. Furthermore, depending on the steric field type used, the field sampling density (i. e. grid spacing) has a variable influence on the predictive ability of the models generated. Ruchi R.

30|$|Our {{strategy}} {{to deal with}} 3 D crack growth, {{as well as the}} large deformations which we wish to model, necessitates frequent remeshing on a global level. After a predefined number of increments, the surface mesh of the 3 D body is extracted from the model. If crack growth is detected, the surface mesh must be modified to incorporate a new crack segment, see the next section. Otherwise, the existing surface mesh is used as input to the 3 D tetrahedral mesh generator TetGen [32], together with an <b>indicator</b> <b>field</b> for the desired element size. The remeshing aims to produce smaller elements in areas where the damage evolves significantly and larger elements in undamaged regions or regions where the damage growth has stopped. The damage rate is used as a pointwise indicator to set the element size. Elements with the largest damage rate have the smallest volume and vice versa. For the intermediate damage rates, the volume of the elements is interpolated between the maximum and minimum values, proportional to their damage rate.|$|R

We construct <b>indicator</b> <b>fields</b> and time series which, in various combinations, provide models consistent with the principle dynamics previously proposed. Using a multimodel inference approach, we investigate the evidence supporting these models and how it varies in space. We show that, in terms of bottom-up processes alone, there is a dominant physical mechanism, namely mixed-layer shoaling, that best predicts the interannual variation in the initial increase in surface chlorophyll across large sectors of the North Atlantic. We further show that different regions are governed by different physical phenomena and that wind-driven mixing is a common component, with either heat flux or light as triggers. We believe these findings to be relevant to the ongoing discussion on North Atlantic bloom onset...|$|R
