50|$|Often a {{worm gearing}} {{is used to}} reduce the high output speed of the {{electric}} motor. This enables a high reduction ratio within the gear stage, leading to a low efficiency which is desired for the actuators. The gearing is therefore self-locking i.e. it prevents accidental and undesired changes of the valve position by acting upon the valve’s <b>closing</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E
50|$|The torque {{switching}} is {{not only}} used for torque seating in the end position, but it also serves as overload protection over the whole travel and protects the valve against excessive torque. If excessive torque acts upon the <b>closing</b> <b>element</b> in an intermediate position, e.g. due to a trapped object, the torque switching will trip when reaching the set tripping torque. In this situation the end position is not signalled by the limit switch. The controls can therefore distinguish between normal operation torque switch tripping {{in one of the}} end positions and switching off in an intermediate position due to excessive torque.|$|E
50|$|After {{receiving}} an operation command, the actuator moves the valve in direction OPEN or CLOSE. When reaching the end position, an automatic switch-off procedure is started. Two fundamentally different switch-off mechanisms can be used. The controls switch off the actuator {{as soon as}} the set tripping point has been reached. This is called limit seating. However, there are valve types for which the <b>closing</b> <b>element</b> has to be moved in the end position at a defined force or a defined torque to ensure that the valve seals tightly. This is called torque seating. The controls are programmed as to ensure that the actuator is switched off when exceeding the set torque limit. The end position is signalled by a limit switch.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Process {{industry}} involves large plants; mainly {{operating in}} continuous form, to achieve economic mass production output. However {{in some situations}} process vessels and tanks are used, where batch processes, take place. These tanks often contain reactants and products in the liquid state. After treatment or processing, valves are opened to allow the product to drain and vessels may receive the next batch. However, with conventional valves {{there will always be}} an amount of fluid trapped between the valve <b>closing</b> <b>element</b> and the tank or vessel, especially for those which are jacketed to allow heating or cooling. This amount is usually untreated, that is to say has not undergone the changes or processing taking place on the fluid bulk in the vessel. Moreover, no matter how accurately this amount is estimated to be isolated from the processed amount leaving the vessel, it will still contaminate with the processed product. From hygiene point of view, this may not be accepted. In this work a valve design is introduced; where no fluid is trapped between a process tank and the valve <b>closing</b> <b>element.</b> When the valve is opened the fluid flows to the outlet flow line without any contamination with unprocessed fluid. Thus a contamination free valve design is utilised to achieve hygiene design tanks or vessels used in batch based processes. Thus cheap equipment acquiring the hygiene requirements necessary for food and some other products that only can be achieved using expensive mass production lines is obtained...|$|E
40|$|Daylight {{represents}} a free source of illumination of building’s internal spaces. For {{the right and}} optimal use of this resource, {{in addition to the}} resort to some simple designing expedients that can be brought back to the practice of “building in a workmanlike manner”, it is possible to adopt speciﬁc devices able to improve the sunlight captation. Among these devices a class that presents a very interesting compromise between simplicity of realization, costs and daylighting performances is represented by the so-called “light pipes”. Light pipes usually work by means of a device placed on an external <b>closing</b> <b>element</b> which attends to collect, redirect and in some cases, concentrate or collimate the incident luminous ﬂux, and a device situated inside the environments able to transport the daylight inwards the building and distribute it into the deep zone of the rooms so as to obtain a better illuminance distribution. In this work, we propose a light pipe equipped with a ﬂat captation system suitable to be integrated in a building’s facade, without any protrusion as to the architectural envelope. This system includes: a planar <b>closing</b> <b>element,</b> a sunlight’s collecting and deﬂecting device that optimizes the direction of the incoming solar rays as the solar position varies, a rectilinear duct with optical properties suitable for the transport of the sunlight and for its introduction into the room that has to be illuminated. The daylighting performances are simulated in different conditions of external illuminance and it is done an assessment of the lighting energy savings in a test room simulating a class room. At the end, some considerations and applying indications useful for the designer are presented...|$|E

40|$|From {{the second}} half of the 20 th century, a set of {{emerging}} economies have undergone a remarkable developing path. During the first years of the global financial crisis of 2007 – 2008, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) were only slightly affected by its negative impacts. However, after 2013, a considerable growth slowdown period has evolved in these countries with the exception of the Indian economy. In the current study, we examine whether the growth dynamics of the BRICS economies shows significant correlation with the fluctuation of commodity prices, especially in the case of raw materials. Besides applying a cross correlation model on the quarterly commodity price indices and real GDP growth data, the research also focuses on the export structure of the selected fast-growing countries. As a <b>closing</b> <b>element</b> of our paper, a brief analysis is carried out regarding the correlations of growth patterns within the BRICS economies...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a valve arrangement, in particular {{for use in}} pneumatic controls. Since pneumatically activated actuators have a certain leakage rate, the control valve (pilot valve) must remain in permanently open state {{in order to maintain}} the actuator in the open position. This requires high holding forces. The valve arrangement according to the invention, however, consumes energy only for the switchover process from one state to the other and can maintain the selected state without the use of any energy. This is achieved by means of an inlet and an outlet valve, whereby at least the inlet valve is a microvalve which has an idle position in addition to the open and the closed positions. In the idle position, there is a gap between the <b>closing</b> <b>element</b> and the valve seat of the microvalve, said gap being so dimensioned that the leakage rate of the actuator is compensated by the gas flowing through the gap. No energy is consumed in the idle position assumed by the valve when n o external forces are acting on it. In a special design, the valve closes automatically when a defined pressure difference exists...|$|E
40|$|The {{narration}} of the Passion of the Christ was an apologetic tool {{essential for}} the ?rst christians because it provided them with a soteriologist perspective and, also, re?ected {{the political and social}} experiences of the writing communities. The episodes of Jesus’ arrest and death were accounts clearly meant for polemics not only with externals, jews and gentiles, but also with other Christian ?owings. On the basis of this notion we propose to analyse the episode of Jesus’ women disciples in front of the empty sepulchre from a historic perspective which will explain the changes that have taken place {{as a result of the}} positions and interests of the different writers. To do this, we will move around a time span which goes from the middle of the decade of the 70 ’s in Ist century up to the end of IInd century. We will begin the analysis with the Gospel of Mark, the ?rst testimony of the episode of the empty tomb. This episode is considered a novelty which comes from the Christian-helenistic circle of Antioch, since Paul did not seem to have known about it in his letters. Then we will proceed to consider the versions proposed by the Gospels of Matthew, Luke, John, the Epistula Apostolorum and the Gospel of Peter.
