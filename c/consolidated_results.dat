The analysis illustrates the limits of conventional Monte Carlo techniques for the simulation of dynamical systems where the uncertainty is expressed in a non probabilistic form.

In this paper, we propose an ontology to capitalize such information and knowledge, with an efficient reuse objective. This ontology, for which specific taxonomies have been defined according to the relevant literature of the domain, is illustrated on a set of data on previous experimental campaigns, corresponding to two kinds of mechanical experiments: tribology tests and material characterization tests...|$|E

In this study, the use of FDTD simulation of the GPR signal is analyzed by simulating three different types of flexible pavement at two different center frequencies of investigation commonly used for road surveys.

40|$|This report concludes {{the first}} phase of the NEU-CO 2 network, {{covering}} the period from January 1999 to June 2000. Within this period, two workshops were held, one in Paris in September 1999 and the other in Brussels in April 2000. The results of these workshops represent the basis of this report. The workshop papers have also been compiled in workshop proceedings which are publicly available. Due to the success of the NEU-CO 2 network, the partners decided to apply for the continuation of this activity which was recently accepted by the European Commission. The second phase of the NEU-CO 2 network will start in Fall 2000 and will continue for 18 months.

In particular, the present study that has involved 41 families with an adolescent 14 - 17 years old has the aim to analyze the intergenerational continuity of risk’s beliefs between parents and their children. In this study, we explored the construct of risk acceptability. We investigated the presence of a relation between parental risk’s beliefs and adolescent risk’s beliefs and the influence on this relationship of parental dynamics. Results showed that the parental risk acceptability predict the children risk acceptability but not children risk behavior. Again, we found that when children perceive low maternal warmth and high antagonism, the link between parental and adolescents risk acceptability increase in size. On the contrary, paternal high warmth and low antagonism influences the relationship between two beliefs. So, results support the current literature in emphasize parental framework as highly influencing the adjusted or misadjusted outcomes...|$|E
