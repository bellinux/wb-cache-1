40|$|A 406 MHz SARSAT {{experiment}} {{using the}} GOES system {{to demonstrate the}} utility of integrating a near-instantaneous distress alerting capability achievable by the geostationary satellites with the location capability of the low altitude, near-polar orbiting satellite system is described. Tests include the evaluation of technical performance of a variety of maritime, aviation, and land-based SARSAT beacons under operational environment conditions as well as a demonstration of system effectiveness in pseudo real distress incident situations. The technical performance tests parallel the CCIR <b>coordinated</b> <b>trials</b> <b>program</b> conducted at L-band frequencies using the INMARSAT satellites.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaFor {{maritime}} {{applications of}} distress communications via geostationary satellites a special method of signal processing was developed, called superposition technique. The data frame containing the alert message {{is transmitted from}} a distress equipment repeatedly. After being relayed by the satellite the signal is detected and improved by superimposing the frames. Around 14 dB is the actual processing gain. Thus a distress buoy is able to transfer a message {{from all over the}} world with high reliability by only transmitting a power of 50 mW omnidirectionally over a slant range of about 40 000 km. The described system, called the Distress Radio Call System (DRCS) was tested in a <b>Coordinated</b> <b>Trials</b> <b>Program</b> (CTP) of 6 nations. Both in a simulation phase and in a field test under exactly the same environmental conditions the DRCS with its superposition technique was able to detect signals with lowest signal-to-noise-density ratio without error. In laboratory tests using GAUSS channel conditions, a system threshold of 13 dB-Hz could be demonstrated. In a real environment (North Cape) 15 dB-Hz was the lower limit for error-free reception. CCIR approved a recommendation in June, 1984 for a system operating through geostationary satellites at 1. 6 GHz being a DRCS-type with very little modifications...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} model to {{estimate}} potential drug-plan cost sav-ings from a <b>trial</b> prescription <b>program,</b> to test the model using data from existing <b>trial</b> prescription <b>programs,</b> and to determine the sensitivity of predicted cost savings to variation in program parameters. DESIGN: Information on <b>trial</b> prescrip-tion <b>programs</b> {{was obtained from the}} published literature, project reports, and personal communications with program administrators. Conceptual models of the determinants of trial-prescription initiation and discontinu-ation were used to guide the develop-ment of a spreadsheet-based cost estimation model that used prescrip-tion claims data. The model was test-ed by comparing predicted to actual cost savings for a <b>trial</b> prescription <b>program</b> in a private drug plan. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine critical model inputs. SETTING: Provincial pharmacy associ-ations and other organizations known to have developed or participated in <b>trial</b> prescription <b>programs.</b> RESULTS: Inaccurate estimates of eli-gible prescriptions and their average daily drug cost, possibly attributable to a change in insurer, resulted in an inaccurate prediction of net cost sav-ings. Model results were sensitive to trial-entry rate, discontinuation rate, daily drug cost, and the number of days supply dispensed {{in the absence of a}} trial. CONCLUSION: To achieve maximal return on investment, <b>trial</b> prescription <b>programs</b> should target drugs with high cost and adverse-effect rates. Before <b>trial</b> prescription <b>programs</b> can be fully endorsed as a managed care strategy, however, peer-reviewed research is needed...|$|R
