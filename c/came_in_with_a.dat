5|$|Booth {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for New South Wales against Queensland in the 195455 Sheffield Shield. He made a duck {{in the first}} innings before adding 19 in the second. New South Wales won, but Booth was dropped when the Test players returned from international duty. Booth was recalled a month later for a match against Len Hutton's English cricket team at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Arthur Morris and Bill Watson had to withdraw at late notice and Booth was asked to play, having already started his day's work as a teacher at Hurlstone Agricultural College. He caught a train and arrived at the ground {{more than half an}} hour after the start of play, by which time New South Wales had collapsed to 3/12. New South Wales fell further to 5/26 before Booth <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> borrowed cap and bat to join Peter Philpott. They put on an 83-run partnership, and Booth eventually finished the innings unbeaten on 74 as the hosts folded for 172. Booth made a duck in the second innings and took his maiden first-class wicket as New South Wales defeated Hutton's men. It was only the tourists' second loss for the campaign, and the last match in Booth's debut season.|$|E

25|$|Both teams saw success {{over the}} next few seasons and {{appeared}} in the playoffs multiple times, and would ultimately go on to have a rematch in the 2011 NBA Finals. It was also the first time that either team had reached the Finals since 2006. This time, however, Miami was favored to win after a highly publicized event when Miami signed LeBron James and Chris Bosh to their roster. Dallas <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 57–25 record while the Heat came in 58–24. Miami won the first game 92–84, but Dallas went on to win four of the next five and upset the Heat to win the first title in franchise history.|$|E
25|$|The Mavericks-Heat rivalry is a {{testament}} to when the two teams faced each other in the NBA finals on two separate occasions. First they came head to head in the 2006 NBA Finals, in which the two teams captured their first respective conference titles. The Mavericks came into the series 60–22 with a strong group of players while the Miami Heat <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> respectable 52–30 record and sported an aging but still strong Shaquille O'Neal as well as an up-and-coming Dwyane Wade. Dallas was favored by many in the media to win the series. The Dallas Mavericks won the first two games but Miami went on to sweep the next four and win the NBA championship {{for the first time in}} team history.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the third}} time that he has taken 10 wickets in a match in his test career. South Africa duly {{completed}} the chase with nine wickets in hand, giving them a 2–0 series lead and their first ever Test series win in Australia. It was also Australia's first home series defeat in 16 years. Steyn was named man of the match for this performance. Steyn made a rearguard effort in attempting to prevent an Australian victory in the 3rd Test in Sydney frustrating the hosts with 28 runs in 65 balls in a 50 run partnership from 105 balls with Makhaya Ntini {{in order to try}} to secure the draw. However, when he was out with 50 balls to go, injured captain Graeme Smith <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> broken hand in an attempt to hold out. Smith was eventually bowled out by Mitchell Johnson with ten balls to go.|$|E
50|$|Cameroon on {{the other}} hand <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> all-domestic line-up which meant regular players who play abroad like Alex Song would not play in the tournament.

25|$|On July 13, 2016, Dempsey {{picked up}} his first MLS red card after putting {{his hands in the}} face of FC Dallas midfielder Juan Esteban Ortiz, who <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> late {{challenge}} on Dempsey. Earlier in the game, Dempsey scored and provided an assist on Jordan Morris's goal. On August 7, Dempsey scored a hat-trick against Orlando City to capture their second road victory of the 2016 season. Dempsey played his last game of the season on August 21 against Portland, picking up a brace in the 3–1 win while simultaneously setting a franchise record for the most goals by a player against one team in MLS play, with the goals being his 7th and 8th. While his absence in Seattle's next game at Houston was a scheduled rest, Dempsey was sidelined with an irregular heartbeat ahead of their Cascadia rivalry tie in Portland. After returning to training in September, Dempsey was ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} season by general manager Garth Lagerwey on September 27.|$|E
25|$|With {{four games}} {{left in the}} season, the Bucs needed to win {{only one of them}} to make the playoffs. In the first, STP was put all over the goal posts in Tampa to prevent the goalposts from being ripped down {{in the event of a}} celebration. Four blocked kicks later, the Bucs wasted the oily substance, falling to the Minnesota Vikings 23–22. STP was wasted again the {{following}} week as the Bucs were shut out 14–0 by the Chicago Bears, and in O. J. Simpson's final home game in San Francisco, Tampa Bay lost its third straight attempt to clinch a division title against a 49ers team which <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 1–13 record. However, in the season finale at home against the Kansas City Chiefs, which was played in the worst downpour in Bucs history, Tampa Bay pulled out a 3–0 victory. Finishing with a 10–6 record, the Bucs had their first winning season in franchise history, and won the Central Division in a tiebreaker over the Bears. In an upset, the Bucs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24–17 in the divisional round of the playoffs. Because the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the other NFC playoff game, the Bucs hosted the NFC Championship Game the following week in Tampa. The Bucs lost to the Rams 9–0. In their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay's five-year plan.|$|E
25|$|Alan Davidson (5/25) and Bobby Simpson {{combined}} to ruin England's reply. Beginning at medium pace ‘Davo’ was chopped onto the stumps by an awful looking stroke from Geoff Pullar and tormented Ted Dexter, who played and missed his first four balls. Dexter was out, {{caught in a}} superb leaping dive by Simpson off the shoulder of his bat and David Sheppard followed a ball and edged it into Simpson's willing hands. Richie Benaud (1/29) brought himself on before tea and Colin Cowdrey became Simpson's third victim to leave England 37/4. Ken Barrington (21) and Peter Parfitt (28) hung until Barrington was bowled by Garth McKenzie (3/26). The England batsmen had now given up making runs and made only 49 from the last 31 overs of the day. Fred Titmus stayed in for 44 minutes for 6 runs until caught by Brian Booth off Norm O'Neill (1/7). John Murray <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strapped shoulder and bravely batted out the day to 86/6. He continued the following morning to make 3 not out in 100 minutes with effectively one hand. McKenzie and Davidson sportingly bowled straight to the injured keeper and settled the matter at the other end. McKenzie dismissing Pullar, caught by O'Neill, and Trueman, caught behind by Barry Jarman. Davidson clean bowled Brian Statham and had Len Coldwell lbw and England were out for 104. It was their lowest score at the Sydney Cricket Ground since 1901-02 and gave them a lead of only 64.|$|E

25|$|Nate Davis {{gave the}} Cardinals their first {{touchdown}} {{in the second quarter}} when he pitched the ball to Briggs Orsbon and sprinted toward the sideline, where Orsbon found him open for an easy four-yard catch into the end zone. In the third quarter, Davis completed a five-yard touchdown pass to Darius Hill and a six-yard touchdown pass to Orsbon. On the final play of the third quarter, Eastern Michigan's Andy Schmitt completed a seven-yard pass to Jacory Stone to give the Eagles their first points of the game. MiQuale Lewis, who <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> streak of six straight games rushing for at least 100yards, was held to 75yards, but scored a 52-yard touchdown two plays into the fourth quarter. Trey Buice finished the rout for the Cardinals with a 45-yard interception return for a touchdown midway through the final quarter, and Ian McGarvey’s extra-point kick extended his school record to 48in a row. Davis passed for 241yards and Schmitt finished with a career-high 309yards passing. Ball State's defense held the Eagles to 67yards rushing and had two interceptions. With the victory, Ball State moved up two spots in the Associated Press poll to #18, up three spots to #19in the USA Today coaches poll, and up four spots to #16in the BCS poll. During their second bye week, the Cardinals' moved up two spots to #16 in the Associated Press poll and one spot to #18 in the USA Today coaches poll. However, the Cardinals moved down one spot to #17 in the BCS poll.|$|E
25|$|Following a bye {{week and}} two {{consecutive}} blowout losses, the Bears faced the Bruins in Los Angeles. Both teams <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3–2 overall record and {{were looking for}} their first conference win. The Bears scored their first touchdown in three games on their opening possession, when running back Shane Vereen was able to run 42 yards for a score. The Bears then recovered a fumble caused by a sack of Bruins quarterback Kevin Prince, which set up a 43-yard touchdown pass from Kevin Riley to Marvin Jones. UCLA responded on the ensuing possession with a 48-yard kickoff return by Terrence Austin which helped set up a 7-yard run by Jonathan Franklin. In the second quarter, Cal scored first when Riley connected with Jahvid Best for a 51-yard touchdown. UCLA countered when Franklin was able to break free for a 74-yard touchdown run on the following possession. After being pinned at the Cal 7-yard line following a UCLA punt, Best had his first rushing touchdown in three games when {{he was able to}} run for a 93-yard score, the third longest touchdown run in school history. Both teams then traded scoring drives, with a Bruins field goal coming after, Riley connecting with Marvin Jones for a 24-yard score, and another Bruins field goal to close out the half. The second half was much quieter, with both teams scoring on field goals in the third quarter, and the final score of the game coming in the fourth when Mychael Kendricks intercepted Prince for a 69-yard touchdown return.|$|E

500|$|Ramsey's {{opinion that}} Dodgin had treated him unfairly was {{not shared by}} the other Southampton players, who {{respected}} Ellerington as a player of comparable ability. According to the wing-half Joe Mallett, Ramsey was also motivated to leave by a dressing-room row with his captain Bill Rochford at half-time during that final League match against Sheffield Wednesday: one of the Sheffield Wednesday goals was blamed on Ramsey's failure to play an opposing winger offside. The Southampton chairman and board tried to persuade Ramsey to stay, but his mind was made up—he told them that if {{he played in the}} reserve team it would hinder his chances of playing internationally. Liverpool, Luton Town and Burnley were among the clubs who expressed interest in buying him but {{by the time of the}} transfer deadline on 16 March only Sheffield Wednesday had made a concrete bid.

Keith Moon used a new double bass drum kit owned by roadie Tony Haslam, after Premier had refused to loan him any more equipment due to continual abuse.

Singer Roger Daltrey later said that Townshend often <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> half-finished demo recording, adding [...] "we probably did as much talking as we did recording, sorting out arrangements and things." [...] Townshend asked Entwistle to write two songs ("Cousin Kevin" [...] and [...] "Fiddle About") that covered the darker themes of bullying and abuse. [...] "Tommy's Holiday Camp" [...] was Moon's suggestion of what religious movement Tommy could lead. Moon got the songwriting credit for suggesting the idea, though the music was composed and played by Townshend. [...] A significant amount of material had a lighter style than earlier recordings, with greater prominence put on the vocals. Moon later said, [...] "It was, at the time, very un-Wholike.
