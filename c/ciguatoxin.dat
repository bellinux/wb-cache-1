50|$|Metabolism of gambierol is {{not known}} yet, but the {{expectation}} is that gambierol acts almost {{the same as the}} <b>ciguatoxins.</b> <b>Ciguatoxins</b> are polycyclic polyether compounds. Their molecular weight is between 1.023 and 1.159 Dalton. Gambierol is structurally similar to <b>ciguatoxins</b> and it can be synthesized together with them. Excretion of these <b>ciguatoxins</b> is largely via the feces and in smaller amounts via urine. The compounds are very lipophilic and will therefore diffuse to multiple organs and tissues, for example the liver, fat and the brain. The highest concentration was found in the brain, but muscles contained the highest total amount after a few days. Because gambierol is lipophilic, it can easily persist and accumulate in the fish food chain. The detoxification pathways are still unknown, but it is possible to eliminate the gambierol. This will take several months or years.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Ciguatoxins</b> are cyclic poly ether toxins, {{derived from}} manne dinoflagellates, which are {{responsible}} for the symptoms of ciguatera poisoning. Ingestion of tropical and subtropical fin fish contaminated by <b>ciguatoxins</b> results in an illness characterised by neurological. cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disorders. The pharmacology of <b>ciguatoxins</b> is characterised by their ability to cause persistent activation of voltage-gated sodium channels, to increase neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release, to impair synaptic vesicle recycling, and to cause cell swelling. It is these effects, in combination with an action to block voltage-gated potassium channels at high doses, which are believed to underlie the complex of symptoms associated with ciguatera. This review examines the sources, structures and pharmacology of <b>ciguatoxins.</b> In particular, attention is placed on their cellular modes of actions to modulate voltage-gated ion channels and other Na +-dependent mechanisms in numerous cell types and to current approaches for detection and treatment of ciguatera...|$|R

Fourteen P-CTX or P-CTX congeners were identified with protonated molecular ions [M + H](+) m/z 1095. 7 (two), 1111. 6 (six) or 1127. 7 (six), including dominant ions for P-CTX- 1, - 2 and - 3. In addition to the protonated species, each of these <b>ciguatoxins</b> gave rise to prominent [M + NH 4](+) and [M + Na](+) ions. The 11 new P-CTX congeners, not readily detected by mouse bioassay, were present in trace amounts (2 - 13 % of P-CTX- 2 levels) and identified as several oxidized P-CTX- 1, - 2 and - 3, and a possible diasteriomer of P-CTX- 1. Acetonitrile-water gradients buffered with 1 mM ammonium acetate improved the separation and detection of the minor <b>ciguatoxins</b> compared with an acetonitrile-water gradient modified with 0. 1 % TFA. Turbo-assisted HPLC/MS had sufficient sensitivity to detect P-CTX- 1 in a crude extract from the flesh of an Australian ciguateric fish.

40|$|Optimised {{gradient}} reversed-phase high-performance {{liquid chromatography}} electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (LC/MS) methods, in combination with a [H- 3]-brevetoxin binding assay (RLB), revealed multiple <b>ciguatoxins</b> in a partially purified extract of a highly toxic Lutjanus sebae (red emperor) from the Indian Ocean. Two major <b>ciguatoxins</b> of 1140. 6 Da (I-CTX- 1 and - 2) and two minor <b>ciguatoxins</b> of 1156. 6 Da (I-CTX- 3 and - 4) were identified. Accurate mass analysis revealed that I-CTX- 1 and - 2 and Caribbean C-CTX- 1 had indistinguishable masses (1140. 6316 Da, at 0. 44 ppm resolution). Toxicity estimated from LC/MS/RLB responses indicated that I-CTX- 1 and - 2 were both similar to 60 % the potency of Pacific ciguatoxin- 1 (P-CTX- 1). In contrast to <b>ciguatoxins</b> of the Pacific where the more oxidised <b>ciguatoxins</b> are more potent, I-CTX- 3 and - 4 were similar to 20 % of P-CTX- 1 potency. Interconversion in dilute acid or on storage, typical of spiroketal and hemiketal functionality found in P-CTXs and C-CTXs, respectively, was not observed to occur between I-CTX- 1 and - 2. The ratio of CTX- 1 and - 2 varied depending on the fish extract being analysed.

40|$|Ciguatera is {{a disease}} caused by the {{consumption}} of fishes from tropical and subtropical waters that have accumulated lipophilic sodium channel activator toxins known as <b>ciguatoxins</b> (CTXs) to levels sufficient to cause human poisoning. Consumption of these temperature-stable, orally active polycyclic ether compounds leads to the activation of neuronal sodium channels that produces a range of characteristic neurological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular signs and symptoms that clinically define the illness. Ciguatera is estimated to affect similar to 50, 000 people annually worldwide after accounting for misdiagnosis and non-reporting. Currently there are no clinically validated treatments and no routine tests that can cost-effectively detect <b>ciguatoxins</b> prior to consumption, with government bans on capture or personal avoidance of risk fish species providing the only effective means to mitigate the risk currently.

5000|$|The current {{estimated}} global incidence annually is 20,000 to 50,000 people, {{though a}} large number of cases are believed to go unreported.

50|$|In Northern Australia, where ciguatera is {{a common}} problem, two {{different}} folk science methods are widely believed to detect whether fish harbor significant <b>ciguatoxin.</b> The first method is that flies are supposed not to land on contaminated fish.

50|$|There is no {{effective}} treatment or antidote for ciguatera poisoning. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care. There {{is some evidence}} that calcium channel blockers like nifedipine and verapamil are effective in treating some of the symptoms that remain after the initial sickness passes, such as poor circulation and shooting pains through the chest. These symptoms are due to the cramping of arterial walls caused by maitotoxin <b>Ciguatoxin</b> lowers the threshold for opening voltage-gated sodium channels in synapses of the nervous system.

40|$|Thirteen {{strains of}} Gambierdiscus toxicus {{isolated}} from Queensland (Australia), Hawaii, French Polynesia and the Virgin Islands were mass cultured and extracted for <b>ciguatoxin.</b> A biodetrital sample containing wild G. toxicus {{collected from the}} Republic of Kiribati was also extracted for <b>ciguatoxin.</b> <b>Ciguatoxin,</b> as characterized from moray eels, was not detected {{in any of the}} strains examined. Two Queensland strains and the wild G. toxicus produced putative <b>ciguatoxin</b> precursors named gambiertoxins. These gambiertoxins were less polar than <b>ciguatoxin</b> but produced bioassay signs in mice and in-vitro responses in isolated guinea pig atria and vas deferens which were similar (but not identical) to those produced by <b>ciguatoxin.</b> The gambiertoxins from cultured cells were also shown to competitively inhibit the binding of [H- 3]brevetoxin- 3 to rat brain membranes in a dose-dependent manner. The gambiertoxins were more potent than <b>ciguatoxin</b> (on a per mouse unit basis) at stimulating neural elements of guinea pig atria. The two culture strains produced similar amounts of gambiertoxins, even when grown in nutrient media made from different seawater containing different concentrations of nutrients. Changes in nutrient media did not induce the other strains of G. toxicus to produce gambiertoxins. The production of these <b>ciguatoxin</b> precursors appears to be limited to only certain genetic strains of G. toxicus, with the majority of strains not producing these toxins. We propose that ciguatera occurs when blooms of G. toxicus strains genetically capable of producing these <b>ciguatoxin</b> precursors enter the marine food chain. These toxins could then become oxidatively metabolized in fishes to the more polar <b>ciguatoxin.</b> Wild cells produced approximately 100 -fold greater quantities of gambiertoxins per cell than did the two culture strains indicating that there is considerable potential for increased production of these <b>ciguatoxin</b> precursors from G. toxicus in culture...|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} harvesting {{of tropical}} marine resources {{has contributed to}} an increased incidence of human intoxication associated with fish consumption. Of these fish poisonings, ciguatera {{is arguably the most}} significant, both {{in terms of the number}} and the severity of poisoning episodes. The disease is associated with the consumption of many species of tropical and subtropical fishes from the Indo-Pacific Oceans and Caribbean Sea that have become contaminated by <b>ciguatoxins</b> which arise from blooms of certain strains of the benthic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus. Environmental degradation may play a role in the increased incidence of ciguatera, although the precise factors involved remain elusive. The role played by other marine toxins in ciguatera, including other toxins produced by benthic dinoflagellates, has not been demonstrated, although mild cases of palytoxin poisoning may be mistaken for ciguatera. Over the last decade there have been rapid advances in our knowledge of the precise chemical and pharmacological properties of the toxins which contribute to the different forms of fish poisoning, especially those toxins involved in ciguatera.

In the Caribbean, ciguatera causes a polymorphic syndrome with gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological signs and symptoms. Neurological and muscular dysfunctions can be treated by intravenous injection of D-mannitol. The lipid-soluble toxins involved are <b>ciguatoxins</b> that are likely produced by the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus. G. toxicus strains are endemic in the Caribbean Sea and in the Western Atlantic. Although {{it is likely that}} blooms of G. toxicus are ingested by herbivorous fishes, they are not implicated in ciguatera in the Caribbean. Rather, large carnivores (barracudas, jacks, snappers, groupers), consumers of smaller benthic fish, are often involved in ciguatera.
