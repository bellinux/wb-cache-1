40|$|A study {{based on}} the literature, an on- farm audit and expert knowledge, was carried out to {{determine}} 1) the risks of spread of animal diseases among farms; 2) odour nuisance due to carcasses at the rendering plant; and 3) measurements to reduce these risks. It was concluded that the possible risks of spread of animal diseases among farms due to the removal of carcasses mainly {{has to do with}} the entrance of the place from where the carcasses are collected by the driver of the truck, the contact of the grab of the haulier with the cadaver container or place and driving with the haulier which is not fully closed. The true size of the risk of spread of disease is unknown and is probably different for each pathogen. Strict hygiene measurements by the driver and farmer can reduce the risk of spread of animal diseases due to cadaver removal. According to the interviewees at the expert assessment session, the odour nuisance at the rendering plant due to carcasses is mainly caused by bacterial conversion of proteins. Cooling of carcasses contribute to the slowing down of the conversions. No unambigious answer could be obtained as to the cooling temperature: not lower than - 7 °C because of the processing at the rendering plant and preferably not higher than 5 °C. Frequent removal of carcasses from the farms and a quick handling at the rendering plant may also reduce odour nuisance at the rendering plant.

40|$|Approximately 2. 2 million cattle <b>carcasses</b> require <b>disposal</b> {{annually}} in the United States. Land burial is a convenient disposal method that has been widely used in animal production for disposal of both daily mortalities as well as during catastrophic mortality events. To date, greenhouse gas production after mortality burial has not been quantified, and this study represents the first attempt to quantify greenhouse gas emissions from land burial of animal carcasses. In this study, anaerobic decomposition of both homogenized and unhomogenized cattle carcass material was investigated using bench-scale reactors. Maximum yields of methane and carbon dioxide were 0. 33 and 0. 09 m 3 /kg dry material, respectively, a higher methane yield than that previously reported for municipal solid waste. Variability in methane production rates were observed over time and between reactors. Based on our laboratory data, annual methane emissions from burial of cattle mortalities in the United States could total 1. 6 Tg CO 2 equivalents. Although this represents less than 1 % of total emissions produced by the agricultural sector in 2009, greenhouse gas emissions from animal carcass burial may be significant if disposal of swine and poultry carcasses is also considered...|$|R

Cluster analyses of volunteer-observed WVC were performed using spatial autocorrelation tests for parts or all of 34 state highways and interstates. Statistically-significant WVC hotspots were modeled using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. High density locations of WVC, that were not necessarily hotspots, were also visualized.

40|$|Background and Aim: Environmental impacts from carcass {{management}} {{are a significant}} concern globally. Despite a history of costly, ineffective, and environmentally damaging <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> efforts, large animal <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> methods have advanced little in the past decade. An outbreak today will likely be managed with the same <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> techniques used in the previous decades and will likely result in the same economic, health, and environmental impacts. This article overviews the results of one field test that was completed in Virginia (United States) using the aboveground burial (AGB) technique and the disposal of 111 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) infected sheep in Tunisia using a similar methodology. Materials and Methods: Researchers in the United States conducted a field test to assess the environmental impact and effectiveness of AGB in decomposing livestock carcasses. The system design included a shallow trench excavated into native soil and a carbonaceous base placed {{on the bottom of}} the trenches followed by a single layer of animal carcasses. Excavated soils were subsequently placed on top of the animals, and a vegetative layer was established. A similar methodology was used in Tunisia to manage sheep infected with FMDs, Peste des Petits Ruminants virus, and Bluetongue Virus. Results: The results of the field test in the United States demonstrated a significant carcass degradation during the 1 -year period of the project, and the migration of nutrients below the carcasses appears to be limited thereby minimizing the threat of groundwater contamination. The methodology proved practical for the disposal of infected sheep carcasses in Tunisia. Conclusions: Based on the analysis conducted to date, AGB appears to offer many benefits over traditional burial for catastrophic mortality management. Ongoing research will help to identify limitations of the method and determine where its application during large disease outbreaks or natural disasters is appropriate...|$|E

40|$|Koi Herpesvirus (KHV), a species-specific DNA virus of {{the family}} Herpesviridae, is {{responsible}} for mass mortalities of common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio L.) throughout the world. KHV’s broad geographical distribution and relatively high mortality rate among infected fish, creates significant disposal issues when die-offs occur, especially {{taking into account the}} body burden of contaminants in the fish. In locales where adequate disposal facilities are unavailable, or are unable to accommodate additional loadings of contaminated fish carcasses, concerns regarding human and environmental health are raised. During the summer of 2008, residents of the Lake Simcoe Region of southern Ontario, Canada, were faced with a massive die-off of carp, infected with KHV. Carp within the Great Lakes and much of the world are known to bioaccumulate (and biomagnify) contaminants, such as, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides (e. g., dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, DDT, and toxic metals (e. g., mercury). These contaminants have been associated with numerous adverse effects on both human and environmental health, and are thus of important considerations when planning for large-scale <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal,</b> following fish die-offs. Although suites of microbiological tests and water quality assessments are frequently conducted to identify causative factors during extensive fish-kills - assessments of relative contaminant burdens in the carcasses, which should dictate the most appropriate method of <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> - are rarely performed. A case study on Snake Island, Lake Simcoe, Ontario was conducted to further examine the implications of this policy. Soil samples from two known disposal sites and three presumed control locations were sampled on Snake Island and sent to the Analytical Services Unit of Queen’s University for chemical analysis.

40|$|As <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> options become limited, it is {{important}} that the disposal tools implemented protect human, livestock and environmental health. Burial, composting, and rendering are among the most common methods. With shallow burial or dragging carcasses out back, there are issues with wildlife and pets being exposed to carcasses and liquids leaving the carcass. Carcass burial is legal in most states but there is little assurance that pathogens are killed and the concentration of carcasses could affect ground or surface water. Burying animals does not ensure that they will degrade. Composting is a viable option that may provide the assurance needed to reduce the risk of disease affecting health or the environment. A comparison of disposal options shows that properly composted carcasses generate little leachate and that pathogen levels are reduced to lower than soil background levels. If composting is performed using too dense material that is not able to reach temperature, more leachate is generated and can become problematic in terms of nutrient loading as well as resulting in higher pathogen levels in the end product. Research shows there is flexibility in the process (as long as carbon source is not too dense) and composting can be used as a safe disposal method...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{mortality}} {{losses are}} {{a normal part}} of livestock and poultry production facilities. Producers may have losses due to disease, accidents, inter-animal competition or natural disasters such as flooding.

The producer is responsible for disposing of these mortalities within 48 hours in an environ-mentally acceptable manner. Safe disposal of carcasses is an important issue for day-to-day, routine management of livestock and poultry mortalities to prevent disease transmission and to protect air and water quality. Therefore, <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> remains one of the major problems facing livestock and poultry producers.

To address this, cadavers of juvenile rats (Rattus rattus) were buried in one of three contrasting soils (Sodosol, Rudosol, and Vertosol) from tropical savanna ecosystems in Queensland, Australia and incubated at 29 °C, 22 °C, or 15 °C in a laboratory setting. Cadavers and soils were destructively sampled at intervals of 7 days over an incubation period of 28 days. Measurements of decomposition included cadaver mass loss, carbon dioxide–carbon (CO 2 –C) evolution, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), protease activity, phosphodiesterase activity, and soil pH, which were all significantly positively affected by cadaver burial. A temperature effect was observed where peaks or differences in decomposition that at occurred at higher temperature would occur at later sample periods at lower temperature.
