5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic <b>cats</b> <b>and</b> raccoons.

Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic <b>cats</b> <b>and</b> wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Assessing {{health status}} in {{clinical}} practice can aid both COPD patients and physicians’ communication {{and understanding of}} the impact of COPD on a patients’ health. In addition to spirometry, health status provides valuable information and has become an important treatment goal in COPD. Various health-status questionnaires have been developed, however not all questionnaires are suitable for daily clinical practice. The Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) are two validated and simple health status questionnaires, designed for use in clinical practice. We compared <b>and</b> validated the <b>CAT</b> <b>and</b> CCQ in a Greek population of COPD patients, using the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) as a gold standard. Methods We administered the <b>CAT,</b> CCQ <b>and</b> SGRQ in patients with COPD stage I-IV during three visits. Guideline recommended spirometry was performed. Change in health status was assessed with the Global Rating of Change scale (GRC). Test-retest reliability was assessed in the <b>CAT</b> <b>and</b> CCQ after 1 - 2 weeks. Responsiveness of the <b>CAT</b> <b>and</b> CCQ was tested through the GRC, during the second and third visit. We also calculated the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the <b>CAT</b> <b>and</b> CCQ. Results We enrolled 90 COPD patients. Cronbach's alpha for both <b>CAT</b> <b>and</b> CCQ was high, (0. 96). We confirmed discriminant validity of the <b>CAT</b> <b>and</b> CCQ; patients with severe COPD reported worse health status compared to milder subgroups. <b>CAT</b> <b>and</b> CCQ correlated significantly, rho = 0. 79. We also found significant correlations of <b>CAT</b> <b>and</b> CCQ with the SGRQ (rho= 0. 65 - 0. 77). Lung function correlated negatively with both <b>CAT</b> <b>and</b> CCQ (rho=- 0. 35 and rho=- 0. 41) demonstrating divergent validity. The ICC was 0. 88 for the total CCQ score and 0. 89 for the CAT score. Responsiveness of the <b>CAT</b> <b>and</b> CCQ was not demonstrated due to limited numbers of patients reporting a change in health status. The MCID calculated with the SEM method showed results similar to previous studies. Conclusions The <b>CAT</b> <b>and</b> CCQ have comparable psychometric properties and are both valid and reliable questionnaires to assess health status in COPD patients. ...|$|R
