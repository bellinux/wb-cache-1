As Sarah predicted, the agents {{do not believe}} that Hank, an {{upstanding}} member of the <b>community,</b> <b>would</b> be capable of such wrongdoing. Although he is ruled out as a suspect, Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' serial numbers were written down to track the cash. Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught; he goes home and burns it all. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses; as he tries to move on with his life, the murderous events constantly haunt him.|$|E

The Orange Horse, Shimer's biennial talent show since the 1960s, invites students, faculty and alumni to read poetry, sing, play music or tell jokes, individually or in groups. The Shimer theater program produces plays complementing its curriculum, offering anyone who wants to participate the chance to do so. Recent productions have included Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya and Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} archeological studies of 9th- and 10th-century gords in Greater Poland {{are at odds}} with the timing of this story. There was no Gniezno {{settlement}} in the 9th century; there was a pagan cult site there beginning only {{at the turn of the}} 10th century. The Gniezno gord was built around year 940, possibly because the location, of great spiritual importance to the tribal <b>community,</b> <b>would</b> rally the local population around its building and defense.|$|E

5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} <b>community</b> <b>would</b> expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, {{an event}} {{occurred}} that {{became part of}} local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree killing all three women below. Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water. A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Her family {{said she had been}} a sickly baby before the event but afterwards she seemed to blossom. For years afterward members of her <b>community</b> <b>would</b> attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.|$|E
5|$|The Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court {{ruled that}} NYSDOT had {{to provide a}} new {{environmental}} report by May12, 1989 or face having the reconstruction shut down. The order by the court reversed {{a decision by the}} New York State Supreme Court that determined that a revised report was unnecessary. Residents of Westbury claimed that the project would bring noise concerns to the village, along with a spillover of diverted traffic to local roads. Concerns were also stated by then-mayor Ernest Strada about Westbury's water supply and potential impacts from the project. NYSDOT claimed that no disruption would be caused by the project, but Strada insisted there were still concerns. Strada also stated that the village had no interest in shutting down the project; rather, they wanted to ensure that their <b>community</b> <b>would</b> be protected from any disruptions caused by the reconstruction. On April24, NYSDOT announced they had appealed the stoppage of work on the interchange, which had been suspended pending a ruling by the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state.|$|E

5|$|The {{need for}} {{building}} materials {{and other supplies}} led Admiral Graves to authorise a loyalist merchant to send his two ships Unity and Polly from Boston to Machias in the District of Maine, escorted by the armed schooner Margaretta {{under the command of}} James Moore, a midshipman from Graves' flagship Preston. Moore also carried orders to recover what he could from the wreck of , which had apparently been run aground in Machias Bay by a patriot pilot in February 1775. After a heated negotiation, the Machias townspeople seized the merchant vessels and the schooner after a short battle in which Moore was killed. Jeremiah O'Brien immediately outfitted one of the three captured vessels with breastwork, armed her with the guns and swivels taken from Margaretta and changed her name to Machias Liberty. In July 1775, Jeremiah O'Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners, Diligent and Tatamagouche, whose officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbour. In August 1775, the Provincial Congress formally recognised their efforts, commissioning both Machias Liberty and Diligent into the Massachusetts Navy, with Jeremiah O'Brien as their commander. The <b>community</b> <b>would</b> be a base for privateering until the war's end.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{was to be}} {{built as}} a two-lane {{alternative}} to Route31 defining {{the border of the}} suburban and rural portions of Flemington Borough and Raritan Township. Along with the new parkway, a brand-new local street network was proposed to help support the new alignment. These would minimize the pressure of traffic on Route31 and include better roads for bicycles and pedestrians. More direct routes to different portions of the <b>community</b> <b>would</b> be provided to maintain the community's character. The proposed parkway was to also help upgrade the sensitive history along the South Branch River. According to the 2008 highway plans, the South Branch Parkway would cost the state more than $2.2 million (2008 USD) in funds to put together the survey of lands in the proposed alignment. Some of these funds for the survey were originally intended to go towards the removal of the Flemington Circle.|$|E
5|$|The priory buildings, {{including}} the church, were extended {{during the late}} 12th and early 13thcenturies. It {{has been estimated that}} the original <b>community</b> <b>would</b> have consisted of 12canons and the prior; this increased to around 26members in the later part of the 12thcentury, {{making it one of the}} largest houses in the Augustinian order. By the end of the century the church had been lengthened, a new and larger chapter house had been built (I* on the plan), and a large chapel had been added to the east end of the church (N). In about 1200 the west front of the church was enlarged (M), a bell tower was built and guest quarters were constructed. It is possible that the chapel at the east end was built to accommodate the holy cross of Norton, a relic which was reputed to have miraculous healing powers. A fire in 1236 destroyed the timber-built kitchen (Q) and damaged the west range of the monastic buildings and the roof of the church. The kitchen was rebuilt and the other damage was rapidly repaired.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of producer and director {{was taken over}} by Naoki Yoshida, a staff member at Square Enix who had previously worked on the Dragon Quest series. Among these were other staff changes: Komoto was reassigned to become lead game designer, Akihiko Yoshida became lead scenario concept artist, Hiroshi Takai was appointed as lead artist, and Akihiko Matsui became lead combat system designer. Yoshida's main priority was to make the game a playable experience after the poor launch and subsequent reaction. Through subsequent patches to the game, multiple graphical and gameplay improvements were made: among the most notable were the addition of a job system, personal chocobos, a revamped battle system, greater customization options for gear, and multiple new dungeons and bosses. Yoshida also introduced the official Final Fantasy XIV forums in order to obtain player feedback and suggestions, and stated that interacting with and growing closer to the <b>community</b> <b>would</b> be a high priority. During this period, XIV and XI were taken offline to help with energy conservation {{in the aftermath of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. They went back online one week later as other means were found to reduce their energy usage that did not involve their online services. Due to the earthquake, a planned and partially-developed boss battle with the Primal Titan was cut and replaced by another Primal: the team felt that players might be offended by the Primal and associate beastribe's links with the power of earth in this context.|$|E

Jones envisioned that future employment would be deskilled and insecure, and because of this, the workplace {{would no longer be}} appropriate for organization. He anticipated that <b>community</b> unions <b>would</b> be established in de-industrialized towns, and urban slums.
