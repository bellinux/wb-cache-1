40|$|The West African Ebola virus {{outbreak}} underlined {{the importance}} of delivering mass diagnostic capability outside the clinical or primary care setting in effectively containing public health emergencies caused by infectious disease. Yet, to date, there is no solution for reliably deploying {{at the point of}} need the gold standard diagnostic method, real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR), in a laboratory infrastructure-free manner. In this proof of principle work, we demonstrate direct performance of RT-qPCR on fresh blood using far-red fluorophores to resolve fluorogenic signal inhibition and controlled, rapid freeze/thawing to achieve viral genome extraction in a single reaction chamber assay. The resulting process is entirely free of manual or automated sample pre-processing, requires no microfluidics or magnetic/mechanical sample handling and thus utilizes low <b>cost</b> <b>consumables.</b> This enables a fast, laboratory infrastructure-free, minimal risk and simple standard operating procedure suited to frontline, field use. Developing this novel approach on recombinant bacteriophage and recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Lentivirus), we demonstrate clinical utility in symptomatic EBOV patient screening using live, infectious Filoviruses and surrogate patient samples. Moreover, we evidence assay co-linearity independent of viral particle structure that may enable viral load quantification through pre-calibration, with no loss of specificity across an 8 log- linear maximum dynamic range. The resulting quantitative rapid identification (QuRapID) molecular diagnostic platform, openly accessible for assay development, meets the requirements of resource- limited countries and provides a fast response solution for mass public health screening against emerging biosecurity threats...|$|E
40|$|Background: Laparoscopic {{hepatectomy}} is progressively gaining popularity. However, it {{is still}} unclear whether the laparoscopic approach offers cost advantages compared with the open approach, especially when major hepatectomies are required. Data providing useful insights into {{the costs of the}} laparoscopic approach for clinicians and hospitals are needed. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the financial implications of the laparoscopic approach for two standardized minor and major hepatectomies: left lateral sectionectomy and right hepatectomy. Methods: A cost comparison analysis of patients undergoing laparoscopic right hepatectomy (LRH) and laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy (LLLS) versus the open counterparts was performed. Data considered for the comparison analysis were operative costs (theatre <b>cost,</b> <b>consumables</b> and surgeon/anaesthetic labour cost), postoperative costs (hospital stay, complication management and readmissions) and overall costs. Results: A total of 149 patients were included: 38 patients underwent LRH and 46 open right hepatectomy (ORH); 46 patients underwent LLLS and 19 open left lateral sectionectomy (OLLS). For LRH the mean operative, postoperative and overall costs were £ 10, 181, £ 4, 037 and £ 14, 218; for ORH the mean operative, postoperative and overall costs were £ 6, 483 (p < 0. 0001), £ 10, 304 (p < 0. 0001) and £ 16, 787 (p = 0. 886). Regarding LLLS, the mean operative, postoperative and overall costs were £ 5, 460, £ 2, 599 and £ 8, 059; for OLLS the mean operative, postoperative and overall costs were £ 5, 841 (p = 0. 874), £ 5, 796 (p < 0. 0001) and £ 11, 637 (p = 0. 0001). Conclusion: Our data support the cost advantage of the laparoscopic approach for left lateral sectionectomy and the cost neutrality for right hepatectomy. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{microbiology}} laboratories rely on quantitative PCR for its speed, sensitivity, specificity and ease-of-use. However, quantitative PCR quantitation {{requires the}} use of a standard curve or normalisation to reference genes. Droplet digital PCR provides absolute quantitation without the need for calibration curves. A comparison between droplet digital PCR and quantitative PCR-based analyses was conducted for the enteric parasite Cryptosporidium, which is an important cause of gastritis in both humans and animals. Two loci were analysed (18 S rRNA and actin) using a range of Cryptosporidium DNA templates, including recombinant plasmids, purified haemocytometer-counted oocysts, commercial flow cytometry-counted oocysts and faecal DNA samples from sheep, cattle and humans. Each method was evaluated for linearity, precision, limit of detection and cost. Across the same range of detection, both methods showed a high degree of linearity and positive correlation for standards (R 2 ≥ 0. 999) and faecal samples (R 2 ≥ 0. 9750). The precision of droplet digital PCR, as measured by mean Relative Standard Deviation (RSD;%), was consistently better compared with quantitative PCR, particularly for the 18 S rRNA locus, but was poorer as DNA concentration decreased. The quantitative detection of quantitative PCR was unaffected by DNA concentration, but droplet digital PCR quantitative PCR was less affected by the presence of inhibitors, compared with quantitative PCR. For most templates analysed including Cryptosporidium-positive faecal DNA, the template copy numbers, as determined by droplet digital PCR, were consistently lower than by quantitative PCR. However, the quantitations obtained by quantitative PCR are dependent on the accuracy of the standard curve and when the quantitative PCR data were corrected for pipetting and DNA losses (as determined by droplet digital PCR), then the sensitivity of both methods was comparable. A cost analysis based on 96 samples revealed that the overall <b>cost</b> (<b>consumables</b> and labour) of droplet digital PCR was two times higher than quantitative PCR. Using droplet digital PCR to precisely quantify standard dilutions used for high-throughput and cost-effective amplifications by quantitative PCR would be one way to combine the advantages of the two technologies...|$|E

The present study evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, ease of use, and cost of AWARE ™ Blood Serum Plasma (BSP) and Oral Mucosal Transudate (OMT) Rapid HIV- 1 / 2 test kits using real-time and archived samples of HIV-infected persons from Cameroon. Matched whole blood and OMT specimens were collected prospectively from HIV-positive and HIV-negative persons from different regions of Cameroon and tested using the AWARE ™ BSP and OMT test kits, respectively. These results were compared to the gold standard that included a combination of Determine HIV- 1 / 2 and Enzygnost HIV- 1 / 2. The BSP Rapid test kit was further evaluated using well characterized panels of HIV- 2 and HIV- 1 group O samples. Cost and end-user analysis of the OMT test kit was done by comparing its actual <b>cost,</b> <b>consumables,</b> safety, bench time and manipulation with other test kits. Of the 732 matched samples, 412 (56. 3 %) and 320 (43. 7 %) were from females and males, respectively. Of these samples, 23 (3. 1 %) gave discordant results between Determine HIV- 1 / 2 and Enzygnost HIV 1 / 2 and were excluded from the analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the AWARE™ BSP were 100 %. The AWARE™ OMT had 98. 8 % sensitivity, 98. 9 % specificity, 98. 0 % PPV and 99. 4 % NPV. The results of a well-characterized archived panel of HIV- 2 (n= 7) and HIV- 1 group O (n= 3) samples using the AWARE™ BSP Rapid test kit gave 100 % concordance. Total per patient cost of the AWARE OMT rapid test kit was US$ 4. 72 compared to a mean cost of US $ 7. 33 ± 0. 11 for the other test kits. Both the AWARE™ BSP and OMT Rapid test kits demonstrated high sensitivities and specificities on all samples tested and were well adapted for use in resource-constrained settings with high HIV heterogeneity such as Cameroon. The AWARE ™ HIV- 1 / 2 OMT Rapid test kit appears to be the cheapest, safest and easiest to use compared with other available test kits...|$|E

We present results on a relative cost analysis within a randomized noninferiority trial of EIMC comparing the AccuCirc device with Mogen clamp in Zimbabwe. Methods: Between January and June 2013, male infants who met inclusion criteria were randomized to EIMC through either AccuCirc or Mogen clamp conducted by a doctor, using a 2 : 1 allocation ratio. We evaluated the overall unit cost plus the key cost drivers of EIMC using both AccuCirc and Mogen clamp. Direct <b>costs</b> included <b>consumable</b> and nonconsumable supplies, device, personnel, associated staff training, and environmental costs. Indirect costs comprised capital and support personnel costs. In 1 -way sensitivity analyses, we assessed potential changes in unit costs due to variations in main parameters, one at a time, holding all other values constant. Results: The unit costs of EIMC using AccuCirc and Mogen clamp were $ 49. 53 and $ 55. 93, respectively. Key <b>cost</b> drivers were <b>consumable</b> supplies, capacity utilization, personnel costs, and device price.

The vast majority of photovoltaic modules are made on crystalline silicon wafers and these wafers accounts for the largest {{fraction of the cost}} of a photovoltaic module. Thus, a method of making high quality, low cost wafers would be extremely beneficial to the PV industry The industry standard technology creates wafers by casting an ingot and then sawing wafers from the ingot.

Others have attempted to create silicon sheet by recrystallization with varying degrees of success. Key among the difficulties encountered by others were: a) difficulty in maintaining the physical shape of the sheet during the recrystallization process and b) difficulty in maintaining the cleanliness of the sheet during recrystallization. Our method solved both of these challenges by encapsulating the preform wafer in a protective capsule prior to recrystallization (see below).
