40|$|For {{the study}} of <b>coloid</b> {{chemical}} and hydrodynamic effects on estuarine sedimentation, the settling processes in salt wedges were investigated by flume experiments. The results of experiments show that strong turbulence in a thin layer on the interface between fresh and salt waters controls the settling process and cations can not directly increase the settling rate owing to weak mixing between solid particles and cations across the stable interface...|$|E
40|$|A 62 -year-old {{woman with}} large tumor of the thyroid manifesting {{thyrotoxicosis}} is presented. Thyroid function tests showed a slight hyperthyroidism. Radiolabelled iodine accumulated {{in some parts}} of the tumor and the others were cold. Triiodothyronin (l-T＿ 3) administration showed non-suppression of the hot pattern. Moreover the blood thyroxin level was not lowered following the suppression of thyrotropin (TSH) induced by l-T＿ 3 administration. A total tumorectomy was performed and the pathological examination showed various degrees of follicular carcinoma. Histological findings were compared to the radiolabelled iodine uptake by mapping of thyroid scintigram. The most highly accumulated area of radiolabelled iodine consisted of smaller follicles with <b>coloid.</b> However, the unaccumulated areas consisited of cancer cells simulated in fetal thyroid or solid and trabecular patterns. This clinical evidence indicates that thyrotoxicosis in this case is caused by the excessive secretion of thyroid hormones from which were produced the cancer cells of highly accumulated area of radiolabelled iodine. 個人の特定が出来ると思われる写真が掲載されているため本文PDFの登録はな...|$|E

40|$|A massive {{hemorrhage}} is {{the main}} cause of death in injures caused by war activities, terrorism, and transpotration accidens. The total loss of blood during 24 hours is considered to be massive hemorrhage. The first hours of hemorrhage are connected with a decline of coagulation potential and with development of coagulopathy,witch when combined with a drop of body temperature and a developing metabolic acidosis constitutes a very serious life,s threat. Therefore,the current approach to the treatment of massive hemorrhage is based on the avoidance of an excessive transfusion od blood substitute fluids,because this leads to a dilution of components of coagulation,and instead focused on-as aerly as  possibile an  application of full blood or products from blood particulary those that increase a coagulation potential. Most often  it is a FFP (fresh frozen plasma),or PCC (prothrombin complex concentrate) A special attention is paid to fibrinogen supplementation (usually 2, 5 – 5, 0 g/adult and 1 – 2 g/child is needed),so that it,s level in serum exceeds 150 mg/dl. The source of fibrinogen other that FFP are crioprecipitat (0, 4 g/ 100 ml) and fibrinogen  concentrat (Haemocomplletan®). Thromboelastography is recommended for a lab diagnosis of massive hemorrhage. The basic rule of the initial treatment that determines  victim,s future outcome is the demage control resuscitation,that is,performing only those  procedures that are absolutely necessary to save life. With regard to hemorrhage here they are: 1. Stop loos of blood with nonsugical or surgical methods depending on their availability. 2. Blood transfusion(particulary fresh or fresh / warm) or blood products  with special attention given to fibrynogen supplementation. 3. While transfusing blood products are performing  has to keep a ratio erythrocytes/thrombocytes/FFP 1 : 1 : 1. The level of hemoglobin must be a minimum 7 g/dl,fibrinogen 150 mg/dl and thrombocytes 100   000 /ml 4. Prevent dropping body,s temperature. 5. Restrict transfusion of fluids such as cristaloids an particulary  artificial <b>coloids</b> to a bare minimum. No more that 700 ml in case that hemostasis was not performed. 6. Supplemented calcium so that its ionized level does not drop below 0. 9 mmol/l. 7. Stabilize broken bons,because its decreases secondary blood loss. 8. Prophylacticly prescribe a wide spectrum antibiotic 9. Transport a victim patient to higher level hospital. </p...|$|R
40|$|Wave {{propagation}} {{in complex}} media is studied in many disciplines as astronomy, meteorology, seismology, etc. A verty interesting {{point in this}} study was to observe the analogy between the propagation of electron waves in solids and classical waves in microstructured materials. The discovery of fotonoc band gap crystals, which emerged out of the pioneering conceptual idea of Sajeev John and the proposal of the structure of Yablonovitch, aroused an upsurge in the research efforts dedicated to analogous studies on phononic (acoustic) crystals. The elastic and acoustic waves attracted the attention due to both their larger number of material parameters (such as densities and sound velocities) which can be varied in order to find the optimal combination for spectral gap appearance, and their richness of applications in many branches of science and technology, such as solid state, geophysics, medicine, metallurgy, oil exploration, nondistructive evaluation, etc. This thesis reports on theoretical work concerning the elastic and acoustic waves propagation in various periodic and random composite structures such as: bubbles in water, lamellar forming block copolymer systems, soft colloids and hard sphere colloids. The fundamental quantities and the basic laws of the theory of elasticity, which will be used in all this study, are shortly reviewed in the first chapter of the thesis. the interest among solid-state physicists in the propagation of classicalwaves in composite meterials either periodic or random was attracted by the quastion of the existence or not of spectral gaps in periodic systems or localized waves in disordered systems in analogy with the case of electrons in solids. This is the reason for which, in the last section of Chapter 1, we describe the phononic crystals and compare them with the solids and the photonic crystals. the next three chapters are dedicated to the methods of calculation used in determining the properties of a phononic crystal. The simplest way to imagine a phononic crystal is spherical scatterers embedded in a host meterial of different elastic properties. This is the model we use in describing theoretically most of the systems presented in this thesis (with the exception of the lamellar system) and for this reason we use it also in the detailed derivation of the theoretical methods. The first method, presented in Chapter 2, is the calculation of the scattering cross section of a sound plane wave scattered by a single sphere. In spectral cases, when the eigenmode of vibration of one sphere in a composite is only weakly coupled with the acoustic phonon propagatingthrough the matrix and with eigenmodes of neighboring scatterers of different nature, the information given by this single sphere sound scattering can be sufficient to describe phonons of the whole system. this kind of phonons have the density energy concentrated mostly inside or at the surface of each sphere. Therefore, in order to check this localization of the phonons, we calculate the energy density distribution by the method presented {{at the end of this}} chapter. In the case of strongly coupling between different kind of modes,hybrid modes arise which can not be easily described. In order to find these modes theoretically, one must take into account the multiple scuttering effects. In Chapter 3 we present methods of band structure,transmission and density of states calculations: the plane wave method, the multiple scattering method and the finite difference time domain method. Each of these methods has the advantages and disadvantages and the choice of one or the other depends on the properties of the composite. An experimental method to obtain information about the phonons in composites is the light scattering by phonons. Only the phonons which scatter strongly the incident light can be detected. In order to identify theoretically the experimentally fount phonons, one needs to calculate the intensity of light scattering and the method is given in Chapter 4. a very interesting example of phononic crystal, with wide spectral gap, formed by air bubbles in water is discussed in the next chapter. This composite is a strongly multiple scattering environment for the acoustic waves and in the case of the disordered system formed by bubbles of random size and randomly placed, analogous with the amorphous semiconductors, new eigenstates appear at the edge of the permitted frequency bands, which can be Anderson localized eigenstates. In the last chapter, phonons in composite systems, releaved experimentally by Brillouin spectroscopy, are theoretically elucidated by using the methods of calculation mentioned above. The theoretical research in this chapter was performed in close collaboration with experimental physical chemists and physicists from F. O. R. T. H., Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser from Heraklion, Greece, Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz, Germany, and Massachusetts Intitute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusets, U. S. A [...] The investigated composites are: (i) block copolymer lamellar forming system made of poly(styrene-b-isoprene) symmetric copolymer in toluene; (ii) soft <b>coloids</b> suspensions of hairy perticles made of styrene-isoprene diblock copolymer in n-decane; (iii) hard sphere colloidal crystals of silica spheres in cyclohexane/decaline or (iv) PMMA spheres in decaline/tetraline mixture; and (v) <b>coloids</b> of PDMS-grafted silica spheres in n-heptane/toluene. The good quantitative agreement between the theory ant the experiment proves the capacity of our methods to describe real systems...|$|R
