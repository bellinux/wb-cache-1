40|$|The area of {{the spit}} of Vistula river spans 166 km 2 {{including}} 49 km 2 of forest. Population numbers of wild boars living in forests (n= 290) and in urban areas (n= 56 - 82) were determined. The city wild boars had a higher piglets/female ratio than forest wild boars (4. 3 vs. 3. 8). Among the <b>culled</b> <b>forest</b> wild boars (n= 62), 20 % of piglets had corpora lutea whereas 57. 1 % of subadult and adult females were pregnant. The size of the daily home range of city wild boars (n= 7) was determined by radio-telemetry and found to be 3. 5 - 5. 8 ha. A questionnaire-based opinion survey was carried out among local residents and visitors regarding the conflict between city wild boars and humans. The paper also discusses possible solutions to the conflict...|$|E
40|$|Overabundance of {{white-tailed deer}} (Odocoileus virginianus) {{continues}} to challenge wildlife professionals nationwide, especially in urban settings. Moreover, wildlife managers often lack general site-specific information on deer movements, survival, and reproduction {{that are critical}} for management planning. We conducted radio-telemetry research concurrent with deer <b>culling</b> in <b>forest</b> preserves in northeastern Illinois and used empirical data to construct predictive population models. We culled 2, 826 deer from 16 forest preserves in DuPage County (1992 - 1999) including 1, 736 from the 10 km 2 Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve. We also radio-marked 129 deer from 8 preserves in DuPage and adjacent Cook County (1994 - 1998). Recruitment was inversely associated with deer density suggesting a classic density-dependent response. Female deer were philopatric and 20...|$|R
40|$|The winter diets of {{roe deer}} <b>culled</b> from Kielder <b>Forest,</b> in {{north-east}} England, where {{the incidence of}} liver carcinomas in roe deer is high, and Galloway Forest, in south-west Scotland, where the incidence of liver carcinomas is low, were compared by microhistological analysis of faeces. Both areas are planted with spruce forests but the diets of the deer from Kielder Forest were less varied and contained more spruce and heather than the diets of the deer from Galloway Forest...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the extent of gastrointestinal and pulmonary helminth infections in the fallow deer in North-West Poland. Infection prevalence and intensity {{as well as the}} species composition of helminth fauna were determined. During about 2 -year period, since March 2000 until February 2002, a total number of 52 animals and 98 faecal samples were examined. The fallow deer were shot during routine <b>culls</b> in 9 <b>forest</b> districts. We have found 12 gastrointestinal and 2 lung nematode species in fallow deer in NW Poland. The most common gastrointestinal species were Oesophagostomum venulosum, Spiculopteragia boehmi, Haemonchus contortus and Nematodirus spp. Other species were determined in a lower intensity. Two lung nematode species Elaphostrongylus cervi and Varestrongylus sagittatus were found, with their prevalence 59. 6 % and 46. 1 %, respectively...|$|R
