40|$|The {{conventional}} way in time {{of flight}} TOF neutron spectroscopy is to use neutron pulses of one monochromatic wavelength. Repetition Rate Multiplication implies using a set of several monochromatic wavelengths coming from one source pulse, instead of a single one. This makes possible to overcome a major efficiency draw back of practical pulsed neutrons sources, the too low pulse repetition rate for TOF spectroscopy and allow us to freely choose the pulse repetition rate at the sample. Here we present the first experimental realization of this novel technique using the flexible disc chopper system of the TOF spectrometer NEAT at BENSC and report about the first real life data collection by Repetition Rate Multiplication. The first choppers of the instrument emulated a pulsed source with 20 40 Hz repetition rate with the sample at 13. 5 m, and the secondary spectrometer was operated with about 160 Hz <b>chopper</b> <b>pulse</b> frequency. The spectra have been detected by 3 He counters placed at 2. 5 meter from the sample. Several RRM frames with different incoming wavelengths have been recorded coming from each source <b>chopper</b> <b>pulse.</b> The results show that information from different RRM frames can be efficiently combined and evaluated. This offers more efficient use of the pulsed source by cutting the data collection dead time, and allows for faster and enhanced quality data collection by using several monochromatic wavelengths in paralle...|$|R
40|$|A pulsed, split-parallel plate chopper {{has been}} designed, built, and {{installed}} {{as part of}} the preinjector of the SSRL Injector. Its function is to allow into the linear accelerator three consecutive S-band bunches from the long bunch train provided by a RF gun. A permanent magnet deflector (PMD) at the chopper entrance deflects the beam into an absorber when the <b>chopper</b> <b>pulse</b> is off. The beam is swept across a pair of slits at the beam output end when a 7 kV, IO-ns rise-time pulse passes in the opposite direction through the 75 R stripline formed by the deflecting plates. Bunches exiting the slits have their trajectories corrected by another PMD, and enter the linac. Beam tests demonstrate that the chopper functions as expected. I...|$|R

40|$|An {{instrument}} for {{the generation of}} pulses and delays has been developed for applications in laserspectroscopy experiments. The pulses from a chopped laserbeam are counted, and when a preset value is reached, two signals are generated: one delayed trigger pulse with constant length and one delayed ‘shutter pulse’ (referred to as the ‘shutter window’ below) which opens a light shutter and allows one light pulse to enter the experimental region and excite the sample. The delays of the trigger pulse and the shutter window and {{the width of the}} shutter window can all be set independently to any value from 0 up to 50 ms with 0. 05 ms steps. A separate microcontroller measures the width of the shutter window with an accuracy of 1 micro second s. The pulse delays and the width of the shutter window are set with thumbwheel potentiometers connected as voltage dividers. A microcontroller reads the set values with a four-channel, 12 -bit AD converter. This technique saves a lot of hardware wiring as well as software writing when compared to the alternative of using separate, BCD-coded thumbwheels for each timesetting. In total, the instrument consists of two independent RISC-controllers: one PIC 16 C 55 for counting <b>chopper</b> <b>pulses</b> and generating pulses and delays, and one PIC 16 C 74 for measuring (and displaying) the width of the shutter window. The width of the shutter window is measured with 1 micro second resolution by taking full advantage of two different peripherial I/O devices in the PIC 16 C 74 : the 16 -bit ‘input capture’ module and the external interrupt facility...|$|R

With the high power handling capability of the switching device, pulse width modulated AC chopper can be used in high power applications. AC <b>chopper</b> using <b>pulse</b> width modulation provides substantial advantages over conventional line commutated AC controllers. To alleviate the problems associated with the conventional AC voltage controllers, pulse width modulated AC chopper fed induction motor drive is developed and presented in this paper with an appropriate control circuit.

40|$|The SPL (Superconducting Proton Linac) is a 4 MW 2. 2 GeV H − linac, {{intended}} to re-use {{most of the}} 352 MHz RF equipment from the decommissioned LEP machine. Injecting into the CERN PS, this linac would improve the intensity {{and quality of the}} CERN proton beams, while as a stand-alone facility could provide intense beams of radioactive ions or neutrinos (Neutrino Superbeam). Together with accumulator and compressor rings, it would be a suitable driver for a Neutrino Factory. Since the original proposal, many improvements to the design have been introduced, in order to simplify the layout and reduce costs. They include the reduction of the repetition frequency to 50 Hz, the design of a shorter superconducting (SC) linac section that goes up to the full energy with β= 0. 8 cavities, an improved DTL section including a new CCDTL design, a chopping line based on fast (2 ns rise time) low-voltage <b>choppers</b> and <b>pulser,</b> and a simplified front-end. Moreover, the problem of pulse mode operation of a superconducting linac with more than one cavity per klystron has been analysed in more detail, showing additional limitations but also proposing some possible compensation schemes. ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, in the {{electrical}} application {{the development of}} industrial apparatus using a semiconductor-chopper system easily employed {{as a source of}} a DC variable voltage is remarkable and it makes great strides in the extension of application field. However, there are very few reports on the iron loss characteristic of these apparatuses. We derived the fundamental method for the analysis of iron loss in the iron core when DC <b>chopper</b> with square-wave <b>pulse</b> voltage is used. Furthermore, we obtained experimentaly the iron loss characteristic of the iron core having nonlinear magnetization curve, and found that there was difference in general idea between the DC chopper and the symmetrical AC voltage.

40|$|The {{scanning}} electron-induced {{acoustic microscopy}} (SEAM) {{has been developed}} as a new tool for non-destructive observations of the internal microstructures of materials. It consists of the electric <b>chopper</b> to <b>pulse</b> the high current electron beam and the detector of the longitudinal acoustic waves, being attached to the commercial scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEAM gives the best performance for observing the internal defects like the local delamination of the interface in the sub-surface of the semiconductor, because it senses the local difference of thermal properties in the sample. The acoustic waves transmitted from the thermal waves generated near to the surface, in principle, carry the information on such internal defects. In the present paper, the outline of our improvements to the system for getting higher resolution is first stated with emphasis on electric chopper way, sample holder design and image data processing method. Some typical samples of a soldered copper piece, Fe- 3 %Si and TRIP steels are supplied to ascertain the detectability of the internal microstructures. And then, {{the effects of the}} pulsing frequency of the electron beam and the accelerating voltage to the resolution of the electron acoustic images are investigated. The higher resolution can be achieved as the higher pulsing frequency, as suggested by the phenomenological considerations...|$|R
50|$|The {{electrical}} system {{differs from the}} SNCF BB 36000 Astride locomotives: current collection is via one of two pantographs, one used for AC electrification supply, the other for DC supply. Under 25kV AC the supply voltage is stepped down by a transformer with four 1375 kW 1520V secondary windings for traction; the traction supply is actively rectified using a <b>pulse</b> <b>chopper</b> circuit. Under 3kV DC electrification the supply voltage is regulated by a chopper to 2200V, producing the same intermiediate DC supply voltage as when under 25kV AC electrification. The intermediate DC link powers four individual three phase GTO-based, heat pipe cooled inverters (one per traction motor); the traction motors are force cooled four pole, three phase asynchronous machines (4FXA4-559B) rated at 1280 kW. The {{electrical system}} allows regenerative braking, except under 1.5kV DC electrification, under which the locomotives operate at reduced power.|$|R
40|$|Following an {{upgrading}} program, ranging performance {{capabilities of}} a satellite-tracking pulsed laser system were assessed {{in terms of}} range accuracy, range noise, data yield, and reliability. With a shorter laser pulse duration (2. 5 to 3. 0 NSEC) and a new analog pulse processing system, the systematic range errors were reduced to 3 to 5 cm and range noise was reduced to 5 to 16 cm and range noise was reduced to 5 to 15 cm on Starlette and BE-C, and 10 to 18 cm on LAGEOS. Maximum pulse repetition rate was increased to 30 pulses per minute and significant improvement was made in {{signal to noise ratio}} by installing a 3 A interference filter and by reducing the range gate window to 200 to 400 nsec.

40|$|The {{electron}} {{source for}} the collider is required to provide two intense single bunches for each cycle of collider operation. One of these bunches is used to create the positrons for the next cycle of collider operation, while one provides the electrons {{to interact with the}} existing positrons in the same cycle of collider operation. Each of these bunches must result in 5 x 10 " electrons being captured and damped in the damping ring. Normally, longitudinally polarized electrons will be delivered by a photoemission electron gun. This polarization is transformed into transverse polarization (parallel to the damping ring magnetic field) in the linac-to-ring beamline, and back to longitudinal polarization for reinjection into the linac in the ring-to-linac beamline. Alternatively, unpolarized electrons may be delivered by a thermionic gun. 5. 1. 1 The Laser Gun for Polarized Electron Beams This gun utilizes photoemission from a semiconductor cathode to produce a longitudinally polarized electron beam.

40|$|One of {{the central}} issues {{in the design and}} the use of pulsed neutron sources is the control of pulse length in elastic {{scattering}} experiments, most significantly diffraction on crystalline matter. On the existing short pulse spallation sources the strongly wavelength dependent source pulse length that determines the resolution is permanently fixed on each beam line by the type of the moderator it faces. We have experimentally implemented {{for the first time the}} wavelength frame multiplication (WFM) multiplexing chopper method, an earlier proposed variant of the by now fully tested repetition rate multiplication technique for inelastic scattering spectroscopy on pulsed neutron sources. We have operated the time-of-flight diffractometer at the continuous reactor source at BNC in an unconventional multiplexing mode that emulates a pulsed source. As a full proof of principle of the WFM method we have experimentally demonstrated the extraction from each source pulse a series of polychromatic, <b>chopper</b> shaped neutron <b>pulses,</b> which can continuously cover any wavelength band. The achieved 25 mu s FWHM pulse length is shorter than that can be obtained at all at short pulse spallation sources for cold neutrons. The method allows us to build efficient, high and variable resolution diffractometers at long pulse spallation sources. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
