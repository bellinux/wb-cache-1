O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar características morfofisiológicas de cafeeiros (Coffea arabica L. cv. "Oeiras") sombreados por acácia (Acacia mangium Willd.) na época seca e chuvosa no sul de Minas Gerais. As maiores taxas fotossintéticas e maiores espessuras da epiderme adaxial foram observadas na estação chuvosa nas linhas de cafeeiros a pleno sol. O sombreamento influenciou em menor espessura das folhas e em espaços intercelulares maiores no tecido esponjoso. Foi também verificada mudança na forma dos cloroplastos, os quais apresentaram-se mais alongados em folhas de cafeeiros a pleno sol quando relacionados aos arborizados. Light availability {{is one of}} {{the most}} important environmental factors affecting leaf structure and functions in coffee plants that can respond differently to radiation by changes in leaf anatomy, morphology, growth and photosynthetic rate. The objective of this research was evaluate some morphophysiological aspects in leaves of coffee (Coffea arabica L. cv. 'Oeiras') <b>cropped</b> <b>under</b> <b>shelter</b> trees in the south of Minas Gerais during the rainy and dry season. The shade caused lower leaves thickness and higher intercellular spaces in spongious tissue. There was also verified a change in chloroplast shape, which showed more elongated in coffee tree kept at full sunlight in relation to that ones maintained on shading...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of shelter on semen quality of  Peranakan Ettawa (PE) Goats Eight PE goats were allocated into cross over design. Four PE goats were placed <b>under</b> no <b>shelter</b> (09. 00 - 14. 30) and another one was placed <b>under</b> <b>shelter.</b> The results of this research showed that semen volume, sperm motility, sperm concentration, and live sperm percentage of PE goat <b>under</b> <b>shelter</b> were higher (P< 0. 01) than those of PE goat <b>under</b> no <b>shelter.</b> On the other hand, sperm abnormality of PE goat <b>under</b> <b>shelter</b> was lower (P< 0. 01) than that of PE goat <b>under</b> no <b>shelter.</b> It was concluded {{that the use of}} shelter could improve semen quality.
