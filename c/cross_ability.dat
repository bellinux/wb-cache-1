40|$|During {{the past}} 25 years, {{chilling}} tolerance of the cultivated (chilling-sensitive) tomato Lycopersicon esculentum and its wild, chilling-tolerant relatives L. peruvianum and L. hirsutum (and, less intensively studied, L. chilense) {{has been the}} object of several investigations. The final aim of these studies {{can be seen in}} the increase in chilling tolerance of the cultivated genotypes. In this review, we will focus on low-temperature effects on photosynthesis and the inheritance of these traits to the offspring of various breeding attempts. While crossing L. peruvianum (¿) to L. esculentum (¿) so far has brought the most detailed insight with respect to physiological questions, for practical purposes, e. g., the readily <b>cross</b> <b>ability,</b> crossing programmes with L. hirsutum as pollen donor at present seem to be a promising way to achieve higher chilling-tolerant genotypes of the cultivated tomato. This perspective is due to the progress that has been made with respect to the genetic basis of chilling tolerance of Lycopersicon spp. over the past five year...|$|E
40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{profiles}} of 145 telial isolates of Puccinia recondita sensu lato (Uredinales: Pucciniaceae), from dif-ferent host species and different geographical origins, {{were determined by}} gas chromatography (GC). The iso-lates clustered into three different GC groups, according to consistent quantitative differences in their fatty acid compositions. Isolates collected from bread, durum and wild emmer wheats, with Thalictrum speciosissimum (Ra-nunculaceae) as aecial host, regardless of their geographi-cal origin, formed one group. The second group consists of isolates collected on Aegilops spp. and some from du-rum wheat, all alternating on Boraginaceous species. The third group contains isolates collected on rye, alternating on Boraginaceae. The grouping of P. recondita isolates by fatty acid profiles coincides with a similar one, suggested by several studies involving pathogenicity on alternate hosts, <b>cross</b> <b>ability,</b> teliospore dimensions and relative DNA content of haploid spores. It is concluded that the three groups represent two species and one subspecies: Puccinia triticina (on wheats, group 1), P. recondita sub-sp. recondita (on rye, group 3) and P. recondita subsp. aegilopis (on Aegilops spp. and durum wheat, group 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Of the 49 {{species that}} {{comprise}} the genus Helianthus, 42 {{are present in the}} wild species collection at the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops. This is a rich bank of desirable genes for sunflower breeders. However, numerous problems are {{associated with the use of}} inter specific hybridization. The wild sunflower species are either di-, tetra- or hexaploid, while the cultivated sun­flower is diploid. Consequences of differences in chromosome number and structure are incom­patibility at crossing and the occurrence of sterility, reduced fertility and meiotic irregularities in inter specific hybrids. Long-term studies on the <b>cross</b> <b>ability</b> of wild species and the cultivated form and cytogenetic analyses of wild species and F 1 inter specific hybrids have shown that phylogenetic differences pose larger problems to the use of wild species in sunflower breeding than the differences in the number of chromosomes. This hypothesis was confirmed by the full cross-incompatibility observed between several diploid perennial species (H. maximiliani, H. giganteus [...] .) and the cultivated sunflower and high percentages of successful crosses between the cultivated sunflower and some tetra- and hexaploid species (H. decapetalus, H. hirsutus, H. tuberosus, H. rigidus, H. resinosus [...] .). The phylogenesis of the genus Heliantbus classifies the species into different sections, i. e., series within the genus...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGroup of {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to verify possibility of gene introgression from common wheat into Aegilops. The artificial indoor crossbreed was conducted using 7 genotypes from 4 wheat relative species as female, and common wheat as male. The experiment result shows that different species has variable <b>cross</b> <b>ability.</b> Among the 4 Aegilops species, the highest cross rate is from the combination of Aegilops tauschii×Triticum aestivum (46. 49 % for genotype Ae 42, 22. 58 % for Y 92), the second is from Aegilops ovata×T. aestivum (14. 76 % for Y 100, 12. 11 % for Ae 23), the third is from Aegilops cylindrica×T. aestivum (2. 23 % for Ae 7, 8. 50 % for Y 145), and the lowest is from Aegilops speltoides×T. aestivum (0. 19 %). Hybrid embryos from different combinations have different ability of callus initiation and germination. The hybrid embryos from A. ovata/T. aestivum and Ae. tauschii/T. aestivum have {{a higher level of}} callus initiation and germination. Ae. cylindrica/T. aestivum has a middle level, while the Ae. speltoides has a lower level. The interspecific hybrids between Aegilops and common wheat have so low fertility. In back-crosses, the seed-set rate of hybrids of Ae. ovata/T. aestivum is 3. 71 % and 4. 36 % respectively back-crossed with male and female parents, while for hybrids of Ae. cylindrica/T. aestivum, they were 0 and 0. 33 % respectively, and for Ae. tauschii/T. aestivum, 0. 33 % and 0 respectively. On selfing of the hybrids, the seed-set rate is 0 (no seed set from 9750 florets) for the combination of Ae. cylindrica/T. aestivum, 0. 044 % (3 selfed seeds out of 6870 florets) for Ae. ovata/T. aestivum and 0 (no seed set from 7253 florets) for Ae. tauschii/T. aestivum. The research suggests that the probability of gene introgression from T. aestivum into Aegilops species is very low in nature...|$|E
