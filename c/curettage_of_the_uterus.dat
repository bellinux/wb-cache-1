30|$|In {{our series}} {{the most common}} {{acquired}} lesion in cases of RPL was intrauterine adhesion. Our study also revealed {{that there are no}} certain criteria for diagnosing intrauterine adhesions with HSG and that hysterosalpingographic diagnosis of them is therefore very difficult. Intrauterine adhesions following overzealous <b>curettage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> in the postpartum period, intrauterine surgery (e.g., myomectomy), or endometritis may cause menstrual irregularity, infertility, and spontaneous abortion. Dense, avascular adhesions may interfere with implantation or placentation. However, an association between intrauterine adhesion and RPL is controversial. After hysteroscopic treatment of intrauterine adhesions, normal menstruation is restored in approximately 88 % of patients who have any menstrual irregularity, including amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, and dysmenorrheal [34]. Therefore, hysteroscopic evaluation of patients with RPL is very useful with respect both to its diagnostic and its therapeutic effects.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundA uterine {{malformation}} {{is a type}} {{of female}} genital malformation resulting from abnormal development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mullerian duct(s) during embryogenesis. The type and degree of uterine malformation depends on the level at which <b>the</b> fusion process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two Mullerian ducts stops; thus, there is a wide variety of malformations. A newly described deformity called accessory cavitated uterine mass (ACUM) has been increasingly reported. The caseWe report this deformity (in a 20 -year-old married woman) which appears to be an additional incompletely developed, cavitated and presumably non-communicating uterus in addition to a normally shaped and developed <b>uterus.</b> <b>The</b> former <b>uterus</b> became impregnated with twins that died in a missed abortion at 13 weeks of gestation. Before discovering <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deformity, three attempts were made to evacuate the dead fetuses by cervical dilatation and <b>curettage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normal empty <b>uterus.</b> These attempts resulted in perforation of its fundus, a laparotomy was performed to repair <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b> During <b>the</b> laparotomy, <b>the</b> pregnant accessory <b>uterus</b> was discovered and was excised with the dead twins. DiscussionThe lack of good medical history was a cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mismanagement <b>of</b> this patient. Most probably, <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> ACUM is a growth from the right Mullerian duct. The ovum has entered the ACUM through the rudimentary tube and has been fertilized by a sperm travelled either through the normal vaginal and uterine cavities or through the lymphatics.

40|$|Abstract Background SERPINE 2, {{also known}} as {{protease}} nexin- 1, belongs to the serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) superfamily. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potent SERPINs that modulates <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> plasminogen activators (PAs). PAs and their SERPIN inhibitors, such as SERPINB 2 and SERPINE 1, were expressed in the human endometrium and were implicated in implantation. However, expression data about SERPINE 2 in the human endometrium is still unknown. Thus, we conducted an investigation to reveal the spatiotemporal and cellular expression of SERPINE 2 in <b>the</b> human <b>uterus</b> during <b>the</b> menstrual cycle. Methods Seven patients who underwent a hysterectomy and samples of 120 archived patients' endometrial <b>curettage</b> or parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> that were formalin-fixed and embedded in paraffin. Western blotting was performed to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antibody. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to localize the SERPINE 2 expression site. Quantitative analysis was conducted to evaluate expression levels of SERPINE 2 in various sub-phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> menstrual cycle. Results The SERPINE 2 protein was primarily detected in the uterine fluid during the mid- and late-secretory phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> menstrual cycle. It was predominantly expressed in the luminal and glandular epithelium, less in the myometrium, and only dispersedly in certain stromal cells throughout the menstrual cycle. A quantitative analysis of expression levels of SERPINE 2 in the glandular epithelium revealed that it was highly expressed in the endometrium during the secretory phase compared to the proliferative phase. Conclusions The SERPINE 2 protein is highly expressed in the endometrium during the secretory phase, indicating that it may participate in tissue remodeling involved in implantation. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on 748 women who reported genital bleeding occurring {{at least one year}} after the last menstruation. Benign causes were most frequent than malignant causes. Among the benign causes, the most frequent were cervicitis (19, 95 %), prolapsed uterus with decubitus ulcer (19, 41 %), dysfunctional hemorrhage (13, 29 %) and endometrial polyps (12, 77 %). In the group of malignant causes, cancer of the cervix was the neoplasm most often detected (59, 26 %); endometrial cancer was next, affecting 29, 63 %.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} risks and {{benefits}} associated with hysterectomy by comparing the age-adjusted health care usage patterns of all women receiving hysterectomy in the Province of Manitoba in 1974 during the two years before and the two years after surgery with those of women undergoing cholecystectomy, and with those of an age and sex matched population sample. Less than half of the women have dilation and <b>curettage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> prior to hysterectomy, despite the fact that menstrual disorders are the most frequent problem bringing women to the physician's office. Despite a low mortality rate, there is a significant risk (40 per 1, 000 cases) of complications requiring hospital readmission during the two years after hysterectomy and associated repair procedures. Although women visit their physician less frequently with gynecologic problems after surgery, they visit more frequently for psychological problems, urinary tract infections, and menopausal symptoms.

40|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{a relatively}} rare cerebrovascular disease, of which the risk has been documented in patients with numerous conditions. However, CVST has never been previously described {{in association with the}} use of a diagnostic curettage in patient with uterine fibroid. Herein, we described a 43 -year-old woman who presented with recurrent convulsive seizures and severe and progressive headache 1 day after a diagnostic <b>curettage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> which was confirmed to be uterine fibroid pathologically later, and her condition subsequently progressed to confusion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an acute extensive thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinus and the ipsilateral cerebellum infarction. Evaluation for primary thrombophilia revealed that an iron deficiency anemia (IDA) due to the fibroid bleeding induced menorrhagia together with a diagnostic curettage might be the sole hypercoagulable risk factor identified. Treatment with anticoagulation led to full recovery of her symptoms and recanalization of the thrombosis was proven on magnetic resonance venography (MRV) 2 months later. We suggest that CVST should be recognized as a potential complication related to this diagnostic technique, especially in patient with IDA. The early diagnosis and timely treatment would be of significance in improving the prognosis of this potentially lethal condition...|$|E
40|$|Pyometra is a {{potentially}} lethal disease. Eighteen cases, {{all but one}} in postmenopausal women, were diagnosed at the Ottawa General and Ottawa Civic hospitals between 1974 and 1978 inclusive. A review of this series and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature demonstrates that {{a large proportion of}} cases (72 % in this series) are associated with or follow radiotherapy for a malignant disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> and that anaerobic bacteria are frequently isolated from the uterine cavity (in 56 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients in this series).

We have compared enflurane with halothane as anaes-thetic agents for outpatient surgery with reference to recovery time and postoperative morbidity in two groups. The frequency of minor complications during anaesthesia was noted also. PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred and five consecutive patients (age range 21 - 59 yr, mean 39 yr) undergoing dilatation and <b>curettage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> as outpatients were studied.

The anaesthetics were given by the authors. A concentra-tion of 2 MAC of the volatile agent was maintained until dilatation of the cervix was complete. The duration of operation and the presence during anaesthesia of minor complications such as coughing, salivation, hiccup, laryngeal stridor and limb move-ment were noted. Recovery of consciousness was assessed as the time at which the patient first opened her eyes in response to her name.

40|$|Miscarriage is {{a common}} problem, often necessitating {{emergency}} health care, which has traditionally been managed with uterine curettage under general anaesthesia. Uterine curettage {{has been the most}} common surgical procedure performed by gynaecologists after office hours in industrialized countries, consuming substantial health care resources. There are, however, risks associated with this procedure and its use has been questioned as the treatment of choice for uncomplicated early miscarriage. Aims and methods: To longitudinally assess the incidence of miscarriage and to assess risk factors for miscarriage in three birth cohorts of women (Paper I); and to evaluate and compare conservative management and surgical intervention and these methods short- and long-term effects in one observational study (Paper II) and two randomized studies (Papers III & IV). Results: (Paper I) Approximately 12 % of all pregnancies ended in miscarriage in a group of women born 1962, monitored for 20 years. One woman in four suffered a miscarriage and 75 % in this group had no more than one miscarriage. No risk factor for miscarriage could be reliably identified. (Paper II) In an observational study of patients presenting for incomplete early miscarriage 83 % were found to resolve spontaneously within one week, requiring no further surgical or medical intervention. Expectant management entailed no increased risk of infection, pain, haemorrhage or extended sick leave, compared to surgical evacuation. (Paper III) After administration of a single vaginal dose of misoprostol miscarriage was complete without surgical intervention within a week in 81 % and within four weeks in 88 % of the subjects. Expectant management alone led to an evacuated uterus within a week in 52 % and, if the woman awaited a spontaneous course of events for one month, in 60 %. The disadvantage of pharmacological management was that the women suffered more pain and that more subjects required analgesics. (Paper IV) In a randomized study no differences in fertility between surgically and expectantly managed participants were found at a 2 -year follow-up. There were no differences in infant birth weights or caesarean section rates between groups and the prematurity rate was not increased in either group. Conclusions: Approximately 12 % of all pregnancies ended in a miscarriage.

This patient had been menopausal for about 6 years without hormone replacement therapy. She had been suffering from breast cancer, had undergone conservative breast surgery, and had been taking tamoxifen (20 mg/day) for 2 years. Pelvic ultrasound was performed and revealed an 8. 9 × 7. 7 cm uterine mass. After simple total hysterectomy, we found an enlarged uterus with a mass over the posterior wall. Final pathology demonstrated a mitotically active leiomyoma, adenomyosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> and proliferation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endometrium.
