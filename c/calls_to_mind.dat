[...] The Smoking Section commented, [...] "he premise might sound out there, until you watch for yourself and your assumptions become trumped by the visually and mentally stimulating succession of supernatural events." [...] Prefix Magazine gave the video a positive review, writing [...] "the vid sets Ocean's doe-eyed crooning against something of an inter-dimensional love story, that or a dreamcatcher-inspired fever dream. Either way, pioneer triage and white-eyed shaman were not what we we're expecting, but we couldn't be more pleasantly surprised." ...|$|E
500|$|Long Distance Swimmer was {{released}} {{as soon as}} it was recorded as, according to Crowley, he became [...] "fed up waiting". It was recorded with engineer Stephen Shannon. The record received positive reviews and was nominated for the Choice Music Prize. The NME said it was [...] "a lo-furnished, snug, auburn-tinged folk album which <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> Bill Callahan, Johnny Cash, and Edwyn Collins". The Irish Independents John Meagher named it his favourite album of 2007 and sixteenth best Irish album of the decade, while his colleague Eamon Sweeney suggested Crowley's record was one of the few Irish albums preventing that year from being [...] "an absolute stinker". It was around this time that Crowley began working with The Fence Collective and members of Halfset. He featured on the edition of 12 March 2008 of the sixth series of Other Voices. Also that month, he performed a residency at Whelan's.|$|E

[...] MacNeil stated that the obverse depicted Liberty [...] "stepping forward in... the defense of peace as her ultimate goal".

500|$|... "I Want You" [...] {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Michael Paoletta of Billboard stated, [...] "the retro-vibed song <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> the sparkly yet wistful soul of '60s-era girl groups" [...] while maintaining [...] "a contemporary reference". Paoletta considered its aura and [...] "girl-desires-boy theme" [...] {{to make the}} track a [...] "crossover gem". West's production was also praised, adding [...] "the opening drum downbeat immediately sets the tone. That beat smoothly propels the song, accompanied by swirling string crescendos that are the perfect backdrop for Jackson's breathy vocals", concluding it to potentially have [...] "multiformat popularity." [...] Ernest Hardy of LA Weekly called it [...] "a retro affair" [...] with a classic [...] "girl-group arrangement", while a critique from Gashaus noted the song [...] "shimmers with some of Janet's former iridescent glow." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised its [...] "impossibly lithe basseline", calling it an electronic reconstruction of a 1970s soul ballad, also determined to be [...] "not only inventive, but brilliantly constructed." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Koehler of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "cooking up new Rube Goldberg torture contraptions isn't {{enough to get}} Saw II out of the shadow of its unnerving predecessor". Gregory Kirschling of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B minus, saying [...] "Saw II is just barely a better B flick than Saw" [...] and that both films are [...] "more clever and revolting than they are actually chilling". He praised Bell's performance as Jigsaw, saying [...] "As the droopy-lidded maniac in the flesh, Tobin Bell is, for all the film's gewgaws, Saw II sturdiest horror, a Terence Stamp look-alike who <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> a seedy General Zod lazily overseeing the universe from his evildoer's lair". [...] He ended his review: [...] "Where Saw II lags behind in Saw's novelty, it takes the lead with its smoother landing, which is again primed to blow the movie wide open, but manages a more compelling job of it than the original's cheat finish".|$|E

500|$|His {{hallmark}} was his raw {{voice and}} ability to convey strong emotion. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic noted his [...] "hoarse, gritty vocals, brassy arrangements, an emotional way with both party tunes and aching ballads." [...] In the book Rock and Roll: An Introduction, authors Michael Campbell and James Brody suggested that [...] "Redding's singing <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> a fervent black preacher. Especially in up-tempo numbers, his singing is more than impassioned speech but less than singing with precise pitch." [...] According to the book, [...] "Redding finds a rough midpoint between impassioned oratory and conventional singing. His delivery overflows with emotion" [...] in his song [...] "I Can't Turn You Loose". Booker T. Jones described Redding's singing as energetic and emotional, but said that his vocal range was limited, reaching neither low nor high notes. Peter Buckley, in The Rough Guide to Rock, describes his [...] "gruff voice, which combined Sam Cooke's phrasing with a brawnier delivery" [...] and later suggested he [...] "could testify like a hell-bent preacher, croon like a tender lover or get down and dirty with a bluesy yawp".|$|E

2500|$|The book {{received}} favorable reviews.

2500|$|There is {{only one}} scene {{throughout}} both acts. Two men are waiting on a country road by a tree. The men are of unspecified origin, though {{it is clear that}} they are not English by nationality (and in English-language productions are traditionally played with Irish accents). The script calls for Estragon to sit on a low mound but in practice—as in Beckett's own 1975 German production—this is usually a stone. In the first act the tree is bare. In the second, a few leaves have appeared despite the script specifying that it is the next day. The minimal description <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> [...] "the idea of the lieu vague, a location which should not be particularised".|$|E
2500|$|The use of red wax is {{also part}} of his repertoire, evocative of flesh, blood, and transfiguration. In 2007, he showed Svayambh (which {{translated}} from Sanskrit means [...] "self-generated"), a 1.5-metre block of red wax that moved on rails through the Nantes Musée des Beaux-Arts as part of the Biennale estuaire; this piece was shown again in a major show at the Haus Der Kunst in Munich and in 2009 at the Royal Academy in London. Some his work blurs the boundaries between architecture and art. In 2008, Kapoor created Memory in Berlin and New York for the Guggenheim Foundation, his first piece in Cor-Ten, which is formulated to produce a protective coating of rust.

2500|$|Sean Axmaker, {{writing in}} the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said the film {{presented}} a [...] "visionary odyssey with a grace and awe and visual scope that <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> Stanley Kubrick's [...] for a new millennium, with echoes of the industrial grunge and crew friction of Alien, the greenhouse ecology of Silent Running, even the unraveling sanity of Dark Star." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times referred to the special effects in the film as [...] "convincing and remorseless" [...] and that the film was at its strongest point when it [...] "focuses on the sheer enormity of the mission and its consequences". In Variety, Derek Elley wrote that the film was [...] "gripping enough with its solid performances, good-looking CGI, underlying tension and resonant, iron-hard digital soundtrack. This film reflects education excellence." [...] He reserved praise for the production merits, noting, [...] "Boyle generally directs fluidly, {{making the most of}} p.d.

Cole is completely different, she declares on their wedding day - he loves and adores her and shows it, so she tolerates his dalliances. Her love for and devotion to him are strong enough for her to overlook his romantic flings outside their marriage. With Linda his fun with music turns into a top international career. Their lavish lifestyle is enviable worldwide. At film's end he tells her the songs were all about her - [...] "not all" [...] she corrects - but enough of them. The leaders in music praise his work and his amazing shows begin. Linda begins a tradition for his show opening nights - a Cartier cigarette case custom designed and engraved to commemorate each show, but almost misses one of his openings herself due to miscarriage and they remain childless.|$|E
2500|$|... "Ruth the Moabitess": In {{modern style}} one would not, in referring, {{at this stage}} of the narrative, to Ruth, deem it in the least degree {{necessary}} or advantageous to repeat the designation [...] "the Moabitess." [...] The repetition is antique, and <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> the redundant particularization of legal phraseology - [...] "the aforesaid Ruth, the Moabitess." [...] She was willing and wishful to avail herself of an Israelitish privilege accorded to the poor, the privilege of gleaning after the reapers in the harvest-fields (see Leviticus 19:9; Leviticus 23:22: Deuteronomy 24:19). Such gleaning was a humiliation to those who had been accustomed to give rather than to get. But Ruth saw, in the pinched features of her mother-in-law, that there was now a serious difficulty in keeping the wolf outside the door. And hence, although there would be temptation in the step, as well as humiliation, she resolved to avail herself of the harvest season to gather as large a store as possible of those nutritious cereals which form the staff of life, and which they would grind for themselves in their little handmill or quern. She said, with beautiful courtesy. [...] "Let me go I, pray, thee;" [...] or, [...] "I wish to go, if you will please to allow me." [...] Such is the force of the peculiar Hebrew idiom.|$|E

2500|$|Shakespeare critic Brents Stirling expands on Lowry's idea {{by placing}} sonnet 65 in a {{distinct}} group among the sonnets presumably addressed to Shakespeare's young friend, {{because of the}} strictly third-person mode of address. Stirling links sonnets 63-68 through their use of [...] "uniform epithet, 'my love' or its variants such as 'my beloved' [...] ". In sonnet 65, the pronoun 'his' directly references the epithet. [...] "Sonnet 65 opens with an epitome of [...] 64: 'Since brass not stone nor earth nor boundless sea..." [...] The opening line refers back to the 'brass,' 'lofty towers,' 'firm soil,' and 'wa'try main' of 64. 'This rage' of 'sad mortality' <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> the 'mortal rage' of 64. [...] "After its development of 64, sonnet 65 returns with its couplet to the couplet of 63: 'That in black ink my love may still shine bright' echoes 'His beauty' that 'shall in these black lines be seen'; and 'still shine' recalls 'still green' [...] ". This [...] "triad" [...] of poems relates {{to the group of}} sonnets 66-68, for [...] "Their respective themes, Time's ruin (63-65) and the Former Age, a pristine earlier world now in ruin and decay (66-68), were conventionally associated in Shakespeare's day," [...] suggesting that the sonnets were written as a related group meant to be distinctly categorized.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen King {{liked the}} film, stating: [...] "Of Fox's two summer creepshows , give the edge to The Happening, partly because M. Night Shyamalan really understands fear, partly because this time he's {{completely}} let himself go (hence the R rating), {{and partly because}} after Lady in the Water {{he had something to}} prove". Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, awarding the movie three stars, found it [...] "oddly touching": [...] "It is no doubt too thoughtful for the summer action season, but I appreciate the quietly realistic way Shyamalan finds to tell a story about the possible death of man". William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called it [...] "something different—and a pleasant surprise" [...] among that summer's major Hollywood releases, and approved of its taking [...] "the less-is-best approach." [...] The New York Times’ Manohla Dargis praised Wahlberg's lead performance, adding that the film [...] "turns out to be a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense". Philipa Hawker of The Age gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting on [...] "the mood of the film: a tantalizing, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters," [...] drawing special attention to [...] "the sound of the breeze and the sight of it ruffling the trees or blowing across the grass— an image of tension that <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> Antonioni's Blowup". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "It almost dares you to roll your eyes or laugh at certain scenes that are supposed to be deadly serious. But, you know what, I appreciated this creatively offbeat, daring sci-fi mind-trip". Reviewer Rumsey Taylor said that the film moves forward with [...] "jack-in-the-box suspense, traipsing from one garish death to another in a parade of cartoonish terror," [...] and noted how the film seemed like [...] "Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds, only without the birds." ...|$|E
