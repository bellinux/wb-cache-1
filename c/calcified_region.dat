40|$|Coronary artery {{calcification}} (CAC) is quantified {{based on}} a computed tomography (CT) scan image. A <b>calcified</b> <b>region</b> is identified. Modified expectation maximization (MEM) of a statistical model for the calcified and background material is used to estimate the partial calcium content of the voxels. The algorithm limits the region over which MEM is performed. By using MEM, the statistical properties of the model are iteratively updated based on the calculated resultant calcium distribution from the previous iteration. The estimated statistical properties are used to generate {{a map of the}} partial calcium content in the <b>calcified</b> <b>region.</b> The volume of calcium in the <b>calcified</b> <b>region</b> is determined based on the map. The experimental results on a cardiac phantom, scanned 90 times using 15 different protocols, demonstrate that the proposed method is less sensitive to partial volume effect and noise, with average error of 9. 5 % (standard deviation (SD) of 5 - 7 mm(3)) compared with 67 % (SD of 3 - 20 mm(3)) for conventional techniques. The high reproducibility of the proposed method for 35 patients, scanned twice using the same protocol at a minimum interval of 10 min, shows that the method provides 2 - 3 times lower interscan variation than conventional techniques...|$|E

Herein, we report a rare case of decalcified choroidal osteoma {{found in the}} retina. A 27 -year-old woman {{presented}} with visual loss. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 50 OS. Ophthalmoscopy of the left eye revealed a yellow-white <b>calcified</b> <b>region</b> accompanied by a decalcified region of four disc diameters in size. After 6 years, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed a tumor projected strongly upwards from the choroid and partially through the retina with serous retinal detachment, with both a lamellar appearance and mound-like area. The <b>calcified</b> <b>region</b> became more contractive than was observed on the first visit. Conversely, the decalcified region was wider than was observed on the first visit. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 400 OS. Choroidal osteoma was worsened by progression of decalcification. The decalcified choroidal osteoma resulted in poor visual acuity, and projected strongly upward from the choroid and into the retina. Keywords: osteoma, decalcification, choroidal osteom...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a level set based method for segmenting the outer vessel wall and plaque {{components of the}} carotid artery in CTA. The method employs a GentleBoost classification framework that classifies pixels as <b>calcified</b> <b>region</b> or not, and inside or outside the vessel wall. The combined result of both classifications is used to construct a speed function for level set based segmentation of the outer vessel wall; the segmented lumen is used to initialize the level set. The method has been optimized on 20 datasets and evaluated on 80 datasets for which manually annotated data was available as reference. The average Dice similarity of the outer vessel wall segmentation was 92 %, which compares favorably to previous methods. Imaging Science and TechnologyApplied Science...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether oxidative stress is increased in calcified, stenotic aortic valves and to examine mechanisms that might contribute to increased oxidative stress. BackgroundOxidative stress is increased in atherosclerotic lesions and might play an important role in plaque progression and calcification. The role of oxidative stress in valve disease is not clear. MethodsSuperoxide (dihydroethidium fluorescence and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) (dichlorofluorescein fluorescence), and expression and activity of pro- and anti-oxidant enzymes were measured in normal valves from hearts not suitable for transplantation and stenotic aortic valves that were removed during surgical replacement of the valve. ResultsIn normal valves, superoxide levels were relatively low and distributed homogeneously throughout the valve. In stenotic valves, superoxide levels were increased 2 -fold near the <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> of the valve (p < 0. 05); noncalcified regions did not differ significantly from normal valves. Hydrogen peroxide levels were also markedly elevated in <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> of stenotic valves. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity was not increased in <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> of stenotic valves. Superoxide levels in stenotic valves were significantly reduced by inhibition of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), which suggests uncoupling of the enzyme. Antioxidant mechanisms were reduced in <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> of the aortic valve, because total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and expression of all 3 SOD isoforms was significantly decreased. Catalase expression also was reduced in pericalcific regions. ConclusionsThis study provides the first evidence that oxidative stress is increased in <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> of stenotic aortic valves from humans. Increased oxidative stress is due at least in part to reduction in expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes and perhaps to uncoupled NOS activity. Thus, mechanisms of oxidative stress differ greatly between stenotic aortic valves and atherosclerotic arteries...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} morphologic {{features}} of a choroidal osteoma using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF). Methods: Two eyes of two cases with a choroidal osteoma were studied using SS-OCT and FAF. Results: The location of the tumor was circumpapillary without macular involvement in case 1 and juxtapapillary with macular involvement in case 2. Both cases had a mixture of calcified and decalcified areas, and a concomitant choroidal neovascularization was found in case 2. The FAF images showed decreased autofluorescence in the central decalcified regions and relatively preserved fluorescence in marginal <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> in both cases. SS-OCT revealed a normal inner retina and an abnormal outer retina in both cases, and subretinal fluid in case 2. The <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> appeared sponge-like and were multilayered in case 2. A lamellar reflective pattern was observed in the decalcified regions in case 1, and hyperreflective mound-like areas were observed in both cases. SS-OCT demonstrated hyperreflective areas above Bruch's membrane accompanied by disruption of Bruch's membrane in case 1. The chorioscleral border was visible in both cases. Conclusions: The FAF pattern in the calcified and decalcified areas of the choroidal osteoma may correspond to the different stage of tumor evolution. The SS-OCT findings indicate that choroidal osteomas can have characteristic reflective patterns and alterations of the overlying retina...|$|R

The {{thickness of}} the calcified zone therefore shows the same distribution pattern as that of the total cartilage and, since the latter is dependent upon the distribution of the load, the thickness of the <b>calcified</b> <b>region</b> also appears to be related to mechanical stress. The volume of the calcified zone, however, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total cartilage, varied considerably from one bone to another within the range from 3. 23 to 8. 8 %.

Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography revealed a cage-like pattern, which corresponded to the <b>calcified</b> <b>region</b> of the tumor. Fundus autofluorescence imaging of the same area showed slight hyperautofluorescence. Three different reflectivity patterns in the decalcified area were defined. In the areas of subretinal fluid, outer segment elongations similar to central serous chorioretinopathy were observed. Hyperautofluorescent spots were evident in fundus autofluorescence in the same area.

40|$|The {{structure}} {{and organization of}} the organic matrix of the cusps of the major lateral teeth of the chiton Acanthopleura hirtosahave been examined using conventional light and transmission electron microscopy techniques and by using the protein ferritin as an ultrastructural probe.

In addition, the central (lepidocrocite-mineralized) region of the tooth has been examined and shown to consist of bundles of fibres arranged such that they display a tightly interwoven pattern. It is suggested that while the structural organization of surface fibres readily permits the passage of ions required for mineralization, the architecturally discrete distribution of biominerals found in mature chiton teeth is due mostly to spatial delineation of the tooth by matrix macromolecules in the central region of the tooth...|$|E

40|$|Calcific {{aortic valve}} disease (CAVD) {{is a serious}} {{condition}} with vast uncertainty regarding the precise mechanism leading to valve calcification. This study was undertaken to examine {{the role of the}} lipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in a comparison of aortic and mitral valve cellular mineralization. The proportion of LPC in differentially <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> of diseased aortic valves was determined using thin layer chromatography (TLC). Next, porcine valvular interstitial cells (pVICs) from the aortic (paVICs) and mitral valve (pmVICs) were cultured with LPC (10 − 1 – 105  nM) and analyzed for cellular mineralization, alkaline phosphatase activity (ALPa), proliferation, and apoptosis. TLC showed a higher percentage of LPC in <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> of tissue compared to non-calcified regions. In pVIC cultures, with the exception of 105  nM LPC, increasing concentrations of LPC led to an increase in phosphate mineralization. Increased levels of calcium content were exhibited at 104  nm LPC application compared to baseline controls. Compared to pmVIC cultures, paVIC cultures had greater total phosphate mineralization, ALPa, calcium content, and apoptosis, under both a baseline control and LPC-treated conditions. This study showed that LPC has the capacity to promote pVIC calcification. Also, paVICs have a greater propensity for mineralization than pmVICs. LPC may be a key factor in the transition of the aortic valve from a healthy to diseased state. In addition, there are intrinsic differences that exist between VICs from different valves that may {{play a key role in}} heart valve pathology...|$|R

40|$|A {{method has}} been devised for {{isolating}} the calcium biomineral from the iron biominerals and organic components {{present in the}} major lateral teeth of the chiton Acanthopleura hirtosa. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of the calcium biomineral indicated {{that it was an}} apatite material containing carbonate and fluoride ions. Carbonate was not found to be present as a separate phase. The apatite was further separated into low and high density fractions, both of which showed crystallinity intermediate between that of bovine tibia cortical bone and human tooth enamel, as indicated by powder X- ray diffraction analysis. The <b>calcified</b> <b>region</b> of the major lateral teeth was also studied in situ using transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction analysis, revealing a close spatial relationship between the mineral apatite phase and underlying organic matrix.

40|$|The {{organic matrix}} {{of the major}} lateral teeth of the chiton Acanthopleura hirtosa was found to consist of approx 10 % by weight of protein. Histochemical {{analysis}} indicated {{that the majority of}} the protein was located in the calcified (anterior) region of the tooth, while the iron-mineralized or posterior region contained relatively small amounts of protein. In comparison, whole radula tissue contained significantly greater amounts of protein than the major lateral teeth alone. This extra protein is required to harden the non-mineralized areas of the radula. High-performance liquid chromatography and biochemical analyses indicated that the protein is rich in aspartic and glutamic acids, while phosphoserine was also detected in appreciable quantities. In addition, the protein component was closely associated with chitin fibres which comprise the remainder of the organic matrix.

40|$|Objective Intravascular {{ultrasound}} (IVUS) is {{a diagnostic}} imaging technique for tomographic visualization of coronary arteries. Automatic analysis of IVUS images is difficult due to speckle noise, artifacts of the catheter, and shadows generated by calcifications.

40|$|Background: Ultrasound (US) elastography {{can provide}} {{information}} about the hardness of calcification and might help decide treatment strategy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the hardness of the calcific area within rotator cuffs by US elastography as an aid for the selection of aspiration or fine-needle repeated puncture for the treatment of rotator cuff calcific tendinosis. Methods: This prospective study included 39 patients (32 males, 7 females; mean age, 52. 9 years) who received US elastography and gray-scale ultrasonography before US-guided treatment for rotator cuff calcific tendinosis. The morphology of the calcifications was classified as arc, fragmented, nodular, and cystic types. US elastography using virtual touch imaging (acoustic radiation force impulse) technique was performed to examine the <b>calcified</b> <b>region</b> to obtain an elastogram that was graded dark, intermediate, or bright. The hardness of the calcifications were recorded, and graded as hard, sand-like, or fluid-like tactile patterns during the US-guided treatment, and the tactile patterns were compared with the results of US elastography and gray-scale ultrasonography. Results: Though the morphologies of the calcifications were significantly related to the tactile pattern of the needle punctures (p <  0. 001), gray-scale US could not accurately demonstrate the hardness of the calcifications. With the aid of elastography, the fluid-like tactile pattern could be predicted well as a nondark pattern by elastography (p <  0. 001). Conclusion: Ultrasound elastography is a useful modality for evaluation of rotator cuff calcific tendinosis, and as an aid to guide management. If elastography shows the calcified area as a non-dark pattern, then fine-needle aspiration should be performed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveArticular {{cartilage}} {{is separated}} from subchondral bone by the tidemark and a calcified cartilage zone. Advancement of the <b>calcified</b> <b>region</b> and tidemark duplication are both hallmarks of osteoarthritis (OA). Currently the mechanisms controlling post-natal articular cartilage mineralization are poorly understood. The objective {{of this study is}} to test the hypothesis that cellular communication between different cartilage layers regulates articular chondrocyte mineralization. DesignCo-culture models were established to evaluate the interaction of chondrocytes derived from the surface, middle and deep zones of articular cartilage. The cultures were stimulated with triiodothyronine (T 3) to promote chondrocyte hypertrophy. The effects of zonal chondrocyte interactions on chondrocyte mineralization were examined over time. ResultsCo-culture of deep zone chondrocytes (DZCs) with surface zone chondrocytes (SZCs) suppressed the T 3 -induced increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and related mineralization. Moreover, SZC–DZC co-culture was associated with a significantly higher parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) expression when compared to controls. When PTHrP(1 – 40) was added to the DZC-only culture, it suppressed DZC ALP activity similar to the inhibition observed in co-culture with SZC. In addition, treatment with PTHrP reversed the effect of T 3 stimulation on the expression of hypertrophic markers (Indian hedgehog, ALP, matrix metalloproteinases- 13, Type X collagen) in the DZC cultures. Moreover, blocking the action of PTHrP significantly increased ALP activity in SZC+DZC co-culture. ConclusionOur findings demonstrate the role of zonal chondrocyte interactions in regulating cell mineralization and provide a plausible mechanism for the post-natal regulation of articular cartilage matrix organization. These findings also have significant implications in understanding the pathology of articular cartilage as well as devising strategies for functional cartilage repair...|$|E

40|$|Soft tissues such as ligaments and tendons {{integrate}} with bone {{through a}} fibrocartilaginous interface divided into noncalcified and <b>calcified</b> <b>regions.</b> This junction between distinct tissue types is frequently injured and not reestablished after surgical repair. Its regeneration is also limited {{by a lack}} of understanding of the structure–function relationship inherent at this complex interface. Therefore, focusing on the insertion site between the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and bone, the objectives of this study are: (i) to determine interface compressive mechanical properties, (ii) to characterize interface mineral presence and distribution, and (iii) to evaluate insertion site-dependent changes in mechanical properties and matrix mineral content. Interface mechanical properties were determined by coupling microcompression with optimized digital image correlation analysis, whereas mineral presence and distribution were characterized by energy dispersive x-ray analysis and backscattered scanning electron microscopy. Both region- and insertion-dependent changes in mechanical properties were found, with the <b>calcified</b> interface <b>region</b> exhibiting significantly greater compressive mechanical properties than the noncalcified region. Mineral presence was only detectable within the calcified interface and bone regions, and its distribution corresponds to region-dependent mechanical inhomogeneity. Additionally, the compressive mechanical properties of the tibial insertion were greater than those of the femoral.

40|$|Aortic valve {{stenosis}} is a slowly progressive disorder with {{a spectrum}} of disease ranging from aortic sclerosis to severe destroyed valvular architecture leading to critical outflow obstruction. The diseased valve is characterized by inflammation, as an initiating event, pathological remodeling of extracellular matrix and pronounced calcification, which all eventually cause restricted leaflet mobility. Compelling evidence obtained from both experimental animal models and human studies provided detailed histopathological picture of disease development. This implies endothelial cell-, macrophage activation and inflammation-dependent calcification paradigm, in which phenotypic transdifferentiation of valvular myofibroblasts towards osteogenic phenotype takes place to further enhance the structural and compositional changes of the valve leaflets. The prognosis of symptomatic patients with severe stenosis is poor without surgical valve replacement. To date there is no medical treatment for this condition other than surgical valve replacement. Based on inflammation associated calcification, observed in early stages, within this thesis the molecular mechanisms of calcified aortic valve stenosis with focus on inflammation and subsequent calcification were characterized. The aim {{of the project was}} to determine the role of proinflammatory signaling through the leukotriene pathway in aortic stenosis. Surgically explanted human aortic valves were subjected for macroscopic dissection followed by Taqman qPCR in order to correlate the gene expression pattern with the echocardiographic parameters quantifying the stenosis severity. This study established a macroscopic dissection technique as a model for in vivo disease development, where different parts of stenotic aortic valve represent the entire disease spectrum from early signs to advanced stages. The inflammatory environment within the affected aortic valve stimulates the 5 -lipoxygenase pathway leading to production of potent inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes. Several components of the 5 -lipoxygenas pathway were correlated with the stenosis severity. As inflamed valvular tissue demonstrates signs of micro- and macrocalcification, {{the next step was to}} determine the spatio-temporal distribution of genes with osteoinductive and osteoresorptive pontential. These findings along with the plasma measures of proteins taking part in bone turnover point to a correlation between their tissue-, systemic levels and the stenosis severity. Furthermore, the intracellular effects of LTC 4 in vitro cell culture of valvular insterstitial cells and smooth muscle cells from human coronary artery were characterized. The results of these experiments demonstrated cascade of events leading to activation of cell death pathways, activation of the nuclear enzyme PARP- 1, upregulation of CysLT 1 receptor expression in response to proinflammatory stimuli coupled to nuclear calcium signaling. Moreover, in a separate experiment a conceptual model of phenotypic plasticity of the valvular insterstitial cells due to epigenetic alteration was provided, which might be connected to stenosis progression. The amount of methylated DNA within the 5 - lipoxygenase promoter region was significantly lower in the calcified part compared with non-calcified, which was confirmed by accompanied increase in expression of 5 - lipoxygenase leading to enhanced inflammatory activity in the <b>calcified</b> <b>region</b> of the valve. In conclusion, the findings of this thesis integrate observations of molecular research using quantitative gene expression data with clinical variables in terms of echocardiographic parameters. The results point to leukotrienes as potential mediators of inflammation in aortic stenosis. Furthermore, the bone turnover both at tissue and systemic levels is associated with stenosis severity. In addition, the thesis also provides mechanistic insight into the direct role of leukotrienes in the pathophysiological process of aortic stenosis. Finally, translational implication of our data suggests possibility for pharmacological intervention using leukotriene receptor antagonists with a potential to retard the hemodynamic progression...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundIt is now {{generally}} accepted that calcific aortic valve disease is an atherosclerotic-like process. Recent studies in an experimental model of aortic valve sclerosis demonstrated {{the presence of}} tissue factor (TF), the main contributor to atherosclerotic plaque thrombogenicity, in diseased valve leaflets. We assessed the hypothesis that human aortic valve disease is an atherosclerotic-like process in which TF {{plays an important role}} and evaluated the valvular expression and localization of TF and other components of atherosclerosis. MethodsCalcified aortic valves (n= 52) were obtained from patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. Leaflet structure, cellular and lipid infiltration and expression of TF, its inhibitors, VEGF and other components of atherosclerosis were evaluated by histological and immunohistochemical staining. TF, TFPI, osteopontin, MMP- 9, TIMP- 1 and VEGF antigen were measured by ELISA and TF and alkaline phosphatase activity were determined using chromogenic assays. Finally, we performed semi-quantification of TF transcripts by RT- PCR and further analyzed protein expression by Western blot. ResultsHistological and immunohistochemical staining of the valve leaflets revealed neovascularisation at the centre of the lesions, overall macrophage and myofibroblast infiltration and the abundant presence of MMP- 9. On the other hand, TF and TFPI were associated with calcification and extracellular lipid deposits in the fibrosa and the subendothelial layer of the aortic side of the leaflets. Correspondingly, TF antigen and activity were found to be higher in <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> of the valve leaflets (733. 29 ± 70. 49 pg/mgvs 429. 40 ± 73. 17 pg/mg and 144. 75 ± 14. 65 pg/mgvs 40. 15 ± 6. 19 pg/mg respectively (p< 0. 0001)). Similar results were found for osteopontin, MMP- 9, TIMP- 1 and VEGF. In contrast, TFPI antigen was found to be much lower in these <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> (722. 54 ± 153. 92 pg/mgvs 2459. 28 ± 285. 36 pg/mg (p< 0. 0001)). ConclusionThese results demonstrate that aortic valve lesions display several characteristics of atherosclerosis, including TF expression. In addition, we showed that TF is colocalized with calcification and lipid deposition. Further studies are now set up to evaluate the role of TF in aortic valve disease and its association with other components of the atherosclerotic process...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objective: Hypoparathyroidism {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} endocrine complications of thalassemia major. This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of intracerebral calcifications in patients with thalassemia with and without hypoparathyroidism. "nPatients and Methods: Forty-seven beta-thalassemia patients with hypoparathyroidism underwent a brain CT scan to investigate the presence and extent of intracerebral calcifications. Thirty age and sex-matched beta-thalassemic patients with normal parathyroid function who had undergone brain CT for headache, or some other minor neurologic problems were also enrolled in the study as control group. The amount of intracerebral calcifications, hematologic parameters, and some clinical findings were com-pared between both groups. "nResults: Intracerebral calcification was present in 54. 2 % of beta -thalassemai patients with hypoparathyroidism. The most frequent sites of calcification were basal ganglia, and frontoparietal areas of the brain. Thalami, internal capsule, cerebellum and posterior fossa were other less frequently <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> of the brain. Conversely intracerebral calcification was not seen in the 30 thalassemia patients with normal parathyroid function. There was not a statistically significant difference between serum ferritin concentrations in thalassemia patients with hy-poparathyroidism and those with normal parathyroid function (2781 vs. 2178, P&gt; 0. 05). "nConclusion: Intracranial calcification is a common finding in thalassemia patients with "nhypoparathyroidism. It can be extensive and involves most regions of the brain...|$|R
40|$|Arterial medial {{calcification}} {{is a major}} complication {{in patients}} with chronic kidney disease and is a strong predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. We sought to determine the role of dietary phosphorus and the severity of uremia on vascular calcification in calcification-prone DBA/ 2 mice. Severe and moderate uremia was induced by renal ablation of varying magnitudes. Extensive arterial-medial calcification developed only when the uremic mice were placed on a high-phosphate diet. Arterial calcification in the severely uremic mice fed a high-phosphate diet {{was significantly associated with}} hyperphosphatemia. Moderately uremic mice on this diet were not hyperphosphatemic but had a significant rise in their serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF- 23) and osteopontin that significantly correlated with arterial medial calcification. Although there was widespread arterial medial calcification, there was no histological evidence of atherosclerosis. At early stages of calcification, the osteochondrogenic markers Runx 2 and osteopontin were upregulated, but the smooth muscle cell marker SM 22 α decreased in medial cells, as did the number of smooth muscle cells in extensively <b>calcified</b> <b>regions.</b> These findings suggest that phosphate loading and the severity of uremia play critical roles in controlling arterial medial calcification in mice. Further, FGF- 23 and osteopontin may be markers and/or inducers of this process...|$|R
40|$|Context: Development of calcifying foci is {{a common}} finding in human thyroid {{papillary}} carcinoma, but its mechanisms remain unknown. Objective: We therefore investigated whether osteocalcin and/or Cbfa- 1 genes are expressed in malignant thyroid epithelial cells. We also studied the effects of Cbfa- 1 on the expression of osteoblast-specific and thyrotropin receptor genes in thyrocytes. Results: The human thyroid papillary carcinoma cell line BHP 18 – 21 expresses bone-type osteocalcin mRNA at higher levels than in MG 63 osteosarcoma cells. Northern blot analysis and EMSA using nuclear extracts from BHP 18 – 21 cells and FRTL- 5 cells demonstrated that cells of thyroid epithelial origin expressed Cbfa- 1 /Runx 2, the main transcription factor {{for the expression of}} osteocalcin. When we transfected pcDNA 3. 1 -human Cbfa- 1 into FRTL- 5 cells, Cbfa- 1 increased the gene expression of alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, and osteocalcin but suppressed the expression of thyrotropin receptor. We then stained the <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> of human papillary thyroid carcinoma tissues with antiosteocalcin antibody and found that malignant cells, as well as follicular epithelial cells, were immunopositive for osteocalcin. Northern blot analysis revealed that the Cbfa- 1 /Runx 2 gene was strongly expressed in tissues from four cases of surgically resected papillar...|$|R

The proliferation and spontaneous aggregation capability of {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) thus prompted us to fabricate a scaffold-free iPSC construct as a transplantation vehicle. Embryoid bodies of mouse gingival fibroblast-derived iPSCs (GF-iPSCs) were seeded in a cell chamber with a round-bottom well made of a thermoresponsive hydrogel. Collected ball-like cell constructs were cultured in osteogenic induction medium for 30 days with gentle shaking, resulting in significant upregulation of osteogenic marker genes. The constructs consisted of an inner region of unstructured cell mass and an outer osseous tissue region that was surrounded by osteoblast progenitor-like cells. The outer osseous tissue was robustly calcified with elemental calcium and phosphorous as well as hydroxyapatite. Subcutaneous transplantation of the GF-iPSC constructs into immunodeficient mice contributed to extensive ectopic bone formation surrounded by teratoma tissue. These results suggest that mouse GF-iPSCs could facilitate the fabrication of osteoinductive scaffold-free 3 D cell constructs, in which the <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> and surrounding osteoblasts may function as scaffolds and drivers of osteoinduction, respectively. With incorporation of technologies to inhibit teratoma formation, this system could provide a promising strategy for bone regenerative therapies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Offsets from isotopic {{equilibrium}} in biogenic carbonates have complicated paleoclimate recon-structions for decades. A new {{archive of}} climate, deep-sea corals, {{is used to}} evaluate the calcification processes, independent of photosynthesis, that contribute to these offsets. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope data from six modern deep-sea corals show strong linear trends between 13 C and 18 O. Slopes of these trends between samples are similar and range between 1. 9 to 2. 6 for 13 C/ 18 O. Linear trends intersect isotopic equilibrium for 18 O and are slightly depleted for 13 C. Variations in the isotopic ratios are strongly correlated with the density banding structure. Isotopically depleted aragonite is associated with light, quickly precipi-tating bands, whereas isotopically enriched points correspond to slowly accumulating, less dense aragonite. The densest white band at the trabecular center is furthest from isotopic equilibrium for both carbon and oxygen. Data from this region fall off the linear trend between 18 O and 13 C. This deviation, where 13 C remains constant while the 18 O continues to decrease, does not support “vital effect ” mechanisms that call upon kinetic fractionation to explain offsets from isotopic equilibrium.

40|$|The new {{generation}} of multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners allows for the acquisition of high-resolution images of the heart. Based on that image data, the heart can be analyzed in a noninvasive way—improving the diagnosis of cardiovascular malfunctions on one hand, and the planning of an eventually necessary intervention on the other. One important parameter {{for the evaluation of}} the severeness of a coronary artery disease is the number and localization of calcifications (hard plaques). This work presents a method for localizing these calcifications by employing a newly developed vessel segmentation approach. This extraction technique has been developed for, and tested with, contrast-enhanced CT data sets of the heart. The algorithm provides enough information to compute the vessel diameter along the extracted segment. An approach for automatically detecting <b>calcified</b> <b>regions</b> that combines diameter information and gray value analysis is presented. In addition, specially adapted methods for the visualization of these analysis results are described. KEY WORDS: Computed tomography, vessel segmentation, coronary arteries, calcification, image analysis, visualization BACKGROUND The most frequent cause of death in the developed nations are cardiovascular diseases. * 1 Often, an occlusion of the coronary artery causes severe risks to the patient’s health.
