5|$|Alexandre Baudrimont's 40-page study Vocabulaire de la langue des Bohémiens habitant {{les pays}} basques français of 1862, the most {{extensive}} of the early accounts, covers both vocabulary and aspects of grammar. He worked with two female informants, {{a mother and her}} daughter from the Uhart-Mixe area near Saint-Palais, whom he describes as highly fluent. Unfortunately, he was only able to conduct a single session as the women were then told not to cooperate further for the fear of outsiders prying into the secrets of the Romani. There is a <b>certain</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> confusion in Baudrimont's publication—he himself states that he could not always be certain the correct forms were elicited. For example, most of the verb forms he tried to elicit lack the verbal -tu ending and appear to be participles.|$|E
5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division municipalities are the third tier of public {{administration in the}} Netherlands after the central government and the provinces. The Netherlands is a decentralized unitary state, {{which means that the}} central government is supreme and delegates certain tasks to lower levels of government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities a <b>certain</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible {{for a wide variety of}} public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 three special municipalities (officially public bodies) were formed. These municipalities function the same as regular municipalities and are grouped together as the Caribbean Netherlands and are not part of a province.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the Vietnamese occupation, the Kampuchean {{resistance}} groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though the Khmer Rouge enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure to reform itself from the international community. ASEAN, which had backed the Khmer Rouge throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged the Khmer Rouge leadership to put its blood-stained image behind it in order to join forces with other non-communist movements. However, the idea of forming an alliance with the Khmer Rouge initially caused a <b>certain</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality. Nonetheless, early in 1981, Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging in talks with Khieu Samphan, President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea, to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{during the}} 1960s, the Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked the {{communist}} leader of Albania Enver Hoxha about giving autonomy to the minority, but this initiative was without any result. The autonomy question {{remains one of}} the main issues on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania (1991). Moreover, a <b>certain</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> autonomy, based on the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, is the main objective of the organization Omonoia, as well as the Unity for Human Rights Party, which represents the Greek minority in the Albanian government. Such proposals were rejected in 1991 by the Albanian government, thus spurring Omonoia's radical wing to call for Union with Greece. In another incident, in 1993, Omonoia’s chairman was immediately arrested by the Albanian police, after explaining in public that the goal of the Greek minority was autonomy inside the Albanian borders, based on the terms of the Protocol.|$|E

Tatiana Proskouriakoff had originally used this stela to misidentify the sixth ajaw of Piedras Negras, assigning the title to the sajal, instead of Ha' K'in Xook.

In 1844; {{the administration of}} Worcestershire {{was carried out by}} the Courts of Quarter Sessions, who were responsible for law and order, civil jurisdiction and certain administrative functions in the county. These roles included the licensing of alehouses, police, weights and measures, construction/maintenance of highways and bridges, poor law disputes and setting taxes. The county was then divided into five hundreds (a county subdivision), four separate boroughs for the larger towns (Bewdley, Kidderminster, Droitwich, and Evesham), and Worcester itself, which was a county corporate.

This methodology enables <b>certain</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom to be position-controlled through real time manual inputs and the remaining <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom to be force-controlled by computer. Functionally, it is a hybrid control scheme in that <b>certain</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom are designated to be under position control, and the remaining <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom to be under force control. However, the methodology is also a shared control scheme because some <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom can be put under manual control and the other <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom put under computer control. Unlike other hybrid control schemes, which process position and force commands independently, this scheme provides a force control loop built {{on top of a}} position control inner loop. This feature minimizes the computational burden and increases disturbance rejection. A simple implementation is achieved partly because the joint control servos that are part of most robots can be used to provide the position control inner loop. Along with this control scheme, several menus were implemented for the convenience of the user. The implemented control scheme was successfully demonstrated for the tasks of hinged-panel opening and peg-in-hole insertion...|$|R
