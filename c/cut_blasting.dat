40|$|Blasting with {{wedge cut}} {{is the key}} to the {{efficiency}} of roadway excavation in coal mines, particularly where the rock face is highly laminated. The quality of the wedge cuts can directly affect blasting results. A series of model experiments were carried out in the Blasting Laboratory of Henan Polytechnique University, China, in order to improve the quality of wedge cuts and increase roadway development rates in the South Wing rail of Tunliu mine. Three groups of twelve wedge cut model experiments were conducted, which showed that the wedge cutting boreholes angle can affect the depth and volume of blasted zone. It was found that; symmetrical cut pattern was beneficial, and effective stemming of the blasting holes can enhance explosive energy efficiency and ensure effective blasting. Suitable roadway wedge <b>cut</b> <b>blasting</b> parameters were determined through the analysis of test results...|$|E

40|$|Questions {{have arisen}} {{regarding}} {{the applicability of}} seismic sensors to detect mining (re-entry) with a tunnel boring machine (TBM). Unlike <b>cut</b> and <b>blast</b> techniques of mining which produce impulsive seismic signals, the TBM produces seismic signals which are of long duration. (There are well established techniques available for detecting and locating {{the sources of the}} impulsive signals.) The Yucca Mountain repository offered an opportunity to perform field evaluations of the capabilities of seismic sensors because during much of 1996, mining there was progressing {{with the use of a}} TBM. During the mining of the repository`s southern branch, an effort was designed to evaluate whether the TBM could be detected, identified and located using seismic sensors. Three data acquisition stations were established in the Yucca Mountain area to monitor the TBM activity. A ratio of short term average to long term average algorithm was developed for use in detection based on the characteristics shown in the time series. For location of the source of detected signals, FK analysis was used on the array data to estimate back azimuths. The back azimuth from the 3 component system was estimated from the horizontal components. Unique features in the timing of the seismic signal were used to identify the source as the TBM...|$|R

40|$|Drilling and Blasting is {{a common}} {{technique}} of tunnel driving, either for mining or civil purposes, at least for lengths shorter than 3 - 4 km. The technology is surely "mature", hence it offers a huge variety of cases to be analyzed. The report deals with {{the subject of the}} compliance of the actual blasting results with the design requirements (contour and pull). Three factors are obviously involved: explosive, rock and drilling; the main objective of the report is to asses in some simple cases the relative importance of each of them, and to describe a simple methodology to do that. A number of rounds in mine drifting operations, covering a variety of rock-drilling system-explosive assortments have been carefully surveyed; rock shows important differences from one site to another with respect to the quality class; drilling is performed with manually steered jumbo in some drifts, with computerized jumbo in other drifts; the general blasting pattern is not different from one site to another, but at places pipe charges are used in contour holes, at places fully coupled charges. The evaluation of the influence of the rock on the excavation difficulty is another objective of the study. Difficulty can be inferred from specific drilling work consumption, specific explosive consumption or from both. Drilling consumption, which means the relative fineness of explosive distribution in the rock-mass required in order to obtain a satisfactory blast, has been assumed to be a reliable criterion {{on the basis of the}} narrower dispersion of the data, with respect to explosive consumption. Being the study aimed to classify by relative difficulty the rock types, rather than the operations, the effect of the cross section (whose influence on specific consumption by far exceeds the one of rock type) has to be accounted for by normalizing consumptions, i. e. by defining a normal cross section v/ specific consumption correlation, to be used as a reference line. Rock classes are related to difficulty classes; a wide dispersion is still observable, which indicates that the rock designation criterion based on lithological type should be improved by adding at least a second descriptive element. Anyhow, the simple lithological designation provides a first approximation ranking of the rocks to the intended purpose. The sensitivity of the pattern performances to drilling precision is analyzed in the same way. Tolerance standards for drilling machinery related to drilling pattern features are proposed. Data collected to establish the quality of the results of the blasts are: the overbreak value, the efficiency (actual pull/design pull ratio), the half cast factor of the contour holes. The relationships linking these indicators of quality to the features of the rock, of the drilling system and of the charging are analyzed and discussed. The statistical basis of the study is provided by data collected from a large number of cases, obtained from technical literature and from on site inspections. Analysis has been carried out on rounds of variable cross sections (from few to 160 m 3), with either parallel or inclined hole <b>cuts,</b> <b>blasted</b> using a wide range of explosives and ignition systems. A general methodology to establish the main reasons of observed inaccuracies and to foresee the consequences of changes in the drilling and blasting practice is presented in the conclusion...|$|R

40|$|Background Production of carp dominates world aquaculture. More than 1. {{1 million}} tonnes of rohu carp, Labeo rohita (Hamilton), were {{produced}} in 2010. Aeromonas hydrophila is a bacterial pathogen causing aeromoniasis in rohu, {{and is a}} major problem for carp production worldwide. There is a need to better understand the genetic mechanisms affecting resistance to this disease, and to develop tools that can be used with selective breeding to improve resistance. Here we use a 6 K SNP array to genotype 21 full-sibling families of L. rohita that were experimentally challenged intra-peritoneally with a virulent strain of A. hydrophila to scan the genome for quantitative trait loci associated with disease resistance. Results In all, 3193 SNPs were found to be informative and were used to create a linkage map and to scan for QTL affecting resistance to A. hydrophila. The linkage map consisted of 25 linkage groups, corresponding to the number of haploid chromosomes in L. rohita. Male and female linkage maps were similar in terms of order, coverage (1384 and 1393 cM, respectively) and average interval distances (1. 32 and 1. 35 cM, respectively). Forty-one percent of the SNPs were annotated with gene identity using <b>BLAST</b> (<b>cut</b> off E-score of 0. 001). Twenty-one SNPs mapping to ten linkage groups showed significant associations with the traits hours of survival and dead or alive (P < 0. 05 after Bonferroni correction). Of the SNPs showing significant or suggestive associations with the traits, several were homologous to genes of known immune function or were in close linkage to such genes. Genes of interest included heat shock proteins (70, 60, 105 and “small heat shock proteins”), mucin (5 b precursor and 2), lectin (receptor and CD 22), tributyltin-binding protein, major histocompatibility loci (I and II), complement protein component c 7 - 1, perforin 1, ubiquitin (ligase, factor e 4 b isoform 2 and conjugation enzyme e 2 c), proteasome subunit, T-cell antigen receptor and lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine kinase.

60|$|He rode away chuckling. He {{left the}} natives vaguely uneasy. They feared the fat sinful old man, and neither the missionaries' abuse of him nor the scorn which Manuma had learnt in Apia made them forget {{that he had}} a devilish cunning and that no man had ever braved him without in the long run {{suffering}} for it. They found out within twenty-four hours what scheme he had devised. It was characteristic. For next morning a great band of men, women, and children came into the village and the chief men said that they had made a bargain with Walker to build the road. He had offered them twenty pounds and they had accepted. Now the cunning lay in this, that the Polynesians have rules of hospitality which have all the force of laws; an etiquette of absolute rigidity made it necessary {{for the people of the}} village not only to give lodging to the strangers, but to provide them with food and drink as long as they wished to stay. The inhabitants of Matautu were outwitted. Every morning the workers went out in a joyous band, <b>cut</b> down trees, <b>blasted</b> rocks, levelled here and there and then in the evening tramped back again, and ate and drank, ate heartily, danced, sang hymns, and enjoyed life. For them it was a picnic. But soon their hosts began to wear long faces; the strangers had enormous appetites, and the plantains and the bread-fruit vanished before their rapacity; the alligator-pear trees, whose fruit sent to Apia might sell for good money, were stripped bare. Ruin stared them in the face. And then they found that the strangers were working very slowly. Had they received a hint from Walker that they might take their time? At this rate by the time the road was finished there would not be a scrap of food in the village. And worse than this, they were a laughing-stock; when one or other of them went to some distant hamlet on an errand he found that the story had got there before him, and he was met with derisive laughter. There is nothing the Kanaka can endure less than ridicule. It was not long before much angry talk passed among the sufferers. Manuma was no longer a hero; he had to put up with a good deal of plain speaking, and one day what Walker had suggested came to pass: a heated argument turned into a quarrel and half a dozen of the young men set upon the chief's son and gave him such a beating that for a week he lay bruised and sore on the pandanus mats. He turned from side to side and could find no ease. Every day or two the administrator rode over on his old mare and watched the progress of the road. He was not a man to resist the temptation of taunting the fallen foe, and he missed no opportunity to rub into the shamed inhabitants of Matautu the bitterness of their humiliation. He broke their spirit. And one morning, putting their pride in their pockets, a figure of speech, since pockets they had not, they all set out with the strangers and started working on the road. It was urgent to get it done quickly if they wanted to save any food at all, and the whole village joined in. But they worked silently, with rage and mortification in their hearts, and even the children toiled in silence. The women wept as they carried away bundles of brushwood. When Walker saw them he laughed so much that he almost rolled out of his saddle. The news spread quickly and tickled the people of the island to death. This was the greatest joke of all, the crowning triumph of that cunning old white man whom no Kanaka had ever been able to circumvent; and they came from distant villages, with their wives and children, to look at the foolish folk who had refused twenty pounds to make the road and now were forced to work for nothing. But the harder they worked the more easily went the guests. Why should they hurry, when they were getting good food for nothing and the longer they took about the job the better the joke became? At last the wretched villagers could stand it no longer, and they were come this morning to beg the administrator to send the strangers back to their own homes. If he would do this they promised to finish the road themselves for nothing. For him it was a victory complete and unqualified. They were humbled. A look of arrogant complacence spread over his large, naked face, and he seemed to swell in his chair like a great bullfrog. There was something sinister in his appearance, so that Mackintosh shivered with disgust. Then in his booming tones he began to speak.|$|R
