5000|$|La Manzanilla {{is a small}} Mexican town of {{approximately}} 2,000 inhabitants. The village {{is located in the}} southeastern corner of the Bay of Tenacatita, on the Costalegre of southwestern mainland Mexico in the state of Jalisco. [...] "Manzanilla" [...] is Spanish for <b>chamomille.</b> The town is a popular beach destination for U.S., Canadian and local Mexican tourists. Many of the residents are employed in fishing, local palapa restaurants, small hotels, and grocery stores. La Manzanilla is approximately {{three and a half hours}} south of Puerto Vallarta and one hour north of Manzanillo by car.It has a population of about 300 American crocodiles in the nearby nature sanctuary.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of aqueous extracts of dried <b>chamomille</b> (Matricaria chamomilla L.), in concentrations of 2 %, 5 % and 10 %, and fresh parts of this plant, in concentrations of 10 %, 20 % and 30 % on survival of black bean aphid (Aphis fabae Scop.) on the leaves of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) variety "Bartek" and on feeding of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say.) on the leaves of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) variety “Bellarosa”. In these researches on impact of water extracts from <b>chamomille</b> on mortality of wingless females and larvae of black bean aphid, 15 laboratory’s observations in the 8 -hour intervals was made. In the studies of the effects of aqueous extracts of <b>chamomille</b> on the dynamics of Leptinotarsa decemlineata feeding on the potato leaves, 4 laboratory’s observations in 12 -hour intervals was made. Observations were carried out in 6 replicates divided into L 2 and L 4 larvae stages. Aquatic extracts of chamomile limited the survival of black bean aphid larvae and wingless females – the higher the concentration, the stronger the effects of the extract, where young insects were found to be more susceptible. Extracts of the dried plant whose concentration was below 5 % and extracts of the fresh plant whose concentration was below 20 % were found to be ineffective against black bean aphids. In all the analysed concentrations the aquatic extracts of chamomile were found to be ineffective against L 2 and L 4 larvae of Colorado potato beetle...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{bioactive}} compounds {{present in}} flower heads of German <b>Chamomille,</b> were extracted and isolated in pure forms by chromatographic techniques. These compounds, spiroketal enol ethers, present in both isomeric forms Z and E, were characterized and unequivocally identified by spectroscopic techniques. One- (¹H, 13 C) and two-dimensional (¹H-¹H-COSY, ¹H-¹H-NOESY, HMQC and HMBC) NMR {{were used to}} assign the configuration of each isomeric compound. It was also found that irradiation of the extracts with UV light induced the photoisomerization of the en-yn-dicycloethers favoring {{the formation of the}} more stable E isomer...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{efficacy}} of solarization (S), dazomet (D) and metam-sodium (MS) treatments on some weed species and their potential as alternative to methyl bromide (MB) was investigated in strawberry growing areas in Aydin province of Turkey. Efficacies of treatments were variable for weed species. Total five weed species, namely common purslane, annual bluegrass, common <b>chamomille,</b> horseweed and shepherd`s purse were considered in this study. Highest efficacy on weeds was provided by MB application, but S is a safe alternative to MB under suitable climatic conditions, because its application is economic and safer to environment and user. In case of horseweed none of the treatments reduced the coverage of this species significantly...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} some natural UV {{absorbers}} on the photostabilization of spiroketal enol ethers (en-yn-dicycloethers) present in German <b>Chamomille</b> extracts pre-coated on glass plates (solid phase) was examined. Plates {{were exposed to}} sunlight radiation from a UV-sun radiation lamp, in the presence and absence of gallic acid, cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and aloin, all natural UV absorbers. At particular intervals the remaining concentration of the en-yn-dicycloethers was analyzed by HPLC. Using first-order kinetic equation, the dissipation half-life values (DT 50) for the degradation of the en-yn-dicycloethers under UV-sun radiation were obtained. The {{results showed that the}} addition of cumaric acid and caffeic acid provided moderate degree of photostabilization of the en-yn-dicycloethers and that addition of ferulic acid provided the best photostabilization among the UV absorbers studied. Photostabilization effect appears to be due to a competitive energy absorption of UV photons by the absorber molecules...|$|E
