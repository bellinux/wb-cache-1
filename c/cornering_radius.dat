Second, as the brakes are applied and the weight shifts forward, the forks are compressed. The compression of the forks changes the motorcycles steering geometry, decreasing stability {{in a way that}} makes the motorcycle more apt to lean and more quickly change direction. Third, decreasing speed decreases the motorcycle's <b>cornering</b> <b>radius.</b> Conversely, accelerating while turning increases the motorcycles <b>cornering</b> <b>radius.</b> [...] Fourth, trailing off the brakes while entering blind or tight corners allows the rider to slow if something unexpected blocks the rider's path. Because the motorcycle is already on the brakes and the front tire is getting additional traction from already slowing, the rider can slow even more with very little risk, depending on surface conditions. However, applying the brakes after the motorcycle is already leaned over can be exceedingly risky depending on surface conditions and lean angle.|$|E

First, the system estimates the path (the radius of curvature of the path center line) by determining the <b>cornering</b> <b>radius</b> of the vehicle based on the detected yaw rate, steering wheel angle, and vehicle velocity. Second, the system judges whether or not the current detected vehicle {{is the same as the}} previous detected vehicle by comparing the position of the detected vehicle with a position that is estimated based on the calculated offset from the center line of the path each time a radar scan occurs. Usually, the radius of curvature of the path center line is assumed to be unchanged during the period between radar scans. However, in cases of curves near an entrance or exit, the radius of curvature of the path actually does change during the period between radar scans. In these cases, if the offset is assumed to be unchanged, the radar fails to lock onto the preceding vehicle. Therefore, because the position of the preceding vehicle relative to the driver's own vehicle is influenced by the sideslip of vehicle, the offset needs to be corrected at each radar scan based on the most recent detected <b>cornering</b> <b>radius.</b>|$|E

The effectiveness of FRP wrapping for RC columns mainly depend upon <b>corner</b> <b>radius</b> of the specimens as well as number of FRP layers used for the confinement. An attempt has been made hereby to investigate the experimental behaviour of GFRP wrapped small scale square RC columns with varying <b>corner</b> <b>radii.</b> Experimentally evaluated behaviour of GFRP wrapped RC columns is compared with the performance observed for non-wrapped RC columns. 15 RC columns having cross-sectional dimensions 125 mm × 125 mm and length of 1200 mm have been tested under axial compression. Three columns are unwrapped and have been designated as control specimens. Three columns each with <b>corner</b> <b>radius</b> equivalent to cover of 25 mm are wrapped with one and two layers of GFRP, respectively. To avoid a premature rupture of the GFRP composite, remaining six columns with <b>corner</b> <b>radius</b> of 5 mm have been wrapped with one and two layers of GFRP, respectively. GFRP wrapped columns go under higher axial displacement {{in order to gain}} higher compressive strength over the control column.

In this work, the effect of variation of <b>corner</b> <b>radius,</b> on thermo- hydrodynamic characteristics of a three dimensional model of T-junction square mini-channel duct of 2 mm sides is studied under constant heat flux applied (H 2 type) on the horizontal part. The length of horizontal section is 300 mm. The T junction is placed at the middle of 60 mm long vertical section. The numerical simulation was done in general purpose CFD package FLUENT. The simulation is performed for two Reynolds number, one in laminar flow range (Re 1000) and the other in turbulent flow range (Re 3200). It is observed that incorporation of fillets at T-junction changed the nature of the fluid flow and heat transfer locally. Variations in velocity and Nusselt number have been observed in both the laminar and turbulent flow regime. Within developing region local velocity is found to be increasing with increase in <b>corner</b> <b>radii</b> towards downstream of the channel in laminar and turbulent flow. Whereas the local Nusselt numbers are less as compared to base model for all heating conditions and <b>corner</b> <b>radii,</b> resulting in local wall temperature rise.
