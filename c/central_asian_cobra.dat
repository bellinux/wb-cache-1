40|$|Seven {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) {{were developed}} against neurotoxin I (NT- 1), a protein from <b>central</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>cobra</b> (Naja naja oxiana) venom which binds specifically to {{nicotinic acetylcholine receptor}} (AchR). All of the mAbs cross-reacted with another long-chain post-synaptic neurotoxin, Bungarus multicinctus alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BT), but not Naja naja kaouthia alpha-cobratoxin, in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (e. l. i. s. a.). Short-chain post-synaptic neurotoxins like Naja naja atra cobrotoxin, Laticauda semifasciata erabutoxin b, or N. n. oxiana neurotoxin II did not cross-react with the NT- 1 mAbs, but an antigen(s) found in Dendroaspis polylepis, Acanthophis antarcticus and Pseudechis australis venoms was immunoreactive. The e. l. i. s. a. readings for dithiothreitol-reduced NT- 1 and NT- 1 mAbs ranged from 13 to 27 % of those for native toxin but reduced alpha-BT was not immunoreactive. Synthetic NT- 1 peptides were used in epitope-mapping studies and two, non-contiguous regions (Cys 15 -Tyr 23 and Lys 25 -Gly 33 or Pro 17 -Lys 25 and Asp 29 -Lys 37) were recognized by the NT- 1 mAbs. The NT- 1 mAbs individually inhibited 31 - 71 % of alpha-BT binding to AchR in vitro and afforded a slight protective effect in vivo with a toxin: antibody mole ratio of 1 : 1. 5. This report {{is the first to}} describe mAbs which recognize and protect against a heterologous, long-chain, post-synaptic neurotoxin from snake venom...|$|E

40|$|The CTs (cytotoxins) I and II are {{positively}} charged three-finger folded proteins from venom of Naja oxiana (the <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>cobra).</b> They belong to S- and P-type respectively based on Ser- 28 and Pro- 30 residues within a putative phospholipid bilayer binding site. Previously, we investigated {{the interaction of}} CTII with multilamellar liposomes of dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol by wide-line 31 P-NMR spectroscopy. To compare interactions of these proteins with phospholipids, we investigated the interaction of CTI with the multilamellar liposomes of dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol analogously. The effect of CTI on the chemical shielding anisotropy and deformation of the liposomes in the magnetic field was determined at different temperatures and lipid/protein ratios. It was found that both the proteins do not affect lipid organization in the gel state. In the liquid crystalline state of the bilayer they disturb lipid packing. To get insight into the interactions of the toxins with membranes, Monte Carlo simulations of CTI and CTII {{in the presence of}} the bilayer membrane were performed. It was found that both the toxins penetrate into the bilayer with the tips of all the three loops. However, the free-energy gain on membrane insertion of CTI is smaller (by ≈ 7  kcal/mol; 1  kcal≡ 4. 184  kJ) when compared with CTII, because of the lower hydrophobicity of the membrane-binding site of CTI. These results clearly demonstrate that the P-type cytotoxins interact with membranes stronger than those of the S-type, although the mode of the membrane insertion is similar for both the types...|$|E

30|$|China makes {{full use}} of its close {{geographical}} position to reinforce and expand energy cooperation with <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries. The energy imports of China from <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries have grown gradually in recent years. <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries have {{become one of the}} important energy strategic partners of China. China mainly exports light industrial products (e.g., textile) to <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries, and, in turn, imports crude oil, natural gas, and industrial raw materials from them. Such complementary resources and trade structure facilitate economic and trade contact between China and <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries. The export commodity structure of <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries have only changed slightly in the past. Energy resources and minerals are still the major export commodities of <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries. For instance, the principal export products of Kazakhstan are petroleum and natural gas, whereas the main export products of Turkmenistan include natural gas, petroleum products, textile, and electricity. Uzbekistan mainly exports natural gas. According to statistics of the China Customs Statistical Yearbook (2001 – 2011) (Bernauer and Siegfried 2012), the value of energy trade between China and <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries grew continuously. Particularly, the value of energy trade between China and <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries achieved rapid growth in 2007 and 2010 since the opening of the China-Kazakhstan oil pipeline in 2006 and the Central Asia-China natural gas pipeline in 2009.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the choices}} between regionalism and multilateralism, {{and the impact}} of WTO membership on the five <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries. The two main sections analyse (1) why the large number of regional trade agreements which the <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries have signed have had little economic impact, and (2) the consequences for the <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries of Chinese and Russian WTO membership and the consequences of the current <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> applicants’ (Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) own WTO accession. During the 1990 s, many regional trade agreements were signed - arrangements both among the <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries, and between <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries and their neighbours (Russia to the north, China to the east, and Iran and Turkey to the south) – but not implemented and, although the Kyrgyz Republic became a WTO member in 1998, the <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries vacillated between pursuing regional and multilateral trade policy avenues. The <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries’ relationship to the WTO became a more pressing issue after China’s long-running WTO accession negotiations were successfully concluded in December 200 and as Russian negotiations are move forward.

40|$|AbstractRecent global {{economic}} and financial crisis and exchange rate volatilities in Eurasian countries caused significant impact on exchange arrangements and trade flows in <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> economies and thereby unveiled the necessity of monetary cooperation in the region. For this, current paper proposes a deviation measurement for coordinated exchange rate policies in <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries to enhance the regional monetary cooperation. <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> Currency Unit - CACU is calculated as a weighted average of <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> currencies against USD following the method {{used to calculate the}} European Currency Unit (ECU) and the Asian Monetary Unit (AMU) introduced by Ogawa and Shimizu (2005) for East Asian countries; and indicator that displays the degree of deviation of <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> currencies against CACU at the benchmark rate. Three types of CACU are considered in the paper based on nominal GDP, GDP measured at PPP and trade volume, while deviation indicator is grounded on arithmetic average of GDP at PPP and trade volume shares. Findings indicate that <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> currencies significantly deviate in terms of other <b>Central</b> <b>Asian</b> currencies. Furthermore, nominal and real deviation indicators signal that the trends vary in both the scales and directions. Thus, these measurements can be utilized for enhancing coordinated exchange rate policies among Central Asia...|$|R
40|$|After the {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, <b>central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries that acquired independence received high attention from great powers inside and outside the region in terms of their important geostrategic position, abundant energy and resource reserves and diversified and heterogeneous cultural patterns. Cooperation relationship of energy is an important component in foreign relations of <b>central</b> <b>Asian</b> countries.
