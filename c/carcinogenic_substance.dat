50|$|Fetal pigs {{are often}} {{preserved}} in formaldehyde, a <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substance.</b> A 1980 {{study found that}} exposure to formaldehyde could possibly cause nasal cancer in rats, leading to research on whether this was possible in humans or not. In 1995 it was concluded by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) that formaldehyde is a carcinogen for humans.In Albania, fetal pigs are preserved by means of alcohol, and are used as an ingredient in Raki, a local moonshine liquor.|$|E
5000|$|When {{exposure}} to a <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substance</b> is suspected, the cause/effect relationship on any given case can never be ascertained. Lung cancer occurs spontaneously, {{and there is no}} difference between a [...] "natural" [...] cancer and another one caused by radon (or smoking). Furthermore, it takes years for a cancer to develop, so that determining the past exposure of a case is usually very approximative. The health effect of radon can only be demonstrated through theory and statistical observation.|$|E

50|$|Ideally <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substances</b> {{should be}} avoided by {{substitution}} with less hazardous substances. Alternate form of <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substances</b> may {{also be used to}} minimise the risk of exposure. In the case of carcinogens which pose a danger through inhalation, pastes or pellets can be used to avoid the possibility of airborne dust.

50|$|Cancer slope factors (CSF) {{are used}} to {{estimate}} the risk of cancer associated with exposure to a carcinogenic or potentially <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substance.</b> A slope factor is an upper bound, approximating a 95% confidence limit, on the increased cancer risk from a lifetime exposure to an agent by ingestion or inhalation. This estimate, usually expressed in units of proportion (of a population) affected per mg of substance/kg body weight-day, is generally reserved {{for use in the}} low-dose region of the dose-response relationship, that is, for exposures corresponding to risks less than 1 in 100. Slope factors are also referred to as cancer potency factors (PF).|$|E
50|$|Standard {{containment}} {{devices such}} as fume hoods, glove boxes, use of high efficiency particular air (HEPA) filters, ventilated containment or weighing, or placing the <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substance</b> in a sealed weighed container (Tare Method). The employment of these methods and equipment can help reduce the unnecessary exposure to the carcinogens. Special {{care must be taken}} when using single exposure carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. All surfaces where carcinogens are used must be of a suitable material, e.g.: stainless steel, plastic trays or absorbent plastic backed paper. Correct signs must be placed outside of the work stating 'No eating, drinking or smoking' and 'Danger carcinogen in use. Authorised personnel only'.|$|E
50|$|A quick {{response}} to an accident or spill can greatly reduce exposure to a <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substance.</b> If a spill or accident occurs ensure that the contaminated materials are disposed of in the correct hazardous waste bin(ensure stained clothing is removed immediately), a correct spill kit is used on the spill, {{in the case of}} a liquid spill, ensure that the spill is cleaned as soon as possible to prevent the formation of aerosols, have employees tested for exposure to carcinogens, refer to MSDS for specific treatment or dangers. Prepare spill kits and emergency plans prior to beginning use of the carcinogenic substances and {{in the case of a}} large spill vacate the area and call for assistance.|$|E

25|$|Wood {{combustion}} products can include toxic and <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substances.</b> Generally, the heartwood {{of a tree}} contains the highest amounts of toxic substances, but precautions should be taken if one is burning wood of an unknown nature, since some trees' woodsmoke can be highly toxic.|$|R
50|$|Methysticin induces the {{function}} of the hepatic enzyme CYP1A1, an enzyme involved in the toxification of benzoapyrene into (+)-benzoapyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, one of the most highly <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substances</b> known. This property is shared by the related compound dihdromethysticin, both of which occur in significant quantities in Piper methysticum.|$|R
50|$|Glycidamide {{is part of}} the {{chemical}} group of amides and oxiranes, it is classified as a <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substance.</b> It is associated with tobacco either as natural component, pyrolysis product in tobacco smoke or additive for one or more types of tobacco products. Glycidamide is formed from acrylamide. Acrylamide is an industrial chemical which is used in several ways, such as production of polyacrylamides for (waste)water treatment, textile, paper processing and cosmetics. It is also a product formed in certain foods prepared at high temperature frying, baking or roasting, such as fried potatoes, bakery products and coffee. Glycidamide is formed through the reaction of unsaturated fatty acids with oxygen. It is a dangerous substance, since it causes small mutations in cells which can result in several forms of cancer.|$|E
40|$|A <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substance,</b> 9, 10 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benza n thracene, was {{put into}} the urinary bladder of male rabbits and the changes {{occurred}} in the mucous membrane were studied. Slight proliferation of epithelium was found in 18 days from the iniciation, nodu l a r or cystic proliferation in 25 days and at last papillary proliferation in 93 days. Cystitis cystica was also found in 25 days.

30|$|Acetaldehyde {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) derived from wood [1] and wood-based materials [2, 3]. It is also commonly detected in both indoor and outdoor environments, although its concentration in indoor environments is larger than in the surrounding environment [4 – 6]. Acetaldehyde is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization [7], as a group 2 B <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substance,</b> meaning that it is possibly carcinogenic to humans and thus, in Japan, it has indoor air guideline value of 48  μg/m 3 [8].|$|E

40|$|An {{information}} campaign, organised in the Netherlands {{to foster}} safer working conditions {{for those who}} find themselves exposed to <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substances,</b> has been evaluated. Posters, leaflets, and booklets had been distributed {{to those who are}} liable to run a risk while at work, managers as well as workmen. To assess the impact and the effects of the campaign, a panel study was carried out among those employees who actually handle <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substances.</b> A random sample of this target group (N = 548) was interviewed by telephone a short while {{before the start of the}} campaign (pretest) and then again three months after its inception (posttest). In addition, a similar sample from the target group (N = 550) was approached for a posttest only, to control for potential measurement effects. The reach and respondents' opinion of the campaign materials, was charted as well. By means of covariance and loglinear analysis an inventory was made of the resulting changes in knowledge, attitude, behavioural intentions and interpersonal communication concerning work involving carcinogens. It was found that people who had the opportunity to study the information ended up being more alive to the risks of working with <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>substances</b> and were better able to take preventive action. A further positive effect is that the campaign appears to have encouraged people to communicate on the subject with colleagues, with management and with others (including the occupational health officer) ...|$|R
