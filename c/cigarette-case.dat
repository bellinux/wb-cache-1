25|$|Stanley pressed {{more and}} more gifts of food and wine, a gold <b>cigarette-case</b> and {{ultimately}} a suit of a quality beyond the means, and clothing coupons, of a junior minister in post-war Britain. Stanley was full of rather vague industrial and commercial propositions that never came to any resolution. Stanley also paid for suits for Gibson and Minister of Works Charles Key.|$|E
60|$|He {{pulled his}} <b>cigarette-case</b> from his pocket. Beatrice looked inside it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Bromide of skittles! Why didn't {{you tell}} me this before? Let go of my arm, and I'll see if there's {{anything}} in my <b>cigarette-case</b> to suit your complaint.' Spurstow hunted among his day-clothes, turned up the lamp, opened a little silver <b>cigarette-case,</b> and advanced on the expectant Hummil with the daintiest of fairy squirts.|$|E
60|$|The old writers {{appear to}} have been {{singularly}} unaware of the importance attaching to these socks, and ties, and <b>cigarette-cases.</b> They told us merely what the man felt and thought. What reliance can we place upon them? How could they possibly have known what sort of man he was underneath his clothes? Tweed or broadcloth is not transparent. Even could they have got rid of his clothes there would have remained his flesh and bones. It was pure guess-work. They did not observe.|$|R

50|$|He {{was born}} in 1854 in Loppi, Finland as {{a son of a}} {{bookkeeper}} Anders Gustaf Hollming of Loviisa and of Katarina Petterson. Hollming was apprenticed to the goldsmith Karl F. Ekholm in Helsinki {{at the beginning of the}} 1870s years. In 1876 he settled in St.Petersburg and registered as a goldworker. In 1880 he qualified as master and opened his workshop at 35 Kazanskaya Street and was hired by Fabergé soon. He had three sons from Erika G. Abrahamsson. In 1900 the Hollming workshop moved to 24 Bolshaya Morskaya under the same roof as Fabergé. In 1913 he ran the workshop together with Otto Hanhinen, his father's assistant. He mainly produced <b>cigarette-cases</b> in silver, gold and enamel, miniature Easter Eggs and small gem-set, enameled jewels such as cuff-links, brooches and pins. Many times he produced these objects for the House of Fabergé.|$|R
60|$|Sanders {{picked up}} the <b>cigarette-case,</b> which he had left on the table.|$|E
60|$|The prince made {{no further}} comment. He drew a tortoise-shell-and-gold <b>cigarette-case</b> from his pocket.|$|E
60|$|Lady Hilda {{withdrew from}} her muff a gold <b>cigarette-case</b> {{and a little}} box of matches.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin {{looked around}} for Felix, but he had disappeared. He took out his <b>cigarette-case.</b>|$|E
60|$|He gave Dick a {{handsome}} silver <b>cigarette-case,</b> engraved with a rather unusual pattern round the crest.|$|E
60|$|John {{turned to}} me, taking out his <b>cigarette-case,</b> and {{lighting}} a cigarette {{as he did}} so.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Grex {{sipped his}} pale, lemon-flavoured tea and toyed with his <b>cigarette-case.</b> He was eating nothing.|$|E
60|$|Cranley sat down, lit a cigarette, {{and laid}} the smooth silver <b>cigarette-case</b> before him. Then he began to deal.|$|E
60|$|Lord Arranmore {{pushed his}} <b>cigarette-case</b> across the small round table which stood between their easy-chairs. The room was empty.|$|E
60|$|MARGARET. I daresay. [She {{mechanically}} {{takes out}} her <b>cigarette-case,</b> catches the lift of TWISDEN'S eyebrows, {{and puts it}} back].|$|E
6000|$|... 'Bosh! You'd do {{the same}} yourself. I feel a new man, thanks to that <b>cigarette-case.</b> You're going over to camp now, aren't you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Line bachelors use 'em while we're away; but they're nice to {{come back}} to after 'heef.'" [...] Matthews passed me his <b>cigarette-case.</b>|$|E
60|$|He stooped as he spoke, {{over the}} table, and Cranley saw him {{pick up the}} silver <b>cigarette-case.</b> It was a {{handsome}} piece of polished silver.|$|E
60|$|Barton {{picked up}} the <b>cigarette-case,</b> and as he, for the first time, {{examined}} its interior, some broken glass fell out and tinkled on the floor.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{took his}} <b>cigarette-case</b> out of his pocket, {{selected}} a cigarette, struck a match and lit it, still avoiding Klara's fixed and staring gaze.|$|E
60|$|He calmly went on {{with his}} task, and sitting down she took out a silver <b>cigarette-case.</b> After {{a minute or two}} she looked up at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are too charming {{to go in}} for philanthropy, Mr. Gray--far too charming." [...] And Lord Henry flung {{himself down}} on the divan, and opened his <b>cigarette-case.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{dropped into}} a chair with a deep breath. He took up his <b>cigarette-case,</b> {{but before he could}} light a match the gong sounded from the distance.|$|E
60|$|But {{he had no}} <b>cigarette-case.</b> No one {{had ever}} {{happened}} to give him one, so he hadn't the habit, and people who carried cigarette-cases he regarded as effeminate.|$|E
6000|$|She {{continued}} {{to handle the}} <b>cigarette-case,</b> without, however, having profited by its contents. [...] "I don't think that as regards Mr. Longdon and me you know quite so much as you suppose." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{touch on}} her arm aroused her. M. Gandinot was {{standing}} by her side. Terms, apparently had been agreed upon and the interview concluded, for in his hand was a silver <b>cigarette-case.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You spilt {{the liquor}} yourself," [...] Barton {{answered}} coolly, [...] "when I took away your <b>cigarette-case.</b> I saw you passing the cards {{over the surface}} of it, which anyone can see for himself is a perfect mirror. I tried to warn you--for I did not want a row--when I said the case 'seemed to bring you luck.' But you would not be warned; and when the <b>cigarette-case</b> trick was played out, you fell back on the old dodge with the drop of water. Will anyone else convince himself that I am right before I let Mr. Cranley go?" ...|$|E
60|$|Comus, who had emptied his <b>cigarette-case,</b> became {{suddenly}} clamorous at {{the prospect}} of being temporarily stranded without a smoke. Youghal took the last remaining cigarette from his own case and gravely bisected it.|$|E
60|$|I dined {{that night}} at Rowchester. Lord Blenavon was sulky, and Lady Angela was only fitfully gay. It was not {{altogether}} a cheerful party. Lady Angela left us the moment Blenavon produced his <b>cigarette-case.</b>|$|E
6000|$|At {{the end of}} the {{narrative}} the silver <b>cigarette-case</b> was produced, and the last words that Hummil said as he fell back for the second time were, 'Put me quite to sleep; for if I'm caught I die,--I die!' ...|$|E
60|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} James {{received from}} the Larchers a golden <b>cigarette-case,</b> with a Victoria Cross in diamonds {{on one side and}} an inscription on the other. It was much too magnificent for use, evidently expensive, and not in very good taste.|$|E
6000|$|Up till {{almost the}} last moment Charles nursed his dispatch-box. But as the [...] "baggage-smashers" [...] were taking down our luggage, and a chambermaid was {{lounging}} officiously about {{in search of a}} tip, he laid it down for a second or two on the centre table while he collected his other immediate impedimenta. He couldn't find his <b>cigarette-case,</b> {{and went back to the}} bedroom for it. I helped him hunt, but it had disappeared mysteriously. That moment lost him. When we had found the <b>cigarette-case,</b> and returned to the sitting-room--lo, and behold! the dispatch-box was missing! Charles questioned the servants, but none of them had noticed it. He searched round the room--not a trace of it anywhere.|$|E
60|$|I {{found my}} <b>cigarette-case</b> in my hand, opened it, and {{selected}} {{one of its}} contents, which I placed between my lips. As I was looking round for a match-box, the spectre courteously put his forefinger {{to the end of}} the cigarette, which lighted at once.|$|E
60|$|He {{began to}} nose about. He pulled out drawer after drawer, pottering around {{like an old}} bloodhound, and {{babbling}} {{from time to time}} about Berkeley and his <b>cigarette-case</b> in a way that struck me as perfectly ghastly. I just stood there, losing weight every moment.|$|E
60|$|When I had finished--it {{was not a}} very {{substantial}} meal--I drew my chair to the brasero and handed round my <b>cigarette-case.</b> The old women helped themselves, and a smile of thanks made the face of my gaunt hostess somewhat less repellent. We smoked a while in silence.|$|E
