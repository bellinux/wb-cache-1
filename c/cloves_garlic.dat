50|$|Solo garlic, {{also known}} as single <b>clove</b> <b>garlic,</b> monobulb garlic, single bulb garlic, or pearl garlic, is a variety of Allium sativum (garlic). The size of the single clove differs from {{approximately}} 25 to 50 mm in diameter. It has the flavour of the <b>garlic</b> <b>clove</b> but is somewhat milder and slightly perfumed. The appearance is somewhat akin {{to that of a}} pickling onion, with white skin and often purple stripes. Solo garlic offers the advantage, compared to traditional garlic, of being very quick and easy to peel. Single <b>clove</b> <b>garlic</b> has been grown at the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains, for about 7,000 years. Single <b>cloved</b> black <b>garlic</b> is also available.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a common}} disease in human societies. Proteins non-enzymatic glycation has deleterious effects on the structure and function of proteins. Non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins can {{be involved in the}} pathogenesis of diabetic complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy. One way of preventing this reaction is the use of medicinal plants. Chamomile, <b>clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> are herbs which their alkaloid compounds have antioxidant property. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of chamomile, <b>clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> extract on non-enzymatic glycosylation of albumin. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study, hydroalcoholic extract of chamomile, <b>clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> was prepared. In vitro albumin glycosylation reaction was carried out in presence of different concentrations (0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 1 g/L) of chamomile, <b>clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> extracts and level of glycosylated albumin was measured. Non-enzymatic glycosylation of albumin was determined by nitrobluetetrazuliom method. Absorbance changes were measured in 530 nm by Eppendorf spectrophotometer. Results: In this study, chamomile extract in 0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 1 g/L of its concentrations had respectively 9 %, 17 % and 26 %, inhibitory effect on albumin glycosylation. Albumin glycosylation reaction was inhibited 23 % by 0. 01 g/L concentration of <b>clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> extracts and the level of inhibition of albumin glycosylation decreased by increasing of extracts concentration. Chamomile extract with 0. 1 g/L concentration has the most effect among the studied extracts. Conclusion: In this study, chamomile extract inhibited the in vitro albumin glycosylation reaction. <b>Clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> extracts showed inhibitory effect in low concentration but this effect decreased with increasing of the extract concentration...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science - Animal Sciences & IndustryFadi AramouniBlue-green {{pigments}} {{have the}} ability to form in crushed and whole <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> following a rapid series of enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. Economic losses associated with a reduction in organoleptic quality of garlic (Allium sativum L.) containing blue-green pigments can be incurred. Preventing blue-green pigment formation can mitigate potential financial and brand equity damages. To prevent pigment formation, inactivation of the enzyme which yields pigment substrates is essential. Two methods to inactivate the enzyme associated with pigment formation were explored: blanch treatment of whole <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> (100 °C, 5 min); and soaking of whole, non-blanched <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> in low pH (< 3. 0) acetic or citric acid pickling solutions for seven days. The blanching treatment was effective in inactivating the enzyme as the pigment substrate decreased by approximately 99 % as compared with pigment substrate concentrations in non-blanched <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves.</b> Soaking whole <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> in low pH (< 3. 0) pickling solutions did not result in enzyme inactivation as pigments formed in cloves soaked in the acetic acid pickling solutions; however pigments did not form in cloves soaked in the citric acid pickling solution. This {{may be due to the}} different effect mono- and poly-carboxylic acids have on the permeability of garlic cell membranes. Blanching <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> can be implemented as a processing step to prevent pigment formation. Soaking garlic in a low pH pickling solution comprised of a poly-carboxylic acid does not inactivate the enzyme associated with pigment formation but pigment formation can be prevented. Other methods presented in the literature to prevent pigment formation include controlling growth, harvest and storage conditions, as well as treating <b>garlic</b> <b>clove</b> homogenates with chemical additives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} shown that several {{extracts}} and compounds derived from garlic are able to inhibit Cu 2 + -induced low density lipoprotein oxidation. In this work we explored if the ability of aqueous garlic extract to prevent in vitro Cu 2 + -induced lipoprotein oxidation in human serum is affected by heating (a) aqueous garlic extracts or (b) <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves.</b> In the first case, aqueous extract of raw garlic and garlic powder were studied. In the second case, aqueous extract of boiled <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves,</b> microwave-treated <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves,</b> and pickled <b>garlic</b> were studied. It was also studied if the above mentioned preparations were able to chelate Cu 2 +. Methods Cu 2 + -induced lipoprotein oxidation in human serum was followed by the formation of conjugated dienes at 234 nm and 37 °C by 240 min in a phosphate buffer 20 mM, pH 7. 4. Blood serum and CuSO 4 were added to a final concentration of 0. 67 % and 0. 0125 mM, respectively. The lag time and the area under the curve from the oxidation curves were obtained. The Cu 2 + -chelating properties of garlic extracts were assessed using an approach based upon restoring the activity of xanthine oxidase inhibited in the presence of 0. 050 mM Cu 2 +. The activity of xanthine oxidase was assessed by monitoring the production of superoxide anion at 560 nm and the formation of uric acid at 295 nm. Data were compared by parametric or non-parametric analysis of variance followed by a post hoc test. Results Extracts from garlic powder and raw garlic inhibited in a dose-dependent way Cu 2 + -induced lipoprotein oxidation. The heating of garlic extracts or <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> was unable to alter significantly the increase in lag time and the decrease in the area under the curve observed with the unheated garlic extracts or raw garlic. In addition, {{it was found that the}} garlic extracts were unable to chelate Cu 2 +. Conclusions (a) the heating of aqueous extracts of raw garlic or garlic powder or the heating of <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> by boiling, microwave or pickling do not affect garlic's ability to inhibit Cu 2 + -induced lipoprotein oxidation in human serum, and (b) this ability is not secondary to Cu 2 + -chelation. </p...|$|R
