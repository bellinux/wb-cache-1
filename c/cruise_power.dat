50|$|The Hortens {{concluded}} that the low-drag flying wing design could meet all of the goals: by reducing the drag, <b>cruise</b> <b>power</b> could be lowered {{to the point where}} the range requirement could be met. They put forward their private project, the H.IX, as the basis for the bomber. The Government Air Ministry (Reichsluftfahrtministerium) approved the Horten proposal, but ordered the addition of two 30 mm cannons, as they felt the aircraft would also be useful as a fighter due to its estimated top speed being significantly higher than that of any Allied aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The {{layout of}} the engines on the Orlyonok was unusual and a {{testament}} of {{the special needs of}} such an unconventional aircraft. Mounted {{in the top of the}} tail, it featured a massive Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprop, the most powerful turboprop ever made, which provided <b>cruise</b> <b>power.</b> The nose of the aircraft mounted two turbofan engines with the intakes on top of the nose and the exhaust along the side of the fuselage, the thrust of these engines being vectored under the wings to produce PAR thrust (increased lift and extra propulsion) for takeoff. Under cruise conditions and in ground effect, the front engines could be shut off since their power was unnecessary to keep the aircraft aloft; this also minimized intake of water, salt and low flying birds.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the engine}} {{being used in}} higher-altitude fighter roles, a number of {{attempts}} were made to address the limited performance of the original supercharger. The BMW 801E was a modification of the D-2 using different gear ratios that tuned the supercharger for higher altitudes. Although takeoff power was unaffected, <b>cruise</b> <b>power</b> increased over 100 hp (75 kW) and [...] "high power" [...] modes for climb and combat were likewise improved by up to 150 hp (110 kW). The E model was also used {{as the basis for the}} BMW 801R, which included a much more complex and powerful two-stage four-speed supercharger, as well as die cast hydronalium-alloy cylinder heads, strengthened crankshaft and pistons, and chromed cylinders and exhaust valves; it was anticipated this version would produce over , or over [...] with MW 50 methanol-water injection.|$|E

25|$|Another recent custom {{has been}} to fly a burgee and/or a <b>cruising</b> or <b>power</b> {{squadron}} flag from the starboard spreader. This custom has arisen because many sailboats today place a racing flag or wind indicator at the masthead.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ultimate}} {{solution to the}} throttling problem was the B and C series of the engine. These engines used two combustion chambers, the original one (retroactively given the name Hauptofen), and a second, smaller Marschofen chamber directly beneath the main Hauptofen chamber, tuned to provide the <b>cruise</b> <b>power</b> needed for high-speed level flight, about [...] This chamber provided that power at peak efficiency, so it did not suffer from the problems found while throttling on the original models. The throttle on the original combustion chamber was removed, and throttling was instead provided by turning the main engine on and off. This new version dramatically improved cruise endurance, with overall flight times improving from eight to twelve minutes, a 50% improvement. It was also mechanically simpler as the turbopumps were no longer throttled.|$|E
50|$|The flight {{characteristics}} of the design were intended to be quick but not oversensitive, for mild aerobatics and handling in rough air. The side stick controller also necessitated full control authority by wrist movement alone. With a fuel capacity of seven gallons and a typical <b>cruise</b> <b>power</b> setting, the Jeanie's Teenie has an endurance of nearly three hours. The Jeanie's Teenie {{had a reputation for}} being quick on the controls. The stabilator design gave the airplane a great deal of pitch sensitivity. The scale of the airplane requires careful attention to weight and balance. As the plane was intended for simple, cheap VFR flying, builders should resist the urge to install extraneous equipment or features that would increase the weight of the vehicle. It is a design that benefits greatly from frugality and minimalism. Deviation from the plans may significantly alter the {{flight characteristics}} of the airplane and present a safety hazard.|$|E
50|$|All {{aircraft}} with retractable {{landing gear}} are required to {{have a way to}} indicate the status of the landing gear, which is normally a set of lights that change colors from red to amber to green depending on whether the gear are up, in transit, or down. However, a distracted pilot may forget to look at these lights. This has led to aircraft designers building extra safety systems in the aircraft to reduce the possibility of human error. In small aircraft this most commonly {{takes the form of a}} warning light and horn which operate when any of the landing gear is not locked down and any of the engine throttles are retarded below a <b>cruise</b> <b>power</b> setting. However, the horn has been useless in situations when the pilot was unfamiliar with the aircraft and did not know what the horn sounding was meant to indicate. Pilots have sometimes confused the landing gear warning horn with the stall warning horn. In other cases, pilots cannot hear the horn on older aircraft due to wearing a modern noise-canceling headset.|$|E
