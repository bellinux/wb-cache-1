5|$|Orwell wrote six novels: Burmese Days, A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, <b>Coming</b> <b>Up</b> for Air, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical. Burmese Days was {{inspired}} by his period working as an imperial policeman and is fictionalized; A Clergyman's Daughter follows {{a young woman who}} passes out from overwork and wakes up an amnesiac, forced to wander the countryside as she finds herself, eventually losing her belief in God, despite being the daughter of a clergyman. Keep the Aspidistra Flying and <b>Coming</b> <b>Up</b> for Air are examinations of the British class system. Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.|$|E

And then we just sewed it together. It was rather like the way we'd been working on the dance remixes we'd been doing before. Kind of a cut-and-paste method.|$|E

The game received a mostly positive reception: reviewers enjoyed the action mini-game which is played when chocolates are manufactured, and the game's graphics, sound, and Victorian-era presentation.|$|E
