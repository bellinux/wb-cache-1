5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an {{overturned}} <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a few inches from his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|E
25|$|Rupert {{lifts the}} lid of the chest and finds the body inside. He is horrified but also deeply ashamed, realizing that Brandon and Phillip used his own rhetoric to {{rationalize}} murder. Rupert disavows all his previous talk of superiority and inferiority, realizing {{that there is no way}} to define these concepts objectively, then seizes Brandon's gun and fires several shots out the window to attract attention. As police sirens approach, Rupert pulls up a <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the chest and the film's end credits appear on the screen.|$|E
500|$|Caraeff {{stood on}} a <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> {{the edge of the}} stage while taking a series of four {{monochrome}} pictures of Hendrix burning his guitar. Caraeff was close enough to the fire that he had to use his camera as a shield to protect his face from the heat. Rolling Stone later colorized the image, matching it with other pictures taken at the festival before using the shot for a 1987 magazine cover. According to author Gail Buckland, the fourth and final frame of [...] "Hendrix kneeling in front of his burning guitar, hands raised, {{is one of the most}} famous images in rock." [...] Author and historian Matthew C. Whitaker wrote: [...] "Hendrix's burning of his guitar became an iconic image in rock history and brought him national attention." [...] The Los Angeles Times asserted that, upon leaving the stage, Hendrix [...] "graduated from rumor to legend". Author John McDermott commented: [...] "Hendrix left the Monterey audience stunned and in disbelief at what they'd just heard and seen." [...] According to Hendrix: [...] "I decided to destroy my guitar at the end of a song as a sacrifice. You sacrifice things you love. I love my guitar." [...] The performance was filmed by D.A. Pennebaker, and later included in the concert documentary Monterey Pop, which helped Hendrix gain popularity with the U.S. public.|$|E

2500|$|As a detective, Seedman {{was known}} for his unorthodox {{approaches}} that solved otherwise perplexing cases. [...] "I try to imagine who was in a room the second before the murder," [...] he recalled years later. In one case early in his career, a Bronx woman was found dead of a shotgun blast in the lobby of her apartment building. Seedman noticed an empty <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the building's stoop. Neighbors told him it was usually occupied by a man who sat there watching the traffic go by. Although he normally was out shopping at the time, Seedman insisted on entering the man's apartment through a window—where he found his body hanging from a pipe. The murder-suicide had occurred after the woman rejected him.|$|E
2500|$|Homer and Bart {{participate}} at an [...] "Ugliest Dog" [...] {{contest in}} Springfield" [...] contest, entering Santa's Little Helper. At the contest, Moe feels neglected because {{nobody wants to}} let him sit next to them (Agnes Skinner even sets the <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her on fire). Moe sits on the ground until he notices that the judge, Krusty the Clown, is not managing to entertain the crowd due to his lack of enthusiasm over his work. He taunts and insults Krusty for his inability to be funny, despite being a clown. Angry, Krusty leaves and offers his job to Moe, much {{to the delight of}} the crowd, who then urges him to replace Krusty, and to which Moe agrees as he now has a place to sit. During the competition, Moe makes sardonic, offensive but undoubtedly funny comments about all the ugly dogs, but chooses the Simpsons' dog (under the alias of Satan's Little Helper) was the winner because the Simpsons disguised their dog's buttocks as if it were his face, leaving Santa's Little Helper upset over his appearance until Lisa comforts him later. After that, Moe becomes the judge of most Springfield competitions (including a bully competition at the beach) and is offered a job as one of jurors of American Idol, since that several other programs with the opportunity of this kind of job were suddenly cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|Eberhard Grisebach {{visited him}} in March, writing to Helen Spengler of Kirchner's condition: [...] "I spent two mornings with Kirchner which I shall never forget. I found him sitting on a very low <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a small, hot stove in a yellow-painted, sloping-roofed attic. Only {{with the help of}} a stick was he able to walk, {{staggering}} around the room. ... A colourfully painted curtain concealed a large collection of paintings. When we began to look at them, he came alive. Together with me, he saw all his experiences drift by on canvas, the small, timid-looking woman set aside what we had seen and brought a bottle of wine. He made short explanatory remarks in a weary voice. Each picture had its own particular colourful character, a great sadness was present in all of them; what I had previously found to be incomprehensible and unfinished now created the same delicate and sensitive impression as his personality. Everywhere a search for style, for psychological understanding of his figures. The most moving was a self- portrait in uniform with his right hand cut off. Then he showed me his travel permit for Switzerland. He wanted to go back to Davos... and implored me to ask father for a medical certificate. ... As the woman with him rightly said, though many people want to help him, nobody is able to do so any longer. ... When I was leaving, I thought of Van Gogh’s fate and thought that it would be his as well, sooner or later. Only later will people understand and see how much he has contributed to painting".|$|E

They may be native evangelists or Christain converts. Two European female missionaries sit {{to the side of the}} group on <b>chairs</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a native evangelist, and two male missionaries sit to the backk of a group, behind a clothed table.

On the left, the baby is bathed by an attending woman, while another prepares blankets. Gottfried Chodowiecki (1728 Gdansk - 1781 Berlin) was a German painter and draftsman and the younger brother of Daniel Chodowiecki. The two brothers moved to Berlin in 1741 to be educated by their uncle. In 1754, Gottfried gave up working as a merchant to concentrate on his artistic career. He was a miniaturist and enameler, though he never gained such popularity as his brother, Daniel, who eventually employed him at his workshop as one of many assistant engravers. Their greatest joint achievement were illustrations to Johann Bernhard Basedow's "Elementartwerk," published in 1770. They were etched by Gottfried according to sketches prepared by Daniel.

60|$|When {{they arrived}} at the shop the barber seated them in two <b>chairs</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> each other, in a room behind the shop, and set to work at once. He first {{produced}} a wig and whiskers, which, with a little clipping, he made of {{the size and shape of}} the hair on the huckster’s face. Then he set to work with his paints, first staining Will’s face to the reddish-brown of the man’s complexion, and then adding line after line. After two hours’ work he asked them to stand together before a glass, and both were astonished; the resemblance was indeed perfect. Will’s eyebrows had been stained a grayish white, and some long hairs had been inserted so as to give them the shaggy appearance of the pedlar. A crow’s foot had been painted at the corner of each eye, and a line drawn from the nose to the corners of the lips. The chin and lower part of the cheeks had been tinted dark, to give them the appearance of long shaving. Both of them burst into a laugh as they looked at the two faces in the mirror.|$|R
