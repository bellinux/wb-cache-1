25|$|Finally, {{the heat}} for fusion {{ignition}} <b>comes</b> <b>not</b> {{from the primary}} but from a second fission bomb called the spark plug, embedded {{in the heart of}} the secondary. The implosion of the secondary implodes this spark plug, detonating it and igniting fusion in the material around it, but the spark plug then continues to fission in the neutron-rich environment until it is fully consumed, adding significantly to the yield.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the Kuznets curve theory {{argue that}} its U-shape <b>comes</b> <b>not</b> from {{progression}} {{in the development}} of individual countries, but rather from historical differences between countries. For instance, many of the middle income countries used in Kuznets' data set were in Latin America, a region with historically high levels of inequality. When controlling for this variable, the U-shape of the curve tends to disappear (e.g. Deininger and Squire, 1998). Regarding the empirical evidence, based on large panels of countries or time series approaches, Fields (2001) considers the Kuznets hypothesis refuted.|$|E

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the song a positive review, stating that [...] "for years, Madonna spoke in metaphors, fantasies and blatant shock tactics, but the performer indignantly struck {{back at her}} critics on 'Human Nature'. She didn't just hold up a mirror, she became the mirror". Barbara O'Dair from Rolling Stone also gave a positive review of the song, commenting that [...] "Madonna does a drive-by on her critics, complete with a keening synth line straight outta Dre", adding that [...] "Madonna's message is still 'Express yourself, don't repress yourself.' This time, however, it <b>comes</b> <b>not</b> with a bang but a whisper". Scott Kearnan of The Boston Globe included the track at number 11 on his list of [...] "30 Ultimate Madonna Singles", stating that the line [...] "Absolutely no regrets" [...] was a [...] "Madonna mantra {{if ever there was}} one".|$|E
500|$|The {{only known}} {{credit for the}} film is that it starred William Garwood. Film historian, Q. David Bowers notes that the plot dealing with circumstantial {{evidence}} focused on one of Lloyd Lonergan's social issues. Lonergan would produce several scenarios featuring the problems with circumstantial evidence being used to obtain convictions. Bowers notes that such convictions were a known social issue, but not a pressing one in 1911. The first such Thanhouser film to tackle the subject was Love and Law released in December 1910. Love and Law was a film which garnered some criticism for an improbable plot. Checkmate wove a more tangled web of circumstantial evidence and intrigue and the resolution <b>comes</b> <b>not</b> from an astute female detective, but by the heiress's novel substitution of a doppelgänger to the prison so that the original can get the needed confession. The serious nature of the film was highlighted with the advertising of the film by Thanhouser which states, [...] "Checkmate carries a message and a lesson to those who value the 'circumstantial evidence' process by which so many convictions are obtained in our criminal courts. The reel demonstrates how easily evidence of this sort may be made to entangle and ensnare a totally innocent man..." ...|$|E

Japanese manga critic Kaoru Nagayama has noted that the manga is [...] "fun to read" [...] and commended Arakawa for keeping Jesus and Buddha faithful to their real character—of kindness—even when confronted by evil. Carlo Santos from Anime News Network criticized it for its art and questioned its capacity to evolve into something other than [...] "Jesus and Buddha hanging out, while normal people do embarrassing things to them". Santos complained that Jesus' and Buddha's philosophical differences and personalities are not explored. However, Santos praised the series' comedy, noting its simplicity and saying, [...] "its brilliance <b>comes</b> <b>not</b> from purposely trivializing two of the world's great religions, but by highlighting the quirks of the secular world when these famous religious figures are placed in it". According to him, the series does not lose its capacity of making readers laugh as it progresses, unlike other manga. Jolyon Baraka Thomas of The Guardian praised the constancy of [...] "visual gags and puns", and wrote: [...] "Her story is not an introduction to abstruse religious doctrines, nor does it feature much overt commentary on the role of religions in contemporary society." ...|$|E
