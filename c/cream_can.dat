Withdrawal of corticosteroids (topical steroid <b>cream)</b> <b>can</b> aggravate psoriasis {{due to the}} rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|Clotted <b>cream</b> <b>can</b> {{be used as}} an {{accompaniment to}} hot or cold desserts. Clotted cream, {{especially}} clotted cream from Devon, where it is less yellow due to lower carotene levels in the grass, is regularly used in baking. It is used throughout southwest England in the production of ice cream and fudge.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} select any two-member {{permutation}} of its five playable characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Amy Rose, Knuckles the Echidna, and Cream the Rabbit, provided the two desired characters have been unlocked; only Sonic and Tails {{are available at}} the beginning, while the other three must be rescued from Eggman {{over the course of the}} game. Each character has a unique ability: Sonic can perform a spinning attack in mid-air, Tails can fly using his two tails as a propeller, Amy can smash enemies with her hammer, Knuckles can glide long distances and climb walls, and <b>Cream</b> <b>can</b> fly using her ears as wings and attack enemies with her Chao friend, Cheese. The second player character can also give powers to the first by pressing the R button; for example, pressing and holding R while Tails is the sidekick blasts both characters into the air. In addition, the second character will collect rings and destroy enemies the first has not. Outside the main game, there are two battle modes for two to four players, in which any of the characters can be selected: racing and Chao collecting.|$|E

25|$|These {{compositions}} are percentage by weight. Since ice <b>cream</b> <b>can</b> contain {{as much as}} half air by volume, {{these numbers}} may be reduced by {{as much as half}} if cited by volume. In terms of dietary considerations, the percentages by weight are more relevant.|$|E
25|$|White wine is also {{a dessert}} wine. All choices are allowed even if the sweet and {{fortified}} wines {{are more suitable for}} this. Perfumed wines (Gewurztraminer, Muscat), sparkling, and sweet wines accord well with fruit desserts (salad, tart). The fortified and sparkling wines support rich desserts made with cream or butter. Crèmes brûlées or caramel which combine sugar and <b>cream</b> <b>can</b> be eaten with a sweet and lively wine such as Jurançon or a late harvest wine. Chocolate requires a very powerful wine so white wine selection is quite limited: a natural amber sweet wine is the best compromise.|$|E
2500|$|Ice <b>cream</b> <b>can</b> be mass-produced {{and thus}} is widely {{available}} in developed parts of the world. Ice <b>cream</b> <b>can</b> be purchased in large cartons (vats and squrounds) from supermarkets and grocery stores, in smaller quantities from ice cream shops, convenience stores, and milk bars, and in individual servings from small carts or vans at public events. [...] In 2015, US produced nearly 900 million gallons of ice cream.|$|E
50|$|Nitrous oxide {{is used as}} a {{propellant}} in aerosol whip <b>cream</b> <b>cans.</b> Large {{densities of}} N2O are dissolved in cream at high pressure. When expelled from the can, the nitrous oxide escapes emulsion instantly, creating a temporary foam in the butterfat matrix of the cream.|$|R
25|$|Compounded BHRT is used almost {{exclusively}} in the United States, and many FDA-approved formulations that are wholly or partially made of bioidentical hormones are available. Topical hormone preparations such as progesterone, estrogen and DHEA <b>creams</b> <b>can</b> be purchased in stores or over the internet and are not regulated by the FDA, as they are generally considered cosmetic.|$|R

2500|$|Red wasp {{stingers}} do {{not remain}} in their victims. A red wasp sting is often painful and causes localized swelling and itchiness. In some cases, people report developing a full-body, itchy rash. Applying a cold compress or ice to the area can help relieve swelling, while application of calamine lotion or 1% hydrocortisone <b>cream</b> <b>can</b> help relieve itching and pain. [...] If neither of these creams is available, a paste made from baking soda and water is an effective sting remedy. The paste should be thick enough {{to stay on the}} area of the sting until it dries. Some individuals are known to have severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to wasp stings, so should seek immediate medical attention if severe symptoms begin to present. In very rare cases, children may develop shock after a red wasp sting.|$|E

It wiped it {{off the face of the}} earth in about twenty-five seconds! It first made a clean break from stem to stern, {{carrying}} everything along with it. The first thing I saw was old Judge Piper, puttin' on his best licks to get away from a big can of strawberry ice cream that was trundling after him and trying to empty itself on his collar, whenever a bigger wave lifted it. He was followed by what was left of the brass band; the big drum just humpin' itself to keep abreast o' the ice cream, mixed up with camp-stools, music-stands, a few Chinamen, and then what they call in them big San Francisco processions 'citizens generally.' The hull thing swept up the canyon inside o' thirty seconds. Then, what Captain Fairfax called 'the reflex action in the laws o' motion' happened, and darned if the hull blamed procession didn't sweep back again--this time all the heavy artillery, such as camp-kettles, lager beer kegs, bottles, glasses, and crockery that was left behind takin' the lead now, and Judge Piper and that ice <b>cream</b> <b>can</b> bringin' up the rear. As the jedge passed us the second time, we noticed that that ice cream can--hevin' swallowed water--was kinder losing its wind, and we encouraged the old man by shoutin' out, 'Five to one on him!' And then, you wouldn't believe what followed. Why, darn my skin, when that 'reflex' met the current at the other end, it just swirled around again in what Captain Fairfax called the 'centrifugal curve,' and just went round and round the canyon like ez when yer washin' the dirt out o' a prospectin' pan--every now and then washin' some one of the boys that was in it, like scum, up ag'in the banks.|$|E
50|$|In general, the Papua New Guinea {{economy is}} highly {{dependent}} on imports for manufactured goods. Its industrial sector—exclusive of mining—accounts for only 9% of GDP and contributes little to exports. Small-scale industries produce beer, soap, concrete products, clothing, paper products, matches, ice <b>cream,</b> <b>canned</b> meat, fruit juices, furniture, plywood, and paint. The small domestic market, relatively high wages, and high transport costs are constraints to industrial development.|$|R

Another PCD buttermilk stud stock piggery, with a carrying capacity of 700 pigs, was opened at Monto in February 1938.
