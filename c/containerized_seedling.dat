40|$|When a <b>containerized</b> <b>seedling</b> is {{pneumatically}} transported {{through a}} pipe or hose it occasionally undergoes oscillating movements, {{referred to as}} “wobbling“, with the container being flung {{from one side of}} the hose to the other. Data on this phenomenon obtained in a previous feed-time study were further analyzed. In addition, a laboratory study was carried out in which the behaviours of seedling-container dummies of different sizes and shapes were studied at different air velocities in Plexiglas pipes of various diameters. Both the analy-ses of the frequencies of wobbling from the previous feed-time study and the results from the laboratory test confirmed that there is covariation between the wobbling tendency of a seedling and the shape of its container. Containers with a large butt-end area tend to wobble more. This leads to differentiation of the seedlings into two groups, seedlings with butt-ended and less butt-ended containers. This differen-tiation was the same whether it was based on feed times from the previous study, frequencies of wob-bling from the previous study, or the wobbling behaviour in the recent laboratory test with dum-mies...|$|E
40|$|Since 1950, the {{creation}} of open woodlands has increased in Canada's northeastern continuous boreal forest and recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} the mechanisms underlying their creation are similar to those found in the lichen woodland zone. Since no natural re-densification of open woodlands has been observed to date, afforestation is necessary to counteract an increase of these types of stands in the continuous boreal forest.

The experimental design included different <b>containerized</b> <b>seedling</b> stocks and site preparation approaches, such as patch and disk scarification, and covered most of the geographical range of accessible continuous boreal forest in Québec. In open woodlands, regardless of black spruce stock size, disk scarification increased planted seedling survival and growth compared with patch scarification and direct planting, possibly due to a beneficial effect on seedling nutrition. However, even if seedling growth in open woodlands and feathermoss stands submitted to disk scarification was comparable, growth was higher in the latter stands. Nonetheless, we conclude that disk scarification followed by planting is an appropriate method to afforest boreal open woodlands...|$|E

Criteria-based evaluations centered on aesthetics, function, and fall color were performed to objectively select superior bigtooth maple specimens. Out of 56 trees initially selected for red fall color, six were selected for propagation based on all three criteria. Five of the six selected trees yielded viable bud take via chip budding. Optimum time for chip budding propagation was determined by four experiments. Coppiced seedling rootstocks were used with the 2 ̆ 2 return budding 2 ̆ 2 of excised buds as scions to parent stock (2006) and grafting buds from wild trees as scions (2007 and 2009). A fourth experiment examined chip budding of wild scions on 2 -year-old, <b>containerized,</b> <b>seedling</b> rootstocks. The general time period identified as the optimum time for budding bigtooth maple was July through mid-August. Propagation by cuttings was also explored as an alternative production method among bigtooth maple selections. Softwood cuttings were taken from six selections of wild bigtooth maples grafted on seedling rootstocks growing in a coppiced stool bed environment. Open-ended, black, velour, drawstring bags were placed over the end of pruned shoots at bud swell to initiate etiolation of the cuttings. The bags were left in place during shoot elongation to insure etiolation of the shoot base.

40|$|Seeds are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used regeneration material for reforestation purpose; hence interest in “precision sowing” among nurseries is high due to the high cost of <b>containerized</b> <b>seedling</b> production. In addition, the increased interest in growing hybrid larch in commercial forestry has raised concerns about the purity of hybrid larch seed lots, as there are large proportions of pure parental seeds mixed with hybrid larch seed lots. The aims of the studies presented in this thesis were to evaluate the application of visible (Vis) and/or near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with multivariate modelling for sorting filled-viable, empty and petrified seeds of Larix sibirica Ledeb., verification of hybrid larch, Larix × eurolepis Henry seeds, identification of seeds of Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh., and authentication of the origin of Picea abies (L.) Karst seed lots. For these purposes, reflectance spectra were recorded on single seeds using XDS Rapid Content Analyzer (FOSS NIRSystems, Inc.) from 400 – 2500 nm with a resolution of 0. 5 nm, and multivariate classification models were developed. The results showed that filled-viable, empty and petrified seeds of L. sibirica can be sorted with 98 %, 82 % and 87 % accuracies, respectively. When the seed lot was sorted into viable and non-viable (empty and petrified combined) classes, the predicted class membership reached 100 % for both classes. The technique could separate the hybrid larch seeds from pure parental seeds with 100 % accuracy. Seeds of B. pubescens and B. pendula were differentiated with 100 % and 99 % classification accuracy, respectively. Also, the overall classification accuracy among three B. pendula families was 93 % and that of B. pubescens was 98 %. NIR spectroscopy discriminated Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Polish and Lithuanian seed lots of P. abies with 92 % - 100 % accuracy. Absorption bands that were accounted for distinguishing the various seed lots examined in this thesis were attributed to differences in seed color, moisture content and chemical composition of the seeds, presumably polysaccharides, proteins and fatty acids, which are the common seed storage reserves. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of Vis + NIR spectroscopy as a robust technique for sorting seed lots according to their viability and for certification of seed lots by species and origin. Thus, concerted efforts should be made to scale-up the technique to on-line sorting system for large-scale tree seed handling operations...|$|E
40|$|To grow {{deciduous}} {{trees and}} shrubs as containerized seedlings is as yet a relatively untried growing method in Sweden and Europe. This paper is {{a report on the}} basic conditions of growing containerized seedlings in container system. A <b>containerized</b> <b>seedling</b> is defined as a plant which has some kind of growing media surrounding the roots when it is planted out. The volume of the containers is usually between 50 - 700 cm 3 and the plants are grown for one or two growing seasons. Porous peat, or a peat mixture are most frequently used as a growing media. One advantage of having containerized seedlings is that their root systems are kept relatively intact, and that root growth can thus continue undisturbed after planting. The method also has certain technical advantages. On the Swedish market today we find about 10 different container systems. The choice of system must be decided by several factors: the type of plant, the plant nursery, the working environment, the customers demands etc. Growing in container systems makes it possible to use green-houses. During germination and the first growth it is necessary {{to have some kind of}} climate regulation in order to obtain a successful growing result. To obtain a good result one has to master the handling of the seeds. Most seeds of deciduous {{trees and shrubs}} have some kind of seed dormancy. The causes of dormancy and how to interrupt it is treated here because seed from different species have to be treated in different ways. The sowing method is decided after the germination percentage has been estimated: either sowing directly in containers or replanting seedlings into the containers. For an optimum utilization of the greenhouse area and other resources, it is imperative that empty containers be avoided. There is not much literature to be found about climate regulation and the influence of environmental factors since trees and shrubs are usually grown outdoors. It is difficult to make recommendations when there are differences between species and when the environment must be changed during the growing season. Rearing seedlings can be divided into three parts; germination, growth and cold hardening. During germination it is most important that moisture and a temperature around the seed are regulated in order to obtain a good growing result. Even during growth the greatest benefits are derived from correct regulation of the water supply and of the temperature. The tolerance for nutrients is quite high as long as the dosage is kept within reasonable limits. In the late summer when the plants are outdoors is cold hardening starts naturally when the days shorten and the temperature sinks. Nitrogen fertilization should be cut down gradually during July and August to stop growth. While each species should be studied individually, there is at the end of this paper a short growing recommendation for 10 species, based on literature studies and own research...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{follows the}} {{bachelor}} thesis on comparison of morphological and economic parameters {{of various types}} of seedlings, {{which resulted in the}} planting of containerized and bare root seedlings of the European beech (Fagus sylvativa Linne) and the English oak (Quercus robur Linnaeus) in a forest regeneration in September 2011 and April 2012. The measurement of the height and thickness of the root neck of the seedlings was carried out on designated plots in March 2015. I also investigated possible mortality from the afforestation inspection in July 2012. Furthermore, 154 <b>seedlings,</b> 84 <b>containerized</b> <b>seedlings</b> a 70 bare root seedlings, in order to evalutate the development of the root system, its possible deformation and subsequently detection of the volume by using xylometric method. The data collected in the field were processed into tables and compared with the results observed in the bachelor thesis. The average figures for the height, the thickness of the root neck and the volume of the root system showed almost identical development of bare root and <b>containerized</b> <b>seedlings</b> in the forest cover, even though the figures of individual seedlings were highly variable. When reviewing the development of the root system, I found unacceptable deformation of the main taproot at 25 % <b>containerized</b> <b>seedlings</b> and 20 % bare root seedlings. The remaining seedlings were without deformation or with acceptable deformation of the taproot (wavy taproot, unbalanced taproot with the axis in the above-ground part, an outgrowth). It was discovered that <b>containerized</b> <b>seedlings</b> were more easily removable from the ground, the seedlings were not sufficiently fixed in the ground and its root system was in some cases less developed than it was with bare root seedlings. This may be influenced by several factors, e. g. the influence of richness of the root system on fine roots, the obstruction of development of the root system by cementing the surrounding soil when using the slit method. The bare root seedlings, the English oak in particular, showed root development to a greater depth, which is very important not only for sealing but also as an important factor in the drought season and extreme summer temperatures when there is rapid exhaustion of the moisture in the upper horizon of the soil due to the vapor. Unfortunately, {{it was not possible to}} verify these findings in a larger sample size, as there had been major damage of the forest...|$|R

The relationship between seedling performance and the number of first-order lateral roots on the seedlings was also tested. Seedling performance was evaluated under 3 overstory densities (each 0. 3 ha) &mdash; a clearcut, 25 %, and 50 % crown covers in combination with (and without) understory vegetation control with herbicide. Height growth was greater for <b>containerized</b> <b>seedlings</b> than bareroot stock after 2 and 3 growing seasons.

The styroblock containerization system used in conjunction with sandy loam soil/vermiculite (2 : 1 v/v) potting-mix produced excellent quality snortleaf pine seedlings with strong primary and secondary lateral root development. Ultrastructural examination of inoculated roots revealed that a Basidiomycete and another fungus were mycotrophic, full Hartig-net and mantle development were common, and apparent host and mycobiont physiological activity was positively influenced by intimate symbiotic relationship. Evolution of mycorrhizae progressed from an obvious infection process at the host epidermis and outer cortical cells, to a balanced symbiosis in the Hartig-net region of the deep cortex.

Silvopasture offers Midwest landowners the opportunity to plant trees in their pastures without significant loss of forage production. However, much of the pasture in the Midwest is dominated by tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub.). Researchers are unsure why, but tall fescue is known to inhibit tree growth. It may be competition for moisture and nutrients, or possibly allelopathy. To improve the adoption of silvopasture, this research was conducted to delineate factors that may affect tall fescue's competitiveness and to create recommendations that minimize the effects of these factors on tree growth. Black walnut, red oak, and black locust growth was reduced up to 90 % when grown with grass competition compared to that in vegetation-free controls, while pitch x loblolly pine growth was similar in grasses and in vegetation-free plots. Neither dry matter yield of grasses nor tall fescue's endophyte association affected tree growth. Results suggest that weed control should extend a minimum of 1. 21 m from black walnut seedlings in tall fescue pastures to maximize height and diameter growth. bare-root and <b>containerized</b> <b>seedlings</b> transplanted well and were larger than seeded seedlings after two years in the field.

For the PCR-based identification study, post-fire Pezizales were examined for mycorrhizal formation with ponderosa pine in vivo on the Malheur National Forest. Fruiting bodies of post-fire Pezizales were collected from a prescribed burn site. Root tips were extracted from soil cores taken underneath fruiting bodies of post-fire Pezizales. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were compared between fruiting bodies and fungal symbionts on root tips. No matches were found; therefore, identities of these fungal symbionts were determined by DNA sequence analyses using the 18 s, ITS 1, and 5. 8 s regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. The Pezizalean mycobionts were Geopora cooperi, Geopora sp., and Wilcoxina rehmii. Outcomes from both studies were inconclusive as to the mycorrhizal status of the post-fire Pezizales examined. Fungi that are probably not mycorrhizal include Helvella compressa, Scutellinia sp., Tricharina sp., the undescribed taxon, and species of Anthracobia, Morchella, and Peziza, found from burned areas. This study used PCR-based methods to determine the ascomycetous community in vivo. A database to help determine the ascomycete mycobionts was created...|$|R
40|$|A plant {{phenotyping}} {{approach was}} applied to evaluate growth rate of <b>containerized</b> tree <b>seedlings</b> during the precultivation phase following seed germination. A simple and affordable stereo optical system was used to collect stereoscopic red-green-blue (RGB) images of seedlings at regular intervals of time. Comparative analysis of these images {{by means of a}} newly developed software enabled us to calculate (a) the increments of seedlings height and (b) the percentage greenness of seedling leaves. Comparison of these parameters with destructive biomass measurements showed that the height traits can be used to estimate seedling growth for needle-leaved plant species whereas the greenness trait can be used for broad-leaved plant species. Despite the need to adjust for plant type, growth stage and light conditions this new, cheap, rapid, and sustainable phenotyping approach can be used to study large-scale phenome variations due to genome variability and interaction with environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|Investigations of <b>containerized</b> conifer <b>seedling</b> root {{diseases}} at the Champion Timberlands Nursery {{revealed that}} Fusarium oxysporum was most commonly isolated from seed, seedling roots, and styroblock containers. Amount of seed infection varied widely among the seedlots tested, but was usually below 5 percent. Runningwater rinses did not reduce amounts of Fusarium detected on seed. Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine seedlings with disease symptoms had roots that {{were much more}} colonized with Fusarium than seedlings without symptoms. Fusarium inoculum existed within soil mixes and on root fragments within seedling plugs. The inner walls of styroblocks were also extensively colonized with Fusarium, especially {{at the bottom of}} the plug. Hot water cleaning and treatment with bleach reduced, but did not eliminate, Fusarium within styroblocks. Sufficient inoculum remained to pose potential threats to subsequent crops of seedlings. Resistance to benomyl was not detected with in vitro tests, although most F. oxysporum isolates displayed some level of resistance to captan, Botran, and Banrot...|$|R
40|$|Isolates of Botrytis cinerea from <b>containerized</b> conifer <b>seedlings</b> {{from two}} {{nurseries}} in the Northern Rocky Mountains {{were exposed to}} the dicarboximide fungicides vinclozolin and iprodione and the chlorinated nitroaniline fungicide dicloran to evaluate occurrence and characteristics of resistant strains. The isolates were grown on test media prepared by incorporating the fungicides at various concentrations into potato dextrose agar. In this way, we were able to select B. cinerea strains resistant to increasing fungicide concentrations up to a maximum of 10, 000 ug/ml. Resistance to the three fungicides occurred in isolates not previously exposed to the chemicals. Some strains were even resistant to high fungicide concentrations. Genetic stability of these resistant strains was confirmed by growing them in the absence of fungicides. Cross-resistance among the three fungicides was common. Vinclozolin and iprodione generally inhibited spore germination more than mycelial growth; the opposite was true for dicloran. Ramifications of fungicide resistance in disease control are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 45 nondiseased <b>containerized</b> ponderosa pine <b>seedlings</b> from 10 seedlots were sampled at three {{different}} {{times during the}} growing season for root infection by Fusarium and Trichoderma at the USDA Forest Service Nursery in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. More than 90 percent of the seedlings had roots infected with Fusarium. Inverse relationships existed between amount of root infection by Fusarium and Trichoderma. Leach pine cells in which seedlings were growing and soil adjacent to roots and on the inner wall surface of containers were also heavily colonized by Fusarium. Fusarium oxysporum was the most commonly encountered species of Fusarium. Despite extensive root colonization by Fusarium, seedling roots lacked lesions and no effects on seedling growth were detected...|$|R
40|$|Causes of {{mortality}} of <b>containerized</b> western larch <b>seedlings</b> at the Champion Timberlands Nursery, Plains, Montana, were investigated. Seedlings were rated for disease severity based on extent of foliar decline symptoms and fungal isolations made from their roots. Isolations were also made from selected larch seed. Consistent associations between root colonization by potentially pathogenic fungi {{and level of}} disease symptoms were not found. Fusarium spp. were only isolated from a few seeds and seedlings sampled {{toward the end of}} the growth cycle. These fungi were also frequently isolated from asymptomatic seedlings. It was concluded that heat injury which occurred during the spring when tissues were sensitive was the most likely cause of seedling mortality...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Two {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to identify fungi which are mycorrhizal with western hemlock and to examine the ecology of hemlock mycorrhizal fungi indigenous to outplanting sites. Another objective was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of mycorrhizal inoculation in improving the performance of outplanted hemlock seedlings. A list of over 100 mycorrhizal fungi associated with hemlock in the field was compiled. Many of these were tested in pure culture synthesis showing that 18 of them were indeed capable of mycorrhiza formation with hemlock. Due to the frequency with which mycorrhizal hemlock seedlings are found on rotten wood, an additional 18 wood inhabiting fungi were tested with hemlock in pure culture synthesis. Five of these proved to be capable of mycorrhiza formation. Field observations indicate that four more are mycorrhizal with hemlock growing in rotten wood. Nonmycorrhizal western hemlock seedlings planted on two clearcuts in western Oregon were readily colonized by indigenous mycorrhizal fungi. Examination of excavated seedlings every two weeks showed a gradual increase in the proportion of short roots colonized by mycorrhizal fungi through the season. The first mycorrhizae appeared two months after planting. Another experiment showed that nonmycorrhizal <b>containerized</b> hemlock <b>seedlings</b> survived and grew well on both rotten wood and mineral soil. Mycorrhizal colonization took place at the same rate and in the same total numbers in rotten wood and mineral soil. Finally, two outplanting studies were done to compare the performance of mycorrhizal and uninoculated hemlock seedlings. The first of these compared the survival and top growth of two year old <b>containerized</b> western hemlock <b>seedlings</b> outplanted on three plots in each of two areas. Mycorrhizal inoculation significantly improved seedling top growth for two years after planting in both of the areas. Survival was not improved in either area by mycorrhizal inoculation. The second study compared survival, root growth and top growth for outplanted mycorrhizal and uninoculated seedlings on both mineral soil and rotten wood. No growth or survival differences between mycorrhizal and uninoculated seedlings were seen on either substrate the first season after planting. Two additional experiments testing rotten wood as mycorrhizal inoculum were done to support the above observations. They demonstrated that rotten wood can indeed serve as a habitat for mycorrhizal fungi...|$|R
40|$|Paclobutrazol (PBZ) is a {{retardant}} {{often used}} in potted ornamental plants to control their growth and compactness. The distribution in plant, substrate and leachate of PBZ applied to <b>containerized</b> oleander <b>seedlings</b> were studied after a single liquid drench application to the substrate surface (20 mg a. i. per plant) in a nursery dedicated to pot production in SE Spain. PBZ significantly reduced all growth parameters, providing more compact plants of good commercial value and confirm-ing its ability to reduce the vertical growth of native oleander in the nursery. The level of PBZ residues in leaves was high-er {{at the end of}} pot cultivation (156 days post PBZ application) than at the first sampling time (30 days after PBZ applica-tion), whereas the level in stems decreased for the same period of time. PBZ residues in roots remained constant during the experimental period. The high level of PBZ residues detected in the substrate 30 days after application had decreased significantly (by 67 %) {{by the end of the}} experiment. A greater leaching fraction was detected for PBZ-treated seedlings and so a greater amount of PBZ was leached into the nursery soil with the irrigation water at the end of the experiment. This greater amount of PBZ leached into the soil represents an important way of contamination in the nursery and a sub-stantial risk to the environment...|$|R
