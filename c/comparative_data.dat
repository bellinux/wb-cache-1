25|$|The {{comparative}} {{efficacy of}} duloxetine and established pain-relief medications for DPN is unclear. A systematic review noted that tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine and amitriptyline), traditional anticonvulsants and opioids have better efficacy than duloxetine. Duloxetine, tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants have similar tolerability while the opioids caused more side effects. Another review in Prescrire International considered the moderate pain relief achieved with duloxetine to be clinically insignificant {{and the results}} of the clinical trials unconvincing. The reviewer saw no reason to prescribe duloxetine in practice. The <b>comparative</b> <b>data</b> collected by reviewers in BMC Neurology indicated that amitriptyline, other tricyclic antidepressants and venlafaxine may be more effective. However, the authors noted that the evidence in favor of duloxetine is much more solid. A Cochrane review concluded that the evidence in support of duloxetine's efficacy in treating painful diabetic neuropathy was adequate, and that further trials should focus on comparisons with other medications.|$|E

40|$|Understanding gene {{regulation}} {{is a key}} step to investigating gene functions and their relationships. Many algorithms {{have been developed to}} discover transcription factor binding sites (TFBS); they are predominantly located in upstream regions of genes and contribute to transcription regulation if they are bound by a specific transcription factor. However, traditional methods focusing on finding motifs have shortcomings, which can be overcome by using <b>comparative</b> genomics <b>data</b> that is now increasingly available. Traditional methods to score motifs also have their limitations.

2500|$|As {{the study}} of the cochlea should {{fundamentally}} be focused at the level of hair cells, {{it is important to note}} the anatomical and physiological differences between the hair cells of various species.

[...] There are several similarities of note in regard to this <b>comparative</b> <b>data.</b> [...] For one, the tall hair cell is very similar in function to that of the inner hair cell, and the short hair cell, lacking afferent auditory-nerve fiber innervation, resembles the outer hair cell.

2500|$|The lateral {{stability}} {{problems of the}} Badger worried its designer Frank Barnwell because a 1/10 scale model had been carefully tested in the NPL wind tunnel without any alarm. Scaling from model to full size was a problem because the Reynolds numbers reached in the atmospheric pressure wind tunnels of the time were much lower than those encountered in full-size flight. Flight tunnel tests also often involved the use of simplified aircraft models, with no attempt made to model the fuselage shape in detail. Using a spare set of Badger wings and empennage, Barnwell designed a new, single-seat flat-sided and very simple fuselage made from plywood on a wooden frame for a fifth and final Badger, the Badger X. It first flew on 13 May 1919 and was Bristol's first civil registered aircraft, initially as K110, then G-EABU, but {{was never able to}} provide the intended <b>comparative</b> <b>data</b> with tunnel models, crashing on 22 May.|$|E
2500|$|Also, in this period, Wat Phra Dhammakaya {{started to}} invest more {{resources}} in its own education and scholarship. In 2009, Wat Phra Dhammakaya had {{the highest number of}} Pali (language of the Theravada Buddhist canon) graduates in the central area of Thailand. The temple continuously placed itself as one of the five highest in the country in Pali studies. In 2010, Wat Phra Dhammakaya started the Dhammachai Tipitaka Project, providing facilities for scholars worldwide to work together collecting ancient manuscripts, mostly from Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand, to make a critical edition of the Pali Canon, the Theravada Buddhist scriptures. This edition was to provide the technology and <b>comparative</b> <b>data</b> for scholars to come to a reconstruction of the Tipitaka texts as they were known in the fifth century CE, when they were first written down. There were over a hundred staff members working on the project worldwide, divided in manuscript reading teams. The work was reviewed by an international advisory board of scholars, including Rupert Gethin, Richard Gombrich and Oskar von Hinüber. A digital version of the Tipitaka was expected to be completed by 2028, but the first part was published in 2015. The project backfired, however, when Matichon and other Thai newspapers interpreted the project as an actual [...] or 'purification of the Tipitaka' (...) , as this was done in the historical Buddhist Councils. Wat Phra Dhammakaya denied this in a press statement, however. They said it was not their intention to rewrite the Pali Canon, and considered it unlikely that in the present day anyone could do so. Wat Phra Dhammakaya set up another research institute, located in Australia, called DIRI (Dhammachai International Research Institute). This institute promoted research on manuscripts of early Buddhism, and offered fellowships to that end.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) {{are often}} {{located in the}} {{upstream}} regions of genes and transcription factors (TFs) cause transcription regulation by binding at these locations. Predicting these binding sites is a difficult problem, and traditional methods have {{a high degree of}} false positives in their predictions. <b>Comparative</b> genomics <b>data</b> can help to improve motif predictions. In this paper, a new strategy is presented, which refines motif by taking the <b>comparative</b> genomics <b>data</b> into account. Tested with the help of both simulation data and biological data, we show that our method makes improved predictions. We also propose a new metric to score a motif profile. This score is biologically motivated and helps the algorithm in its predictions. ...|$|R
