5|$|Shakespeare almost {{certainly}} wrote {{the role of}} Hamlet for Richard Burbage. He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range. Judging {{by the number of}} reprints, Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare's fourth most popular play during his lifetime—only Henry IV Part 1, Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it. Shakespeare provides no <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not have affected the staging.|$|E
5|$|In the east, however, Manuel's {{achievements}} {{are more}} ambiguous. He suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Myriokephalon in 1176 against the Turks. Manuel was marching against Konya, the Turkish capital, when his forces were ambushed; the ensuing defeat has since entered {{the popular imagination}} as a legendary disaster. Exaggerated accounts of the battle often describe {{the destruction of the}} entire Byzantine army, and with it the end of Byzantine power and influence. However, the modern consensus among Byzantine historians is that, while the Battle of Myriokephalon was a serious humiliation for the emperor, it was certainly not a catastrophe. Nor was it in any way equivalent to the Battle of Manzikert over a century earlier. In fact, much of the emperor's army emerged from the battle without serious damage. Units involved in the battle are well documented as campaigning in Asia Minor the following year. The imperial frontier remained unmoved for the remainder of Manuel's reign, a <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> that the Turks were unable to gain any advantage from their victory. In 1177, the Byzantines inflicted a major defeat on a large Turkish force at Hyelion and Leimocheir in the Meander valley.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May, the pretender Mustafa {{appeared}} before the Great Council, and was given a gift of 150 ducats for his services. On 4 June a new duke and captain were elected for Thessalonica, Paolo Contarini and Andrea Donato, after the first three pairs chosen all declined the post, despite the fine attached to refusal; a <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> of the unwillingness of the Venetian nobles to undertake the unprofitable and perilous task. On 1 July, Mocenigo attacked the Ottoman ships at Gallipoli, but although he led his flagship {{to break through the}} palisade protecting the Ottoman anchorage, the other Venetian vessels did not follow, forcing Mocenigo to withdraw with heavy casualties. Even now, however, Venice would not commit its full force to the conflict: when Suriano, as a proponent of the hawkish faction, proposed to arm a fleet of 14 ships and engage in a more decisive policy against the Ottomans in January 1430, the proposal was voted down, even though it was rather modest and clearly inadequate to force the Sultan to come to terms. Instead, the Great Council instructed the new captain-general, Silvestro Morosini, to seek the mediation of the Byzantine Emperor for a settlement on the lines of the previous agreements.|$|E

5|$|The party spent a {{total of}} 11days {{traversing}} the North China Plain via the Grand Canal before reaching Tongzhou District, {{where there was a}} large warehouse depot adjunct to the capital city. From there they left their courier ships and traveled by donkey and foot towards the capital Beijing, where they lodged at the Central Courier Hostel. The Ming court granted the Korean party gifts of fine clothes during their stay. On June 3, the officer in charge of Choe's escort notified the transport office in Beijing that three carriages plus horses and donkeys would be needed in the journey to the Korean border; when these were granted in the morning, the party swiftly departed from Beijing. Choe was not sad to leave the sights of Beijing behind, as he found the people there to be obsessed with business and cared little for agriculture or farming, a <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> of his Confucian-oriented values.|$|E

Since the 16th century, Samis have always paid taxes in monetary currency, and some historians have proposed that large scale husbandry is not older than from this period.|$|E

The colonial troop’s original badges of their home colony were replaced with Rising Sun Badges, the symbol of the newly formed Australian Army. It was also not practical or economical for the men to adopt a single uniform, or standardise equipment, and so each colonial unit continued to utilise their original uniforms and equipment.|$|E
25|$|The 1765 cricket {{season was}} the 168th in England since the {{earliest}} known definite reference to cricket in January 1597 (i.e., Old Style – 1598 New Style).

25|$|As thymomas {{are seen}} in 10% of all people with the MG, people are often given a chest X-ray and CT scan to {{evaluate}} their need for surgical removal of their thymus and any cancerous tissue that may be present.

Surgery in the case of MG involves the removal of the thymus, although in 2013 there was no <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> of beneficial except {{in the presence of a}} thymoma.

25|$|Thus, {{by the end}} of 1940, SIS had {{constructed}} an exact analog of the PURPLE machine without ever having seen one. With the duplicate machines and an understanding of PURPLE, SIS could decrypt increasing amounts of Japanese traffic. One such intercept was the message to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., ordering an end (on December 7, 1941) to negotiations with the US. The message gave a <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> of impending war, and was to have been delivered to the US State Department only hours prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The controversy over whether the US had foreknowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack has roiled well into the 21st century.|$|E

30|$|Does {{this finding}} have {{clinical}} relevance? Arguably, if indicated, platelet transfusions cannot be omitted. However, <b>clear</b> <b>indications</b> for platelet transfusion in ICU patients are lacking. Prophylactic platelet transfusion prevents bleeding in haematology patients [23], {{but it is}} not known at which count platelets should be transfused in ICU patients to prevent bleeding. Protocols at both centres pragmatically suggest a count of 10, 000 as a trigger for transfusion in ICU patients and a trigger of 50, 000 when the patient needs treatment with anticoagulant medication. These suggestions are, however, not substantiated with data. The lack of data on <b>clear</b> <b>indications,</b> together with the suggestion of possible harm in this study, calls for studies on the risk–benefit of platelet transfusion in the critically ill.|$|R
