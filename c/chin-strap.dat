25|$|The colors {{returned}} to blue and yellow-gold in 1973. The new uniform design consisted of yellow-gold pants and curling rams horns on the sleeves – yellow gold horns curving from the shoulders to the {{arms on the}} blue jerseys, which featured golden numerals (a white border around the numerals, similar to the 1957 style, appeared for two exhibitions and was then removed). Players' names were in contrasting white. The white jersey had similarly shaped blue horns, blue numerals, and names. The white jerseys also had yellow gold sleeves. The gold pants included a blue-white-blue tri-stripe, which was gradually widened through the 1970s and early 1980s. The blue socks initially featured two thin golden stripes, but these were rarely visible. From 1973 to 1976 the Rams were the only team to wear white cleats {{on the road and}} royal blue cleats at home. The new golden helmet horns were of identical shape, {{but for the first time}} the horn was not factory-painted but instead a decal applied to the helmet. The decal was cut in sections and affixed to accommodate spaces for face-mask and <b>chin-strap</b> attachments, and so the horn curved farther around the ear hole. Jersey numerals were made thicker and blunter in 1975. The Rams primarily wore blue at home with this combination, but after 1977 would wear white on occasion at home. The team wore its white jerseys for most of its 1978 home dates, including its post-season games with the Minnesota Vikings and the Dallas Cowboys – though the latter is the only postseason game the Cowboys have ever won while outfitted in their blue jerseys. Standard gray face masks became dark blue in 1981. The Rams wore white jerseys exclusively in the 1982 and 1993 seasons, as well as other selected occasions throughout their 15 seasons in Anaheim.|$|E
2500|$|The helmet is {{considered}} to be a Celtic version of a Roman auxiliary helmet, combining a Roman shape with La Tène style decoration. It is in the shape of a conical cap with a peaked neck guard. It is made from a single sheet of bronze, possibly spun finished, and has repoussé decoration in the La Tène style, similar to that found on the Waterloo Helmet, on the neck guard and on the fragmentary side pieces. On the neck guard are two flat domed bosses with criss-cross grooves which would originally have held red glass enamel studs. There are holes on either side for attachment to a <b>chin-strap</b> or cheekpiece, and a hole at the top of the helmet for the attachment of a plumed top-knot. On the outer margin of the helmet are incised two strokes which could represent the Roman number [...] "II".|$|E

When I had them formed up in fours, all in silver grey and upon chestnut horses, with their leopard skin shabracks and their little red panaches, my heart beat high at the sight. I could not look at their weather-stained faces, with the great moustaches which bristled over their <b>chin-straps,</b> without feeling a glow of confidence, and, between ourselves, I have no doubt that that was exactly how they felt when they saw their young Colonel on his great black war-horse riding at their head.|$|R

[...] According to his aide, Fernando Urissa, Santa Anna responded [...] "What are the lives of soldiers than so many chickens? I tell you, the Alamo must fall, and my orders must be obeyed at all hazards. If our soldiers are driven back, the next line in their rear must force those before them forward, and compel them to scale the walls, cost what it may." [...] The decision made, General Juan Valentín Amador drew up detailed battle orders. [...] The orders instructed all men to wear shoes or sandals and to properly tie their shako <b>chin-straps.</b> [...] Despite the cold, soldiers were prohibited from wearing cloaks or blankets, as these might limit their movements on the battlefield. [...] Each soldier would receive either 4 or 6 rounds of ammunition and would be given 2 flints.|$|R

6000|$|On the Monday {{following}} the burial, the Colonel sought revenge on the White Hussars.

6000|$|Cleever said [...] "when," [...] {{and more}} thereto, {{for he was}} a golden talker, and {{he sat in the}} midst of hero-worship devoid of all taint of self-interest. The boys asked him of the birth of his book, and whether it was hard to write, and how his notions came to him; and he {{answered}} with the same absolute simplicity as he was questioned. His big eyes twinkled, he dug his long thin hands into his gray beard and tugged it as he grew animated. He dropped little by little from the peculiar pinching of the broader vowels - the indefinable [...] "euh," [...] that runs through the speech of the pundit caste - and the elaborate choice of words, to freely- mouthed [...] "ows" [...] and [...] "ois," [...] and, for him at least, unfettered colloquialisms. He could not altogether understand the boys, who hung upon his words so reverently. The line of the <b>chin-strap,</b> that still showed white and untanned on cheekbone and jaw, the steadfast young eyes puckered at the corners of the lids with much staring through red- hot sunshine, the slow, untroubled breathing, and the curious, crisp, curt speech seemed to puzzle him equally. He could create men and women, and send them to the uttermost ends of the earth, to help, delight, and comfort; he knew every mood of the fields, and could interpret them to the cities, and he knew the hearts of many in city and country, but he had hardly, in forty years, come into contact with the thing which is called a Subaltern of the Line. He told the boys this in his own way.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the lambs}} were sacrificed, and the oaths were taken, and Paris {{put on his}} brother's armour: helmet, breastplate, shield, and leg-armour. Lots were drawn to decide whether Paris or Menelaus should throw his spear first, and, as Paris won, he threw his spear, but the point was blunted against the shield of Menelaus. But when Menelaus threw his spear it went clean through the shield of Paris, and through {{the side of his}} breastplate, but only grazed his robe. Menelaus drew his sword, and rushed in, and smote at the crest of the helmet of Paris, but his bronze blade broke into four pieces. Menelaus caught Paris by the {{horsehair}} crest of his helmet, and dragged him towards the Greeks, but the <b>chin-strap</b> broke, and Menelaus turning round threw the helmet into the ranks of the Greeks. But when Menelaus looked again for Paris, with a spear in his hand, he could see him nowhere! The Greeks believed that the beautiful goddess Aphrodite, whom the Romans called Venus, hid him in a thick cloud of darkness and carried him to his own house, where Helen of the fair hands found him and said to him, 'Would that thou hadst perished, conquered by that great warrior who was my lord! Go forth again and challenge him to fight thee face to face.' But Paris had no more desire to fight, and the Goddess threatened Helen, and compelled her to remain with him in Troy, coward as he had proved himself. Yet on other days Paris fought well; it seems that he was afraid of Menelaus because, in his heart, he was ashamed of himself.|$|E

Depending on the helmet style, a broad plastic band, narrow black metal band, narrow chrome metal band, or broad chrome metal band is wrapped around the helmet and pinned down, concealing the staples. For additional protection, a sponge liner is tucked into the helmet.|$|E

A decorative strip with a row of rivets overlays the join between the front and back sheets, and goes around the base of the horns.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Measurements of d 13 C, d 15 N, and C/N for {{a variety}} of Antarctic pen-insula fauna and flora were used to {{quantify}} the importance of benthic brown algae to resident organisms and determine food web relationships among this di-verse littoral fauna. d 13 C values ranged from 216. 8 ‰ for benthic algal herbivores (limpets) to 229. 8 ‰ for the krill, Euphausia superba; the average pooled value for brown macroalgae, including their attached filamentous diatoms, was 220. 6 ‰. There was no correlation between biomass d 13 C or d 15 N with C/N content, and consequently both d 13 C and d 15 N values were useful in evaluating trophic relation-ships. d 15 N values of the fauna ranged from 3. 1 to 12. 5 ‰, with lowest values re-corded in suspension feeders (e. g., bryozoans) and highest values in Adelie pen-guins (12. 5 ‰) collected in 1989. The comparatively lower d 15 N value for a <b>Chin-strap</b> penguin (6. 9 ‰) collected in 1997 is attributed to the different dietary food sources consumed by these species as reflected in their respective d 13 C values. Sig-nificant amounts of benthic macroalgal carbon is incorporated into the tissues of invertebrates and fishes that occupy up to four trophic levels. For many benthic and epibenthic species, including various crustaceans and molluscs, assimilation of benthic algal carbon through detrital pathways ranges from 30 to 100 %. Conse-quently, the trophic importance of benthic brown algae may well extend to many pelagic organisms that are key prey species for birds, fishes, and marine mammals. These data support the hypothesis that benthic seaweeeds, together with their as-sociated epiphytic diatoms, provide an important carbon source that is readily incorporated into Antarctic peninsula food webs...|$|E
