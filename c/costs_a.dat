5|$|The {{war ended}} with Croatian victory, as it {{achieved}} the goals it had declared {{at the beginning}} of the war: independence and preservation of its borders. Approximately 21–25% of Croatia's economy was ruined, with an estimated US$37billion in damaged infrastructure, lost output, and refugee-related <b>costs.</b> <b>A</b> total of 20,000 people were killed in the war, and refugees were displaced on both sides. The Serb and Croatian governments began to progressively cooperate with each other but tension remains, in part due to verdicts by the ICTY and lawsuits filed by each country against the other.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Megami Tensei games, demons {{are central to}} combat. They are acquired by the player through real-time negotiation: upon contacting a demon, they must successfully negotiate a conversation with them which can entail either friendly persuasion or intimidation of a demon. Once a demon is allied with the player, they aid them in combat: only one demon can be summoned at any one time, and when summoned that demon follows the player around as they navigate environments. Each time a demon is summoned, it <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> certain amount of magnetite, an in-game currency. Several demons can be held by them on the go, while further demons {{can be stored in}} Shinjuku Babel. Demons and the player gain experience levels separately: when the avatar has gained a level, they can assign stat points to various attributes. These in turn effect their abilities in battle and further skill development. Two different demons can be fused into a new demon in a location known as the Cathedral of Shadows: upon fusion, the new demon can inherit different skills from its demon parents. The skills a demon possesses can be altered or enhanced depending on their use in battles.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{flexibility}} of the new broilers, the new equipment has several features intended to decrease operational <b>costs.</b> <b>A</b> more efficient design of the burners in the Nieco units produces a 30 percent reduction in energy consumption. The Duke units produce a $4,000 -$5,000 annual savings on energy compared to the original units, which ran approximately at full capacity all day. The units are so fuel-efficient that in many US states, the company and its franchises qualify for energy-efficiency rebates. However, and issue arose in September 2011 when the state of Washington department of health warned Burger King of issues with the Duke units. In multiple incidents in seven counties throughout the state, the Duke units were found to have cracked heat spreaders which resulted in under cooked products. Additionally, there was foreign material contamination caused by loose insulation resulting from the cracks as well as other issues. Upon notification, Burger King released a statement that the company has notified franchisees and corporate-owned stores operating the Duke units with orders to repair the problem immediately. Additional training for operators was also ordered.|$|E

5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Voss Line was {{completed}} Norway had plunged into recession. Parliament {{was not willing to}} give more money to railways, and the country had to make do with a transport plan launched in 1886 that did not follow up with any funding. On 1 March 1894 parliament after five days of debate chose, with 60 against 53 votes, to build the Bergen Line. Several different routes had been proposed, including over Krøderen, or down Numedal (which later would get the Numedal Line). In the end Hallingdal was chosen, connecting to Hønefoss and via Sandvika. To save <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> preliminary line would connect Hønefoss to Roa with the branch Roa–Hønefoss Line. The final stage would be along the Gjøvik Line to Oslo. The line would also connect to the system via the Randsfjorden Line at Hønefoss.|$|E
5|$|Space Race is a two-player arcade game. In the game, the {{two players}} each control a spaceship, which they fly {{from the bottom}} of the screen to the top. Along the way are dashes {{representing}} asteroids moving across the screen from left to right, which the players must avoid. Movement controls are limited to moving the spaceship up or down; if the player's ship is hit by an asteroid it disappears for a few seconds before reappearing at the bottom again. The game displays a starfield in the background, as well as each player's score, which increases whenever a player makes it to the top first. Each game is for a set amount of time, represented by a line in the bottom middle of the screen that shortens during the game, with the winner being the player with the higher score when time runs out. Each game <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> quarter. Machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game, and the time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 45 seconds to 3 minutes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cost</b> is <b>an</b> {{important}} factor in game play and {{can be summed up}} as the weight of the player's action. With some exceptions, all cards have <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> attached to them and when used this cost transfers to the player. Cost varies radically from card to card. The higher the <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> character has, the longer that character must wait until their next turn. The lower the <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> character has, the shorter that character must wait until their next turn. For example: if a player character has <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> of 10 and a guard has <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> of 15, then the character's turn would occur before the guard's.|$|R

5|$|The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system method of tolling between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas {{along with the}} {{mainline}} Pennsylvania Turnpike. With the ticket system, a motorist receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders the ticket upon exiting. If a motorist loses the ticket, the turnpike charges the highest fare to the exit where the motorist leaves. Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit, charging a flat rate. There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit. E-ZPass is accepted at all toll plazas. As of 2017, it <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> passenger vehicle $12.10 to travel {{the length of the}} Northeast Extension between Mid-County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $8.54 using E-ZPass. The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $1.45 using cash and $0.81 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} was controversial in Lillehammer, both amongst {{the general public}} and politicians. The chief of administration had doubted whether he should recommend construction. The original plans had called for both a large and normal hill, but lack of funding meant that the normal hill was never built, meaning that the number of competitions in the hill would be severely limited. The cost overruns were largely created by errors in the plans, which estimated too little earthwork to fill the hillside, and not enough blasting. To cut <b>costs,</b> <b>a</b> floodlighting system was taken out of the plans, so the venue could not be used during the evenings, limiting the amount of time the venue could be used. It was also a concern that very few locals were able to jump on such a large hill. Many politicians stated in 1972 that the money should have been spent instead on an indoor hall for handball. The first trial jump was made by Helge Nordstrand, while Jan Stenbekk is credited with the first hill record, at 110.5meters.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to establish a}} bridge in Cubzac is taken by Napoleon Bonaparte on 30 January 1812 and February 3, 1813. The bridge was originally {{to be completed in}} 1820. However, Cubzac's first bridge was a suspension bridge for which construction works started in 1834, under Louis-Philippe I. Works lasted four years, and public inauguration occurred on August 17, 1839 by the Duc and Duchesse of Orleans. The bridge had cost an estimated 3 million gold francs, was 545m long and had 5 bays. Shortly after its construction, the pillars sank about one metre. During its 30 years of existence, it withstood storms despite the large amplitude oscillations caused. However, on March 2, 1869 a large storm, causing oscillations of more than two metres, partially destroyed the bridge and rendered it useless. Ancient methods to cross the Dordogne where reinstated. At first, barges and steamboats were used. Then, starting from October 1870, a large steam tub was used, measuring 21m by 13m. To cover the expensive construction <b>costs,</b> <b>a</b> toll was levied for the first 27 years.|$|E

5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed.|$|E
