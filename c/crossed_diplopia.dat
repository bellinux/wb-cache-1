5000|$|If {{the patient}} saw a red {{line to the}} left and white light to the right, they are said to have exotropia or exophoria (<b>crossed</b> <b>diplopia)</b> in which base in (BI) prisms of {{increasing}} strength are used until the lines are superimposed.|$|E
5000|$|Exotropia {{is a form}} of {{strabismus}} {{where the}} eyes are deviated outward. It is the opposite of esotropia. People with exotropia often experience <b>crossed</b> <b>diplopia.</b> Intermittent exotropia is a fairly common condition. [...] "Sensory exotropia" [...] occurs in the presence of poor vision. Infantile exotropia (sometimes called [...] "congenital exotropia") is seen {{during the first year of}} life, and is less common than [...] "essential exotropia" [...] which usually becomes apparent several years later.|$|E

50|$|Alhazen {{studied the}} process of sight, the {{structure}} of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the visual system. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 Perception article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century Hering's law of equal innervation. He wrote a description of vertical horopters 600 years before Aguilonius that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's—and his work on binocular disparity was repeated by Panum in 1858. Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from Ptolemy, who Alhazen was extremely familiar with. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law. In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy. In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune and Sabra, Raynaud showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and <b>crossed</b> <b>diplopia</b> were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-Müller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition {{of the role of the}} retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.|$|E
