25|$|September 8, 2010, {{mainland}} Chinese non-governmental fisherman groups {{took the}} streets of Beijing in protest, including a major protest outside the Japanese embassy. Chinese patriotism and anti-Japanese sentiment were evident amongst protestors who waved Chinese flags and sang the national anthem while holding placards demanding that the Japanese withdraw from the islands. A letter of protest was left with Japanese embassy staff along with an ancient Chinese styled <b>copper</b> <b>sheet</b> used to send off a dead person's spirit, as a death wish.|$|E
25|$|Rockets first firebox was of <b>copper</b> <b>sheet</b> {{and of a}} {{somewhat}} triangular shape from the side. The throatplate was of firebrick, possibly the backhead too. When rebuilt around 1831, this {{was replaced by a}} wrought iron backhead and throatplate, with a drum wrapper (now missing), presumed to be of copper, between them. This gave a larger internal volume and encouraged better combustion within the firebox, rather than inside the tubes. These early fireboxes formed a separate water space from the boiler drum and were connected by prominent external copper pipes.|$|E

25|$|The side-float design uses a {{float on}} the end of a lever to control the fill valve. The float is usually shaped like a ball, so the {{mechanism}} is called a ball-valve or a ballcock. Cock is a term for valve; see, for example, stopcock. The float was originally made from <b>copper</b> <b>sheet,</b> but it is now usually plastic. The float is located to one side of the main valve tower at the end of a rod or arm. As the side-float rises, so does the side-float-arm. The arm connects to the fill valve that blocks the water flow into the toilet tank, and thus maintains a constant level in the tank.|$|E

The eagle, of gilt <b>copper,</b> <b>sheet,</b> 15cm high and 11.5cm wide, is placed over this. Looking rightward, the eagle's wings are pointed downward and it holds the thunderbolts of Jupiter in its talons. It is placed on a parallelepipedic support of the same metal (10×3.5×2cm), which has a 3.4cm high ornament on its lower part.
