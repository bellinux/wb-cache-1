5|$|National {{and state}} AFL-CIO officials, fearing the New Jersey law might {{open the door}} to {{extensive}} new state regulation of labor unions, asked Local 54 to test the New Jersey law in court. After a regulatory appeal, the Casino Control Commission unanimously rejected the union's <b>contention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> law was unconstitutional and preempted by the NLRA.|$|E
5|$|Recent evidence, however, has {{suggested}} against the <b>contention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> use of psilocybin puts one {{at risk for}} developing long lasting mental disorders.

50|$|Fish J. wrote a {{unanimous}} verdict for the Court, rejecting Crown <b>contentions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> investigative procedure {{ought to be}} withheld from public view, in this case of insalubrious slaughter of cattle at the Aylmer Meat Packers plant in Toronto.

5|$|First, the High Court held, upon an {{examination}} of section 3 of the UPA and section 24(1) of the SA, {{that there was no}} express requirement for the Minister to have given the affected parties a right to be heard before the orders were made. Further, {{there was no room for}} the appellants' <b>contention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> principles of natural justice had to be complied with fully. The orders had been made with respect to both the public interest and the public order, and their objective was clearly the preservation of national security. The Court affirmed the conclusion of Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in R. v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, ex parte Hosenball (1977) that in such situations the ordinary principles of natural justice have to be modified to accommodate the public interest.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies on}} the sail of Dimetrodon and other sphenacodontids support Haack's 1986 <b>contention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sail was poorly adapted to {{releasing}} heat and maintaining a stable body temperature. The presence of sails in small-bodied species of Dimetrodon such as D.milleri and D.teutonis does not fit {{the idea that the}} sail's purpose was thermoregulation because smaller sails are less able to transfer heat and because small bodies can absorb and release heat easily on their own. Moreover, close relatives of Dimetrodon such as Sphenacodon have very low crests that would have been useless as thermoregulatory devices. The large sail of Dimetrodon is thought to have developed gradually from these smaller crests, meaning that over most of the sail's evolutionary history, thermoregulation could not have served an important function.|$|E
5|$|The High Court's {{decision}} was overruled by the Court of Appeal. The Court {{held that the}} Registrar had given genuine consideration to Komoco's arguments. It found that the Registrar had been entitled to take, prima facie, the Customs' OMV figures as correct unless they had {{been shown to be}} incorrect. Although the Registrar had been disposed to follow the Customs' OMV, she had equally been concerned to find out whether there had been sufficient reasons for her not to follow the administrative convention. Komoco had neither challenged the sworn evidence given by the Registrar by applying to cross-examine her, nor adduced any evidence to disprove the Registrar's sworn statement. There was thus no merit in Komoco's <b>contention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Registrar had not given genuine consideration to its representation. Furthermore, Komoco had not provided new evidence not already presented to the Customs to justify a departure from the administrative convention. Therefore, there had not been any compelling reason for the Registrar to re-evaluate her decision. She had adequately justified her refusal to depart from the policy, and had not fettered her discretion.|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{opinion of}} the work has also been voiced, with <b>contentions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> OCB perpetuates certain beer history myths, and other {{omissions}} published by writers and beer enthusiasts, some of whom OCB contributors themselves. Shortly after publication an unofficial wiki site was launched to [...] "make comments, add annotation, identify errata and suggest further sources to the text of The Oxford Companion to Beer".|$|R
5|$|The <b>contention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scene {{depicts the}} festival for Athena {{is fraught with}} problems. Later sources {{indicate}} {{that a number of}} classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the frieze, these include: the hoplites, the allies in the Delian league, the skiaphoroi or umbrella bearers, the female hydraiphoroi (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed) thetes, slaves, metics, the panathenaic ship, and some would suggest the kanephoros, although there is evidence that she is accounted for. That what we now see {{was meant to be a}} generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the line of inquiry. John Boardman has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the marathonomachoi, the hoplites who fell at Marathon in 490, and that, therefore these riders were the Athenians who took part in the last pre-war Greater Panathenaia. In support, he points out, the number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms, and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian War, is the similarity several scholars have noted of the frieze to the Apadana sculpture in Persepolis. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter posing itself to oriental tyranny, or, aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East. Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt’s <b>contention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> frieze embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of agones (or contests, as witnessed by the apobatai), sacrifices, and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues. More recent scholarship pursuing this vein has made the frieze a site of ideological tension between the elite and the demos with perhaps, only the aristocracy present, and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.|$|E
5|$|No formula {{could be}} more {{accurate}} than the values put into it; the values for the cross sections were dubious, and {{had not yet been}} determined for plutonium. Measurement of these values would be a priority, but the laboratory possessed just 1 gram of uranium-235, and only a few micrograms of plutonium. This task fell to Bacher's P Division. Williams P-2 (Electrostatic Generator) Group carried out the first experiment in July 1943, when it used the larger of the two Van de Graaff generators to measure the ratio of the neutron per fission in plutonium against that of uranium-235. This involved some negotiation with the Metallurgical Laboratory to obtain 165 μg of plutonium, which was received at Los Alamos on 10 July 1943. Bacher was able to report that the number of neutrons per fission of plutonium-239 was 2.64 ± 0.2, about 1.2 times as much as uranium-235. Titterton and Boyce McDaniel of Wilson's P-1 (Cyclotron) Group attempted to measure the time it took for prompt neutrons to be emitted from a uranium-235 nucleus when it fissions. They calculated that most were emitted in less than 1 nanosecond. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that fission took less than a nanosecond too. Confirmation of the theorists' <b>contention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of neutrons emitted per fission was the same for both fast and slow neutrons took longer, and was not completed until the autumn of 1944.|$|E
25|$|Springer's {{challenge}} {{was based on}} the <b>contention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> income tax imposed by the statute was a direct tax not apportioned among the states according to the population of each state under Article I of the Constitution.

50|$|Post-industrialism as {{a concept}} is highly Western-centric. Theoretically and effectively, it is only {{possible}} in the Global West, which its proponents assume to be solely capable of fully realizing industrialization and then post-industrialization. Herman Kahn optimistically predicted the “economic growth, expanded production and growing efficiency” of post-industrial societies and the resultant “material abundance and… high quality of life” to extend to “almost all people in Western societies” and only “some in Eastern societies.” This prediction is treated elsewhere by <b>contentions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> post-industrial society merely perpetuates capitalism.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{criminal}} incarceration (imprisonment) {{imposed upon}} conviction following a trial, administrative detention is a forward-looking mechanism. While criminal proceedings have a retrospective focus - {{they seek to}} determine whether a defendant committed an offense in the past - the reasoning behind administrative detention often is based upon <b>contentions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> suspect is likely to pose a threat in the future. It is meant to be preventive in nature rather than punitive (see preventive detention). The practice has been criticized by human rights organizations as a breach of civil and political rights.|$|R

25|$|Arius {{objected to}} Origen's doctrine, {{complaining}} {{about it in}} his letter to the Nicomedian Eusebius, who had also studied under Lucian. Nevertheless, despite disagreeing with Origen on this point, Arius found solace in his writings, which used expressions that favored Arius's <b>contention</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Logos was of a different substance than the Father, and owed his existence to his Father's will. However, because Origen's theological speculations were often proffered to stimulate further inquiry rather than {{to put an end to}} any given dispute, both Arius and his opponents were able to invoke the authority of this revered (at the time) theologian during their debate.|$|E
