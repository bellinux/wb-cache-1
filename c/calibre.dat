Traditional British double rifle <b>calibres</b> include the Rook rifle, Black Powder Express and rimmed Nitro Express families of cartridges {{and many of these}} can still be obtained today. European makers tend to chamber their double rifles in metric rimmed <b>calibres</b> developed by European firms, although British and American cartridges are offered.|$|R
50|$|The Nordenfelt gun was a {{multiple}} barrel organ gun {{that had a}} row of up to twelve barrels. It was fired by pulling a lever {{back and forth and}} ammunition was gravity fed through chutes for each barrel. It was produced {{in a number of different}} <b>calibres</b> from rifle up to 25 mm (1 inch). Larger <b>calibres</b> were also used, but for these <b>calibres</b> the design simply permitted rapid manual loading rather than true automatic fire. This article covers the anti-personnel rifle-calibre (typically 0.45 inch) gun.|$|R
5|$|For 2000, Memory Card A/S, a Danish {{producer}} of memory cards, stepped in as co-sponsor and Danish cyclist Bo Hamburger {{was brought in}} as captain.

5|$|Rather {{than try}} to fit more guns onto a ship, it was {{possible}} to increase the power of each gun. This could be done by increasing either the <b>calibre</b> of the weapon and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of ironclads {{tended to}} become concentrated {{in a small}} number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range; <b>calibre</b> and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration. Throughout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech-loading versus muzzle-loading.|$|E

5|$|The brigade was {{equipped}} with 43 anti-aircraft guns ranging in <b>calibre</b> from 20 to 40mm. These guns had a dual role as both anti-aircraft and coastal defence weapons. Many were in concrete emplacements {{on top of the}} submarine pens and other dockside installations of the St Nazaire submarine base.|$|E
5|$|The pre-dreadnought's {{armament}} {{was completed}} by a tertiary battery of light, rapid-fire guns. These could be of any <b>calibre</b> from 3-inch (76mm) down to machine guns. Their role was to give short-range protection against torpedo boats, or to rake the deck and superstructure of a battleship.|$|E
5|$|But in the {{following}} seven months, Cairano records successive advances and balances for trophies in full production mode that does not affect his other works, whereas Tamagnino only realises two Caesars and seventeen leonine busts. The creation of leonine busts was considered repetitive and could be consigned to low <b>calibre</b> stonecutters, and Tamagnino was paid {{much less than the}} average payment received by Cairano for artefacts of the same type.|$|E

50|$|Mk X {{continued}} {{the trend of}} lengthening gun barrels as far as new construction methods would permit, {{in order to allow}} more cordite propellant to be used to attain higher projectile velocities. Mk X increased the bore length from Mk IX's 480 inches (40 <b>calibres)</b> to 540 inches (45 <b>calibres),</b> increasing muzzle velocity from 2,600 to 2,700 feet/second.|$|R
50|$|The gun was {{designed}} and built by Vickers specifically as a field gun, unlike its predecessors which originated as naval guns. Its length was reduced from the 45 <b>calibres</b> of its naval gun predecessors, to 35 <b>calibres,</b> to reduce weight and improve mobility. It utilized the modern carriage and recoil mechanism of the BL 8 inch Howitzer Mk 6.|$|R
5|$|Cdr Katô Hirohasu {{pushed for}} the {{adoption}} of a new /45 <b>calibre</b> gun that was currently under development. After trials of the new gun, which were witnessed by both the Japanese Navy and Royal Navy, the Japanese made the decision on 29 Nov 1911 to use the new gun despite the keel having already been laid down on 17 January 1911, and the resulting need to quickly make a large number of alternations to the design, so as to not prolong the construction.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts {{also carried}} lighter weapons. Many early dreadnoughts carried a {{secondary}} armament of very light guns designed {{to fend off}} enemy torpedo boats. The <b>calibre</b> and weight of secondary armament tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the staying power of the destroyers expected to carry them also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to be equipped with many light guns as anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of Brownings, which had been selected as the new standard rifle <b>calibre</b> machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later. Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly {{on the ground and}} at low altitudes, they tended to freeze at high altitude, especially the outer wing guns. This was because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented overheating of the cordite used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered. Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938, when they added hot air ducts {{from the rear of the}} wing mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the hot air in the wing. Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt and moisture until they were fired. Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a <b>calibre</b> of at least 20mm was urgently needed.|$|E

5|$|Extant {{documentation}} {{makes it}} possible to follow the competition more clearly than {{in the case of the}} shrine dei Miracoli, and the delivered works, their dates and respective payments lend themselves to interesting analyses. By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had delivered at least five different Caesars and other stone material, but only a payment for a single bust is documented, because his attention was completely taken up with two gigantic angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine busts, which showcased his <b>calibre</b> and scale of production.|$|E
5|$|His {{performance}} at the Olympic trials was in vain as Mr. Justice Mackay upheld the BOA ban in the High Court of Justice and stated that a right to work was not sufficient reason to remove it. The BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, was satisfied with the outcome, stating that those abusing drugs did not deserve to represent Great Britain at the Olympics. However, he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers' <b>calibre</b> had in effect excluded himself from the competition.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal was a well-armed ship, {{carrying}} twenty-six 12-pounder cannon and {{a number}} of smaller <b>calibre</b> guns on the maindeck. The French Navy immediately took her into service as the 34-gun frigate Duguay Trouin and attached her to the Isle de France squadron of the frigates Prudente and Cybèle, and the brig Vulcain under Captain Jean-Marie Renaud. This force skirmished inconclusively with a squadron of East India Company ships in the Sunda Strait in January 1794, before returning to Isle de France with the captured East Indiaman Pigot.|$|E

This was some 2,000tons (2,032tonnes) heavier than the preceding King George Vs, and was primarily due {{to the increase in}} <b>calibre</b> of the secondary battery.|$|E

It {{was cast in}} 1603 and is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia. In front of the dolphin handles is a decorative band featuring three pairs of heraldic lions with long, spiralling tails. Each pair faces a vase containing flowers. Between the handles and the Dutch East India Company's seal is a Javi inscription, inlaid with silver, celebrating the gun's capture in 1613. The base ring is incised with the gunsmith's signature and date of manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of smokeless powder, based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the pre-Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s {{tended to be}} smaller in <b>calibre</b> compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12in (305mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.|$|E
