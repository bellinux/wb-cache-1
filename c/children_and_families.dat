5|$|In 1999, {{the band}} self-released an EP titled First Impressions {{which was the}} product of a two-day session at A-Room Studios with Brian Tochilin. Only 1,000 copies were made and the band members sold them out of their cars. Working with Death by Stereo's Paul Miner, the quartet {{recorded}} 12 tracks, and by April 2000, the group had released Identity Crisis on Greenflag Records. A portion of the album's proceeds were donated to a local charity called Crittenton Services for <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> <b>Families.</b> More support gigs and local buzz followed, and Thrice sparked the interest of Hopeless/Sub City's Louis Posen. In 2001, Posen signed with the band, reissued Identity Crisis, and sent the group out on tour with Samiam. Tours with Midtown and Hot Rod Circuit followed.|$|E
40|$|Background: Australia has a {{well-established}} universal <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health service predominately staffed by specialist/qualified <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nurses. Two common and interrelated concerns are {{the need for}} nurses {{to be ready for}} practice after completing a nursing education program and the means to ensure ongoing nursing competence. Objective: To investigate the readiness of CFH nurses to practise after qualification and their continuing engagement with learning. Design: The study used an interpretive descriptive approach. Setting: This paper presents data from four questions from a larger survey of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nurses across Australia. Participants: 1098 <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nurses responded to the survey. Method: Qualitative survey responses from the four education questions were analysed using inductive thematic content analysis. Results: Five significant themes were identified: hands-on experience (student clinical practice/placement); drawing on prior experience; learning on the job; learning (learning over time); and barriers to learning. Conclusion: This paper provides insights into nurses 2 ̆ 7 readiness for practice at the completion of a postgraduate <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nursing qualification and their maintenance of competence and specialist knowledge. It highlights: the need for clinical placement to be retained and enhanced; the significant contribution of more experienced <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nurses mentoring newly graduated <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nurses; the need for minimum education standards; the importance of reviewing education courses in relation to graduates 2 ̆ 7 readiness for <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nursing practice; the importance of supporting ongoing professional development; and the removal of barriers to accessing education opportunities...|$|R

5|$|The 400-page report made 108 {{recommendations}} in child protection reform. Regional and local committees for <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>families</b> {{are to be}} set up, with members from all groups involved in child protection. Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register, a list of children believed to be at risk, and no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases, led {{to the implementation of}} the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time the report was published.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, 2017, Baker {{proposed}} a $40.5 billion state budget {{for fiscal year}} 2018, and on March 9, 2017, legislative hearings began to review it. Tax changes proposed in Baker's 2018 budget proposal include extending the state sales tax to online retailers without physical storefronts or offices in-state, a requirement that credit card companies send a 1099 tax form to individuals earning more than $600 from credit and debit card transactions, extending the state's hotel tax to room-sharing services and individuals who rent out rooms for more than 150 days a year, and a $2,000-per-employee assessment on employers that do not offer health insurance to counter spending growth in the state Medicaid program, MassHealth. Spending increases to MassHealth, local government and local education aid, higher education (including $78 million towards repairs of the University of Massachusetts Boston underground parking garage), an anti-opioid trafficking program and substance abuse services, homelessness prevention, improvement in clinical services at Bridgewater State Hospital, the Department of <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> <b>Families</b> to hire more case workers, a job retraining fund, an MBTA subsidy, and increasing state tax credits to businesses that hire unemployed military veterans {{are included in the}} proposal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Given {{extensive}} {{demographic and}} social change, {{there is a}} search for new policy strategies for enhancing <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> well-being. Family policy, a holistic approach to evaluating social policies affecting <b>children</b> <b>and</b> their <b>families,</b> is one such strategy. Two illustrations of advanced industrialised countries with an explicit family policy are presented along with several new <b>and</b> innovative <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> policy initiatives launched in less developed countries. Together, these may offer possible components of a Hong Kong family policy. An explicit family policy {{may not be the}} answer to Hong Kong's concerns about <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> well-being, but making the conditions of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> their <b>families</b> more visible <b>and</b> identifying and assessing the policies affecting them, would help if one goal is to achieve greater policy coherence...|$|R

5|$|To {{allow the}} {{introduction}} of the database, the government required all local authorities to implement the Integrated Children's System, a framework to help improve outcomes for children. The government set a deadline of 1 January 2007, and 92 out of the 150 local authorities failed to achieve this. The government began a consultation on the 2007 draft regulations on 21 September 2006 which ended on 14 December 2006. In October 2006, the government selected Capgemini to design the database. On 15 February 2007, the database was renamed from Information Sharing Index to ContactPoint, following research with stakeholder groups, including <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>families,</b> who decided that the name ContactPoint made clear what the purpose of the database was: to improve communication between those working with children. A consultation on a guide for database users was launched on 4 May 2007 and ended on 27 July 2007.|$|E
