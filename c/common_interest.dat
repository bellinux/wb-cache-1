Ali Bey shared a <b>common</b> <b>interest</b> with Zahir to subdue Damascus as he sought to extend his influence to Syria for strategic purposes vis-a-vis his conflict with the Sublime Porte. He had dispatched 15,000-20,000 Egyptian troops to the port cities of Gaza and Jaffa under commander Ismail Bey. Together, Zahir and Ismail crossed the Jordan Valley with their armies and moved north toward Damascus. They made {{it as far as}} Muzayrib, but Ismail abruptly halted his army's advance after confronting Uthman Pasha as he was leading the Hajj caravan in order to avoid harming the Muslim pilgrims.

5|$|For {{the first}} 12years after the county {{was created in}} 1974, Greater Manchester had a two-tier system of local government, and the {{metropolitan}} borough councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council. The Greater Manchester County Council, a strategic authority based {{in what is now}} Westminster House off Piccadilly Gardens, comprised 106 members drawn from the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester. It was a sub-regional body running regional services such as transport, strategic planning, emergency services and waste disposal. In 1986, along with the five other metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council, the Greater Manchester County Council was abolished, and most of its powers were devolved to the boroughs. Between 1986 and 2011, the boroughs were effectively unitary authority areas, but opted to co-operate voluntarily under the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA), which served to create a co-ordinated county-wide approach to issues of <b>common</b> <b>interest</b> to Greater Manchester, such as public transport and the shared labour market, as well as making representations to central government and the European Union.|$|E
