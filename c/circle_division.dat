[...] "And I went over there and talked to them, they said: “Yeah, go ahead.” It was a street racer movie, that’s what I came up with, and we shot that in 15 days—TV was not generous with their time. We shot that up in Northern California, in Calistoga, wine country, and at the Fremont drag way." ...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the ways}} of drawing {{sketches}} of heads—as Jack Ham advises—is to develop it in six well defined steps starting with {{the shape of the}} head in the shape of an egg. Female head in particular is sketched in a double circle design procedure with proportions considered as ideal of female head. In the first <b>circle</b> <b>division</b> is made of five sections on the diameter, each section of five eyes width. It is then developed over a series of ten defined steps with the smaller circle imposed partially over the larger circle at lower end at the fourth stage. Eyes and chins are fitted in various shapes to form the head.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- We {{consider}} the coverage and connectivity {{problem of a}} sensor network with n unreliable nodes, uniformity arranged over a square region of unit area. We propose a novel triangle-arranged <b>circle</b> <b>division</b> method to obtain the the formula {{of the relationship of}} probability of coverage and connectivity, sensing radius, transmission radius, failure probability and the numbers of the nodes using probability method. Based on those,the design principle of sensing radius, transmission radius, failure probability and the numbers of the nodes for wireless sensor networks is given. We extend the ratio of transmission radius to sensing radius to arbitrary value and obtain good result...|$|E
50|$|The first {{plans for}} a Lower Saxon Circle {{originate}} from Albert II of Germany in 1438. An Imperial Saxon Circle was formally created in 1500, but in 1512 it was divided into an Upper Saxon and Lower Saxon <b>Circle.</b> The <b>division</b> was only codified in 1522, {{and it took a}} while before the separation was completely implemented by the Imperial Chamber Court. Furthermore, the first mention of an Upper Saxon Circle, a Lower Saxon Circle or the Netherlands occurred much later on. The term Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen) was first used only in 1548.|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} HIV infection on T cell turnover, we examined levels of DNA synthesis in lymph node and peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets by using ex vivo labeling with BrdUrd. Compared with healthy controls (n = 67), HIV-infected patients (n = 57) had significant increases in the number and fraction of dividing CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. Higher percentages of dividing CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells were noted in patients with the higher viral burdens. No direct correlation was noted between rates of T cell turnover and CD 4 + T cell counts. Marked reductions in CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell proliferation were seen in 11 / 11 patients 1 – 12 weeks after initiation of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART). These reductions persisted for the length of the study (16 – 72 weeks). Decreases in naïve T cell proliferation correlated with increases in the levels of T cell receptor rearrangement excision <b>circles.</b> <b>Division</b> of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells increased dramatically in association with rapid increases in HIV- 1 viral loads in 9 / 9 patients 5 weeks after termination of HAART and declined to pre-HAART-termination levels 8 weeks after reinitiation of therapy. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that HIV- 1 infection induces a viral burden-related, global activation of the immune system, leading to increases in lymphocyte proliferation...|$|R
40|$|The Geospatial Delhi Limited (GSDL), a Govt. of NCT of Delhi Company {{formed in}} order to provide the {{geospatial}} information of National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD) to the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) and its organs such as DDA, MCD, DJB, State Election Department, DMRC etc., for the benefit of all citizens of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD). This paper describes the development of Geospatial Map based Portal (GMP) for New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) of NCT of Delhi. The GMP has been developed as a map based spatial decision support system (SDSS) for planning and development of NDMC area to the NDMC department and It’s heaving the inbuilt information searching tools (identifying of location, nearest utilities locations, distance measurement etc.) for the citizens of NCTD. The GMP is based on Client-Server architecture model. It has been developed using Arc GIS Server 10. 0 with. NET (pronounced dot net) technology. The GMP is scalable to enterprise SDSS with enterprise Geo Database & Virtual Private Network (VPN) connectivity. Spatial data to GMP includes <b>Circle,</b> <b>Division,</b> Sub-division boundaries of department pertaining to New Delhi Municipal Council, Parcels of residential, commercial, and government buildings, basic amenities (Police Stations, Hospitals, Schools, Banks, ATMs and Fire Stations etc.), Over-ground and Underground utility network lines, Roads, Railway features.

It enables a faster response to the changing ground realities in the development planning, owing to its in-built scientific approach and open-ended design...|$|E
25|$|After having entertained {{a number}} of {{traditional}} record company offers, and rejecting them due to an unwillingness to give up rights to her music, Rhodes assumed production and engineering duties on the 1998 release Many Worlds Are Born Tonight. Once the album was complete, she signed with a new label, Samson Music, {{and was able to}} tour the northeastern United States with a more elaborate stage show. The song Roy was released as a single and reached #42 on the Billboard Club Play/Dance Music chart. While sales were far greater than her previous albums, Samson eventually decided to concentrate on their Gold <b>Circle</b> Films <b>division</b> and dropped Rhodes. The parting was amicable, and the label returned her musical rights, as well as all unsold product.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} color {{circle of}} Isaac Newton.showed only the spectral hues and {{was provided to}} illustrate a rule for the color of mixtures of lights, that these could be approximately predicted {{from the center of}} gravity of the numbers of [...] "rays" [...] of each spectral color present (represented in his diagram by small <b>circles).</b> The <b>divisions</b> of Newton's <b>circle</b> are of unequal size, being based on the intervals of a Dorian musical scale. Most later color circles include the purples, however, between red and violet, and have equal-sized hue divisions. Color scientists and psychologists often use the additive primaries, red, green and blue; and often refer to their arrangement around a circle as a color circle as opposed to a color wheel.|$|R

The 27th Division of the Japanese Army attempted to reinforce the position but were ambushed and repulsed by the Chinese 32nd Army led by Shang Zhen in Baisui Street, west of Wanjialing. On 7 October, the Chinese Army mounted a final large-scale assault to encircle the Japanese troops. The fierce battle continued for three days, and all Japanese counter-attacks were repelled by the Chinese.|$|R
50|$|Another {{system was}} created in the 16th century by Pedro Nunes and was called nonius after him. It {{consisted}} of tracing a certain number of concentric circles on an instrument and dividing each successive one with one fewer divisions than the adjacent outer circle. Thus the outermost quadrant would have 90° in 90 equal divisions, the next inner would have 89 divisions, the next 88 and so on. When an angle was measured, the <b>circle</b> and the <b>division</b> on which the alidade fell was noted. A table was then consulted to provide the exact measure.

2500|$|First [...] {{demonstrated}} {{the form of}} the world by a plain wooden sphere... thus expressing a very big thing by a little model. Slanting this sphere by its two poles on the horizon, he showed the northern constellations toward the upper pole and the southern toward the lower pole. He kept this position straight using a circle that the Greeks called horizon, the Latins limitans, because it divides visible stars from those that are not visible. On this horizon line, placed so as to demonstrate practically and plausibly... the rising and setting of the stars, he traced natural outlines to give a greater appearance of reality to the constellations... He divided a sphere in half, letting the tube represent the diameter, the one end representing the north pole, the other the south pole. Then he divided the semicircle from one pole to the other into thirty parts. Six lines drawn from the pole he drew a heavy ring to represent the arctic polar <b>circle.</b> Five <b>divisions</b> below this he placed another line to represent the tropic of Cancer. Four parts lower he drew a line for the equinoctial circle [...] The remaining distance to the south pole is divided by the same dimensions.|$|R

50|$|The {{remnants}} of the Burma Army faced encirclement as they retreated north from the city, but broke through the Taukkyan Roadblock {{as the result of}} an error {{on the part of the}} local Japanese commander. Colonel Takanobu Sakuma, commanding the Japanese 214th Infantry Regiment, had been ordered to block the main road north from Rangoon to Prome while the main body of the 33rd <b>Division</b> <b>circled</b> round the city to attack from the west. The retreating British and Indian troops were thrown back when they attempted to break through Sakuma's road block. Alexander ordered another attack but found the Japanese had gone. Not realising that the British were evacuating Rangoon, Sakuma had withdrawn the road block, as ordered, once the 33rd Division reached its intended positions. Had he not done so, the Japanese might have captured General Alexander and much of the rest of Burma Army.|$|R
