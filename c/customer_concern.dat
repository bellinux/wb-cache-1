In this context, optimal product differentiation strategies solve a trade-off between softening price competition and reducing customers' total cost of ownership. Our analysis is consistent with empirical evidence suggesting a negative correlation between corporate leverage and product uniqueness. ...|$|R

The factors that used to analyze in this research are; customer motivation, brand name, product design and price. Hence, to analyze these factors, researcher had used coefficient correlation to determine which factor had high tendency towards the dependent variable (purchase of gadget). Customer motivation factor explain about the environment that influence them to attempt a purchase like; media, friends and customer confident level. The coefficient correlation value for the customer motivation factor is positive. 490, which indicates weak relationship. Besides that, brand name factor also play the vital role to influence the purchase of gadget. Usually, the good reputation of a brand attracts customer to buy most. The coefficient correlation value for the brand name factor is positive. 338, which indicates weak relationship. Next, product design factor explain the characteristic of a product, specification, application and function. The coefficient correlation value for the product design factor is positive. 575, which indicates moderate relationship. The last factor that had been tested is price.

40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirement}} for the Master of Technology: Quality in the Faculty of Engineering At the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2012 New Product Development (NPD) is a complicated process that determines {{success or failure of}} any company engaging in product development processes. Over the past years, due to the current highly competitive market environment, poor management skills, lack of innovation and <b>customer</b> <b>concern,</b> many companies are struggling to develop new products while simultaneously maintaining high quality of each of these new products. Various studies described that quality management is critical to prolong the life cycle of new products. Thus, this study focused on the key success factors of NPD and integrated quality management strategies into NPD process. This study was conducted at a local plastic packaging and load securing company in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. A combination of both qualitative and quantitative research approaches was conducted. Both management (n 1 = 5) the staff members (n 2 = 24) who are involved in the NPD process were selected as samples. A semi-structured questionnaire and several interviews (in-depth and focused group) were utilised for data collection. A statistical programme (SPSS V 20) was employed to generate descriptive statistical results and test the reliability of all the variables. The study results identified that the key quality determinants of the NPD process were are NPD reviews, verifications and validations. In addition, for the NPD process to be successful, the company should focus {{on the development of the}} NPD strategy, availability of skills and resources including NPD competence, product quality, empowered multidisciplinary teams and effective risk management. Based on the research findings, this study recommends that the company should have more focuses on the areas of customer dissatisfaction, product quality, and prototype planning in their NPD processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the EXPRESS (Expedite the PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station) rack project {{is to provide a}} set of {{predefined}} interfaces for scientific payloads which allow rapid integration into a payload rack on International Space Station (ISS). VxWorks' was selected as the operating system for the rack and payload resource controller, primarily based on the proliferation of VME (Versa Module Eurocard) products. These products provide needed flexibility for future hardware upgrades to meet everchanging science research rack configuration requirements. On the International Space Station, there are multiple science research rack configurations, including: 1) Human Research Facility (HRF); 2) EXPRESS ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System); 3) WORF (Window Observational Research Facility); and 4) HHR (Habitat Holding Rack). The RIC (Rack Interface Controller) connects payloads to the ISS bus architecture for data transfer between the payload and ground control. The RIC is a general purpose embedded computer which supports multiple communication protocols, including fiber optic communication buses, Ethernet buses, EIA- 422, Mil-Std- 1553 buses, SMPTE (Society Motion Picture Television Engineers) - 170 M video, and audio interfaces to payloads and the ISS. As a cost saving and software reliability strategy, the Boeing Payload Software Organization developed reusable common software where appropriate. These reusable modules included a set of low-level driver software interfaces to 1553 B. RS 232, RS 422, Ethernet buses, HRDL (High Rate Data Link), video switch functionality, telemetry processing, and executive software hosted on the FUC computer. These drivers formed the basis for software development of the HRF, EXPRESS, EXPRESS ARIS, WORF, and HHR RIC executable modules. The reusable RIC common software has provided extensive benefits, including: 1) Significant reduction in development flow time; 2) Minimal rework and maintenance; 3) Improved reliability; and 4) Overall reduction in software life cycle cost. Due to the limited number of crew hours available on ISS for science research, operational efficiency is a critical <b>customer</b> <b>concern.</b> The current method of upgrading RIC software is a time consuming process; thus, an improved methodology for uploading RIC software is currently under evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to set out an {{argument}} for a way to design, implement and manage IS with an emphasis on first, the learning that can be created through undertaking the approach, and second, the learning that may be created through using the IS that was implemented. The paper proposes joining two areas of research namely, technology management with soft systems methodology (SSM). The framework was developed through undertaking a <b>customer</b> <b>concern</b> management project within a manufacturing organisation. Design/methodology/approach Reviewing the literature on information systems management, the learning organisation, and systems theory a proposed synergy is found. The outcome of this synergy allows a number of methodologies to be identified that are argued as suitable for IS design. From these information system development (ISD) methodologies, SSM is expanded to incorporate the principles of the learning organisation and systems theory. The expanded SSM framework is applied in practice through a process of participatory action research. Findings The outcome of the practical work argues for a complete framework that joins the areas of research (SSM and technology management) and emphasises other thinking from the areas of systems theory and the “learning organisation”. Research limitations/implications The paper concludes with a discussion on the advantages of joining soft systems with technology management but also the limitations created. Such limitations have been identified as moving from the soft, tacit issues of the design phases to the harder more structured aspects of technology implementation and management. A change in philosophy may restrict other issues from being explored. This issue needs to be focussed on in future research. Practical implications A framework has been developed that draws on the work of soft systems methodology (SSM) and a technology management process framework (TMPF) used in the area of technology management. By expanding the SSM model and joining it with the TMPF an attempt to give individuals and teams a practical tool to help design, implement, and manage IS with an emphasis on learning the framework promotes. Originality/value The framework provides advantages for academics, consultants and other practitioners and gives a central focus on what issues need to be accomplished more explicitly in order to undertake an ISD project...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to investigate the reasons for conflicts in the customer service industry, to examine strategies for conflict management {{which can be used}} to help resolve these conflicts, to examine the relationship of these strategies with the concept of emotional intelligence, and {{to improve the quality of}} customer service provisions in the customer service industry. The theoretical basis of this study includes reference to the following: Attribution Theory (Heider, 1958) Factors of interpersonal attraction and distraction (Deutsch, 1994) Temperament Theory (McKenna 2 ̆ 6 David, 1997) Contingency Theory (Burnett, 1998) The influence of environmental factors (Daniels 2 ̆ 6 Walker, 2001) Theory of Self‐control (Walsh, 2002) Theory of Causation (Berstene, 2004) In the area of conflict management, Wall (1995) focuses on the concern for self and for others in five major forms of behaviour: avoiding, dominating, obliging, compromising and integrating. Reuven Bar‐On (1997) analyses a person’s ability and potential to recognise and regulate conflicts. The relationship between emotional intelligence and conflict formation is said to be affected by factors including attitude (Eugenio, 2003), perception (Berstene, 2004), personality (Ambe, 2004) and past rivalry (Fazzi, 2001). The determinants of the relationship between emotional intelligence and conflict management strategy have been identified as (1) communication and interpersonal relationships (Esin, 1986), (2) concern for self (Frak, 2005), (3) concern for others (Gourley, 2005) and (4) transformation and reinterpretation of the conflict situation (Kane, 2004). Grounded Theory has been adopted in this research (Glaser 2 ̆ 6 Strauss, 1967). Qualitative interviews were used to collect data on conflict formation and management strategy. Tests to measure the emotional intelligence quotient (also called the emotional quotient) of participants were also conducted and demographic data of the participants was gathered. Customer service staff are suggested to identify the real needs of customers through the use of the concepts of emotional intelligence and conflict formation. Customer service staff should apply the appropriate conflict management strategy with due regard to the impact of emotional intelligence so as to resolve conflicts or be aware of situations of potential conflict. There are three factors that can contribute to preventing or minimising conflict: (1) high staff emotional intelligence, (2) staff concern for others and (3) <b>customer</b> <b>concern</b> for others. This study suggests that as long as at least two of these factors are present concurrently, conflicts can be avoided or resolved soon after their formation...|$|E

40|$|Banking and {{insurance}} services are ideal candidates for electronic delivery (Evans and Wurster 1997 and Rayport and Sviokla 1995). It is unsurprising therefore {{to find that}} the financial services industry has been among the earliest adopters of electronic commerce solutions in the provision of those services. However that there is little empirical evidence that this trend is to any large degree a response to customer demand. This paper outlines some findings of a series of focus groups conducted with members of a large health insurance company in Australia. Key findings of this qualitative work were that while introduction of e-commerce applications to their service was not a key issue for customers, any such introduction would need to meet a range of serious <b>customer</b> <b>concerns</b> if it was to meet with their approval. Follow-up research revealed that subsequently, not only the fund in question but in fact all major funds had aggressively implemented Internet payment and claiming.
