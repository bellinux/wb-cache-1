Serpulid worms {{are very similar to}} tube worms of the closely related sabellid family, except that the former possess a {{cartilaginous}} operculum that occludes the entrance to their protective tube after the animal has withdrawn into it. The most distinctive feature of worms of the Serpula genus is their colorful fan-shaped [...] "crown". The crown, used by these animals for respiration and alimentation, is the structure that is most commonly seen by scuba divers and other casual observers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Calcareous</b> <b>tubeworms</b> {{are common}} in the Artinskian (Lower Permian) shale and {{limestone}} rocks of the Wichita−Albany Group in central Texas. In some units they form small reefs of budding tubes spreading outward from a common origin. These tubular fossils have been traditionally referred to as serpulids, but here we identify them as microconchids (Helicoconchus elongatus gen. et sp. nov.) These microconchids are unusual because of their greatly elongated impunctate tubes with centrally pitted diaphragms. They also show two types of budding: lateral with small daughter tubes that begin as small coils, and binary fission that produced two daughter tubes of equal diameters. These microconchids flourished in shal− low marine environments with a fauna dominated by mollusks, echinoids, and foraminifera...|$|R
40|$|Nineteen polychaete species {{belonging}} to five families, {{and representatives of}} two others not identified to species, are recorded from Viti Levu, Fiji. Most of the <b>calcareous</b> <b>tubeworms</b> (Serpulidae, Spirorbidae) were collected from shallow patch reefs in the Mba Passage off the northwest coast; the remaining worms came from the intertidal region of Suva Harbor on the southeast coast of Viti Levu. The tubeworms Spirobranchus giganteus corniculatus and Floriprotis sabiuraensis were collected with live coral, and 12 species were scraped from coral rock. Extensive patches of a gregarious sabellariid occur in Suva Harbor, and nereidids and spionids were found among the densely packed sabellariid tubes. Polychaetes in this collection are most similar to faunas of eastern Australia, Japan, Hawaii, and Tonga, and least {{similar to those of}} the Societies, Marquesas, and Tuamotus. These faunal affinities show a west to east trend reflecting Ekman's rule, but could also be explained on the basis of sampling effort...|$|R
40|$|Although Scandinavian Arctic polychaete fauna {{has been}} {{extensively}} investigated, new species are still being found in the Barents Sea. Polychaetes of the family Serpulidae are <b>calcareous</b> <b>tubeworms</b> that are most abundant at low latitudes and less common in Arctic and Antarctic waters. Because recent phylogenetic data indicate that the family Spirorbidae is a clade nested inside Serpulidae, spirorbins are treated here as subfamily Spirorbinae and their traditionally recognized subfamilies are thus lowered to the tribes Paralaeospirini, Spirorbini, Circeini, Romanchellini, Pileolariini and Januini. Here we report two new serpulid species, a filogranin Protis akvaplani sp. n. and a spirorbin Bushiella (Bushiella) barentsii sp. n. collected from off the northern Norwegian coast. Protis akvaplani differs from other species of within the genus by its tube with a high longitudinal keel, six thoracic chaetigerous segments, and short thoracic membranes ending after the 3 rd segment. Generic diagnosis of the genus Protis has been emended. Bushiella (B. ) barentsii differs from other species of the subgenus Bushiella by morphology of the opercular talon of operculum, incomplete fusing of primary operculum with brood chamber, and large tubes (up to 5 mm in coil diameter) with 1 - 2 distinct longitudinal ridges...|$|R
40|$|A {{test coupon}} coated with light <b>calcareous</b> <b>tubeworm</b> fouling was scanned, scaled and {{reproduced}} for wind-tunnel testing {{to determine the}} equivalent sand grain roughness ks. It was found that this surface had a ks = 0. 325 mm, substantially less than previously reported values for light calcareous fouling. Any number of variations in surface topology could account for these different report values, such as sparseness, differences in species settlement etc. The experimental results were used to predict the drag on a fouled full scale ship. To achieve this, a modified method for predicting the total drag of a spatially developing turbulent boundary layer(TBL), such as that on the hull of a ship, is presented. The method numerically integrates the skin friction over {{the length of the}} boundary layer, assuming a widely accepted analytical form for the mean velocity profile of the TBL. The velocity profile contains the roughness (fouling) information, such that the prediction requires only an input of ks, free-stream velocity (ship speed), kinematic viscosity and the length of the boundary layer (hull length). Using the equivalent sandgrain roughness height determined from experiments, a FFG- 7 Oliver Perry class Frigate is predicted to experience a 23 % increase in total resistance at cruise, if its hull is coated in light <b>calcareous</b> <b>tubeworm</b> fouling. A similarly fouled Very Large Crude Carrier would experience a 34 % increase in total resistance at cruise...|$|E
40|$|A new tubeworm, Palaeotubus sosiensis gen. et sp. nov., is {{described}} from the Permian Pietra di Salomone limestone (Sosio Valley, W Sicily). The new species {{is characterized by}} a thick tube ornamented with slightly flared peristomes and numerous longitudinal keels. The internal structure of the tube was obliterated during diagenesis, which prevents the tube unequivocal systematic attribution. Nevertheless, all preserved morphological characters strongly suggest that the new tube belongs to serpulids. When confirmed by further findings, the positive attribution of this new species to serpulids will imply that it represents the ancestor of the Serpulidae, and the earliest evidence of <b>calcareous</b> <b>tubeworm</b> polychaetes from the Palaeozoic...|$|E
40|$|The uptake of {{anthropogenic}} CO 2 {{emissions by}} oceans has started decreasing pH and carbonate ion concentrations of seawater, {{a process called}} ocean acidification (OA). Occurring over centuries and many generations, evolutionary adaptation and epigenetic transfer will change species responses to OA over time. Trans-generational responses, via genetic selection or trans-generational phenotypic plasticity, differ depending on species and exposure {{time as well as}} differences between individuals such as gender. Males and females differ in reproductive investment and egg producing females may have less energy available for OA stress responses. By crossing eggs and sperm from the <b>calcareous</b> <b>tubeworm</b> Hydroides elegans (Haswell, 1883) raised in ambient (8. 1) and low (7. 8) pH environments, we observed that paternal and maternal low pH experience had opposite and additive effects on offspring. For example, when compared to offspring with both parents from ambient pH, growth rates of offspring of fathers or mothers raised in low pH were higher or lower respectively, but there was no difference when both parents were from low pH. Gender differences may result in different selection pressures for each gender. This may result in overestimates of species tolerance and missed opportunities of potentially insightful comparisons between individuals of the same species...|$|E
40|$|Hydroides Gunnerus, 1768 is {{the largest}} {{and one of the}} {{economically}} most important genera of <b>calcareous</b> <b>tubeworms</b> (Serpulidae, Annelida) that includes a number of notorious fouling and bioinvading species. Although the representatives of the genus are typically found in shallow waters of tropical and subtropical areas worldwide, the species composition of the genus in Australia has never been revised. We conducted the first detailed regional taxonomic revision of Hydroidesspecies based both on the historical collections from Australian museums (Australian Museum, Museum Victoria, South Australian Museum, Western Australian Museum, Queensland Museum, and Museum and Art Gallery of Northern Territory) and newly collected material from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Northern Territory, and Western Australia. In total, 25 species are currently considered valid in Australia, including three new species: H. amri n. sp. from NSW, SA, and Vic (previously referred to as H. cf. brachyacantha), as well as H. glasbyi n. sp. and H. qiui n. sp., both from NT, and two new records of H. furcifera and H. multispinosa for Australia. We have synonymised H. spiratubus with H. albiceps, and H. spiculitubus with H. tambalagamensis in this study. The status of the taxon H. cf. recta remains undecided. An identification key and diagnoses accompanied by original high-quality photographs for all species recorded in Australia are provided. Application of molecular genetics is needed to resolve the status of some problematic species. 99 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Polychaete serpulids are {{globally}} distributed tubeworms {{mostly in}} marine environments from Late Triassic to modern time. These <b>calcareous</b> <b>tubeworms</b> could be rock-forming, reef-building, or a principal fouling organism in harbor and bays. Carbonates of the Paleogene Kalatar Formation in southwest Tarim Basin yield abundant serpulid fossils, which, together with oyster fossils, constitute the characteristic fossil assemblage of the Kalatar Formation. Other common fossils include bivalves, gastropods, ostracods, echinoderms, and bryozoans. Lithologies that yielded serpulid fossils {{are characterized by}} micritic bioclastic limestone, sandy limestone, and shelly limestone, indicating a semi-restricted to open shallow marine environment with medium to low water energy. The research data about serpulids and their fossil materials from China are relatively rare. Based on the studies of fossils taxonomy, community palaeoecology, and fossil taphonomy, this paper analyzed and studied the types, occurrence, distribution, and morphological characteristics of serpulids and their palaeoecological features in the Kalatar Formation. Two serpulid community compositions were recognized in the Kalatar Formation, including a rock-forming Ditrupa community and a cluster-growth Propomatoceros community. The Ditrupa community was distributed in coastal environment of the west Kunlun piedmont, lived on sandy hard substrates with little mud, and rarely occurred in lagoon and tidal settings. The Propomatoceros community occurred in offshore middle carbonate ramp in the piedmont of the south Tianshan Mountains and in offshore shelf in the piedmont of the west Kunlun Mountains. According to the analysis on the host-rock lithologies, preservation and symbionts, it is inferred that serpulids in the Kalatar Formation grew on the oyster shell or other hard substrate, {{and they did not}} form reefs or bioherms...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWith {{large-scale}} {{development of}} offshore wind farms, vertical structures {{are becoming more}} common in open water areas. To examine how vertical structures of different materials may be colonized by epibenthic organisms, an experiment was carried out using steel and concrete pilings constructed to resemble those commonly used in wind farm constructions {{as well as in}} bridges, jetties and oil platforms. The early recruitment and succession of the epibenthic communities were sampled once a month for the first 5 months and then again after 1 year. Further, the fish assemblages associated with the pillars were sampled and compared to natural areas. The main epibenthic species groups, in terms of coverage, differed between the two materials at five out of six sampling occasions. Dominant organisms on steel pillars were the barnacle, the <b>calcareous</b> <b>tubeworm</b> and the tunicate. On the concrete pillars, the hydroid sp. and the tunicates and spp. dominated. However, there was no different in coverage at different heights on the pillars or in biomass and species abundance at different directions (north-east or south-west) 5 months after submergence. Fish showed overall higher abundances and species numbers on the pillars (but no difference between steel and concrete) compared to the surrounding soft bottom habitats but not compared to natural vertical rock walls. Two species were attracted to the pillars, indicating a reef effect; and. The bottom-dwelling gobies, spp., did not show such preferences...|$|E
40|$|Biofouling pests, {{including}} non-indigenous species, {{can have}} significant impacts on anthropogenic activities. This {{is particularly true}} for aquaculture industries, where biofouling communities grow on crop species and infrastructure, potentially reducing revenue and increasing processing and production costs. It is of interest to marine farmers and scientists {{to gain a better}} understanding of the processes facilitating the regional proliferation and spread of biofouling pests. The structure of biofouling communities associated with marine farms in New Zealand’s main mussel growing region, Pelorus Sound, are characterised in this thesis. The patterns of connectivity and gene flow among biofouling populations are also investigated. Images and video footage of biofouling on mussel farms (Perna canaliculus) indicate strong spatial variation in the structure of biofouling communities, with a dominance of known problematic taxa and high wave energy tolerant species, such as the brown alga Undaria pinnatifida and the <b>calcareous</b> <b>tubeworm</b> Pomatoceros sp., near the entrance of Pelorus Sound. Genetic analyses and simple GIS-based modelling of a case study biofouling organism, Didemnum vexillum, revealed genetic differentiation among populations with extreme outcrossing and low levels of connectivity. Genetic analyses also suggest that anthropogenic-assisted dispersal may be vital for connecting certain D. vexillum populations compared to natural spread. The present study illustrates how multidisciplinary research approaches can be used to identify geographical areas that are less prone to biofouling and to inform the management of biofouling pests and invasive species in aquaculture environments...|$|E
40|$|The <b>calcareous</b> <b>tubeworm</b> Spirorbis spirorbis is a wide-spread serpulid {{species in}} the Baltic Sea, where it {{commonly}} grows as an epibiont on brown macroalgae (genus Fucus). It lives within a Mg-calcite shell and could be affected by ocean acidification and temperature rise induced by the predicted future atmospheric CO 2 increase. However, Spirorbis tubes grow in a chemically modified boundary layer around the algae, which may mitigate acidification. In order to investigate how increasing temperature and rising pCO 2 may influence S. spirorbis shell growth we carried out four seasonal experiments in the 'Kiel Outdoor Benthocosms' at elevated pCO 2 and temperature conditions. Compared to laboratory batch culture experiments the benthocosm approach provides a better representation of natural conditions for physical and biological ecosystem parameters, including seasonal variations. We find that growth rates of S. spirorbis are significantly controlled by ontogenetic and seasonal effects. The length of the newly grown tube is inversely related to the initial diameter of the shell. Our study showed no significant difference of the growth rates between ambient atmospheric and elevated (1100 [*]ppm) pCO 2 conditions. No influence of daily average CaCO 3 saturation state on the growth rates of S. spirorbiswas observed. We found, however, net growth of the shells even in temporarily undersaturated bulk solutions, under conditions that concurrently favored selective shell surface dissolution. The results suggest an overall resistance of S. spirorbis growth to acidification levels predicted for the year 2100 in the Baltic Sea. In contrast, S. spirorbis did not survive at mean seasonal temperatures exceeding 24 [*]°C during the summer experiments. In the autumn experiments at ambient pCO 2, the growth rates of juvenile S. spirorbis were higher under elevated temperature conditions. The results reveal that S. spirorbis may prefer moderately warmer conditions during their early life stages but will suffer from an excessive temperature increase and from increasing shell corrosion {{as a consequence of}} progressing ocean acidification...|$|E
