40|$|The two {{authors are}} members of punk rock trio the Eruptörs. Both also teach in higher {{education}} – one in popular music, {{and the other in}} management and marketing.

The paper provides cross-disciplinary insights into internal and external cultures of the Eruptörs.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} the <b>creativities</b> of protest as phenomena of rhythm. Theoretically, I propose translating Cornelius Castoriadis’ regional ontology of selves into a problematique of rhythms. I argue for an artisanal way {{of using the}} Castoriadian conceptual pair autonomy/heteronomy, focusing on moments rather than on entire societies. Furthermore, I introduce a notion of concentricity of rhythms {{that allows us to}} capture the polyrhythmic complexity of protest situations, which become psychic situations, involving presences, as well as absences, half-absences or spectres. Thus, I aim to contribute to a psychosocial understanding of the <b>creativities</b> of collective action. Finally, I analyse the concentricities of rhythm in a site of protest in Romania. The organisation Alburnus Maior protests against the project of a gold mine based on cyanide technologies. It performs a complicated political choreography, centred on the symbolic pair gold-death. Listening to the rhythms of the square enables a reflection on autonomy, recognition and post-oedipal politics...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reflects}} on current conditions in South Africa, by considering {{local and international}} circumstances with regard to intellectual creations. A literature study was done, based on a bibliography which was chosen {{as a result of}} experiences whilst attempting to implement business ideas. The paper argues that the current system of intellectual property rights is not sufficient to sustain the economy in the long term because <b>creativities</b> are not remunerated sufficiently close to sources to motivate continuous innovations. The argument was formulated by looking at the effects of theology, industrial psychology, law and management accounting on intellectual property rights. The preliminary finding was that currently the system takes advantage of individuals for the benefit of group members, by developing <b>creativities,</b> without sufficient compensation to creative individuals. Because of the problems identified a proposal is made by the paper for a trans-disciplinary research project to culminate at recording of and remuneration for intellectual creation...|$|R
