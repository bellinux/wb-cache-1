5|$|Starting in 1738, {{towns in}} New Jersey began issuing liquor {{licenses}} to tavern keepers. Before federal Prohibition in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, {{the regulation of}} alcoholic beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic beverages. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic Beverage <b>Control</b> <b>Law,</b> which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The law also established a three-tier alcohol distribution system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{repeal of}} Prohibition and {{the passage of}} the Alcoholic Beverage <b>Control</b> <b>Law,</b> the ABC issued {{regulations}} that prohibited bars and liquor stores from selling alcohol to a person under 21, which was considered the age of majority at that time. In 1939, it became a criminal offense to sell alcohol to a person under 21, and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment. The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957, possibly in response to young New Jerseyans traveling to New York, where the drinking age was 18, and returning home with liquor. For many years laws against underage drinking and the serving of alcohol to minors did not apply on private property, though an adult who supplied a substantial amount of liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor Furthermore, arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s.|$|E

The physical part includes unmanned quadcopters equipped with multiple sensors.

To control the quadcopter's horizontal-plane motions, we propose a controller that combines pollutant dynamics with quadcopter physics. To control the quadcopter's vertical motions, we adopt an anti-windup proportional-integral (PI) controller.

40|$|Model-based {{control of}} continuous-time, multivariable, {{nonlinear}} processes with input constraints and time delays is studied. Differential geometric <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> are derived for stable processes, whether their delay-free part is minimum- or non-minimum-phase. They are obtained by requesting an approximately linear, input-output response and exploiting {{the connections between}} model-predictive control and input-output linearization. Conditions under which the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable are given. The <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> ensure asymptotic tracking of the measured output {{in the presence of}} constant model errors and disturbances as long as nominal, closed-loop, asymptotic stability is preserved. There are no limitations on the order, relative order, or number of unstable modes of the zero dynamics of the processes to which the <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> are applicable. ^ To derive <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> that can perform optimally in the presence of input constraints, the connections between model-predictive control and input-output linearization are exploited. The continuous-time <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> are solutions of constrained optimization problems that are solved on-line. They minimize the error between controlled outputs and their reference trajectories, subject to the input constraints. In the absence of input constraints the <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> do not induce a linear, closed-loop, output response when process zero dynamics are unstable. The nonlinearity of the resulting process output response is the price of ensuring closed-loop stability for non-minimum-phase processes. ^ The application and performance of the <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> are illustrated using numerical simulation of several chemical reactors that exhibit non-minimum-phase behavior. The <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> are also implemented in real-time on a pilot-scale, liquid-level process with non-minimum-phase behavior. Real-time implementation issues, and advantages and disadvantages of the <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> are discussed. ...|$|R

The federal crime-fighting apparatus was also modernised, while a Foreign Tax Act was passed which limited the possibility of tax evasion.

25|$|Various {{measures}} {{were introduced to}} improve environmental conditions and to safeguard the environment, the Federal Emission <b>Control</b> <b>Law</b> established the basis for taking of legal action against those responsible for excessive noise and air pollution, the Works’ Constitution Act and Personnel Representation Act strengthened the position of individual employees in offices and factories, and the Works’ Safety Law required firms to employ safety specialists and doctors. An amendment to the Labour Management Act (1971) granted workers co-determination {{on the shop floor}} while the new Factory Management Law (1972) extended co-determination at the factory level. This Act acknowledged {{for the first time the}} presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils. A law was passed in 1974 allowing for worker representation on the boards of large firms, although this change was not enacted until 1976, after alterations were made. In 1974, redundancy allowances in cases of bankruptcies were introduced. The Federal Law on Personnel Representation, which came into force in April 1974, gave increased co-management rights to those employed in factories and offices in the public sector. The staff councils were given an increased say in social and personal matters, together with a wider operational basis for their activities in connection with day release and training opportunities. The arrangements governing cooperation between the staff councils and the trade union were also improved. Young workers were given increased rights of representation, while foreign workers received voting rights and thus achieved equality in this respect with German employees.|$|E
