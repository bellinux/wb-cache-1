5|$|The vast size, {{and wide}} range of altitudes, {{contribute}} to Argentina's diverse climate. Consequently, {{there is a wide}} variety of biomes in the country, including subtropical rain forests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the latitudinal extent of the country, determine the different varieties in the main climate types. Despite the diversity of biomes, about two-thirds of Argentina is arid or semi-arid. Argentina is best divided into six distinct regions reflecting the climatic conditions of the country as a whole. From north to south, these regions are Northwest, Chaco, Northeast, Cuyo/Monte, Pampas, and Patagonia. Each <b>climatic</b> <b>region</b> has distinctive types of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The vast size, {{and wide}} range of altitudes, {{contribute}} to Argentina's diverse climate. Argentina possesses {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions ranging from subtropical in the north to subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, which features a mild and humid climate. Consequently, there is a wide variety of biomes in the country, including subtropical rain forests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south. However, despite the diversity of biomes, about two-thirds of Argentina is arid or semi-arid. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold, all determined by the expanse across latitude, range in altitude, and relief features. Argentina is best divided into six distinct regions reflecting the climatic conditions of the country as a whole.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Very {{little is}} known about how water use differs in various <b>climatic</b> <b>regions.</b> Many studies have been done on the topic of water {{resources}} and climate change, but they mainly emphasize on how the changing climate affects water quality. When water quality is decreasing, the quantity of water supply will be affected as well. Balancing water supply and water demand is very critical for sustainable development, because the wellbeing of human lives and sensitive ecosystems depend on reliable water sources. This paper explores the pattern of domestic per-capita water use in various <b>climatic</b> <b>regions</b> and the influence of climatic conditions, demographic variations, and demand management policies on water use. My research focuses on nine <b>climatic</b> <b>regions</b> across the U. S. I focus my research around the following questions: 1) how does per-capita domestic water use vary across various <b>climatic</b> <b>regions,</b> 2) how do the various water demand management policies vary across <b>climatic</b> <b>regions,</b> and 3) how do climatic conditions, demographic factors, and water demand management policies relate to domestic per-capita water use...|$|R

500|$|... 3) East of the Thar Desert, the Punjab-Haryana-Kathiawar region {{experiences}} a tropical and sub-tropical steppe climate. Haryana's climate resembles other {{states of the}} northern plains: extreme summer heat of up to 50°C and winter cold as low as 1°C. May and June are hottest; December and January are coldest. Rainfall is varied, with the Shivalik Hills region being the wettest and the Aravali Hills region being the driest. About 80% of the rainfall occurs in the monsoon season of July–September, which can cause flooding. The Punjabi climate is also governed by extremes of hot and cold. Areas near the Himalayan foothills receive heavy rainfall whereas those eloigned from them are hot and dry. Punjab's three-season climate sees summer months that span from mid-April {{to the end of}} June. Temperatures typically range from–2°C to 40°C, but can reach 47°C (117°F) in summer and −4°C in winter. In this zone, a transitional <b>climatic</b> <b>region</b> separating tropical desert from humid sub-tropical savanna and forests, experiences temperatures that are less extreme than those of the desert. Average annual rainfall is , but is very unreliable; as in {{much of the rest of}} India, the southwest monsoon accounts for most precipitation. Daily summer temperature maxima rise to around this results in natural vegetation typically comprising short, coarse grasses.|$|E

2500|$|The {{surrounding}} Great Lakes greatly {{influence the}} <b>climatic</b> <b>region</b> of southern Ontario. During {{the fall and}} winter months, heat stored from the lakes is released, moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes. This gives some parts of southern Ontario milder winters than mid-continental areas at lower latitudes. Parts of Southwestern Ontario (generally south of a line from Sarnia-Toronto) have a moderate humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa), {{similar to that of the}} inland Mid-Atlantic states and the Great Lakes portion of the Midwestern United States. The region has warm to hot, humid summers and cold winters. Annual precipitation ranges from [...] and is well distributed throughout the year. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes, making for abundant snow in some areas. In December 2010, the snowbelt set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within 48 hours. The next <b>climatic</b> <b>region</b> is Central and Eastern Ontario which has a moderate humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb). This region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder, longer winters, ample snowfall (even in regions not directly in the snowbelts) and annual precipitation similar to the rest of Southern Ontario.|$|E
40|$|Abstract.

40|$|To {{predict the}} effects of future global warming on water resources, {{we need to know}} how climate effects lakes. This {{knowledge}} can be gained (1) by comparative studies of similarly-sized lakes located in different <b>climatic</b> <b>regions</b> and (2) by use of simulation models that predict lake characteristics given various climatic conditions. Model results can be validated by comparisons with measurements in different <b>climatic</b> <b>regions</b> or through comparison with the paleorecord from a specific lake. The paleorecord approach can be most powerful because the last 14, 000 years encompass a wide range of climate conditions, including much. lower and higher temperatures, changes in season, and changes in runoff. Furthermore, it avoids the difference in topography and water chemistry that often characterizes different <b>climatic</b> <b>regions.</b> Environmental Research Laboratory, US Environmental Protection Agenc...|$|R
