General Đổ Cao Trí, the {{commander}} of the ARVN I Corps, who had repressed the Buddhists in Huế, privately told <b>Cẩn</b> <b>that</b> the junta would allow him safe passage out of Vietnam. On 5 November, Cẩn sought refuge at the US consulate with a suitcase crammed with US currency. Trí was then told that Cẩn was not safe in Huế and that he was to send Cẩn to Saigon, immediately for his own protection. Trí would only promise safe passage in an American plane to Saigon, where embassy officials would meet Cẩn. On the journey to the capital, Cẩn was accompanied by four Americans: a vice-consul, two military policemen and a lieutenant colonel. He had intended to seek asylum in Japan.|$|E

25|$|Prey {{is often}} flushed out of tall grass by the birds stomping on the {{surrounding}} vegetation. It also waits near fires, eating anything it <b>can</b> <b>that</b> {{is trying to}} escape. They can either catch prey by chasing it and striking with the bill and swallowing (usually with small prey), or stamping on prey until it is rendered stunned or unconscious enough to swallow. Larger or dangerous prey, such as venomous snakes, are instead stunned or killed by the bird jumping onto their backs, at which point {{they will try to}} snap their necks or backs. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, the secretary birds will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified. Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds' considerable gape. Occasionally, like other raptors, they will tear apart prey with their feet before consuming it.|$|E

500|$|The episode's cold open {{was filmed}} {{in a water}} tank, using a replica P-51 Mustang plane which had been {{designed}} by the art director. Bowman also needed to direct {{a scene in which}} Gillian Anderson would react to a memory of playing with her sister as a child; the scene involved digitally compositing the children playing into Anderson's footage. Bowman asked Anderson to act towards a tree as though it were her sister, later telling her [...] "I'm going to tell everybody I <b>can</b> <b>that</b> you just did that great reaction to a tree". Bowman also reshot the episode's ending, as originally Duchovny and Lea were to walk past the camera and continue off-screen.

500|$|The {{standard}} way {{of measuring}} rainfall or snowfall {{is the standard}} rain gauge, {{which can be found}} in 100-mm (4-in) plastic and 200-mm (8-in) metal varieties. The inner cylinder is filled by [...] of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to [...] resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate [...] markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty. Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge. For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a <b>can</b> <b>that</b> is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with. Any of the above rain gauges can be made at home, with enough know-how.|$|E

500|$|Several global {{events of}} the early 2010s {{included}} the rise of hacktivist groups such as Anonymous and LulzSec; large scale protest movements, including the Arab Spring, Occupy movement, and Quebec student protests; the crypto-anarchist activity {{on the part of}} Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson; and the various information leaks to WikiLeaks by Chelsea Manning, the Stratfor email leak by Anonymous and Jeremy Hammond, and the global surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden. The rapid succession of these events led some media commentators to insist that Anarky's relevance as a character had dramatically increased, and recommended that the character receive a higher profile in media. This sentiment led the creative team that developed Batman: Arkham Origins to include Anarky in the game. Describing Anarky's anti-government and anti-corporate agenda, Holmes acknowledged the relevance of anarchism in the contemporary protest movements of the time as a factor in the choice to include the character in the game, and to update his appearance to that of a street protester with a gang resembling a social movement. Holmes stressed in one interview, [...] "In the real world, this is Anarky's moment. Right now. Today." [...] Even as early as 2005, James Peaty recommended that Anarky should be included in more publications {{in the midst of the}} ongoing War on Terror, stating [...] "Anarky is a terrorist!

500|$|The {{first single}} {{released}} from the album was [...] "The Statue Got Me High". The titular lyrics originally started out as the dummy line [...] "The Apple of My Eye". However, Linnell soon conceived the line that would become the title, and he was amused at the juxtaposition of a statue—something [...] "utterly immobile and … in the past"—completely [...] "blowing somebody's mind". [...] "Spider" [...] is an eclectic song that was made when Flansburgh and Linnell were experimenting with a sampler. Linnell provided {{almost all of the}} voices, save for the line, [...] "must stop!" [...] which was spoken by Flansburgh. Flansburgh himself was responsible for the bongos, horns, and various sound effects. The second single from the album, [...] "The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)", was spawned from a jam session of The Tokens song [...] "The Lion Sleeps Tonight". The song was also originally intended to simply be titled [...] "The Guitar". Due to the legal ramifications of including the [...] "Lion Sleeps Tonight" [...] motif, Elektra required the band to add the name of the original song to the title. The song features Laura Cantrell on the chorus. [...] "Dinner Bell" [...] references Ivan Pavlov, and his experimentations in classical conditioning by using a dinner bell to cause his dog to salivate. According to Rolling Stone, [...] "Narrow Your Eyes" [...] is a [...] "touching breakup song that pays vocal tribute to The Beatles and The Four Seasons". Spin magazine called the song [...] "the most direct lyrically and simplest musically." [...] The opening line of [...] "See the Constellation"—described by Rolling Stone as [...] "a psychedelic/New Wave potion"—references railroad tracks and was inspired by a promotional photo of an Elektra recording artist who was resting on tracks.
