50|$|The first railways, {{such as the}} {{pioneering}} Liverpool and Manchester Railway of 1830, used {{a version of the}} tramways buffer and <b>chain</b> <b>coupling,</b> termed a screw-coupling. Vehicles are coupled by hand using a hook and links with a turnbuckle-like device that draws the vehicles together. Vehicles have buffers, one at each corner on the ends, which are pulled together and compressed by the coupling device. With no continuous brake across the entire train, the whole train was reliant on the braking capacity of the locomotive, and train lengths were restricted.|$|E
50|$|For European freight, the TSIs mandate buffer {{and chain}} {{couplings}} at specified heights. The European system {{links to the}} former Soviet Russian-gauge network, where SA3 automatic couplers are used. Some research has been undertaken to choose an automatic freight coupler compatible with the Soviet one, but owing to widescale replacement cost, no action has been taken to implement the conversion, except for some trial installations. In many heavy-haul applications, such as for coal and iron ore, either US AAR-type couplers or Soviet SA-3 couplers are used. Conversion is made harder to justify because the existing buffer and <b>chain</b> <b>coupling</b> is almost universal.|$|E

On the other hand, a Markov <b>chain</b> <b>coupling</b> argument similar to the above, but now without invoking the Harris inequality, shows that conditional pointwise domination, in fact, implies stochastically domination. Stochastic domination is equivalent to saying that [...] for all increasing ƒ, thus we get a proof of the Holley inequality.

50|$|British locomotive-hauled {{passenger}} carriages adopted a dual coupling {{system in the}} 1950s.

No chain is provided on dual-coupled vehicles, since the chain on the other vehicle can be used when the knuckle coupler {{is out of the}} way (down).

40|$|Using series {{expansion}} {{based on the}} flow equation method we study the zero temperature properties of the spin- 1 / 2 planar pyrochlore antiferromagnet {{in the limit of}} strong diagonal coupling. Starting from the limit of decoupled crossed dimers we analyze the evolution of the ground state energy and the elementary triplet excitations in terms of two coupling constants describing the inter dimer exchange. In the limit of weakly coupled spin- 1 / 2 chains we find that the fully frustrated inter <b>chain</b> <b>coupling</b> is critical, forcing a dimer phase which adiabatically connects to the state of isolated dimers. This result is consistent with findings by O. Starykh, A. Furusaki and L. Balents (Phys. Rev.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the spin excitation spectrum of charge ordered (CO) NaV 2 O 5 is presented. We discuss several different exchange models which may be relevant for this compound, namely in- line and zig-zag chain models with weak as well as strong inter- <b>chain</b> <b>coupling</b> and also a ladder model and a CO/MV (mixed valent) model. We put special emphasis {{on the importance of}} large additional exchange across the diagonals of V- ladders and the presence of exchange anisotropies on the excitation spectrum. It is shown that the observed splitting of transverse dispersion branches may both be interpreted as anisotropy effect as well as acoustic- optic mode splitting in the weakly coupled chain models. In addition we calculate the field dependence of excitation modes in these models. Furthermore we show that for strong inter- <b>chain</b> <b>coupling,</b> as suggested by recent LDA+U results, an additional high energy optical excitation appears and the spin gap is determined by anisotropies. The most promising CO/MV model predicts a spin wave dispersion perpendicular to the chains which agrees very well with recent results obtained by inelastic neutron scattering.

Inspired by the recent development of characterization of symmetry protected topological states, of which the Haldane phase of spin- 1 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain is a preeminent example, we provide direct evidence that the quasi-one-dimensional Haldane phase is indeed a non-trivial symmetry protected topological state.
