25|$|The {{organism}} {{is intrinsically}} resistant to gentamicin and <b>colistin,</b> and {{this fact is}} helpful {{in the identification of}} the organism. Kanamycin is used to kill B.pseudomallei in the laboratory, but the concentrations used are much higher than those achievable in humans.|$|E
25|$|As {{fluoroquinolone}} {{is one of}} the few antibiotics widely {{effective against}} P. aeruginosa, in some hospitals, its use is severely restricted to avoid the development of resistant strains. On the rare occasions where infection is superficial and limited (for example, ear infections or nail infections), topical gentamicin or <b>colistin</b> may be used.|$|E
2500|$|Cultures {{typically}} become {{positive in}} 24 to 48 hours (this rapid growth rate differentiates the organism from B. mallei, which typically takes {{a minimum of}} 72 hours to grow). Colonies are wrinkled, have a metallic appearance, and possess an earthy odour. [...] On Gram staining, the organism is a Gram-negative rod with a characteristic [...] "safety pin" [...] appearance (bipolar staining). [...] On sensitivity testing, the organism appears highly resistant (it is innately resistant to {{a large number of}} antibiotics including <b>colistin</b> and gentamicin) and that again differentiates it from B. mallei, which is in contrast, exquisitely sensitive to a large number of antibiotics. [...] For environmental specimens only, differentiation from the nonpathogenic B. thailandensis using an arabinose test is necessary (B. thailandensis is never isolated from clinical specimens). The laboratory identification of B. pseudomallei has been described in the literature.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{people with}} CF are {{on one or}} more {{antibiotics}} at all times, even when healthy, to prophylactically suppress infection. Antibiotics are absolutely necessary whenever pneumonia is suspected or a noticeable decline in lung function is seen, and are usually chosen {{based on the results}} of a sputum analysis and the person's past response. This prolonged therapy often necessitates hospitalization and insertion of a more permanent IV such as a peripherally inserted central catheter [...] or Port-a-Cath. Inhaled therapy with antibiotics such as tobramycin, <b>colistin,</b> and aztreonam is often given for months at a time to improve lung function by impeding the growth of colonized bacteria. Inhaled antibiotic therapy helps lung function by fighting infection, but also has significant drawbacks such as development of antibiotic resistance, tinnitus, and changes in the voice. Inhaled levofloxacin may be used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis who are infected.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{forms of}} <b>colistin</b> are {{available}} commercially: <b>colistin</b> sulfate and colistimethate sodium (<b>colistin</b> methanesulfonate sodium, <b>colistin</b> sulfomethate sodium). <b>Colistin</b> sulfate is cationic; colistimethate sodium is anionic. <b>Colistin</b> sulfate is stable, but colistimethate sodium is readily hydrolysed {{to a variety}} of methanesulfonated derivatives. <b>Colistin</b> sulfate and colistimethate sodium are eliminated from the body by different routes. With respect to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, colistimethate is the inactive prodrug of <b>colistin.</b> The two drugs are not interchangeable [...]|$|E
50|$|<b>Colistin,</b> {{also known}} as {{polymyxin}} E, is an antibiotic produced by certain strains of the bacteria Paenibacillus polymyxa. <b>Colistin</b> {{is a mixture of}} the cyclic polypeptides <b>colistin</b> A and B and belongs to the class of polypeptide antibiotics known as polymyxins. <b>Colistin</b> is effective against most Gram-negative bacilli.|$|E
50|$|No {{clinically}} useful {{absorption of}} <b>colistin</b> {{occurs in the}} gastrointestinal tract. For systemic infection, <b>colistin</b> must, therefore, be given by injection.Colistimethate is eliminated by the kidneys, but <b>colistin</b> {{is supposed to be}} eliminated by non-renal mechanism(s) that are as yet not characterised.|$|E
5000|$|China {{was using}} <b>colistin</b> as growth {{promoter}} ( [...] subtherapeutic antibiotic use [...] )but after {{the emergence of}} <b>colistin</b> resistance pig ( [...] pig with mcr-1 gene [...] ) inintensive farm near Shanghai year 2013 then the spread of mcr-1 <b>colistin</b> resistant gene, 26 july 2016 China started to ban colistinas growth promoter.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Colistin</b> sulfate {{may be used}} {{to treat}} {{intestinal}} infections, or to suppress colonic flora. <b>Colistin</b> sulfate is also used as topical creams, powders, and otic solutions.|$|E
50|$|Resistance to <b>colistin</b> is rare, but {{has been}} described. , no {{agreement}} exists about how to look for <b>colistin</b> resistance. The :fr:Société Française de Microbiologie uses a cut-off of 2 mg/l, whereas the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy sets a cutoff of 4 mg/l or less as sensitive, and 8 mg/ml or more as resistant. No standards for measuring <b>colistin</b> sensitivity are given in the US.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Colistin</b> sulfate and {{colistimethate sodium}} may both be given intravenously, but the dosing is complicated. The very {{different}} labeling of the parenteral products of <b>colistin</b> methanesulfonate {{in different parts}} of the world was first revealed by Li et al. Colistimethate sodium manufactured by Xellia (Colomycin injection) is prescribed in international units, but colistimethate sodium manufactured by Parkdale Pharmaceuticals (Coly-Mycin M Parenteral) is prescribed in milligrams of <b>colistin</b> base: ...|$|E
5000|$|Because <b>colistin</b> was {{introduced}} into clinical practice over 50 years ago, {{it was never}} subject to the regulations that modern drugs are subject to, and therefore there is no standardised dosing of <b>colistin</b> and no detailed trials on pharmacology or pharmacokinetics: The optimal dosing of <b>colistin</b> for most infections is therefore unknown. Colomycin has a recommended intravenous dose of 1 to 2 million units three times daily for patients weighing 60 kg or more with normal renal function. Coly-Mycin has a recommended dose of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg <b>colistin</b> base a day, which is equivalent to 6 to 12 mg/kg colistimethate sodium per day. For a 60 kg man, therefore, the recommended dose for Colomycin is 240 to 480 mg of colistimethate sodium, yet the recommended dose for Coly-Mycin is 360 to 720 mg of colistimethate sodium. Likewise, the recommended [...] "maximum" [...] dose for each preparation is different (480 mg for Colomycin and 720 mg for Coly-Mycin). Each country has different generic preparations of <b>colistin,</b> and the recommended dose depends on the manufacturer. This complete absence of any regulation or standardisation of dose makes intravenous <b>colistin</b> dosing difficult for any physician.|$|E
50|$|<b>Colistin</b> is a decades-old {{drug that}} {{fell out of}} favor in human {{medicine}} due to its kidney toxicity.

5000|$|Proteose peptone, horse plasma, {{haemoglobin}} provide nutrients for {{the growth}} of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. Phosphate buffers the medium. The selective supplement added contains the antibiotics vancomycin, <b>colistin,</b> nystatin and trimethoprim, to suppress the accompanying flora. Vancomycin is inhibitory for gram-positive bacteria. <b>Colistin</b> inhibits gram negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas species, while Proteus is inhibited by trimethoprim. The combination of trimethoprim and <b>colistin</b> acts synergistically against gram-negative bacilli. Starch neutralizes the toxic metabolites produced by Neisseria [...] The yeast autolysate supplement fulfils the CO2 requirements needed to enhance Neisseria growth. Yeast contains oxaloacetic acid which is metabolized by gonococci to produce sufficient CO2 for growth of capnophilic gonococci. Also, presence of yeast autolysate reduces the lag phase of growth of Neisseria , thus enhancing both size and number of colonies. The specimen can be directly streaked on the medium to obtain maximum isolation.|$|E

50|$|Chinchillas may {{be treated}} with chloramphenicol, neomycin, or {{spectinomycin}} for digestive problems. Sulfonamides dissolved in drinking water may be used. <b>Colistin</b> {{can be an effective}} antibiotic.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Colistin</b> {{has been}} {{effective}} in treating infections caused by Pseudomonas, Escherichia, and Klebsiella species. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms: ...|$|E
50|$|Because most {{infections are}} now {{resistant}} to multiple drugs, determining what susceptibilities the particular strain has {{is necessary to}} for treatment to be successful. Traditionally, infections were treated with imipenem or meropenem, but a steady rise in carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii has been noted. Consequently, treatment methods often fall back on polymyxins, particularly <b>colistin.</b> <b>Colistin</b> is considered a drug of last resort because it often causes kidney damage, among other side effects. Prevention methods in hospitals focus on increased hand-washing and more diligent sterilization procedures.|$|E
50|$|The mobilized <b>colistin</b> {{resistance}} (mcr-1) gene confers plasmid-mediated {{resistance to}} <b>colistin,</b> {{one of a}} number of last-resort antibiotics for treating gram negative infections. mcr-1 is capable of horizontal transfer between different strains of a bacterial species and after discovery in November 2015 in E. coli (strain SHP45) from a pig in China it has been found in Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. , it has been detected in more than 30 countries on 5 continents in less than a year.|$|E
5000|$|For example, <b>colistin</b> in {{combination}} with other drugs are used to attack P. aeruginosa biofilm infection in lungs of CF patients. [...] Biofilms have a low oxygen environment below the surface where bacteria are metabolically inactive and <b>colistin</b> is highly effective in this environment. However, P. aeruginosa reside in the top layers of the biofilm, where they remain metabolically active. [...] This is because surviving tolerant cells migrate {{to the top of the}} biofilm via pili motility and form new aggregates via quorum sensing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of <b>colistin</b> {{requires the}} use of three amino acids threonine, valine, and 2,4-diaminobutryic acid. It is important to synthesis the linear form of <b>colistin</b> before cycliziation. Elongation of non ribosomal peptide biosynthesis begins by a loading module and then the addition of each subsequent amino acid. The subsequent amino acids are added {{with the help of an}} adenylation domain (A), a peptidyl carrier protein domain (PCP), an epimerization domain (E), and a condensation domain (C). Cyclization is accomplished by utilizing a thioesterase. The first step is to have a loading domain, 6-methyl-heptanoic acid, associate with the A and PCP domains. Now with a C, A, and PCP domain that is associated with 2,4-diaminobutryic acid. This continues with each amino acid until the linear peptide chain is completed. The last module will have a thioesterase to complete the cyclization and form the product <b>colistin.</b>|$|E
50|$|E. meningoseptica grows well {{on blood}} agar and {{chocolate}} agar. Colonies are very pale yellow {{and may not}} be easily evident at 24 hours. Strains growing better at 40 °C are mostly associated with invasive meningitis. There is often a greyish discoloration around the colonies on blood agar due to proteases and gelatinase. E. meningoseptica grow poorly on MacConkey agar and are considered glucose oxidizers. They do not grow on CNA (<b>colistin</b> nalidixic acid) agar because, although they are resistant to <b>colistin,</b> they are susceptible to quinolones such as nalidixic acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Colistin</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} in Japan in 1949 from a flask of fermenting Bacillus polymyxa var. colistinus by the Japanese scientist Koyama and became available {{for clinical use}} in 1959.|$|E
50|$|The {{additional}} or sequential use {{of other}} nephrotoxic drugs like aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, capreomycin, <b>colistin,</b> polymyxin B, vancomycin, foscarnet, or cisplatin should be closely monitored, or whenever possible completely avoided.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} {{resistant}} {{to a variety}} of antibiotics including penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones, and aminoglycosides. Ampicillin and carbenicillin, which are penicillins, are an exception. It is variably susceptible to tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and <b>colistin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Use of <b>colistin</b> {{to treat}} Acinetobacter baumannii infections {{has led to}} the {{development}} of resistant bacterial strains. which have also developed resistance to antimicrobial compounds LL-37 and lysozyme, produced by the human immune system.|$|E
50|$|To {{increase}} {{recovery of}} GBS, swabs {{can also be}} inoculated previously into a selective enrichment broth medium, such as the Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with gentamicin or <b>colistin</b> and nalidixic acid and incubated for 18-24 hours at 35-37 °C.|$|E
50|$|However, some M. morganii strains are {{resistant}} to penicillin, ampicillin/sublactam, oxacillin, first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, lincosamides, fosfomycin, <b>colistin,</b> and polymyxin B.
