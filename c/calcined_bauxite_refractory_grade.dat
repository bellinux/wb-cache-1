The problem gets exacerbated during wet weather. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) estimates that about 70 % of wet pavement crashes {{can be prevented}} or minimized by improving pavement friction. High Friction Surface Treatment (HFST), a specially-designed thin surface application of hard aggregates and thermosetting resins like epoxy, has been proven {{to be an effective}} method to increase road surface friction. <b>Calcined</b> <b>bauxite</b> has been predominantly used in the United States as the hard aggregate in combination with an epoxy binder for HFST.

Pull-off testing was also conducted to examine the bonding between the proposed HFST systems and the substrate surface. Field friction test data was utilized to evaluate the long-term friction performances of pavement preservation treatments, including chip seal, microsurfacing, UBWC, and diamond grinding.

To identify the causes of degradation in different reactor linings, a coupling diagram made up of three poles is established: namely, slag Impregnation (I), Thermomechanics (TM) and Phase transformations (P). The variation of the microstructure and the gradient of the chemical composition resulting from the (I-P) coupling are characterized by microprobe analyses; a natural impregnation tracer is identified. The (I-T) coupling is studied by modeling the refractory lining behavior subjected to a cyclic thermal loading {{within the framework of}} the mechanics of porous continua. Parameters governing the location and amplitude of the maximum pore pressure are obtained and their influences are studied. The analysis of the (TM) pole leads to the identification of a thermo-elasto-viscoplastic model for bauxite in various states of slag impregnation.

The chromite deposits are hosted by dunite and harzburgite, spatially associated with feldspatic rocks (gabbro dikes and/or sills, troctolites and/or anorthosites) in close proximity to gabbroic cumulates {{at the base of the}} plutonic crust. The texture observed in the chromite deposits is predominantly massive, although fine disseminated, nodular and brecciated textures are also present. The interstitial silicate matrix of the chromitite consists principally of olivine and to a lesser extent pyroxenes and plagioclase. Often these silicates are altered to other secondary minerals such as serpentine, chlorite, magnetite and uvarovite-type garnet.

The chromite compositions are noticeably different from those in layered igneous intrusions of the Bushveld-Stillwater type. The existence of original highly calcic plagioclase, FeAl-rich chromite, and magmatic amphibole is consistent with derivation from a parental magma of hydrous tholeiitic composition that was most likely generated in a supra-subduction zone arc setting. In terms of mineralogy and field relations, the Sittampundi chromitites are remarkably similar to anorthosite-hosted chromitites in the Neoarchean Fiskensset anorthositic complex, Greenland. We propose that the Sittampundi chromitites formed by partial melting of unusually aluminous harzburgite in a hydrated mantle wedge above a subduction zone. This melting process produced hydrous, aluminous basalt, which fractionated at depth to give rise to a variety of high-alumina basalt compositions from which the anorthositic complex with its cumulate chromite-rich and amphibole-rich layers formed within the magma chamber of a supra-subduction zone arc.

The existence of undesirable impurities in the beta-SiAlON crystal structure because of the use of impure Si 3 N 4 powders {{has been shown to be}} tolerable by TEM microstructural analysis. Mechanical properties are in general evaluated by Vickers indentation method. Wear behaviour of the cost effective SiAlONs were compared with commercially available ceramic materials which are commonly being used in wear applications. Initially the use of such powders to produce materials for engineering applications proved challenging, however, satisfactory results have been obtained by the optimization of the initial chemical composition and process parameters...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} varieties of Si 3 N 4 powders {{were used to}} prepare SiAlON ceramics. 100 % beta-Si 3 N 4 was used from <b>refractory</b> <b>grade</b> powders (B 1) and another purer 98 % alpha-Si 3 N 4 (50 A) powder was used to prepare the SiAlON samples. Since SiC + SiAlON composites reportedly perform better, batches were prepared with 15 % SiC addition to the refractory powders (B 1) and 17. 5 % SiC {{was added to the}} other SiAlON composition (50 A). The samples were gas pressure sintered at 1840 degrees C and at 22 bar with 1 h dwelling time. Thereby, we could achieve 97 - 98 % theoretical density. The hardness was recorded 14 - 17 GPa while fracture toughness varied from 4. 3 to 5 MPa m(1 / 2). Fretting experiments showed initial running-in period of 300 cycles for all the tribo-couples. After which, the steady state coefficient of frictions (COF) were achieved. Steel ball of 10 mm diameter, fretting against 50 A composition, showed 0. 6 average steady state COF while the same composition while fretting against alumina ball of the same diameter, showed 0. 57 average steady state COF. Results have been compared with SiAlON composition derived from refractory powder (B 1) and found that the 50 A composition performs better under identical test conditions. Moreover, cytocompatibility study also suggests that the investigated 50 A composition can be used as substrate to support cell adhesion and proliferation of L 929 mouse fibroblast cell lines whereas B 1 composition derived from refractory powders are toxic in nature...|$|R
