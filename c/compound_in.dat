5000|$|Self-lubricating composites: Solid {{lubricants}} such as PTFE, graphite, MoS2 {{and some}} other anti-friction and anti-wear additives are often <b>compounded</b> <b>in</b> polymers and all kind of sintered materials. MoS2, for example, is <b>compounded</b> <b>in</b> materials for sleeve bearings, elastomer O-rings, carbon brushes, etc. Solid lubricants are <b>compounded</b> <b>in</b> plastics to form a [...] "self-lubricating" [...] or [...] "internally lubricated" [...] thermoplastic composite. For example, PTFE particles <b>compounded</b> <b>in</b> the plastic form a PTFE film over the mating surface, resulting in a reduction of friction and wear. MoS2 <b>compounded</b> <b>in</b> nylon reduces wear, friction and stick-slip. Furthermore, it acts as a nucleating agent effecting in a very fine crystalline structure. The primary use of graphite lubricated thermoplastics is in applications operating in aqueous environments.|$|R

5|$|In pharmacology, {{ionization}} of {{a compound}} alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as solubility and lipophilicity, logp).

40|$|A UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS {{method for}} {{analyzing}} the constituents in rat plasma after oral administration of Yin Chen Hao Tang (YCHT), a traditional Chinese medical formula, has been established. The UPLC/MS fingerprints {{of the samples}} were established first in vitro and in vivo, with 45 <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> YCHT and 21 <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> rat plasma after oral administration of YCHT were detected. Of the 45 detected <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> vitro, 30 were identified, {{and all of the}} 21 <b>compounds</b> detected <b>in</b> rat plasma were identified either by comparing the retention time and mass spectrometry data with that of reference compounds or by mass spectrometry analysis and retrieving the reference literatures.

5|$|A <b>compound</b> <b>in</b> {{the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 has the {{potential}} to be a new and powerful antibiotic.

It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the <b>compound</b> <b>in</b> sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E
