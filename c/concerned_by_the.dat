He decided to invade and occupy Midway Atoll, which he was sure would draw out the American carriers to defend it. The Japanese codenamed the Midway invasion Operation MI. Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese plan by breaking its JN-25 code and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.|$|E
5|$|Flat Holm was {{fortified}} in the 1860s {{following a}} visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to France, {{where they had been}} <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> strength of the French Navy. The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, under direction of Lord Palmerston, recommended fortification of the coast in 1865. The defences on the island, which became part of a line of defences known as the Palmerston Forts, were completed in 1869.|$|E

5|$|Headley {{was born}} in Colón, Panama on 30 May 1909, the son of DeCourcy Headley and Irene Roberts. Neither of Headley's parents was from Panama; his father was from Barbados and his mother from Jamaica, but they had moved to Panama while DeCourcey worked on the {{construction}} of the Panama Canal. By the time Headley was five years old the Canal was complete, and the family moved to Cuba in search of further employment. In 1919, <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> amount of Spanish being spoken by her son, Headley's mother took him to Jamaica so he could be educated in an English-speaking school.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 1909 two {{visitors}} were left stranded {{at the top}} of the tower as the final lift car of the night descended without them. The woman and twelve-year-old child were not noticed during the final round of inspection and so, without a way to communicate with anyone on the ground, they spent the night on the tower until 10am the following morning. They did not appear too <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ordeal and left without giving their names to officials.|$|E
5|$|This {{apparent}} {{reconciliation between}} Venice and the Pope {{did not stop}} the French from again invading the Veneto in March. Pitigliano's death in January had left Andrea Gritti {{in command of the}} Venetian forces; although Maximilian failed to reinforce Louis, the French army was nonetheless sufficient to drive the Venetians from Vicenza by May. Gritti garrisoned Padua for an expected attack by a combined Franco-Imperial army, but Louis, more <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> death of his advisor, the Cardinal d'Amboise, abandoned his plans for a siege.|$|E

5|$|While {{serving on}} the Western Front, Godley {{continued}} to fulfill {{his role as the}} overall commander of the NZEF in addition to his corps command. By September 1917, as reinforcements from New Zealand continued to arrive on the Western Front to replace the casualties lost in the major battles of the previous two years, Allen, still the Minister of Defence, was <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> drain on New Zealand's manpower. Allen considered that Australia and Canada were not making their proper contributions to the war effort. In response, Godley pointed out that the Australian divisions had seen more action than the New Zealanders.|$|E
5|$|Bordeaux was an {{important}} port for the German war effort, receiving {{a great deal of}} cargo, mostly raw materials, from overseas. It was also a major naval base, with huge submarine pens for U-boats. The Gironde estuary and Bordeaux had already been a target for the Allies. Operation Frankton was a 1942 commando raid targeting important shipping in the port. In January 1944, the Allies intercepted communications indicating that German commanders were <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> possibility of landings in the Bay of Biscay region of France. The next month, German naval and air units undertook anti-invasion exercises in the area. Ironside was intended to amplify these concerns.|$|E
5|$|<b>Concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{effects of}} {{commercial}} interests, prominent citizens including Galen Clark and Senator John Conness advocated for {{protection of the}} area. A park bill was prepared {{with the assistance of}} the General Land Office in the Interior Department. The bill passed both houses of the 38th United States Congress, and was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on June 30, 1864, creating the Yosemite Grant. This is the first instance of park land being set aside specifically for preservation and public use by action of the U.S. federal government, and set a precedent for the 1872 creation of Yellowstone as the first national park. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were ceded to California as a state park, and a board of commissioners was proclaimed two years later.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{an injury}} to pace {{spearhead}} Ray Lindwall, Bradman's fast bowlers reduced England in their first innings to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165. Bradman dropped two catches in this innings. English gloveman Godfrey Evans came to the crease with the score at 6/60, and hit Johnston hard to cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second chance went through Bradman's hand and struck him in the abdomen. However, these missed catches did not cost Australia much, as Evans was soon caught at short leg by Morris close in, leaving England at 7/74. England managed to recover somewhat after Laker and Bedser added 89 runs in only 73 minutes for the ninth wicket. At first, Bradman did not appear <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> partnership, and it was surmised {{that he may have}} been happy for England to continue batting so that his top order would not have to bat in fading light {{towards the end of the}} afternoon, but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable.|$|E
5|$|George visited Russia {{again in}} 1867 {{to meet with}} his sister Dagmar, who had married Tsarevitch Alexander (later Alexander III) the year before. He was {{determined}} to find a wife {{and the idea of}} an alliance with a Russian grand duchess, born into the Eastern Orthodox Church, appealed to him. Olga fell in love with George, but she was nevertheless anxious and distraught at the thought of leaving Russia. Her father was initially reluctant to agree to their marriage, thinking that at the age of fifteen she was too young and, being close to his daughter, <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> distance between Greece and Russia. For her part, Grand Duchess Alexandra was much more enthusiastic than her husband and, when some members of the imperial family noted the extreme youth of her daughter, she replied that Olga would not always be as young. Eventually, it was decided that Olga and George would marry when she had reached her sixteenth birthday. Meanwhile, she would continue her schoolwork until her wedding day.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} interests {{also included}} armour. In 1834 he published A Catalogue of the Collection of Ancient Arms and Armour, {{the property of}} Bernard Brocas, with a prefatory notice. In 1857 Planché was invited to arrange the collection of armour formerly belonging to his friend Sir Samuel Meyrick for the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, a task which he repeated in South Kensington in 1868. <b>Concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> state of the armour in the Tower of London, Planché wrote several reports on the subject between 1855 and 1869. In that year, the War Office invited him to rearrange the collection in chronological order, {{which was one of}} the things for which he had been campaigning.|$|E

5|$|His {{policies}} ran {{afoul of}} the United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States government to have him overthrown. The US was also <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of communists in the Guatemalan government, and Árbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. Árbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually fell apart. His daughter committed suicide, and he descended further into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971. In October 2011, the Guatemalan government issued an official apology for Árbenz's overthrow.|$|E
5|$|In the Junta, Alberti {{was aligned}} {{with most of}} the reformist {{proposals}} of Mariano Moreno, as well as Juan Larrea and Juan José Castelli. He signed most of the rulings that shaped the new political system, such as those related to popular sovereignty, representative and republican principles, separation of powers, publicity of the government actions, freedom of speech and the bases of political federalism. However, he did not support the actions of the Junta that contradicted his religious formation, regardless of the context. He refused to sign the death penalty for Santiago de Liniers, captured after the defeat of his counter-revolution. He signed the harsh commands given to Castelli for the first Upper Peru campaign, but noticing next to his signature that he made an exception with the articles involving capital punishment. He was also <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> role of the church in the new political system and headed a dispute against the Cabildo about it. He considered that the Cabildo should not have any authority over the Junta in ecclesiastic topics, to prevent the former abuses of the absolutist governments.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. He was <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was bound to be a war within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious of the Nazis.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{there were}} some who were <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{expansion}} of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this {{came to a head}} with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio. Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio. Murena was named among the conspirators, the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, {{but it was not a}} unanimous verdict. All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured—without ever giving testimony in their defence. Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{deploying}} Belgian troops {{against the}} mutineers as Janssens had wished, Lumumba dismissed him and renamed the Force Publique the Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC). All black soldiers were promoted {{by at least}} one rank. Victor Lundula was promoted directly from sergeant-major to major-general and head of the army, replacing Janssens. At the same time, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, an ex-sergeant-major and close personal aide of Lumumba, became Lundula's deputy as army chief of staff. The government attempted to stop the revolt—Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu intervened personally at Léopoldville and Thysville and persuaded the mutineers to lay down their arms—but in most of the country the mutiny intensified. White officers and civilians were attacked, white-owned properties were looted and white women were raped. The Belgian government became deeply <b>concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> situation, particularly when white civilians began entering neighbouring countries as refugees.|$|E
5|$|The Capitulation of Saldanha Bay saw the {{surrender}} to the British Royal Navy of a Dutch expeditionary force sent to recapture the Dutch Cape Colony in 1796 during the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1794 {{the army of the}} French Republic overran the Dutch Republic which then became a French client state, the Batavian Republic. <b>Concerned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> threat posed to the trade routes between Great Britain and British India by the Dutch Cape Colony in Southern Africa, a British expeditionary force had landed at Simon's Town in June 1795 and forced {{the surrender}} of the colony in a short campaign. The British commander, Vice-Admiral Sir George Elphinstone, then reinforced the garrison and stationed a naval squadron at the Cape to protect the British conquest.|$|E
