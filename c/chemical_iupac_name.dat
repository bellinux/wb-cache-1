25|$|The suffix -ol {{appears in}} the <b>IUPAC</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> of all {{substances}} where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority; in substances where a higher priority group is present the prefix hydroxy- {{will appear in the}} International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (<b>IUPAC)</b> <b>name.</b> The suffix -ol in non-systematic names (such as paracetamol or cholesterol) also typically indicates that the substance includes a hydroxyl functional group and, so, can be termed an alcohol. But many substances, particularly sugars (examples glucose and sucrose) contain hydroxyl functional groups without using the suffix. An important class of alcohols, of which methanol and ethanol are the simplest members is the saturated straight chain alcohols, the general formula for which is CnH2n+1OH.|$|R

Structured compilation of phytochem-icals from traditional medicinal plants can facilitate prospection for novel PDMs and their analogs as therapeutic agents. Atropa belladonna, Catharanthus roseus, Heliotropium indicum, Picrorhiza kurroa and Podophyllum hexandrum are important Himalayan medi-cinal plants, reported to have immense therapeutic properties against various diseases. We present Phytochemica, a structured compilation of 963 PDMs from these plants, inclusive of their plant part source, <b>chemical</b> classification, <b>IUPAC</b> <b>names,</b> SMILES notations, physicochemical properties and 3 -dimensional structures with associated references. Phytochemica is an exhaustive resource of natural molecules facilitating pro-spection for therapeutic molecules from medicinally important plants. It also offers refined search option to explore the neighbourhood of chemical space against ZINC data-base to identify analogs of natural molecules at user-defined cut-off.
