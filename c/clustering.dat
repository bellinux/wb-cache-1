5|$|In {{the theory}} of cluster analysis, the nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical <b>clustering.</b> These are methods that take a collection of points as input, and create a hierarchy of clusters of points by repeatedly merging pairs of smaller clusters to form larger clusters. The <b>clustering</b> methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm {{can be used for}} include Ward's method, complete-linkage <b>clustering,</b> and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly merging the closest two clusters but use different definitions of the distance between clusters. The cluster distances for which the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm works are called reducible and are characterized by a simple inequality among certain cluster distances.|$|E
5|$|Many {{problems}} in data analysis concern <b>clustering,</b> grouping data items into clusters of closely related items. Hierarchical <b>clustering</b> is {{a version of}} cluster analysis in which the clusters form a hierarchy or tree-like structure rather than a strict partition of the data items. In some cases, this type of <b>clustering</b> may be performed {{as a way of}} performing cluster analysis at multiple different scales simultaneously. In others, the data to be analyzed naturally has an unknown tree structure and the goal is to recover that structure by performing the analysis. Both of these kinds of analysis can be seen, for instance, in the application of hierarchical <b>clustering</b> to biological taxonomy. In this application, different living things are grouped into clusters at different scales or levels of similarity (species, genus, family, etc). This analysis simultaneously gives a multi-scale grouping of the organisms of the present age, and aims to accurately reconstruct the branching process or evolutionary tree that in past ages produced these organisms.|$|E

Each circle {{represents}} <b>cluster,</b> and the number located {{at the center of the}} circle shows the number of inner edges in the <b>cluster.</b> The number assigned to an edge shows the number of the cross-cluster edges. The dotted shape represents seed <b>cluster</b> (container). (1) In the initial state, two largest <b>clusters</b> (<b>cluster</b> 1 and <b>cluster</b> 2) are chosen as seed <b>clusters.</b> (2) The smallest seed <b>cluster</b> (<b>cluster</b> 2) and its one of adjacent <b>clusters</b> (<b>cluster</b> 3) are merged.

5|$|Next, the dissimilarity {{function}} is extended from pairs of points to pairs of clusters. Different <b>clustering</b> methods perform this extension in different ways. For instance, in the single-linkage <b>clustering</b> method, {{the distance between}} two clusters is defined to be the minimum distance between any two points from each cluster. Given this distance between clusters, a hierarchical <b>clustering</b> may be defined by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters.|$|E

The algorithm uses an amount of memory proportional to the number of points, when it is used for <b>clustering</b> methods such as Ward's method that allow constant-time calculation of the distance between clusters. However, for some other <b>clustering</b> methods it uses a larger amount of memory in an auxiliary data structure with which it keeps track of the distances between pairs of clusters.|$|E
