50|$|The <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>system</b> is {{very similar}} in action and in usage to the FLP-FRT {{recombination}} system.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>system</b> {{is used as}} {{a genetic}} tool to control site {{specific}} recombination events in genomic DNA. This system has allowed researchers to manipulate a variety of genetically modified organisms to control gene expression, delete undesired DNA sequences and modify chromosome architecture.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, {{researchers}} {{formed a}} {{human artificial chromosome}} by truncating chromosome 14. Genetic material was then introduced as mentioned above, using the <b>Cre-Lox</b> recombination <b>system.</b> This particular study focused on changes in expression levels by leaving portions of the existing genomic DNA. By leaving existing telomeric and sub-telomeric sequences, {{they were able to}} amplify expression levels of genes coding for erythropoietin production over 1000-fold. This work also has large gene therapy implications, as erythropoietin controls red blood cell formation.|$|R
50|$|Cre {{recombinase}} is {{a widely}} used tool {{in the field of}} molecular biology. The enzyme's unique and specific recombination system is exploited to manipulate genes and chromosomes in a huge range of research, such as gene knock out or knock in studies. The enzyme's ability to operate efficiently {{in a wide range of}} cellular environments (including mammals, plants, bacteria, and yeast) enables the <b>Cre-Lox</b> recombination <b>system</b> to be used in a vast number of organisms, making it a particularly useful tool in scientific research.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the above}} designs are {{generally}} followed, there are exceptions. For example, the construct might include a <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>system</b> to selectively remove inserted genes; or a prokaryotic construct may insert itself downstream of a promoter, allowing the inserted genes {{to be governed}} by a promoter already in place and {{eliminating the need for}} one {{to be included in the}} construct.|$|E
50|$|Phages {{like the}} lambda phage use their site {{specific}} recombinases to integrate their DNA into the host genome during lysogeny. P1 phage DNA {{on the other}} hand, exists as a plasmid in the host. The <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>system</b> serves several functions in the phage: it circularizes the phage DNA into a plasmid, separates interlinked plasmid rings so they are passed to both daughter bacteria equally and may help maintain copy numbers through an alternative means of replication.|$|E
50|$|To seek {{roles of}} Pcdh-γs in self-avoidance, Lefebvre et al. (2012) {{focused on a}} retinal interneuron, the starburst {{amacrine}} cell (SAC), which expresses Pcdh-γs and exhibits dramatic dendritic self-avoidance. They used a <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>system</b> to delete all the variable domains of the Pcdh-γ locus in the developing retina and verified that dendrites arising from a single SAC frequently crossed each other and sometimes formed loose bundles, similarly to the removal of Dscam1 from da neurons (Figure 8).|$|E
50|$|Cre-Lox {{recombination}} is a site-specific recombinase technology, used {{to carry}} out deletions, insertions, translocations and inversions at specific sites in the DNA of cells. It allows the DNA modification to be targeted to a specific cell type or be triggered by a specific external stimulus. It is implemented both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic <b>systems.</b> The <b>Cre-lox</b> recombination <b>system</b> has been particularly useful to help neuroscientists to study the brain in which complex cell types and neural circuits come together to generate cognition and behaviors. NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research has created several hundreds of Cre driver mouse lines which are currently used by the worldwide neuroscience community.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method for recombining bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and P 1 artificial chromosomes (PACs) containing large genomic DNA fragments into a single vector using the <b>Cre-lox</b> recombination <b>system</b> from bacteriophage P 1 in vivo. This overcomes the limitations of in vitro methods for generating large constructs based on restriction digestion, ligation, and transformation of DNA into Escherichia coli cells. We used the method to construct a human artificial chromosome vector of 404 kb encompassing long tracts of alpha satellite DNA, telomeric sequences, and the human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene. The specificity of Cre recombinase for loxP sites minimizes the possibility of intramolecular rearrangements, unlike previous techniques using general homologous recombination in E. coli, and makes our method compatible {{with the presence of}} large arrays of repeated sequences in cloned DNA. This methodology may also be applied to retrofitting PACs or BACs with markers and functional sequences...|$|R
40|$|AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) regulates {{cellular}} metabolism and promotes ATP production when energy is depleted. Evidence suggests that AMPK {{may be involved}} in oxygen sensing by carotid body cells, which are responsible for regulating the breathing rate to maintain proper blood oxygen levels. There are two isoforms of the catalytic alpha subunit, AMPKalpha 1 and AMPKalpha 2, which could be involved in oxygen sensing. Here, the production of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting both catalytic isoforms of AMPK in human, mouse, and rat is described. The shRNA causes significant knockdown of both isoforms of AMPK alpha in mouse and human cells and a significant reduction in AMPK activity, measured as phosphorylation of a direct target. This shRNA will be used to generate a rat model with tissue-specific knockdown of AMPKalpha 1 and 2 using a <b>Cre-Lox</b> recombination <b>system</b> to determine the role of AMPK in oxygen sensing by the carotid body...|$|R
50|$|There are {{currently}} two accepted {{models for the}} creation of human artificial chromosome vectors. The first is to create a small minichromosome by altering a natural human chromosome. This is accomplished by truncating the natural chromosome, followed by the introduction of unique genetic material via the <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>system</b> of recombination. The second method involves the literal creation of a novel chromosome de novo. Progress regarding de novo HAC formation has been limited, as many large genomic fragments will not successfully integrate into de novo vectors. Another factor limiting de novo vector formation is limited knowledge of what elements are required for construction, specifically centromeric sequences.|$|E
5000|$|Genetic cell lineage tracing {{became an}} {{extremely}} powerful approach when Nat Sternberg and Daniel Hamilton identified a topoisomerase in P1 bacteriophage called Cre recombinase, which has site-specific (loxP site) recombination activity (1981). Subsequent studies {{have used the}} <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>system</b> in transgenic mice and zebrafish to create tissue specific conditional knockouts. In order to conditionally ablate a tissue or cell population of interest, one can create a transgenic mouse using a construct containing the promoter of a gene that is specific to the target cell population, so that the Cre recombinase is only expressed in that tissue type. A second transgenic line must be created, in which loxP recognition sites flank {{a portion of a}} particular critical [...] "housekeeping" [...] gene such as DNA polymerase-β. Each transgene is completely harmless by itself; however, when the two strains are crossed, the Cre expressed in the target cell population will cause the excision of DNA pol-β in those cells, which will die. Use of the Cre system instead of injected Pronase ensures that when the targeted cell(s) dies, its intracellular contents will not harm neighboring cells since the Cre is innocuous by itself and outside the cell, whereas Pronase can damage other cells and the extracellular matrix and thus may have nonspecific effects on development. This approach allows tissue-specific targeted ablation studies, which are important for understanding the importance of particular progenitor cells in the establishment and functionality of adult tissues.|$|E
40|$|Nestin-Cre mice have a {{significant}} metabolic phenotype {{that is hard to}} discern from current literature. Indeed, the <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>system</b> has numerous problems that can affect physiological parameters, and these are missed when the correct control strains are not used. Despite the increasing use of the <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>system,</b> these issues were not visible to the scientific community previously and may have affected published work. This makes it important to highlight the issues and raise awareness of the pitfalls of the <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, this perspective will discuss the impact of CNS and peripheral “off-target” Cre recombination on metabolic systems and describe the development of new approaches to obviate the difficulties...|$|E
40|$|Synaptic {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) at spinal neurons directly communicating pain-specific inputs from the periphery {{to the brain}} has been proposed {{to serve as a}} trigger for pain hypersensitivity in pathological states. Previous studies have functionally implicated the NMDA receptor-NO pathway and the downstream second messenger, cGMP, in these processes. Because cGMP can broadly influence diverse ion-channels, kinases, and phosphodiesterases, pre- as well as post-synaptically, the precise identity of cGMP targets mediating spinal LTP, their mechanisms of action, and their locus in the spinal circuitry are still unclear. Here, we found that Protein Kinase G 1 (PKG-I) localized presynaptically in nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in the expression of spinal LTP. Using the <b>Cre-lox</b> P <b>system,</b> we generated nociceptor-specific knockout mice lacking PKG-I specifically in presynaptic terminals of nociceptors in the spinal cord, but not in post-synaptic neurons or elsewhere (SNS-PKG-I 2 / 2 mice). Patch clamp recordings showed that activity-induced LTP at identifie...|$|R
50|$|The P1 phage DNA when {{released}} into the host from the virion {{is in the form}} of a linear double stranded DNA molecule. The Cre enzyme targets loxP sites at the ends of this molecule and cyclises the genome. This can also take place in the absence of the Cre lox system with the help of other bacterial and viral proteins. The P1 plasmid is relatively large (~90Kbp) and hence exists in a low copy number - usually one per cell. If the two daughter plasmids get interlinked one of the daughter cells of the host will lose the plasmid. The <b>Cre-lox</b> recombination <b>system</b> prevents these situations by unlinking the rings of DNA by carrying out two recombination events (linked rings -> single fused ring -> two unlinked rings). It is also proposed that rolling circle replication followed by recombination will allow the plasmid to increase its copy number when certain regulators (repA) are limiting.|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used technique is the <b>Cre-lox</b> recombination <b>system.</b> The Cre recombinase enzyme specifically recognizes two lox (loci of recombination) sites within DNA and causes recombination between them. During recombination two strands of DNA exchange information. This recombination will cause a deletion or inversion of the genes between the two lox sites, depending on their orientation. An entire gene can be removed to inactivate it. This whole system is inducible so a chemical {{can be added to}} knock genes out at a specific time. Two of the {{most commonly}} used chemicals are tetracycline, which activates transcription of the Cre recombinase gene and tamoxifen, which activates transport of the Cre recombinase protein to the nucleus. Only a few cell types express Cre recombinase and no mammalian cells express it so there is no risk of accidental activation of lox sites when using conditional gene knockout in mammals. Figuring out how to express Cre-recombinase in an organism tends to be {{the most difficult part of}} this technique.|$|R
40|$|Last decade major {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the field of mouse model engineering. Newly developed conditional mouse models have overcome important drawbacks in conventional mouse models. Conditional mouse models are especially suited for the development of models of sporadic human carcinomas. These models can control gene (in) activation in a time and/or tissue-specific manner. Here, we review two important conditional mouse model systems, based on the Tet off/on and the <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>system.</b> Furthermore possible applications of the <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>system</b> in the development of a mouse model for HNSCC are being discussed. In the future, conditional mouse models for HNSCC can be used in the identification of new key genes in HNSCC tumorigenesis, and would furthermore serve as an indispensable tool for designing new treatment-modalitie...|$|E

40|$|Cell fusion is an {{important}} event that mediates various biological processes. However, the role of cell fusion in cancer has not been very well described due to technical limitations. Here we describe a <b>Cre-Lox</b> recombination model <b>system</b> to study spontaneous heterotypic cell-cell fusion between tumor and non-tumor cells. This fusion event results in hybrid cells that are hyperploid and contain DNA from both parental cells. In addition, fusion-derived hybrids eventually adopt cancer gene profile, are more resistant to chemotherapy, and show increased tumorsphere-forming capacity. This model system can therefore be used to further our understanding of cell-cell fusion {{in the context of}} cancer...|$|R
40|$|A small {{heat shock}} gene of Lactobacillus plantarum strain WCFS 1 was deleted using a <b>Cre-lox</b> based <b>system.</b> Compared {{to the wild}} type, the ∆hsp 18. 55 mutant strain {{displayed}} a similar growth rate when cultivated either under optimal temperature or under different stress conditions such as heat, low pH and salt stress. However, a longer lag phase was observed when the ∆hsp 18. 55 mutant strain was cultivated under short intense heat stress (50  °C). This suggests that the hsp 18. 55 gene of L. plantarum {{may be involved in}} recovery of L. plantarum stressed cells in the early stage of high temperature stress. In addition, morphology of the mutant cells, investigated by scanning electron microscopy, revealed that cells clumped together and had rough surfaces, and that some of the cells had a shrunken empty appearance, which clearly contrasted with the characteristic rod-shaped, smooth-surface morphology of control L. plantarum cells. Furthermore, inactivation of the hsp 18. 55 gene affected membrane fluidity and physicochemical surface properties of L. plantarum WCFS 1...|$|R
40|$|To {{create a}} {{strategy}} for inducible gene targeting we developed a <b>Cre-lox</b> recombination <b>system</b> which responds to the synthetic steroid RU 486. Several fusions between Cre recombinase and the hormone binding domain (HBD) of a mutated human progesterone receptor, which binds RU 486 but not progesterone, were constructed. When tested in transient expression assays recombination activities of all fusion proteins were responsive to RU 486, {{but not to the}} endogenous steroid progesterone. However, the observed induction of recombination activity by the synthetic steroid varied between the different fusion proteins. The fusion with the highest activity in the presence of RU 486 combined with low background activity {{in the absence of the}} steroid was tested after stable expression in fibroblast and embryonal stem (ES) cells. We could demonstrate that its recombination activity was highly dependent on RU 486. Since the RU 486 doses required to activate recombination were considerably lower than doses displaying anti-progesterone effects in mice, this system could be used as a valuable tool for inducible gene targeting...|$|R
40|$|Wnt-targeted {{gene therapy}} has been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} human colorectal cancer (CRC). The <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>system</b> consists of methodology for enhancing targeted expression from tissue-specific or cancer-specific promoters. We analyzed the efficiency of Wnt-specific promoters as drivers of the Cre-mediated activity of a luciferase reporter gene or cell death effector gene in CRC cell lines in the presence and absence of two modulators of Wnt activity, sodium butyrate and lithium chloride. Butyrate is present in the colonic lumen after digestion of fiber-rich foods, whereas the colonic lumen is readily accessible to lithium chloride. In both SW 620 and HCT- 116 CRC cells, a physiologically relevant concentration of butyrate upregulated reporter and effector activity and altered the Wnt-specific expression pattern. Lithium chloride markedly enhanced Cre-Lox-mediated Wnt-specific reporter expression only in APC wild-type CRC cells. Possibilities for genetic modulation of the proposed CRC therapy included Wnt-specific expression of a floxed Lef 1 -VP 16 fusion that enhanced Wnt-specific cell death and of a floxed dominant-negative Tcf 4 that specifically downregulated endogenous Wnt activity. These findings demonstrated that the <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>system,</b> in combination with pharmacological and genetic modulators, represents effective methodology for enhancing Wnt-targeted gene therapy...|$|E

LKB 1 is a kinase that is required for activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as well as 13 AMPK-related protein kinases. AMPK stimulates ATP production during ischemia and prevents post-ischemic dysfunction. We used the <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>system</b> to generate mice where LKB 1 was selectively knocked out in cardiomyocytes and muscle cells (LKB 1 -KO) to assess the role of LKB 1 on cardiac function in these mice...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the size}} of BAC, PAC and P 1 clones, it is often {{difficult}} to construct detailed restriction maps, with large number of restriction fragments leading to ambiguity of mapping data. We report the use of Cre recombinase to linearise and asymmetrically introduce label at the unique loxP site of large loxP-containing clones. Subsequent partial digestion allows the direct ordering of restriction fragments. Additionally, BAC DNA linearised using the <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>system</b> has been used successfully to generate transgenic animals...|$|E
40|$|Constitutive mouse {{models of}} {{intestinal}} neoplasia, {{such as the}} Apcmin/+ (multiple intestinal neoplasia) mouse have proven valuable tools both for furthering our understanding of tumorigenesis and {{for the development of}} therapeutic strategies. However, the in vivo study of a number of genes has been precluded by their absolute requirement during embryonic development. This has {{led to the development of}} conditional strategies that allow gene regulation in vivo. This review describes the principal techniques used to achieve conditional transgenesis within the mouse intestine, with a particular focus upon the <b>Cre–Lox</b> and Tet-regulable <b>systems.</b> Further, we discuss how these techniques are being used to dissect the mechanisms governing both normal homeostasis and neoplastic development within the intestine...|$|R
40|$|Studying the {{cellular}} function of microRNAs requires genetic strategies to generate their loss-of-function. Recently, {{a novel approach}} of targeted genomic deletion was proposed, {{which is based on}} induction of site-specific DNA cuts with Cas 9 /gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes, combined with homologous recombination-dependent insertion of cassettes that contain sequences for <b>Cre-lox</b> or FLP-FRT <b>systems.</b> Here, we provide a technical report describing application of this CRISPR/Cas 9 -directed homologous recombination procedure to the generation of human tumor cells in which conditional knockout of an X-linked cluster of microRNAs (miR- 105 /miR- 767) can be induced.

40|$|Yarrowia lipolytica {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied nonconventional yeasts. Unfortunately, few methods for gene disruption have been reported for this yeast, and all of them are time-consuming and laborious. The functional analysis of unknown genes requires powerful disruption methods. Here, we describe such a new method for rapid gene disruption in Y lipolytica. This knockout system combines SEP method and the <b>Cre-lox</b> recombination <b>system,</b> facilitating efficient marker rescue. Versatility was increased by using both auxotrophic markers like ylURA 3 and ylLEU 2, as well as the antibiotic resistance marker hph. The hph marker, which confers resistance to hygromycin-B, allows gene disruption in a strain lacking any conventional auxothrophic marker. The disruption cassette was shown to integrate at the correct locus at an average frequency of 45 %. Upon expression of Cre recombinase, the marker was excised at a frequency of 98 %, by recombination between the two lox sites. This new method for gene disruption is an ideal tool for the functional analysis of gene families, or for creating large-scale mutant collections in general. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|By using a {{conditional}} {{gene targeting}} approach exploiting the <b>cre-lox</b> <b>system,</b> we show that postnatal inactivation of the myostatin gene in striated muscle is sufficient to cause a generalized muscular hypertrophy of the same magnitude as that observed for constitutive myostatin knockout mice. This formally demonstrates that striated muscle is the production site of functional myostatin and that this member of the TGFbeta family of growth and differentiation factors regulates muscle mass not only during early embryogenesis but throughout development. It indicates that myostatin antagonist {{could be used to}} treat muscle wasting and to promote muscle growth in man and animals. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Here, utilizing the activation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV 1) under heat, the translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) triggered by Calcium influx, and the recombination effects of <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>system,</b> we have developed a system to remotely manipulate the expression of proteins in cells under the control of both heat and drugs.

However, details of the molecular mechanisms remain to be determined. Here, we have developed a gene amplification system in yeast and mammalian cells that is based on double rolling-circle replication (DRCR). <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>system</b> is used to efficiently induce DRCR utilizing a recombinational process coupled with replication. This system shows distinctive features seen in amplification of oncogenes and drug-resistance genes: (i) intra- and extrachromosomal amplification, (ii) intensive chromosome rearrangement and (iii) scattered-type amplification resembling those seen in cancer cells.

40|$|The procaryotic <b>cre-lox</b> {{site-specific}} recombination <b>system</b> of coliphage P 1 {{was shown to}} function in an efficient manner in a eucaryote, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cre gene, which codes for a site-specific recombinase, was placed under control of the yeast GALI promoter. lox sites flanking the LEU 2 gene were integrated into two different chromosomes in both orientations. Excisive recombination at the lox sites (as measured by loss of the LEU 2 gene) was promoted efficiently and accurately by the Cre protein and was dependent upon induction by galactose. These results demonstrate that a procaryotic recombinase can enter a eucaryotic nucleus and, moreover, that {{the ability of the}} Cre recombinase to perform precise recombination events on the chromosomes of S. cerevisiae is unimpaired by chromatin structure...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesAlthough {{reducing}} {{rates of}} restenosis, drug-eluting stents also impair endothelial healing, resulting in {{increased risk of}} thrombosis. Alternatively, inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia is favoured by acceleration of reendothelialization. We previously showed that E 2 accelerates reendothelialization through Estrogen Receptor α (ERα) and we now aimed at defining the cellular targets of this action. Methods and ResultsThe respective roles of endothelial and hematopoietic cellular targets of E 2 were investigated in a mouse carotid injury model, using “en face” confocal microscopy, to follow endothelium repair. Grafting ERα –/– mice with ERα +/+ bone marrow (BM) did not restore the accelerative effect of E 2 on reendothelialization, demonstrating the necessary role of extrahematopoietic ERα. Using a cell-specific inactivation of ERα (<b>Cre-lox</b> recombination <b>system),</b> we showed that endothelial ER_ plays {{a pivotal role in}} the E 2 action. Finally, in wild type mice grafted with ERα –/–, the regenerative effect of E 2 was abolished, demonstrating that ERα-expressing hematopoietic cells are also concomitantly required. ConclusionsWe demonstrate that endothelial ERα plays a pivotal role in E 2 -mediated reendothelialization. However, endothelial targeting alone is not sufficient and the concomitant stimulation of BM ERα is absolutely required. This cooperation should be now taken into account in strategies aimed at optimizing in-stent reendothelialization...|$|R
