40|$|In 4 Simon {{experiments}} {{the authors}} examined control over 2 routes of sensorimotor processing: response priming in the unconditional route and response selection via the <b>conditional</b> <b>route.</b> The Simon effect diminished as {{the frequency of}} noncorresponding trials increased. Location-based response priming was observed only when the stimulus followed a corresponding event but not after a noncorresponding trial. Therefore, the unconditional route appears to be suppressed whenever the task context indicates priming as potentially disadvantageous. Moreover, the task-irrelevant stimulus location was used for response selection {{as a function of}} correspondence probability. Although exact repetitions of stimulus-response sequences caused a marked speed-up of responses, this 3 rd mechanism is independent of unconditional route suppression and frequency-based adjustments in the conditional rout...|$|E

However, the regular cleaning and pipeline inspection rely on human is not only labor-intensive but also less effective. This paper presents the developmknt of a computer controlled air <b>conditional</b> <b>route</b> inspection robot. The movement and speed of the inspection robot can be controlled remotely by using a joystick. This robot can be used to detect a leaking hole based on heat detection and clean the air conditioning route. The operator can monitor the robot's inspection by using video that are captured through a wireless camera on the surface of the robot. The robot is controlled using PIC 16 F 877 A and Visual Basic 6. 0 program is created to interface with computer. This prototype of robot showed that the operational was successful. This user friendly inspection robot is expected to overcome the inspecting and cleaning the air conditional routes problem in the fastest and easiest way...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{foundation of}} Stochastic User Equilibrium {{is that each}} traveller attempts to minimize his or her perceived travel costs, where these costs are composed of a deterministic measured cost and a random term which {{can be interpreted as}} perceptual error. In principle such a definition, which is in terms of random errors, should imply an equilibrium probability distribution over feasible flow patterns on the transport network. Such a probability distribution could potentially allow between day variability in network flows to be represented. However, traditionally a deterministic, large sample approximation has been used as the 'solution' of Stochastic User Equilibrium. In this paper a representation of Stochastic User Equilibrium as a probability distribution is developed. This distribution is defined by the <b>conditional</b> <b>route</b> selection of each individual given the choices of all other travellers. An interpretation of the resulting assignment model as the limit (in the infinite future) of a continuous time assignment process is discussed. The limiting behaviour as the travel demand becomes large is also investigated, and convergence to the traditional deterministic form of Stochastic User Equilibrium is proved. ...|$|E

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{air traffic}} {{demand in the}} Pan-European airspace {{there is a need}} for optimizing the use of the airspace structure (civilian and military) in a manner that would satisfy the requirements of civil and military users. In the area of Europe with the highest levels of air traffic (Core area) 32 % of the volume of airspace above FL 195 is shared by both civil and military users. Until the introduction of the concept of flexible use of airspace, flexible airspace structures were 24 hours per day unavailable for commercial air transport. Flexible use of airspace concept provides a substantial level of dynamic airspace management by the usage of <b>conditional</b> <b>routes.</b> This paper analyses underutilization of resources, flexible airspace structures in the Pan-European airspace, especially in the south-eastern part of the traffic flows (East South Axis), reducing the efficiency of flight operations, as result of delegating the flexible structures to military users. Based on previous analysis, utilization model for flexible use of airspace is developed (scenarios) with defined airspace structure. The model is based on the temporal, vertical, and modular airspace sectorisation parameters in order to optimize flight efficiency. The presented model brings significant improvement in flight efficiency (in terms of reduced flight distance) for air carriers that planned to fly through the selected flexible airspace structure (LI_RST- 49) ...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{decomposition}} mechanism {{operating in}} binary Ti-Al alloys {{in the two}} phase alpha + alpha(2) region has been investigated. A Ti- 15 at. %Al alloy was aged in the range 450 - 750 degrees C for various time periods. The resulting microstructures were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe field ion microscopy (APFIM). Computer simulations of phase separation in this alloy were also carried out using a dynamic Ising model. Results from the computer simulations suggest decomposition occurs via a <b>conditional</b> spinodal <b>route,</b> whereby compositional phase separation is contingent upon prior ordering of the matrix.

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{anonymous}} wireless networking is considered when an adversary monitors the packet transmission timing {{of an unknown}} fraction of the network nodes. For a given level of network performance, as measured by network throughput, the problem of maximizing anonymity is studied from a game-theoretic perspective. Using <b>conditional</b> entropy of <b>routes</b> {{as a measure of}} anonymity, this problem is posed as a two player zero-sum game between the network designer and the adversary; the task of the adversary is to choose a subset of nodes to monitor so that anonymity of routes is minimum and the task of the network designer is to choose a subset of nodes (referred to as covert relays to generate independent transmission schedules and evade flow detection so that anonymity is maximized. It is shown that a Nash equilibrium exists for a general category of finite networks. The theory is applied to the numerical example of a switching network to study the relationship between anonymity, fraction of monitored relays and the fraction of covert relays...|$|R
5000|$|The Zephyrettes {{lacked the}} luxurious {{appointments}} of the California Zephyr, foregoing foodservice entirely and providing only hot and cooled water for refreshments. Although the RDCs typically ran the route alone, {{during periods of}} peak demand the Western Pacific ran them in short trains behind an EMD F3, a water tender, and a baggage car. In October 1950, the railroad had computed the direct operating costs for the Zephyrette RDCs at 71 cents per train-mile, almost half the cost incurred by its conventional predecessor, the Royal Gorge. In addition to their relative economic efficiency, the cars also gained a reputation for reliability: one Western Pacific employee even likened one of the RDCs to [...] "a big Buick". They also provided numerous advantages over conventional consists, {{especially in terms of}} their ability to accelerate quickly and maintain high sustained speeds, which allowed for faster service of the <b>route's</b> <b>conditional</b> stops than had previously been possible. While the Zephyrettes had initially been profitable for the Western Pacific, they did not remain so, and the service was ended on October 2, 1960.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{proposes a}} {{statistical}} model to estimate route traffic flows in congested networks. In the study, {{it is assumed}} that route traffic flows conform to the stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) principle while being treated as random variables in order to exploit the stochastic nature of traffic. The proposed model formulates the distribution of these random variables as the <b>conditional</b> distribution of <b>route</b> flows and origin–destination (O-D) travel demand, given the observed link flows and the SUE principle. Here, the SUE principle is accounted for through the likelihood of user behaviours rather than by using a bi-level formulation. In this study, the Bayesian theorem is applied to derive the probability density function (PDF) of the conditional distribution. Based on the PDF, characteristics such as the means and variances of route/link traffic flows are estimated using a blocked Metropolis–Hastings (M–H) algorithm. To facilitate the use of prior knowledge, a hierarchical form is designed to provide a straightforward way to integrate prior knowledge into the traffic estimation model. The performance of the proposed method is tested on the Sioux–Falls network through a series of numerical examples...|$|R
3000|$|Given {{the small}} number of time periods in our sample, our first stage relies heavily on {{cross-sectional}} variation to identify a relationship between the instrument and homicides. As a result, we do not include state or municipal fixed effects in our regressions. In their place we include observable state and municipal characteristics, detailed shortly. We recognize concerns about the absence of geographic fixed effects, and address these in Section 6.2. At both the state and municipal levels, we include controls for economic activity and wealth. At the state level we use annual real GDP and unemployment rates. At the municipal level, since we do not have annual data or GDP values, we use unemployment rates in 2010 and 2000, average years of education for adults, the percentage of households with running water, and household income per capita in the year 2000. We also account for pre-existing levels of violence by including average homicides per 100, 000 inhabitants for the years 2003 and 2004. To account for time-invariant migration costs, we include all non-federal (state) highways as of 2005. A larger highway network should reduce the cost of moving elsewhere in Mexico and abroad, but these costs likely are general to the entire highway network, rather than specific to federal highways. 26 Thus our instrument captures changes {{in the value of the}} drug distribution <b>routes</b> <b>conditional</b> on the pre-existing local transportation network. Finally, we include population density to account for the possibility that both homicide and migration rates are higher in urban areas. 27 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Branch Xa of Pan-European Transport Corridor X has a {{strategic}} importance for Croatia since this corridor (Corridor branch) enables linking of Croatia with Slovenia and Austria, which, {{according to the}} current data {{on the structure of}} trade in goods from countries, is counted among five most important Croatian trading partners. Therefore, the valorization of the branch of Corridor X has unquestionable importance for the Croatian economy and the associated surroundings that gravitate in the transport <b>route.</b> <b>Conditional</b> on the numerous geo-transport and socioeconomic factors, the valorization of transport corridor on the transport market is determined also by the value of transport (traffic) services that are determined by the costs incurred in its production. Accordingly, the underlying problem of the present study is to analyze the external costs of the branch of Corridor X which, although, belong to the category of social costs borne by society, have the intention to become, over various regulatory measures (excise), {{an integral part of the}} costs of the conveyor. With the aim of the research in this study, which, generally, supports the need for internalization of the external costs, as the essential factors of valorization of the transport corridors, a comparative analysis of external costs of the branch of Corridor X between the road and rail transport was performed. As input data, the results of in-depth analysis were used, resulting from the studies of the European Commission for the European Union, specifically Studies for Corridor X and Studies on East-Mediterranean transport routes. The research results show that the mean values of external costs of freight rail transport on the branch Xa are almost five times fewer than the average value of external costs of road transport and that, in accordance with the purpose of these investigations, the internalization of external costs is unquestionably required for planning the traffic flows and valorization of the route...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} a dynamic {{assignment}} model is developed which estimates travellers' route and departure time choices {{and the resulting}} time varying traffic patterns during the morning peak. The distinctive feature of the model {{is that it does}} not restrict the geometry of the network to specific forms. The proposed framework of analysis consists of a travel time model, a demand model and a demand adjustment mechanism. Two travel time models are proposed. The first is based on elementary relationships from traffic flow theory and provides the framework for a macroscopic simulation model which calculates the time varying flow patterns and link travel times given the time dependent departure rate distributions; the second is based on queueing theory and models roads as bottlenecks through which traffic flow is either uncongested or fixed at a capacity independent of traffic density. The demand model is based on the utility maximisation decision rule and defines the time dependent departure rates associated with each reasonable route connecting, the O-D pairs of the network, given the total utility associated with each combination of departure time and route. Travellers' choices are assumed to result from the trade-off between travel time and schedule delay and each individual is assumed to first choose a departure time t, and then select a reasonable <b>route,</b> <b>conditional</b> on the choice of t. The demand model has therefore the form of a nested logit. The demand adjustment mechanism is derived from a Markovian model, and describes the day-to-day evolution of the departure rate distributions. Travellers are assumed to modify their trip choice decisions based on the information they acquire from recent trips. The demand adjustment mechanism is used in order to find the equilibrium state of the system, defined as the state at which travellers believe that they cannot increase their utility of travel by unilaterally changing route or departure time. The model outputs exhibit the characteristics of real world traffic patterns observed during the peak, i. e., time varying flow patterns and travel times which result from time varying departure rates from the origins. It is shown that increasing the work start time flexibility results in a spread of the departure rate distributions over a longer period and therefore reduces the level of congestion in the network. Furthermore, it was shown that increasing the total demand using the road network results in higher levels of congestion and that travellers tend to depart earlier in an attempt to compensate for the increase in travel times. Moreover, experiments using the queueing theory based travel time model have shown that increasing the capacity of a bottleneck may cause congestion to develop downstream, which in turn may result in an increase of the average travel time for certain O-D pairs. The dynamic assignment model is also applied to estimate the effects that different road pricing policies may have on trip choices and the level of congestion; the model is used to demonstrate the development of the shifting peak phenomenon. Furthermore, the effect of information availability on the traffic patterns is investigated through a number of experiments using the developed dynamic assignment model and assuming that guided drivers form a class of users characterised by lower variability of preferences with respect to route choice...|$|R
40|$|It is now {{accepted}} {{that there is}} a link between obesity and several diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and atherosclerosis with the common initiating factor in pathogenesis being a state of low grade, chronic inflammation. This state, characterised by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 6, leads to sustained activation of inflammatory signalling pathways such as the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway and subsequently pathogenesis. Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) 3 is inducible by several stimuli including IL 6 and 3 '- 5 '-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and via these routes has been demonstrated to terminate IL 6 signalling thus quenching JAK/STAT signalling and an inflammatory response. While SOCS 3 was primarily characterised as a competitive inhibitor of intracellular signalling, it also functions as specificity factor for an elongin-cullin-SOCS (ECS) -type E 3 ubiquitin ligase. In this role, it has been demonstrated to direct ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of several substrates and lysosomal routing. However, the full spectrum of SOCS 3 -dependently ubiquitinated substrates is unknown. Given that JAK/STAT signalling is critical in the development of chronic inflammatory disorders, delineating the role of SOCS 3 as an E 3 ligase might be therapeutically beneficial. However, given the broad range of SOCS 3 stimuli, the availability of certain SOCS 3 substrates might be <b>conditional</b> on the <b>route</b> of SOCS 3 induction. Using a global proteomics approach, this study aimed to identify SOCS 3 -dependently ubiquitinated substrates in response to cAMP and thus elaborate on the already well-established role of cAMP in inflammation. Differentially stable isotope labelling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) -labelled, tandem affinity purified ubiquitinomes of wild type (WT) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and SOCS 3 -/- MEFs, each expressing epitope-tagged forms of ubiquitin, were compared using mass spectrometry (MS) following cAMP-mediated SOCS 3 induction. Using this approach, proteins modified by SOCS 3 with the epitope-tagged form of ubiquitin should be enriched in WT MEFs but not SOCS 3 -/- MEFs. MaxQuant analysis of raw mass spectromeric data identified several candidate SOCS 3 substrates. Of these, SOCS 3 was found to interact with PTRF/cavin- 1, a regulator of caveolae formation and stability. Other substrates were tested but with limited success. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that SOCS 3 could precipitate cavin- 1 however the interaction was reduced following the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) using sodium orthovanadate and hydrogen peroxide. This was surprising since all known SOCS 3 substrates are tyrosine-phosphorylated prior to interacting with SOCS 3 via its Src-homology (SH) 2 domain. Consistent with this finding, SOCS 3 did not interact with known cavin- 1 tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides spotted on a peptide array. However, a full-length cavin- 1 peptide array spotted with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides showed specific interactions at multiple sites. It is proposed that this interaction might influence the localisation and stability of either protein. While SOCS 3 was demonstrated to impact cavin- 1 ubiquitination, the mechanism by which it does so or the functional consequence is still not clear. Immunoprecipitation of cavin- 1 following the introduction of SOCS 3 was accompanied by a shift in the polyubiquitin signal from a high molecular weight, seen with cavin- 1 alone, to a low molecular weight. Furthermore, an enhanced K 48 -polyubiquitin signal was detectable in this low molecular weight fraction, which was focused around the molecular weight of cavin- 1. It is not known if this ubiquitin signal is SOCS 3 -dependent. In conclusion, the project has identified and validated a novel substrate of SOCS 3. However, the mechanism by which SOCS 3 regulates cavin- 1 ubiquitination or the biological function of the interaction is currently unknown...|$|R
