5|$|As a result, the {{intermediate}} appellate <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> reach {{the question of}} whether the statute of limitation applies.|$|E
5|$|Because its {{aforementioned}} holdings required affirmance, the <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{reach the}} alternate ground for {{decision of the}} trial court that the appraisal and the payments were conditions precedent.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{hear the}} {{question}} that had decided the district court opinion, namely that Hamdan was entitled to a GCIII Art. 5 hearing instead of a Combatant Status Review Tribunal.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> need {{to approve}} a reaffirmation {{agreement}} which applies to consumer debt secured by real estate. This applies to any mortgages on your home or other debts secured by your home. In addition, the <b>Court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> approve any reaffirmation agreements between debtors and credit unions. They are filed and {{become part of the}} record without a hearing.|$|R
50|$|Consumer <b>courts</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have {{jurisdiction}} over matters where services or goods were bought {{for a commercial}} purpose.|$|R
50|$|Applying this {{analysis}} {{to the facts}} at hand, Marshall found that the <b>courts</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have jurisdiction over the case.|$|R
5|$|Because Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} Stevens' opinion as to several parts, largely {{on the grounds of}} {{judicial}} parsimony (that is, having decided that the military commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and the <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> need to go further), those sections were without a majority in support.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{adopting}} a broad principle, the <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> list any specific rules for how trial judges were to balance evidentiary {{standards and the}} right of the defendant to secure witnesses in his or her favor.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{explicitly}} rule {{on whether}} or not Terrazas had lost his US citizenship; rather, it remanded the case back to the original trial court (a Federal District Court in Illinois) for further proceedings consistent with the court's ruling.|$|E
50|$|State <b>courts</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{adjudicate}} {{whether an}} action could be properly removed. Once a defendant {{has filed a}} notice to remove a case, jurisdiction is transferred automatically and immediately by operation of law from the state court to the federal court. Any objection to removal must {{be presented to the}} federal court. If a federal court finds that the notice of removal was in fact defective, or that the federal <b>court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have jurisdiction, the case is remanded to the state court.|$|R
50|$|Japanese <b>courts</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> award {{punitive damages}} {{as a matter}} of public policy, and Japanese law prohibits the {{enforcement}} of punitive damage awards obtained overseas.|$|R
50|$|Where {{there has}} been a death at sea, and no body has been brought ashore, the <b>court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have {{jurisdiction}} to hold an inquest.|$|R
5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the state <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E
5|$|In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the {{corporation}} tax act of 1909 did not violate the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> rule that excise taxes consisted only of taxes on corporations and corporate privileges, {{to the exclusion of}} taxes on individuals (natural persons). The issue of the validity of an income tax imposed on individuals was neither presented to the Court nor decided by the Court.|$|E
50|$|Decisions {{made by the}} Magistrates Court may {{be heard}} on appeal to the District Court of Queensland. The Magistrates <b>Court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have an appellate jurisdiction.|$|R

50|$|If {{the court}} is {{satisfied}} with the plea, then the matter proceeds to the fourth stage listed above. The <b>court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> at this stage enter a conviction.|$|R
5|$|The Marshall Court also issued {{important}} opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although the <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> explicitly cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain {{influential in}} interpreting the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and venue provision of Article Three. The Court also laid down the common law rules of evidence in federal courts, including the hearsay exception for party admissions and the narrowing of the best evidence rule.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} ACLU {{case of the}} 1920s was Gitlow v. New York, in which Benjamin Gitlow was arrested for violating a state law against inciting anarchy and violence, when he distributed literature promoting communism. Although the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> overturn Gitlow's conviction, it adopted the ACLU's stance (later termed the incorporation doctrine) that the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws, as well as federal laws.|$|E
5|$|After decades, the Oneida became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} the case to settle. Instead, they began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting sovereignty over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E
50|$|The Territorial <b>Court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{deal with}} most matters of family law, such as divorce, child custody and adoption. Its {{jurisdiction}} in civil cases {{is limited to}} $25,000.|$|R
50|$|Consideration must be sufficient, but <b>courts</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{weigh the}} {{adequacy}} of consideration, partially because in a capitalistic society private parties are entitled and expected to determine the value of things for themselves. In other words, the things being exchanged must have some value {{in the eyes of}} the law, but the general rule is that <b>courts</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> care how much. Love and affection, for example, would not constitute sufficient consideration, but a penny would. However, sufficient consideration that is grossly inadequate may be deemed unconscionable, discussed below.|$|R
50|$|Current orders {{issued by}} the <b>court</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{generally}} call for a blanket freezing of assets, and they are currently worded in more nuanced terms according to the situation concerned.|$|R
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He {{told the court}} that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, {{and said he had}} warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. The <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011), the {{applicant}} sought a declaration that section 377A of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The High Court stated {{that a person}} who is asserting an infringement of a constitutional liberty must establish that he or she has not merely a sufficient interest but a substantial interest in the matter, that is, he or she must be alleging a violation of a fundamental liberty. The <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> discuss the issue of standing in the context of administrative law.|$|E
5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
50|$|In certain circumstances, {{decisions}} made by the Magistrates Court may be appealed to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. The Magistrates <b>Court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> hear matters on appeal.|$|R

5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
5|$|In the 2016 Austrian presidential election, Freedom Party {{candidate}} Norbert Hofer won {{the first}} round of the election, receiving 35.1% of the vote, making that election the Freedom Party's best ever election result in its history. However, in the second round, Hofer was defeated by Alexander Van der Bellen, who received the support of 50.3% compared to Hofer's 49.7%. On July first the Constitutional Court of Austria voided the results of the second round due to mishandling of postal votes; although the <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> find evidence of deliberate manipulation. The re-vote took place on 4 December 2016 when Van der Bellen won by a significantly larger margin.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> explain this.|$|E
