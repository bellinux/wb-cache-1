40|$|The {{multipacting}} {{phenomena in}} accelerating structures and coaxial lines are well documented {{and methods of}} mitigating or suppressing it are understood. The multipacting that occurs in a quarter wave <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> designed to mount a cathode insertion stalk into a superconducting RF photoinjector has been analyzed via calculations and experimental measurements {{and the effect of}} introducing multipacting suppression grooves into the structure is analyzed. Several alternative <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> designs are analyzed and suggestions made regarding future <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> development. Furthermore, the problems encountered in cleaning the <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> surfaces, factors important in changes to the secondary electron yield, are discussed and evaluated. This design is being implemented on the BNL 1. 3 GHz photoinjector, previously used for measurement of the quantum efficiency of bare Nb, to allow for the introduction of other cathode materials for study, and to verify the design functions properly prior to constructing our 703 Mflz photoinjector with a similar <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> design...|$|E
40|$|The BNL 704 MHz SRF gun has a grooved <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> {{to support}} the photo-cathode. Due to the {{distortion}} of grooves at the <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> during the BCP for the <b>choke</b> <b>joint,</b> several multipacting barriers showed up when it was tested with Nb cathode stalk at JLab. We built a setup to use the spare large grain SRF cavity to test and condition the multipacting at BNL with various power sources up to 50 kW. The test is carried out in three stages: testing the cavity performance without cathode, testing the cavity with the Nb cathode stalk that was used at Jlab, and testing the cavity with a copper cathode stalk {{that is based on}} the design for the SRF gun.

5000|$|The {{majority}} of submission holds can be grouped into two broad categories: <b>joint</b> locks and <b>chokes.</b> <b>Joint</b> locks typically involve isolating an opponent's limb {{and creating a}} lever with the body position which will force the joint to move past its normal range of motion. Pressure is increased {{in a controlled manner}} and released if the opponent cannot escape the hold and signals defeat by submitting. Opponents can indicate submission verbally or they can [...] "tap out" [...] by tapping the opponent or the mat. (Tapping one's own body is dangerous because the opponent {{may not be able to}} tell if his or her opponent is tapping.) A choke hold, by disrupting the blood supply to the brain, can cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not submit soon enough.|$|R

The most commonly used method of joining cells of such structures is the high temperature bonding and/or brazing in hydrogen and/or vacuum. These high temperature processes may not be suitable {{for some of the}} new materials that are under consideration. We propose to build structures from cells with an rf choke, taking the cell-to-cell junction out of the electromagnetic field region. These cells may be clamped together in a vacuum enclosure, the <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> ensuring continuity of rf currents. Next, we propose a structure with a <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> in a high gradient cell and a view port which may allow us microscopic, in-situ observation of the metal surface during high power tests.

There is evidence that, although knockouts were common, most pankration competitions were probably decided on the ground where both striking and submission techniques would freely come into play. Pankratiasts were highly skilled grapplers and were extremely effective in applying a variety of takedowns, <b>chokes</b> and <b>joint</b> locks.

Royce fought against often much larger opponents who were practicing other styles, including boxing, wrestling, (including freestyle, Greco-Roman, and American folkstyle), shoot-fighting, karate and taekwondo. It has since become a staple art and key component for many MMA fighters. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and JuJutsu are largely credited for bringing widespread attention to the importance of ground fighting.

40|$|The 703 MHz superconducting gun for BNL ERL {{prototype}} {{was tested}} at JLab {{with and without}} choke-joint and cathode stalk. Without choke-joint and cathode stalk, the gradient reached was 25 MV/m with Q{sup 0 } {approx} 6 E 9. The gun cathode insertion port {{is equipped with a}} grooved <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> for multipacting suppression. We carried out tests with choke-joint and cathode stalk. The test results show that {{there are at least two}} barriers at about 3. 5 MV/m and 5 MV/m. We considered several possibilities and finally found that fine details of the grooved shape are important for multipacting suppression. A triangular groove with round crest may cause strong multipacting in the choke-joint at 3. 5 MV/m, 5 MV/m and 10 MV/m. This paper presents the primary test results of the gun and discusses the multipacting analysis in the choke-joint.

40|$|When the BNL {{high current}} ERL was first envisioned {{the choice of}} {{injector}} went through several iterations before concluding that an SRF injector was the appropriate choice for the task at hand. The design requirements were quite stringent as the injector had to be designed to reach currents never before achieved in any injector. The overall goal was to design an injector capable of delivering up to 0. 5 Ampere at 703. 75 MHz. This criteria was set based {{on the need to}} demonstrate high average current energy recovery at the ERL so that future machines could be designed and built with confidence in the injector. For the ERL the injector needs to be capable of accelerating electrons to 2 - 2. 5 MeV with charges ranging from 0. 7 to 5 nC per bunch depending on the operational parameters being studied. These criteria led to a 1 / 2 cell photoinjector designed to accommodate a demountable photocathode utilizing a novel quarter wave <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> for the cathode insertion mechanism. The cavity requires a total of 1 MW of power coupled to the beam {{in order to meet the}} high current application, necessitating two 500 kW RF power couplers. This AP note will review the overall physics design and analysis, the fabrication sequence, and the testing plan for this cavity...|$|E
40|$|A {{testing program}} for the superconducting {{electron}} gun cavity that has been designed for the Energy Recovery LINAC is being planned. The goal of the testing program is to characterize the RF properties of the gun cavity at superconducting temperatures and, in particular, to study multipacting that is suspected to be occurring in the <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> of the cavity where the vertical test cathode is inserted. The testing program will seek {{to understand the nature}} and cause of this multipacting and attempt to eliminate it, if possible, by supplying sufficient voltage to the cavity. These efforts are motivated by the multipacting issues that have been observed in the processing of the fine-grain niobium gun cavity. This cavity, which is being processed at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory for Brookhaven, has encountered multipacting at a gradient of approximately 3 MV/m and, to date, has resisted efforts at elimination. Because of this problem, a testing program is being established here in C-AD that will use the large-grain niobium gun cavity that currently resides at Brookhaven and has been used for room-temperature measurements. The large-grain and fine-cavities are identical in every aspect of construction and only differ in niobium grain size. Thus, it is believed that testing and conditioning of the large-grain cavity should yield important insights about the fine-grain cavity. One element of this testing program involves characterizing the physical features of the <b>choke</b> <b>joint</b> of the cavity where the multipacting is believed to be occurring and, in particular the grooves of the joint. The configuration of the cavity and the vertical test cathode is shown in Figure 1. In addition, it is important to characterize the groove of the vertical test cathode. The grooved nature of these two components was specifically designed to prevent multipacting. However, it is suspected that, because of the chemical processing that the fine-grain gun cavity underwent along with the vertical test cathode, the geometry of these grooves was altered, presenting the possibility that multipacting may, in fact, be occurring in this area and contributing to the low gradients that have been observed in the fine-grain cavity. Therefore, the Survey and Alignment group in C-AD engaged in measurements of the cavity joint, shown in Figure 2 and the cathode weldment, shown in Figure 3 for the purpose of characterizing the grooves in both the cavity and the vertical test cathode and comparing the dimensions of the cathode with those of the prints supplied by Advanced Energy Systems (AES), the original designer and manufacturer of both the test cathode and the electron gun cavity, in preparation to have a new one manufactured. The goal was to ensure that the articles as built matched the design prints in preparation for manufacturing a new vertical test cathode. This report describes the data collected by the Survey group in these efforts. The endeavor was challenging for the group given the millimeter-scale dimensions of the grooves and the requirement for high precision...|$|E

50|$|When unskilled fighters get {{embroiled in}} combat, a common {{reaction}} is {{to grab the}} opponent {{in an attempt to}} slow the situation down by holding them still, resulting in an unsystematic struggle that relies on brute force. A skilled fighter, in contrast, can perform takedowns as a way of progressing to a superior position such as a Mount (grappling) or side control, or using clinch holds and ground positions to set up strikes, <b>choke</b> holds, and <b>joint</b> locks. A grappler who has been taken down to the ground can use defensive positions such as the Guard (grappling), which protects against being mounted or attacked. If a grappler is strong and can utilize leverage well, a takedown or throw itself can be a form of dix; the impact can render an opponent unconscious. On the other hand, grappling also offers the possibility of controlling an opponent without injuring them. For this reason, most police staff receive some training in grappling. Likewise, grappling sports have been devised so that their participants can compete using full physical effort without injuring their opponents.|$|R
