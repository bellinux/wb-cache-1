40|$|We analyse {{the effects}} of distortionary <b>company</b> <b>car</b> {{taxation}} through increased household car consumption for the Netherlands. We use several identification strategies and demonstrate that for about 20 % of households <b>company</b> <b>car</b> possession increases car ownership. The annual welfare loss of distortionary company taxation through increased car ownership is generally rather small, maximally € 120 per <b>company</b> <b>car,</b> and {{much less than the}} welfare loss through increased expenditure on the <b>company</b> <b>car.</b> However, for policies that exempt households from paying tax on their <b>company</b> <b>car,</b> the annual deadweight loss is likely higher. Our first-best tax policy recommendation is to increase <b>company</b> <b>car</b> tax rates. However, our current results suggest that a second-best policy, which keeps average <b>company</b> <b>car</b> taxation constant but which reduces the marginal tax on cheaper cars and increases the marginal tax on expensive cars, would be welfare improving as overconsumption of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> will be reduced. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|In Europe, the {{preferential}} {{tax treatment}} of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> implies that many employees receive a <b>company</b> <b>car</b> {{as part of their}} compensation package. In this paper, we consider a model in which wages and the decision whether or not to provide a <b>company</b> <b>car</b> are the result of direct negotiation between employer and employee. Using this framework, we theoretically and numerically study first- and second-best optimal tax policies on labour and transport markets, focusing {{on the role of the}} tax treatment of <b>company</b> <b>cars.</b> We show that higher labour taxes and a more favourable tax treatment of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> raise the fraction employees that receives a company car; congestion and congestion tolls reduce it. More importantly, we find that earlier models that ignored the {{preferential tax treatment}} of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> may have substantially underestimated optimal congestion tolls in Europe. The numerical illustration, calibrated using Belgian data, suggests that about one third of the optimal congestion toll is due to the current tax treatment of <b>company</b> <b>cars.</b> We further find that eliminating the preferential tax treatment of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> is an imperfect [...] but easy to implement [...] substitute for currently unavailable congestion tolls: it yields about half the welfare gain attainable through optimal congestion taxes. Finally, the favourable tax treatment of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> justifies large public transport subsidies; the numerical results are consistent with zero public transport fares. ...|$|R

30|$|Comparisons of {{the attitudes}} of the two {{sub-samples}} indicate that privately owned car drivers agree with the statements, “Most people drive differently in a <b>company</b> <b>car</b> compared to a privately owned car” and “In a privately owned car, driving style is more careful compared to a company car” significantly more than do <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers. It {{is important to note that}} <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers agree significantly more than do their counterparts with the statement, “In a <b>company</b> <b>car</b> it is possible to drive more aggressively compared to a privately owned car”. The second and third statements try to catch the same issue of comparing perceptions regarding driving style. It makes sense that people response differently to a positive presentation (driving style is more careful) versus a negative presentation (driving style is more aggressive); it is not trivial to make self-statements about aggressive driving style due to having a <b>company</b> <b>car.</b> This result points out that a relatively more aggressive driving style in <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> is perceived as common, not only among privately owned car drivers, but even more so among <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers. Consequently, the driving behavior of <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers might reflect the perception and, hence, be less safe than that of privately owned car drivers.|$|R

30|$|While {{the effect}} of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> on an {{increase}} in the amount of mileage traveled has received some attention in the literature [2, 18, 26], there has been relatively little research regarding the safety implications of <b>company</b> <b>car</b> use. Most of the latter studies were conducted in Great Britain, where the share of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> was the highest for many years. Accordingly, this paper addresses a number of safety aspects of the use of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> in Israel: the amount of travel, driving behavior, and the level of safety equipment installed in the car.|$|R
30|$|The results clearly {{indicate}} that <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> {{have a significant}} negative impact on both travel behavior and safety. First, company-car arrangements result in significant extra mileages which lead to an excessive level of exposure. In addition, <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> are installed with fewer safety features than privately owned cars, and drivers of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> tend to exhibit fewer safe-driving characteristics. The consequence of such practice is that company-car drivers were also {{found to be more}} involved in road crashes than were drivers who did not have a <b>company</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
30|$|Important {{questions}} arise regarding the safety implications of <b>company</b> <b>cars.</b> It {{is well known}} that traveling by passenger car is less safe than using modes of public transportation (see, for example, [20]). Therefore, the encouragement of passenger car usage engendered by providing <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> should be evaluated. Additionally, certain relevant questions need to be answered: Are the safety features installed in <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> different from those in privately sold cars? Do drivers of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> exhibit different driving behavior from drivers of private cars with regard to energy use and, in particular, safety? These questions should be of concern, especially in a country like Israel, which has experienced a massive growth in the proportion of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> in recent years.|$|R
40|$|In Europe, many {{employees}} receive <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> as fringe benefits induced by taxation. We analyze the welfare effects of <b>company</b> <b>car</b> taxation for the Netherlands by estimating {{to what extent}} car expenditure and private car travel change when employees receive a <b>company</b> <b>car.</b> Tax treatment of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> generates an annual welfare loss, ranging from € 600 to € 780 per <b>company</b> <b>car,</b> mainly due to a shift toward more expensive cars (from € 420 to € 600), but also due to increased private travel (€ 180).

Questionnaire {{results show that}} the annual average for <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> is 26, 600  km., compared to the annual average for privately owned cars of 15, 650  km. The model results verify that having a <b>company</b> <b>car,</b> and controlling for other variables, significantly increases the annual mileage driven. It should be noted that 45  % of <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers stated that they would make fewer trips or would choose alternative modes to a passenger car if they had a privately owned car instead of a <b>company</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
30|$|In 2008, the Israeli {{annual average}} mileage per {{passenger}} car was 16, 700  km., including both privately owned and <b>company</b> <b>cars.</b> The questionnaire {{results show that}} the annual average mileage of a <b>company</b> <b>car</b> is 26, 600  km., compared to 15, 650  km. for a privately own car; that is, 70  % higher. Given that 13  % of the passenger car fleet in Israel consists of <b>company</b> <b>cars,</b> these results seem plausible and provide an explanation of how the annual average mileage per passenger car in Israel is split between <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> and privately owned cars.|$|R
30|$|The {{methodology}} {{consisted of}} two main elements: {{the first was a}} market survey regarding the situation in Israel, including the car market in general, the <b>company</b> <b>car</b> market, mileage rates and safety characteristics, all based on the available official statistics; the second was a questionnaire-based survey distributed to 400 drivers who had a <b>company</b> <b>car</b> and to a control group of 230 drivers who did not have a <b>company</b> <b>car</b> and drove their own vehicles. The focus of the study was on <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers, and the control group was used to compare some average figures per driver.|$|R
30|$|The {{consequences}} {{suggest that}} decision-makers {{may need to}} re-examine <b>company</b> <b>car</b> arrangements {{in order to control}} the excessive exposure and to require that <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> come with a core of sufficient safety features.|$|R
30|$|Lynn and Lockwood [24] {{found that}} the average mileage of a <b>company</b> <b>car</b> in England was more than double that of a privately owned car. Furthermore, the crash rate of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> totaled 0.19 crashes per driver per year, {{compared}} to 0.10 for drivers of privately owned car on work-related car trips and 0.08 for non-work-related trips. The researchers reported that even after controlling for differences in mileage, <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers are 50  % {{more likely to be}} involved in a car crash than are other drivers. Therefore, the proportion of <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers involved in collisions is higher than their share in the fleet [21]. Clarke et al. [6, 7] {{found that the}} main reason for road crashes involving <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> in Great Britain was excess speeds. Dimmer and Parker [11] found that 27  % of <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers reported involvement in at least one crash over the previous 3 -year period, which is considerably higher than the 18  % reported by drivers of privately owned cars in Great Britain. They also concluded that driving under pressure in <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> was a significant cause of crashes of these cars. The foregoing findings suggest that these drivers tend to drive above-average mileage and are exposed to a variety of stressors [21]. The implication is that these factors constitute particular risk factors that are associated with <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers and that result in higher collision liability [10, 27].|$|R
30|$|The {{results suggest}} that {{decision-makers}} may need to re-examine <b>company</b> <b>car</b> arrangements and require that <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> come with a core of sufficient safety features; e.g., a minimum of six airbags. Furthermore, employers should re-examine the type of <b>company</b> <b>car</b> arrangement offered to employees {{in order to control}} their excessive level of exposure. For example, to limit their employees’ permitted mileage rate, to regulate variable expense coverage (e.g., fuel, tolls), etc. In this regard, we would like to note that a recent report [30] which summarizes the <b>company</b> <b>car</b> market for 2011, a year after the last reform in the value of personal use calculation, points out that the absolute number of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> in Israel remains constant whereas their share in the total fleet has slightly decreased to 12.2  %. Figures in this report show that the gap in the average annual mileage driven is similar to the study findings: annual average for <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> in 2011 was 27, 900  km., compared to the annual average for privately owned cars of 15, 800  km. These recent data indicate the continued importance of the results and discussion presented here.|$|R
30|$|This {{study is}} the first to explore the {{potential}} safety implications of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> in Israel. It relies on available national figures, a market survey, and a questionnaire-based survey of <b>company</b> <b>car</b> drivers and privately owned car drivers which lacks randomness. However, {{the purpose of this study}} was not to quantify the safety implications of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> accurately, but to point out the issues and their potential implications. Since <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> are common in the Western world (except for the United States) and enjoy an increasing share of the general car population in many countries, their safety implications should be of concern; however, this issue has not received much attention in the literature and the implications were found to be worrisome. The conclusion of this paper, therefore, should be noted in other countries beyond Israel. Further studies are required to better estimate and quantify the safety implications of <b>company</b> <b>cars,</b> including driving violations and road-crash involvement in various countries.|$|R
30|$|These {{estimates}} {{are consistent with}} other evaluations {{that have been made}} about mileage rates of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> in Israel.
