500|$|The U.S. Wonderbra rollout {{included}} {{events with}} Eva Herzigová in New York's Times Square. The advertisements were toned down {{in comparison to}} the earlier UK campaign. The U.S. print and billboard advertising showed models wearing only the Wonderbra. Underneath read slogans such as [...] "who <b>cares</b> <b>if</b> it's a bad hair day" [...] and [...] "look me in the eyes and tell me that you love me." [...] The $25 Million campaign worked in conjunction to the ongoing media interest in the bra. Although Playtex promoted the authenticity of their [...] "One and Only Wonderbra", the rapid introduction of competitive products meant that the overall U.S. market benefited from a 43% increase in push-up bra sales by the end of 1994.|$|E
500|$|Another {{theme is}} the need for common sense to back up rules. [...] Milo {{journeys}} through a land where, without Rhyme or Reason, the art of governance has been lost, leading to bizarre results. [...] Milo repeatedly meets characters to whom words are more important than their meaning. [...] The Whether Man, for all his talk, is unable to provide Milo with the information or guidance the boy wants, while Officer Shrift's investigation of the overturning of the Word Market contains the forms of law, without justice. The denizens around Digitopolis are little better; the twelve-faced Dodecahedron, named for what he is, turns the logic of his naming on its head when he asks if everyone with one face is called Milo. The attitudes now displayed by the adherents of both brothers are summed up by the Dodecahedron, [...] "as long as the answer is right, who <b>cares</b> <b>if</b> the question is wrong?" ...|$|E
500|$|The 1979 meeting, {{attended}} by the government-employed commission members and Mint Director Stella Hackel Sims, was held eight days late on February 22 due to schedule conflicts. In June 1979, Carter's Presidential Reorganization Project recommended {{the abolition of}} the Assay Commission and two other small agencies. [...] The report estimated that having an Assay Commission cost the federal government about $20,000 and that the work was done better by vending machine manufacturers to avoid having their machines jam. In August, columnist Jack Anderson deemed the commission an example of wasteful spending in Washington, characterizing its activities, [...] "more than a decade ago, the government stopped putting either gold or silver in its coins—but the commission continues to hold its annual luncheon meeting. [...] Solemnly, the commissioners measure the amounts of nonprecious metals in U.S. coins, and strike a medal to commemorate their activities. This useless exercise costs the taxpayers about $20,000 a year." [...] As coin collector and columnist Gary Palmer put it in 1979, [...] "who really <b>cares</b> <b>if</b> the weight of a cupro-nickel quarter is off by a grain or two?" ...|$|E

500|$|After much anticipation, Brian {{receives}} {{an invitation to}} an award ceremony celebrating his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love, [...] by the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence. Convinced {{he is a great}} writer, Brian attempts to gain the family's interest but fails to do so. Once he arrives at the [...] "award ceremony" [...] however, he discovers that he has misunderstood {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "special", [...] prompting him to drown his sorrows at the local bar and realize that he's not a writer at all, but a big fat joke. He drives home drunk that night and accidentally runs over and kills a dog. He secretly buries the dead dog's body outside the Griffins' home and tries to keep quiet about it. Stewie, having witnessed his deed, begins to toy with Brian's guilt, eventually driving him to a state where he decides to confess to [...] "murder". However, when he confesses to Joe and the Griffin family, they all laugh, saying that no one <b>cares</b> <b>if</b> a dog or any other animal is killed, especially by another animal.|$|E

6000|$|She {{suddenly}} knelt {{forward toward}} me, with a glowing darkness in her eyes. [...] "Who <b>cares</b> <b>if</b> it upsets?" [...] she cried. [...] "If you {{say another word}} I will kiss you. And go to the bottom clutching you.|$|E

It will be dark in fifteen minutes --and then let them follow us if they want to. I'm willing.

What a tame part he must have played: his name indeed doesn't occur at all: apparently he didn't enlarge on the girl's good looks, or [...] "comment on her attractive appearance," [...] or anything. I don't suppose that he even asked Mary Forrester out to lunch with him.|$|E
60|$|George {{shook his}} head. A smile {{was on his}} lips, and that smile had in {{it a quality of}} remoteness, as though it belonged to another sphere, and had strayed on to the lips of this man of the world against his will. He seemed trying to conquer it, to twist his face into its {{habitual}} shape, but, like the spirit of a strange force, the smile broke through. It had mastered him, his thoughts, his habits, and his creed; he was stripped of fashion, as on a thirsty noon a man stands stripped for a cool plunge from which he hardly <b>cares</b> <b>if</b> he come up again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Touché!" [...] Karschoff laughed. [...] "There {{is another}} point of view, too. The further east you go, the less value life has. Westwards, it becomes an {{absolute}} craze to preserve and coddle it, to drag it out to its furthermost span. The American millionaire, for example, has a resident physician attached to his household {{and is likely to}} spend the aftermath of his life in a semi-drugged and comatose condition. And in the East, who <b>cares?</b> <b>If</b> not to-day--to-morrow! Inevitability, which is the nightmare of the West, is the philosophy of the East. By the by, Prince," [...] he added, [...] "have you any theory as to last night's attempt?" ...|$|E

Tell me," [...] and she crept nearer, [...] "have I been like the dusk to you, like the warm dusk? Is there magic still? Listen to the ripple of water from your paddle.

6000|$|One very ingenious person terms {{them the}} [...] "natural allies of Englishmen;" [...] another no less ingenious, {{will not allow}} them to be the allies of anybody, and denies their very descent from the ancients; a third, more ingenious than either, builds a Greek empire on a Russian foundation, and realises (on paper) all the chimeras of Catharine II. As to the {{question}} of their descent, what can it import whether the Mainotes[238] are the lineal Laconians or not? or the present Athenians as indigenous as the bees of Hymettus, or as the grasshoppers, to which they once likened themselves?
