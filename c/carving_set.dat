There is a 15th-century screen with tracery in the north aisle enclosing an altar in memory of a soldier killed on the Indian frontier; above the altar is a painting of two saints and a Roman soldier by the cross. The chancel stalls are carved with wild roses, the sedilia with grapes and acorns, and the reredos has a gleaming white sculpture of the Crucifixion with saints and angels under rich canopies.

50|$|As rubber {{stamping}} increasingly gains popularity, {{mostly in}} the United States, it also gains a reputation as an art form.

Companies like Speedball or MasterCarve supply <b>carving</b> <b>sets</b> to amateurs wishing to carve their own rubber stamps, with some including linocut tools. The print from the carved rubber stamp is viewed as work of art on its own, or one or more stamps are used to embellish {{a work of art}} with other components.|$|R

The lockers were designed in 1919 by Mr Shaw Wilson, head of the wood carving department and created by wounded soldiers who had returned from the war.

5000|$|The {{triptych}} {{retains its}} original frames, which are both ornate and served {{to protect the}} piece {{from the effects of}} light and smoke during travel and when in situ. [...] The inner frames have recessed mouldings and are carved with gilded inscriptions, and the top corners of the two wing panels each bear a <b>carved</b> <b>set</b> of coat of arms. The lettering and phrases in Latin serve a dual purpose. They are decorative, similar to margins in medieval manuscripts, and set the context for the imagery; van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison. Writing about Early Netherlandish triptychs, Jacobs says the inscriptions serve to distinguish and separate between the worldly and spiritual spheres, with the panels showing earthly images while the inscriptions on the frames act as reminder of heavenly influence. The letterings reinforce the duality between the earthly and heavenly, with St. Catherine's a reminder of ascetic piety while the figure herself is depicted in sumptuous garments and jewels.|$|R

50|$|The falls {{were once}} a fishing place for the historic, nomadic Abenaki tribes, {{who were part of}} the Algonquian {{language}} family. They caught plentiful salmon and shad. Indigenous peoples had fished at the falls and inhabited the area for thousands of years before European arrival. They <b>carved</b> two <b>sets</b> of faces in the rocks just below the falls (see Bellows Falls Petroglyph Site (VT-WD-8)).|$|R
50|$|His best-known work is {{probably}} The Soul of France, which he executed {{in three different}} materials: the first in plaster in 1921, the second in stone in 1922, and the last in bronze in 1930. In 1926 the sculptor developed a method of direct <b>carving</b> in <b>setting</b> concrete, and much of his subsequent work was integrated with architecture, particularly in collaboration with architect Paul Tournon, and in monumental scale.|$|R
50|$|Smith {{executed}} {{a number of}} church commissions. He carved crucifixes of simple piety, and created panels based on the meditations of St. Augustine.

In the late 1950s, Smith produced a series of carvings of ancient alphabets and alchemy symbols.|$|R

50|$|Initial {{plans for}} the work {{described}} the boulder as being affixed to the trench walls themselves, giving the boulder the appearance of floating when viewed from within the trench via optical illusion, hence the works title.

A 1982 Heizer work in Manhattan, also called Levitated Mass, consists of a much smaller, <b>carved</b> rock <b>set</b> on hidden supports, and does preserve this floating effect.|$|R
