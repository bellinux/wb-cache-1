5|$|Some {{traits are}} governed by only a single gene, but most traits are {{influenced}} by the interactions of many genes. A variation in one of the many genes that <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> trait may have only a small effect on the phenotype; together, these genes can produce a continuum of possible phenotypic values.|$|E
5|$|A {{second factor}} which <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{concentrated}} jet, {{that is more}} applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park has {{a highly}} {{regarded}} global climate change research program. Based in West Glacier, with the main headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992. In addition {{to the study of}} the retreating glaciers, research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which UV-B radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> broader understanding of climate changes in the park. The data collected, when compared to other facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale.|$|E

5|$|Metalloproteinase {{activity}} causes hemorrhage and necrosis {{following a}} snake bite, {{a process which}} aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet and muscle function and damages cell membranes, and thus <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> quick death for the prey animal. The {{study found that the}} venoms of Crotalus fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their tenderizing potential. The researchers also hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in neurotoxicity, such as a type II venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting metalloproteinase from digesting tissue.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{portfolio}} theory (MPT), or mean-variance analysis, is {{a mathematical}} framework for assembling {{a portfolio of}} assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk, defined as variance.

When chewing for extended periods of time (more than 30 minutes) an increased level of mercury vapor is released.

One can therefore conclude that low socio-economic status <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> person's likelihood of being obese.|$|E
