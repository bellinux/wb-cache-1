5000|$|Ranofer is an {{orphaned}} 12-year-old {{boy whose}} {{mother had died}} at birth. Ranofer had learned many things at a goldsmith's shop with his father Thutra. Without his half brother, Gebu, he would be living on the streets. His evil half brother beats and mistreats Ranofer. Ranofer has to stay with Gebu because his father, Thutra, {{died when he was}} young. His father knew Zau, the master goldsmith well. When the tallies of gold sweepings do not add up, Ranofer tries to figure out why. He determines that Ibni the Babylonian porter is smuggling gold to Gebu through wineskins that Ranofer unknowingly carries home. Ranofer tries to stop this, but Gebu forces him to continue, threatening to beat again and sell him into slavery. Ranofer makes two new friends, the Ancient and Heqet, but things take {{a turn for the worse}} when Gebu moves him to his stone <b>cutting</b> <b>shop</b> to be an apprentice after Ibni is caught. Ranofer doesn't like the job as much as his dream where he is to be apprentice by Zau, the master goldsmith.With the help of his new friends, Ranofer discovers that someone else is stealing gold at night after getting suspicious again. After Heqet suggests they work together to spy on Gebu and his evil helpers, they meet in a thicket near the river, share food, and talk about what they have heard during midday when Ranofer gets a break from his awful job at the stonecutters' shop.Ranofer breaks into Gebu's room and discovers a golden goblet which could not come from the area. Ranofer realizes that Gebu has been tomb robbing by the markings at the bottom which say the name of a pharaoh,Thutmose the Conqueror. Also with that evidence he realizes that no one can get as rich as Gebu was getting in one day which supports his theory. He asks the Ancient how tomb robbers are caught, and the Ancient replies, [...] "They must be followed". Ranofer knows from Heqet's eavesdropping that Gebu will be going on another tomb robbing session during the upcoming feast, but keeps his findings to himself. Ranofer follows Gebu to the burial chamber. Meanwhile, Heqet and the Ancient have also gone to the Valley of the Kings looking for Ranofer, putting puzzle pieces together where he has gone and why. Ranofer runs out of the tomb after extinguishing the robbers' torch and one of the giant steps crumbles, trapping Gebu and his companion Wenamon. Ranofer puts a boulder on top of the entrance, and then finds Heqet and the Ancient, who sit on the boulder while Ranofer returns to town. He manages to get into the palace, and tries to get an audience with the queen but is stopped by the palace guards.Qa-nefer, the queenâ€™s dwarf &"pet", believes his story although he finds Ranofer a little crazy. Ranofer finally gets an audience with the queen, and after telling her about the golden goblet with Thutmose's name on it, she decides to test his truthfullness about the tomb robbery by asking him, [...] "What is the object is leaning against the north wall of my parents' burial chamber?" [...] Ranofer answers, [...] "Majesty, it was your father's oaken staff," [...] and the queen immediately senns out soldiers, who catch Gebu & Wenamon [...] Finally, the queen asks what Ranofer wants most in the world. [...] "A donkey," [...] Ranofer said, [...] "so that I may earn a living for myself like the Ancient, be a student of Zau the Gold Master & make fine jewellery for Your Sublime Majesty."

40|$|The {{conflict}} of interest amongst the professionals like client and contractorâ€™s project managers, site engineers, quantity surveyors and designers/architects play crucial roles for the unethical practices, consequently these practices have adverse impact on the product quality, faith of clients and investorsâ€™ confidence {{in the construction industry}}. Hence, this research is aimed at examining the common forms of unethical practices among professionals in the construction industry as well as revealing the key factors that have encouraged these practices. This study depends on the questionnaire survey amongst professionals of the construction industry. The survey is conducted to recognise the view of key stakeholders from different perspectives of the affected parties on the concept of business ethics in the building and construction industry, which play key role in contributing to the national economic growth of the countries. The survey concludes that untimely legal action including changing project managerâ€™s responsibility and delays in payment processes are key ethical practices from owner/client aspect, while contractorâ€™s unethical practices are under bidding, bid <b>cutting</b> and <b>shopping,</b> bid rigging and over billing. But from the consultant aspect; lack of supervision, poor monitoring and taking bribes under different pretend are found to be the encouraging factors for unethical conducts in the construction industry. It is also found that accepting the bribes, gifts and conflicts of interest are the most common forms of unethical practices. The findings from the study is expected to help as an important eye opener to policy makers and regulatory agencies in detecting and preventing unethical practices. In conclusion, avoiding the {{conflict of}} interest and promoting the ethic codes to professionals will help to restore the investor and people confidence, faith of the clients and improve the quality of buildings and infrastructures. The study recommends that promoting awareness regarding the values of ethical behaviour at different forum and ensuring the effective punishment for unethical activities at different stages of project life cycle might reduce the unethical practices in the construction industry...|$|R

However, pork may contain {{high levels of}} microbial contamination such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli which might cause harm to consumers. To determine microbial contamination along the pork value chain, we collected 216 samples from 72 pig farms (floor swab, drinking and waste water), 545 from 49 slaughterhouses (carcass swab, lymph node, rectal feces, floor swab and washing water) and 514 from 220 pork shops in the informal markets (pork cuts, ground pork and cutting board swab) in 2 provinces of Vietnam (Hung Yen and Nghe An). Overall prevalence from combined all types of above mentioned samples at pig farms, slaughterhouses and pork shops for Salmonella were 35 %, 30 % and 37 %, and for E. coli were 91 %, 75 % and 79 %, respectively. Salmonella contamination in the final product (pork at market) was 45 % and an average concentration of 9 MPN/g was recorded.

After all, it was hardly a month yet since the proposition was made to him. He found Mr. Neefit in the back shop, measuring a customer. [...] "I'll be with you in two minutes," [...] said Mr. Neefit, just putting his head through the open door, and then going back to his work; [...] "3--1--1/8, Waddle; Sir George isn't quite as stout as he was last year. Oh, no, Sir George; we won't tie you in too tight. Leave it to us, Sir George. The last pair too tight? Oh, no; I think not, Sir George. Perhaps your man isn't as careful in cleaning as he ought to be. Gentlemen's servants do get so careless, it quite sickens one!"

40|$|Introduction: Food-borne {{disease is}} a major public health issue in Vietnam. The {{contamination}} of popular foods can occur all along the food value chains. It {{is important to understand}} how and where food safety issues arise in order to mitigate and prevent food-borne diseases. Risk-based approach is a tool for managing food safety, however in Vietnam it is rarely applied and the capacity for application is still lacking. This paper describes how food safety risk assessment research has been applied for the pork value chain in Vietnam. Methods: We have conducted a risk assessment research to assess health risks related to pork consumption in the context of pig smallholder value chains and pork traded in informal markets. We collected 216 samples from 72 pig farms (floor swab, drinking and waste water), 545 samples from 49 slaughterhouses (carcass swab, lymph node, rectal feces, floor swab and washing water) and 514 samples from 220 pork retailed shops at informal markets (pork cuts, ground pork and cutting board swab) in Hung Yen and Nghe An provinces in the north and central of Vietnam. These 1275 samples were analyzed to detect qualitatively and quantitatively for Salmonella and E. coli. Chemical hazards (antibiotic, growth promoters, and heavy metal residues) in 190 pork samples from informal markets were also analyzed. Pork consumption behavior and cross-contamination modalities during pork preparation were assessed. Findings and interpretations: Overall prevalence of Salmonella combined from all types of above mentioned samples at pig farms, slaughterhouses and pork shops were 35 %, 30 % and 37 %, respectively. Salmonella contamination in the final product (pork at market) was 45 % and an average concentration of 9 MPN/g was recorded. E. coli average loads along different points of the chain were 5. 3 Â± 1. 4 (farm floor swabs), 2. 9 Â± 0. 9 (carcass swabs), 3. 1 Â± 1. 0 (slaughterhouse floor swabs), and 3. 3 Â± 1. 1 (market <b>shop</b> <b>cutting</b> board swabs) logCFU/cm 2, whereas pork from market had 3. 4 Â± 0. 9 logCFU/g. Demonstrated high levels of Salmonella in the final product (pork at market) induces the potential health risks for the consumers. High values for E. coli indicates general poor hygiene along the chain. 50 % and 16. 7 % pooled samples were positive with sulfamethazine and chloramphenicol, with average residue levels of 156 Âµg/kg and 0. 54 Âµg/kg, respectively. A quantitative risk model is being developed and integrates information on contamination along the pork value chain to characterize the health risk caused by Salmonella. Appropriate hygiene practices and management are required to achieve better pork quality and reduce the risk for the consumers...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis investigates and {{assesses the}} {{productive}} use and spread of solar PV (photovoltaic) systems among rural SMEs (small and medium enterprises) in two rural regions in Tanzania. It also analyzes sustainability aspects of productive solar PV usage {{and the future}} prospects {{for this type of}} activities. As the situation is today {{there is a lack of}} electricity in a major part of the country and there is a big need for rural electrification. In recent years there has been a lot of effort and money put into the solar PV industry in order to achieve a higher quality of life for the rural poor. One of the goals except for producing electricity, has been to achieve a self-sustaining market where solar PV are used for generate income in rural areas, i. e. productive use of solar PVs. The aim of this report is to, by a case study, map to which extent there is a productive use of solar PV and what type of businesses that has evolved. Moreover, the features of these businesses have been investigated in order to predict future prospects and diffusion for these types of activities. In addition, the research has comprised a sustainable development approach in order to investigate how and if productive use of solar PVs fit into the norms of sustainability on an economic, social and environmental level. It was found that, within the two investigated areas, there was an extensive use of solar PVs for productive use. The most common type of business was cell phone charging business, followed by barber <b>shops</b> <b>cutting</b> hair. Other businesses that were found were TV-shows, cold beverage sales and light equipped hostels. The prospects for further diffusion of solar PVs seems to be good, mainly because of the short payback times encountered, but also due to appropriate actions on a governmental level that has resulted in acceptance and awareness among the inhabitants. In addition, people saved money and time switching from other energy sources such as generator to Solar PVs because of low running costs. Concerning the sustainability issues, solar PVs for productive use definitely is a step towards a sustainable development, particularly on a local level. On a larger level, PVs alone might not be the sole solution but is still of importance. However, there are some improvements that can be done such as a more effective usage of batteries and implementation of recycling stations for used batteries in order to decrease the environmental load. During the initial phase of the project literature studies were performed in order to gain as much knowledge as possible within the subject of solar PVs for productive use and also aiming to be prepared for a working in a completely different environment and culture. On site, interviews with businessmen and other for the study important people were conducted. The gathered information from the interviews was then analyzed and evaluated in order to be able to draw appropriate conclusions...|$|R
