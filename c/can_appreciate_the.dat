From this fact we <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> capacity that Angola has to increase production for not only for the national market but also the international one. Investing in this sector can help reduce unemployment and more specifically in the rural areas. This will undoubtedly have consequences on the living standard of rural civilians.|$|E
25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way to}} explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|E

[...] "To look out at this kind of creation and not believe in God is to me impossible," [...] said Glenn after his second (and final) space voyage. He saw no contradiction between belief in God and the knowledge that evolution is [...] "a fact" [...] and believed [...] evolution should be taught in schools: [...] "I don't see that I'm any less religious that I <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> fact that science just records that we change with evolution and time, and that's a fact. It doesn't mean it's less wondrous and it doesn't mean that there can't be some power greater {{than any of us}} that has been behind and is behind whatever is going on." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{narrative}} of the School Rumble anime is designed to mirror that of the manga, which results in multiple short story segments with no significant connection. Shown {{from the perspective of}} its characters—notably Tenma and Harima as they attempt similar ploys to get their crush to notice their affection—the anime uses absurdist humor which often combines elements of popular culture to explore the love-triangle, with jokes that work on multiple levels. One such example, highlighted by Lisa Marie, reviewer for Anime Today, is the bike chase scene in episode1 of season one. She notes that while anyone <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> chase's inherent humor, those familiar with Initial D will find another level of appreciation that nevertheless does not interfere with viewers who do not catch the deeper reference. Lisa Marie comments [...] "I certainly admit watching an insane bike chase cross paths with Initial Ds famous AE86 has a bit more [...] when you know why there's a cheesily rendered race car in slow moving Eurobeat." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly favorable, calling it [...] "the only show with any sense of mystery." [...] John Teti of The A.V. Club found the episode to have a [...] "fantastic premise for a Peter Griffin adventure" [...] but went on to state that he gives the episode [...] "points for a strong first half, but I wish that the writers had pushed {{themselves}} {{a little harder to}} make this one go the distance." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN reiterated his own enjoyment of the premise {{of the episode}}, but went on to state, [...] "While I <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> point that good comedy does take a certain degree of wit and cleverness, this just wasn't a very satisfying end to an idea that had so much potential." [...] In a much more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the underuse of cutaways, going on to note, [...] "Reducing the reliance on cutaways seems to be the continuing trend for the series, and I think it's a good move [...] It forces smarter writing, and creates a better narrative structure." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, John C. Bean sees the speech as the final stage in the process of Katherina's change of heart towards Petruchio; [...] "if we <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> liberal element in Kate's last speech – the speech that strikes modern sensibilities as advocating male tyranny – we can perhaps see that Kate is tamed not in the automatic manner of behavioural psychology but in the spontaneous manner of the later romantic comedies where characters lose themselves and emerge, as if from a dream, liberated into the bonds of love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing the 2014 reissue of Extra Texture, for Paste magazine, Robert Ham views [...] "the desperate 'Grey Cloudy Lies'" [...] as a [...] " [...] when Harrison's focus returns", and a ballad that [...] "cut deep". Writing for vintagerock.com, Shawn Perry {{considers}} the track to be {{a highlight of}} [...] "a creative and introspective album that's aged well", and [...] "a song that, despite its solemn, down-trodden lyrics, resonates {{with a level of}} reflection that somehow makes you feel {{everything is going to be}} OK". In his review for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka similarly opines that this and other [...] "confessional songs" [...] on Extra Texture have [...] "worn well". Trynka continues: [...] " [...] a dark exploration of the depression into which he'd sunk in 1974, after being mocked for his spiritual homilies.

2500|$|Singing differs {{by region}} in {{that a high}} falsetto {{is used in the}} north while in the south a lower range is used. [...] "To the {{unfamiliar}} listener, Indian singing sounds exotic, different, and difficult to comprehend," [...] and the contrast in the quality or timbre of voice used in traditional Indian and European musics may {{have much to do with}} that difficulty. However, [...] "to the trained ear, melodies flow, ascend and descend" [...] while dancers react to changes in the structure of the melody and the song. Boye Ladd says, [...] "If you give me a stink song, I'll dance stink. If you give me good music, I'll give you a great show," [...] implying that one <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> music through the dancing, which is readily appreciated by everyone. But others say that today's contemporary contest dancers are expected to dance their best no matter how well or poor the drum group is that is singing for their contest. Generally, Native American singing follows a pentatonic scale (as if playing only the black keys on a piano) and while, to the outsider, it may sound like we're just pounding a drum and going [...] "Heya-heya-heya-heya" [...] sometimes there are actual words in Cree, Pikuni, Lushuutsid, Niimipuu, Lakhota, Sahpatin, Salish, Ojibwemowin or many other Native languages.|$|E
