40|$|Pseudorandom binary {{sequences}} with optimal {{balance and}} autocorrelation have many applications in stream cipher, communication, coding theory, etc. It {{is known that}} binary sequences with three-level autocorrelation should have an almost difference set as their characteristic sets. How to construct new families of almost difference set is an important research topic in such fields as communication, coding theory and cryptography. In a work of Ding, Helleseth, and Martinsen in 2001, the authors developed a new method, known as the Ding-Helleseth-Martinsens Constructions in literature, of constructing an almost difference set from product sets of GF(2) and the union <b>of</b> two cyclotomic <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> four. In the present paper, we have constructed two <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> almost difference set with product sets between GF(2) and union sets <b>of</b> the cyclotomic <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> 12 using that method.
