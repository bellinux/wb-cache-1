50|$|This {{technique}} was first developed and named by Eric Kmiec at Thomas Jefferson University. Since its discovery {{there has been}} debate over chimeraplasty’s effectiveness. In the 6 September 1996 article of Science, Kmiec claimed that <b>chimeraplasty</b> was 50% effective in human cells. This figure was later disputed {{by a number of}} universities; <b>chimeraplasty</b> is now considered around 0.0002% effective in transforming yeast cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chimeraplasty</b> is a non-viral {{method of}} gene therapy. <b>Chimeraplasty</b> changes DNA {{sequences}} using a synthetic strand of RNA and DNA. This strand of RNA and DNA {{is known as}} a chimeraplast. The chimeraplast enters a cell and attaches itself to the target gene. The DNA of the chimeraplast and the cell complement each other except {{in the middle of the}} strand, where the chimeraplast's sequence is different from that of the cell. The DNA repair enzymes then replace the cells DNA with that of the chimeraplast. This leaves the chimeraplast's new sequence in the cell's DNA and the replaced DNA sequence then decays.|$|E

This targeted gene correction strategy, also called <b>chimeraplasty,</b> initially was shown to change episomal sequences (Yoon et al., 1996), but various examples of altering genomic sequences in both mammalia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGene {{augmentation}} is {{an attractive}} and viable approach in treatment of inherited diseases, despite its limitations, such as the eliciting of host immune response, and the sustainability of gene expression. Therefore, alternative therapeutic approaches are being investigated, {{such as the use}} of chimeric RNA–DNA oligonucleotides (chimeraplasts), in which a mutated allele that already exists in an affected individual can be corrected. Although the only gene defects that can be corrected by <b>chimeraplasty</b> are point mutations, and the correction frequencies are variable, it has been observed that intracellular delivery of oligonucleotides is likely to be more efficient than that of plasmid DNA or viral vectors. Furthermore, corrected genes are expressed from their autologous promoters, thus ensuring correct spatial and temporal expression. Here we report on the recent progress made in the field of <b>chimeraplasty,</b> and the problems encountered...|$|E
40|$|Targeted {{corrective}} gene conversion (TCGC) holds much promise {{as a future}} therapy for many hereditary diseases in humans, but there still remain significant impediments to effective mutation correction {{and it is clear}} that significant work remains to improve TCGC to levels where it can be considered for translation to the clinical setting. Nevertheless, mutation correction frequencies varying between 0. 0001 % and 40 % have been reported using <b>chimeraplasty,</b> oligoplasty, triplex-forming oligonucleotides, and small corrective PCR amplicons. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chimeraplasty</b> {{or the use}} of {{chimeric}} RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (RDOs) {{to correct}} single-base mutations emerged in the field of gene therapy with reported base pair conversions of up to 40 %. We investigated the applicability of <b>chimeraplasty</b> to correct a point mutation in the von Willebrand Factor (VWF) gene resulting in a von Willebrand Disease (VWD) type 3 phenotype. Although we have access to VWD type 3 dogs, we used wild type endothelial cells for in vitro studies, as isolation of endothelial cells from VWD type 3 dogs is not straightforward due to the bleeding diathesis. RDOs to convert the wild type VWF gene into VWD type 3 gDNA were constructed and used in various transfection conditions. However, no gene conversion could be detected either in the RNA or in the DNA isolated from transfected cells, not even with the sensitive colony hybridisation technique, despite the presence of RDOs in the cell nucleus. On the other hand, sequence analysis of isolated DNA of transfected cells did reveal the presence of VWF type 3 DNA. However, this apparent conversion is very likely not the result of RDO-mediated nucleotide conversion as the same VWF type 3 DNA sequence was also detected in negative control experiments where no RDO was used. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Sickle cell {{disease and}} &# 946;-thalassemia {{represent}} {{the most common}} forms of hemoglobinopathies. Since the first successful bone marrow transplant in 1981, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only treatment option for the patients. However, the current routine therapies for these conditions are limited by the availability of suitable donors and graft-vs-host disease. On the other hand, hemoglobinopathies were long considered amenable to the genetic correction by available gene transfer technologies. Therefore, gene therapy strategies aim at the globin gene transfer resulting hemoglobin function recovery. Here we review the studies and clinical applications of gene therapy for the hemoglobinopathies within the timeline of developed technologies, including the viral vectors, transposons, homolog recombination as a treatment modality together with generation of {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} and <b>chimeraplasty.</b> This brief review highlights the gene therapy strategies, current developments, challenges and future perspectives for hemoglobinopathies...|$|E
40|$|Apolipoprotein (apo) E is a {{polymorphic}} plasma protein, synthesized {{mainly by}} liver. Here, we evaluate whether synthetic DNA-RNA oligonucleotides (chimeraplasts) can convert a dysfunctional isoform, apoE 2 (C [...] > T, R 158 C), which causes Type III hyperlipidemia and premature atherosclerosis, into apoE 3. First, we treated recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells stably secreting apoE 2 with a 68 -mer apoE 2 to apoE 3 chimeraplast. About one-third of apoE 2 was converted to apoE 3, and the repair was stable through 12 passages. Subcloning treated cells produced both apoE 2 and apoE 3 clones. Direct sequencing and reverse transcription {{polymerase chain reaction}} confirmed the genotype, whereas phenotypic change was verified by isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting of secreted proteins. Second, we established that the APOE 2 gene can be targeted both in vivo, using transgenic mice overexpressing human apoE 2, and in chromosomal context, using cultured lymphocytes from a patient homozygous for the epsilon 2 allele. We conclude that <b>chimeraplasty</b> {{has the potential to}} convert the apoE 2 mutation in patients with Type III hyperlipidemia to apoE 3...|$|E

Nevertheless, mutation correction frequencies varying between 0. 0001 % and 40 % have been reported using <b>chimeraplasty,</b> oligoplasty, triplex-forming oligonucleotides, and small corrective PCR amplicons. We have investigated potential mechanisms that impede effective gene correction and potential methods by which to improve the efficiency of dystrophin gene mutation correction in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Arrest of cell cycle using Hydroxyurea and double Thymidine blockade significantly improved TCGC frequency in mdx myoblasts at the gene level, but it was clearly evident that transfection reagents rendered TCGC efficiency variable with some, albeit limited expression of the corrected loci. The latter aspect was investigated by adjustment of transfection conditions, resulting in more robust gene correction with better (but still variable) expression of the corrected locus in a proportion of the treated cells, but still affected by the toxic chemistries used to mediate improved gene correction. These studies report new methods and strategies for improvement of TCGC by cell cycle arrest using molecular methods less toxic than transfection reagents or chemical cell cycle inhibitors: Molecular technologies such as PNA chemistry, advanced electromaterials, and CNA motifs that present lesional signals to the DNA metabolic machinery are potential technologies that may impart levels of efficiency that translate more efficiently from gene to protein levels and more readily facilitate consideration towards clinical application...|$|E
