Among other things China should find new points of economic development that moves China away from being the [...] "World's Factory" [...] and improves energy efficiency. China also must avoid unnecessary waste, foster a sustainable economy and encourage renewable energy sources to reduce China's reliance on petrochemical energy resources.|$|R

This article aims to analyze the position and role, assess the resource availability, discuss the geographic distribution, market scale and industry development, and present the policy options of biomass in China. The resource availability and geographical distribution of biomass byproducts are assessed in terms of crop residues, manure, forest and wood biomass byproducts, municipal waste and wastewater. The position of biomass use for power generation is just next to hydropower among types of renewable energy in China. The potential quantity of all biomass byproducts energy in 2004 is 3511 Mtce (Mtce is the abbreviation of million tons of <b>coal</b> <b>equivalents</b> and 1 Mtce is equal to 10 (6) tce.), while the acquirable quantity is 460 Mtce. Biomass energy plays a critical role in rural regions of China. The geographical distribution and quantity of biomass byproducts resources depends mainly on the relationship between ecological zones and climate conditions. Our estimation shows that the total quantity of crop residues, manure, forest and wood biomass byproducts, municipal waste and wastewater resources are 728, 3926, 2175, 155 and 48240 Mt (million tons), respectively. Crop residues come mainly from the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Sichuan. All manure is mainly located in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei and Hunan. Forest and wood biomass byproducts are mainly produced in the provinces or autonomous regions of Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, while most of municipal waste mainly comes from Guangdong, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Hubei and Jiangsu. Most of wastewater is largely discharged from advanced provinces like Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong and Henan. Biomass byproducts' energy distribution also varies from province to province in China. Based on the analysis of the market scale and industry development, the article argues that China's biomass energy industry is still at a very early stage of development and that Feed-in Tariffs (FIT) might be the best policy option for China to promote its development of biomass energy.

40|$|An {{alternative}} approach is proposed {{to develop an}} improved permeability model for coalbed methane (CBM) and CO 2 -enhanced CBM (ECBM) recovery, and CO 2 geosequestration in coal. This approach integrates the textural and mechanical properties to describe the anisotropy of gas permeability in coal reservoirs. The model accounts for the stress dependent deformation using a stress-strain correlation, which allows determination of directional permeability for coals. The stress-strain correlation was developed by combining mechanical strain with sorption-induced strain for any given direction. The mechanical strain of coal is described by the general thermo-poro-elastic constitutive equations for solid materials under isothermal conditions and the sorption-induced strain is approximated by treating the swelling/shrinkage of <b>coal</b> matrix <b>equivalent</b> to the thermal contraction/expansion of materials. With directional strains, the permeability of coal in any given direction can be modeled based on the theory of rock hydraulics.

The potential of rice husk for each province was obtained by analyzing the rice production of 22 provinces that have rice production greater than 1 million tons per year. The study shows that the potential of rice husk and potential electrical energy increased by about 36. 8 % within 12 years or an average increase of around 3. 1 % per year. For the potential of rice husk in 22 provinces, the total gain was estimated 12. 76 × 106 tons which is equivalent to 6. 62 × 106 tons of <b>coal</b> or <b>equivalent</b> to 3. 68 × 106 tons of oil.
