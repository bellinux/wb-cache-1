40|$|Laser {{photodissociation}} {{of respiratory}} proteins {{is followed by}} fast geminate recombination competing with escape of the oxygen molecule into the solvent. The escape rate from myoglobin or hemerythrin has been shown previously to exhibit a reciprocal power-law dependence on viscosity. We have reinvestigated oxygen escape from hemerythrin using a number of viscous <b>cosolvents</b> of varying molecular weight, from glycerol to dextrans up to 500 kDa. In isoviscous solutions, the strong viscosity dependence observed with small <b>cosolvents</b> is progressively reduced upon increasing the <b>cosolvent's</b> molecular weight and disappears at molecular weights greater than about 100 kDa. Thus, viscosity is not a suitable independent parameter to describe the data.

25|$|To {{choose the}} matrix for each solid analyte, three {{criteria}} must be considered. First, it should dissolve the solid compound to be analysed (with {{or without the}} aid of a <b>cosolvent</b> or additive), thus allowing molecules of that compound to diffuse to the surface layers, replenishing the sample molecules that have been ionized or destroyed by interaction with the fast atom beam. It {{should also be noted that}} another mechanism for explanation of ion formation in FAB involves the idea that sputtering occurs from the bulk rather than the surface, but in that case, the solubility is still largely important to insure homogeneity of solid analyte in the bulk solution. Secondly, the matrix should have a low volatility under the conditions of the mass spectrometer. As mentioned above, as the matrix is depleted, the ionization decreases as well, so maintaining the matrix is vital. Thirdly, the matrix should not react with the solid analyte in question, or if it does react, it should be in an understood and reproducible way. This ensures reproducibility of analysis and identification of the actual analyte rather than a derivative of the analyte.|$|E
