A few examples {{would be the}} vehicle that a person owns, boats, and <b>capitalized</b> <b>expenses.</b> They add value to a person's life but unlike other assets they do not make money and should be a class of their own. In the business world, for tax and bookkeeping purposes, these are depreciated over time {{due to the fact}} that their useful life runs out. This is known as accumulated deprecation and the asset will eventually need to be replaced.|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis of 2008 will likely lead to public demands for increased regulation of market participants and for increased transparency in financial reporting. While {{it is appropriate}} for the public, and its institutions, to focus on these recent financial market abuses, {{it is also important}} not to lose sight of previously identified and ongoing schemes used to perpetrate fraud in the financial markets. The results of a SEC study of its own enforcement actions, covering the period July 31, 1997 to July 30. 2002, found that {{the most common type of}} abuse during this period was that of earnings manipulation or inappropriate earnings management. While the study found that improper revenue recognition led to the largest number of enforcement actions, there were also numerous enforcement matters involving improper expense recognition. These included improper capitalization or deferral of expenses, improper use of reserves, and other misstatements. The purpose of this paper is to provide evidence on this other, less common, approach to earnings management, the misstatement of expenses. In particular, the paper reports on the improper capitalization of expenses as a means to manipulate earnings. In order to provide evidence on the ways companies have improperly <b>capitalized</b> <b>expenses</b> to manipulat...|$|E

Main purpose of EBIT is to evaluate company’s performance without {{taking into account}} influence of tax environment and ways of financing, as management as a rule {{does not have any}} influence on them. Amount of financial expenses shows first of all efficacy of financial policy, and the sum of tax payments indicates optimization income policy of the enterprise, that is why they should not influence evaluation of the enterprise’s economic activities. EBITDA allows evaluating enterprise’s ability to bear expenses connected with financing <b>capitalized</b> <b>expenses,</b> as well as pay interests on present and new loans. In this connection differences between the notions of amortization and removing of capital assets, as they are often mistakingly taken as synonyms. Basic distinctions in approaches to financial reports according to IAS and Statement of Standard Accounting Practice are described. National financial report form is well defined (as distinct from international format), so unified methods for calculation of these indices has been proposed on the basis of financial report data made according to requirements of national Standard Accounting Practice. It is stressed that EBIT and EBITDA should be calculated {{not on the basis of}} operation earnings figures, but earnings from all enterprise’s regular activities. Operational profit is the basis for calculating OIBDA. The analyzed indicators will be good for national analysts and add the existent instruments for analyzing enterprise activity...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine whether}} managers' {{decisions}} to <b>capitalize</b> or <b>expense</b> R&D expenditures convey {{information about the}} future performance of the firm. Focusing on a French setting where managers can choose to capitalize R&D expenditures under certain circumstances, we find that, after controlling for industry effects, firms that capitalize R&D expenditures spend less on R&D, have more volatile R&D efforts, and are smaller and more leveraged than firms that expense R&D expenditures. We also find that capitalizers capitalize R&D outlays {{when they need to}} meet or beat thresholds. Finally, we show that the decision to capitalize R&D is generally associated with a negative or neutral impact on future performance, even after controlling for self-selection. Our results also show that when firms both <b>capitalize</b> and <b>expense</b> R&D expenditures, the expensed portion exhibits a stronger (and negative) relationship with future performance. Market-based tests corroborate these findings. While we cannot unambiguously establish whether our findings imply that management uses R&D capitalization to manage earnings or because it is unable to estimate the earning power of R&D projects, our results suggest that management is unable to truthfully convey information about future performance through its decision to capitalize R&D. Our findings, based on real data as opposed to simulated data, therefore contrast with previous supportive evidence in favor of capitalization in the literature. ...|$|R

The empirical evidence suggests that investors value positively R&D information, most especially when it is quantitative and relates to the capitalisation of such expenses. Their value relevance is less obvious when the information is qualitative, and vanishes completely when both types of information are considered simultaneously in the models. The change in the accounting environment in 2005 seems to affect the empirical evidence.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the economic effects of capitalizing development costs during a race between two firms {{to discover and}} develop a new technology. Winning the race requires success in the research stage and success in the development stage. Development costs are expensed in some settings, but capitalized in others. Capitalization of development costs provides a credible signal regarding progress in the race, allowing the rival to make a more informed decision regarding whether to proceed with development. We {{study the effects of}} this signal on the firms’ investment decisions and social welfare. We show that if both firms <b>capitalize</b> instead of <b>expense</b> development costs, aggregate investment in research weakly increases but aggregate investment in development weakly decreases. We also characterize the accounting policies that the two rival firms would adopt if they could freely choose either an expensing policy or a capitalization policy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sets out}} from the {{contemporary}} discussion on the need of separate financial reporting standards for {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs), and focuses on financial reporting information needs in the context of entrepreneurial and growth-oriented SMEs. The main purpose of the study is to sort out areas of financial reporting information that are likely to be of significance tomanagers of entrepreneurial SMEs in their provision of information to users. In order to fulfill this purpose data has been collected in several sequential steps where the results of each step have provided with significant input and structure to the carrying through of the following step/s. The first step consists of a literature study of previous empirical studies about accounting information in entrepreneurial contexts. In the second step, interviews have been conducted with accounting experts engaged in the current discussion on the development of accounting standards for SMEs. The third and fourth step consists ofdocument studies of comment letters to the Swedish standard setter Bokföringsnämnden’s (BFN) two drafts of the accounting standard Financial reporting in small companies (K 2) and IASB’s Esposure draft of an IFRS for SMEs. According to the study results the continuous high demand for financial capitalis a great challenge to managers of entrepreneurial SMEs in their efforts to make their entities develop and grow. In this context, financial reports make up an important tool mainly for informing external capital providers, among which bankers are considered to hold a prominent position. The high demand for financial capital also makes risk capitalists and other external owners more important as financiers of entrepreneurial SMEs than what is the case in SMEs in general. Other important users of entrepreneurial SMEs’ financial reports are customers, suppliers, employees, potential acquirers and management. One of the areas of financial reporting information that have been sorted out in this study as likely to be of significance to managers of entrepreneurial SMEs in their provision of information to users is cash flow. Information on cash flow is likely to be significant in the entrepreneurial context not at least since the development of entrepreneurial activities puts {{a lot of pressure on}} managers to secure the continuous inflow of cash. The extent to which capital providers make use of cash flow information provides with further argument for its importance in the entrepreneurial context. Also, entrepreneurial entities tend to rely on intangible assets to a high extent, and these assets are in general not sufficiently reflected in the balance sheets. Cash flow provides in this respect straightforward and reliable complementary information that is important when assessing the prospects of the business. Besides information on cash flow, information on intangible assets is according to the results of this study likely to be significant in an entrepreneurial context. The possibility to <b>capitalize</b> <b>expenses</b> for intangible investments is crucial not at least to avoid the legal consequences of bankruptcy law, which may be critical to the very survival of development-intensive entrepreneurial SMEs. The importance of innovation as a central part of the entrepreneurial process also makes financial reporting information on intangibles highly relevant from an informational perspective. In addition, financial ratios in general, and financial ratios measuring various aspects of growth - i. e. growth ratios - in specific, have been sorted out as likely to be of specific importance to include in the financial reports of entrepreneurial SMEs. Besides disclosure of additional information on individual intangible assets, additional disclosure of information related to the collective earning capacity of ongoing projects - including the business concept of the reporting entity - has also been identified as significant in the entrepreneurial context...|$|R

5000|$|The Repair Allowance Method, {{also known}} as the Repair Allowance Safe Harbor, is a {{proposed}} regulation to the Internal Revenue Service administrative regulations. This optional method of calculating deductions affects individuals and corporate taxpayers who own property subject to MACRS and repair or improve property used in a trade or business. This method permits taxpayers to treat both material and labor cost used to repair or improve property as a trade or business expense. Therefore, taxpayers who elect this method may deduct this cost as an above the line deduction under 26 CFR §. 162. This method is a proposed simplification, when compared to other deduction methods, because it does not distinguish between repair and improvement of property. Without the proposed regulation, improvements to property must be <b>capitalized</b> and not <b>expensed</b> because improvements are considered a capital expenditure. Arguably, this proposed regulation would not be used by a taxpayer who has a clearly defined business expense otherwise deductible under IRC §. 162. And even California adopts the PRA ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the result}} of the {{adoption}} of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprise (2006) in the beginning of 2007, the accounting treatment of Research and Development (R&D) expenditure changed dramatically. IT (Information Technology) industry, an R&D intensive industry, was expected to experience more significant change than average. Meanwhile, the financial market in China was increasing mature and investors were becoming more sophisticated. These conditions provide a meaningful ground to investigate the value relevance of R&D reporting based on data of listed IT firms. The work observed all IT firms listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange over the period of 2009 to 2015. In this study, I find evidence supporting the implementation of accounting reforms on R&D increases the value relevance of financial reports. In addition, I also find positive (negative) association between the market value and R&D asset (expense). This study extends the existing studies regarding the effect of R&D reporting reform by using ‘AS-IF’ method. Besides, it collaborates with existing argument that valuation effect of capitalized R&D expenditure is distinct from that of <b>expensed</b> <b>capitalized</b> R&D expenditure. The existence of difference of valuation effect between GEM and Other Boards (Main Board and SME Board) is examined as well, while the study fails to find evidences supporting such difference...|$|R
5000|$|Approximately USD $374.3 {{million was}} {{invested}} into the Wynn Palace Cotai project {{during the first}} quarter of 2015, making the accumulative investment equal to USD $2.2 billion. As of April 2015, the total projected budget including [...] "construction costs, <b>capitalized</b> interest, pre-opening <b>expenses,</b> land costs and financing fees" [...] was USD $4.1 billion. Wynn Macau, Ltd was seeking government approval for 500 gaming tables by the fall of 2015. In November 2015, around 130 non-resident construction workers for Wynn Palace staged a meeting outside the PRC Liaison Office, alleging unpaid and involuntary overtime. The Labour Affairs Bureau (DSAL) subsequently stated that it had been aware of the situation since October 2015, and had promised staff to examine the issue. Also in November 2015, general construction delays pushed the projected opening back three months, from March 25, 2016 to the original date of June 25, 2016. As a result, Leighton Holdings (then renamed CIMIC) lost access to a USD $38 million bonus. Wynn Resorts share values fell 6 percent after the announcement, before rising again shortly afterwards.

40|$|In the US, FASB NR 2 {{demands the}} full expensing of R & D costs {{because they would}} not {{contribute}} to future earnings. In Europe, however, article 37 of the Fourth European Directive allows companies to capitalize their costs of R & D as an intangible asset or to expense them immediately in their income statement. The paper exploits that difference and tries to analyze empirically which factors determine the reporting choice made by firms in Europe. More specifically, we analyze the capitalization {{as well as the}} disclosure decision of 321 Flemish firms, who are actively performing R & D activities. Company information from their financial statements is combined with privately held data on the size and nature of their R & D activities. The disclosure decision is analyzed separately from the capitalization decision. Only 30 % of the 321 R & D active firms in the sample disclosed the amount of R & D spent in their financial statements. About 70 % of those firms disclosing choose to capitalize. The empirical results show that the disclosure decision is determined by the R & D characteristics {{as well as by the}} financial performance of the firm. The probability that a firm discloses its R & D expenses is increasing with its R & D intensity, the existence of an R & D department and cooperation with universities or other firms. The current as well as the long term financial performance are also relevant for the disclosure decision. Once the firm has decided to disclose its R & D expenses, the decision to <b>capitalize</b> these <b>expenses</b> is mainly determined by the financial performance. If firms can not repay part of their debt and if stakeholders do not receive a sufficiently high income, firms are more likely to capitalize their R & D costs. When the group of capitalizing firms is compared to the group of expensing firms, whether disclosing or not, our results suggest that the R & D intensity, at least in highly innovative industries, and the financial performance determine the capitalization of R & D expenses. Our results suggest that the expenses of successful R & D activities are more likely to be capitalized as an asset in the balance sheet.

40|$|For many years, most IT {{departments}} {{used the}} same software development methodology called waterfall. This methodology outlines distinct phases for project completion; each phase needing to be completed {{prior to the start}} of the next. The primary accounting standard for allocating costs for software development is written in the language of waterfall. Costs are either <b>capitalized</b> or <b>expensed</b> depending on the type of activity that was performed. IT departments have been moving toward a new group of software development methodologies called agile. These methodologies do not follow the phases of waterfall. This makes the current accounting standard for software development difficult to interpret and determine the appropriate transaction. This further hinders IT organizations attempts to better quantify business value of software projects. To examine this issue, a new construct called accounting clarity is introduced in this research. Accounting clarity is an agreement between IT and accounting regarding the treatment of software development costs. This study shows that it is essential for both IT and accounting to work together to determine a solution. The accounting clarity construct is developed from the “ilities” of software quality models and the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Level 3 key process area (KPA) of intergroup coordination. Intergroup coordination provides the concepts for accounting clarity as the two groups must coordinate to determine the appropriate accounting treatment. The “ilities” are characteristics that should be followed and measured throughout a software development project to ensure long term maintainability of software. This study proposes that accounting clarity should be one of the 2 ̆ 2 ilities 2 ̆ 2 in the software quality model. A portion of the study of accounting clarity examines the relationship between accounting clarity and project control, proposing a positive relationship between the two variables. Then the study examines factors that help to increase accounting clarity. These factors were derived from teamwork and coordination literature. To test the hypothesized relationships, a survey methodology was used. Individuals working on agile software development projects were participants in the survey. This study contributes to both the IT and accounting literature. The research provides a framework to examine other contexts in which the current accounting standards are unclear. As changes happen more frequently in business, this is more likely to occur on a frequent basis. The study has practical implication for software development as it highlights the importance of understanding the accounting implications prior to the project and continuously throughout the lifespan of the software. Adding accounting clarity to the “ilities” of software quality helps software development teams include this in project plans with any software development methodology...|$|R

40|$|A presente dissertação efetua uma revisão de {{literatura}} sobre a manipulação de resultados nas empresas portuguesas não cotadas, que consequentemente afeta a qualidade de informação das suas demonstrações financeiras. O fenómeno de manipulação de resultados é complexo e de difícil deteção, o que torna este tema controverso e de análise relevante, principalmente para os leitores das demonstrações financeiras. As razões porque os indivíduos cometem fraude ou manipulam as demonstrações financeiras podem ser várias. Para tentar explicar este acontecimento Donald Cressey criou o chamado “Triângulo da Fraude”. Em que o primeiro vértice contempla a necessidade financeira sentida pelo indivíduo, caracterizada pela pressão própria sentida quer por necessidade de liquidez financeira quer por integração num grupo social cujo somatório entre as possíveis perdas e ganhos e a justificação para os seus atos (racionalização) o leva a decidir pela prática ou não de atos fraudulentos. Neste triângulo também se encontra considerada a oportunidade que pode ser caracterizada através de falhas do controlo interno. Desta forma, esta dissertação pretende averiguar de acordo com diferentes graus de rentabilidade as empresas que tendem mais a manipular os seus resultados, tendo em conta os diferentes objetivos destas empresas e dos seus gestores. De entre vários métodos de deteção de manipulação de resultados foi escolhido o que se aplica melhor a análise em questão, sendo que alguns deles são de difícil aplicação para grande nº de empresas e contextos diferentes. O modelo utilizado, elaborado por Francis (2004), parte de outros modelos já criados para estabelecer uma ligação entre sete atributos, entre os quais a qualidade dos accruals, para verificar a qualidade de informação das demonstrações financeiras e o impacto que tem nas decisões dos investidores. Através de um modelo econométrico que vamos utilizar para calcular a qualidade dos accruals na nossa amostra, este chega a conclusões sobre as influências dos atributos como iremos explicar de seguida. As empresas que têm uma melhor rentabilidade têm assim um incentivo maior de fuga aos impostos enquanto, as empresas que apresentam uma rentabilidade mais reduzida necessitam de maior financiamento e desse modo vão ter um conflito de incentivos quando chega a hora de tomar decisões. Isto porque, estas precisam de apresentar melhores resultados para obterem melhores taxas de financiamento mas ao mesmo tempo querem pagar menos imposto. Daqui pode-se esperar que as empresas manipulem mais quando têm uma rentabilidade mais elevada, de forma a reduzirem o valor a entregar ao Estado. Através da análise das regressões concluímos que as empresas que têm mais tendência a manipular são as que têm rentabilidades mais elevadas e mais reduzidas de acordo com o esperado. This thesis makes {{a literature}} review {{on the results}} of manipulation in unlisted Portuguese companies, which consequently affects the quality of information in its financial statements. The phenomenon of earning management is complex and difficult detection, which makes this controversial and relevant analysis theme, especially for readers of the financial statements. Within the earning management definition exists manipulation of actual transactions and handling of accrued expenses and revenues. The results consist of cash flows and accruals of expenses and revenues, and the handling of each of these components will affect the results. A manager can make operational decisions with an impact on financial numbers - cash flows, such as offering products with high discounts in {{the end of the year}} in order to anticipate sales to reach a goal or cut spending on research and development. The second form of managers achieve the desired results is to handle the increases in spending and revenues. In this method, the company does not change its activity, but rather opportunistically recorded profit of its existing activities. Examples that increase the results are the reduction of provisions, <b>capitalize</b> <b>expenses</b> and avoid depreciation of assets. Accrued expenses and revenues create the opportunity to manipulate results because there is a need for estimates, forecasts and judgments. This type of manipulation is derived from selective interpretation of accounting rules, since the company is free to choose between the existing methods in the standards. The reasons why individuals commit fraud can be several. To try to explain this event Donald Cressey created the so-called "Triangle of Fraud. " In the first vertex includes financial need felt by the individual, characterized by felt own pressure or by need for financial liquidity either by integration into a social group whose sum of the possible gains and losses and the justification for their acts (rationalization) takes to decide to practice or not fraudulent acts. In this triangle is also considered that the opportunity may be characterized by internal control failures. Thus, this dissertation seeks to ascertain according to different degrees of profitability companies that are more likely to manipulate the results, taking into account the different objectives of these companies and their managers. Among several match-fixing detection methods was chosen that best applies the analysis in question, some of which are difficult to apply to large number of companies and different contexts. The model developed by Francis, La Fond, Olsson, Schipper 2004 from other models already created to establish a link between seven attributes, including the quality of accruals and deferrals, to check the quality of information in the financial statements and the impact it has on investor’s decisions. Through an econometric model that we use to calculate the quality of accruals and deferrals in our sample, this draws conclusions about the influence of the attributes as we explain below. Companies that have a better profitability thus have a greater incentive for tax evasion while, companies that have a lower profitability require increased funding and thus will have an incentive conflict when it comes time to make decisions. This is because they need to deliver better results to get better financing rates but at the same time want to pay less tax. It can be expected that most businesses to manipulate when they have a high yield in order to reduce the amount to deliver to the state. Through the analysis of regressions we concluded that companies are more likely to handle are those that have higher yields and lower in line with expectations...|$|R
