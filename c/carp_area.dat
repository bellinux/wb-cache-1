40|$|Predicting the {{potential}} geographical distribution and spread of non-native species is of major concern to ecologists. Silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, ranked {{as one of}} the world’s 100 worst invasive species, were introduced into South Africa in 1975, but {{the potential}} spread of this invader has not yet been addressed, despite recent studies indicating its potential ecological impacts in South Africa. The potential range of silver carp in South Africa was identified based on ecological niche modelling (ENM) using the maximum entropy method. Models were constructed using occurrence records and a defined background, and calibrated using a k-fold method. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was used to evaluate model performance. Both the native and introduced range model accurately predicted species occurrences (AUC 0. 98 and 0. 94, respectively). Most of the north-eastern part of South Africa, including the Limpopo River Basin, where the presence of silver carp has been recorded, was correctly predicted as climatically suitable for silver <b>carp.</b> Other <b>areas</b> with suitable climatic conditions for silver carp but with no known introductions were also identified. The model demonstrated the potential use of ENM to predict the potential range of silver carp in South Africa.

50|$|Shipbuilding is {{a longstanding}} {{practice}} at Galați: {{by the late}} 18th century, longboats, canoes, sailboats and kayaks were being built there for both commercial and military use. Due to Moldavia's being a vassal state, most war vessel production was {{on behalf of the}} Ottoman Navy through the 1820s. The wood, of high quality, came from forests upstream and was brought by raft. It was not until the late 1830s, following the establishment of a free port at Galați, that the bulk of its ships started being used domestically: seven vessels were built there in 1839, followed by ten in 1840. In 1893, a local resident named Fernic purchased the arsenal of the fleet stationed there and the Naval Mechanical Factory, beginning ship production at what was called Șantierul Naval Fernic Galați ("Fernic Shipyard Galați"). Four river monitors (NMS Ion C. Brătianu, Mihail Kogălniceanu, Alexandru Lahovari and Lascăr Catargiu) were commissioned for the Romanian Navy in 1907. Built in sections in the Austro-Hungarian port of Trieste, they were assembled in Galați.

40|$|The {{prevention}} of non-indigenous aquatic invasive species spreading into new areas {{is a goal}} of many resource managers. New techniques {{have been developed to}} survey for species that are difficult to capture with conventional gears that involve the detection of their DNA in water samples (eDNA). This technique is currently used to track the invasion of bigheaded carps (silver carp and bighead carp; Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and H. nobilis) in the Chicago Area Waterway System and Upper Mississippi River. In both systems DNA has been detected from silver carp without the capture of a live fish, which has led to some uncertainty about the source of the DNA. The potential contribution to eDNA by vectors and fomites has not been explored. Because barges move from areas with a high abundance of bigheaded <b>carps</b> to <b>areas</b> monitored for the potential presence of silver carp, we used juvenile silver carp to simulate the barge transport of dead bigheaded carp carcasses, slime residue, and predator feces to determine the potential of these sources to supply DNA to uninhabited waters where it could be detected and misinterpreted as indicative of the presence of live bigheaded carp. Our results indicate that all three vectors are feasible sources of detectable eDNA for at least one month after their deposition. This suggests that current monitoring programs must consider alternative vectors of DNA in the environment and conside...|$|R
40|$|The Kolleru Lake area (KLA) in Andhra Pradesh being a {{predominant}} centre for carp {{culture is}} known as the ‘Carp Pocket of India’. This paper has described the highly efficient fish marketing system prevalent in the KLA and has compared it with the marketing of Indian Major Carps (IMC) in other major aquaculture states like West Bengal and Orissa and marine states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The marketing channels, market intermediaries, price spread and marketing efficiency have been presented. A comparison of the marketing channels at several fish markets has revealed that the price spread for IMC from Kolleru is highest at the Mumbai market and lowest at the Coimbatore market. Consequently, fishermen’s share in consumer price has been found highest for Coimbatore at 61. 54 per cent and lowest for Mumbai at 47. 06 per cent. Similarly, the marketing efficiency was the highest for Coimbatore at 2. 60 and lowest for Mumbai at 1. 89. Retail price for KLA carps has been found lower than locally cultured <b>carps</b> at various <b>areas,</b> reflecting the efficiency of the marketing channel in providing cheap fish transported over large distances and through a large number of intermediaries. The reasons for the efficient IMC marketing system at KLA have been discussed and the study has recommended the development of efficient fish marketing system {{in other parts of the}} country.

40|$|Understanding early-life {{habitats}} {{is crucial}} for managing non-indigenous large river fishes such as silver carp that are threatening to invade the Great Lakes and may significantly impact economically valuable Great Lakes fisheries. Silver carp inhabiting the upper Illinois River directly below the electrical deterrent barrier (installed on a canal in the Chicago area that connects the Illinois River with Lake Michigan) possess the greatest potential to invade the Great Lakes. However, adult silver carp inhabiting this reach of the Illinois River may have originated from many points throughout the Mississippi River basin (e. g., Illinois River or Middle Mississippi River), and {{the relative importance of}} these potential origination locations is unknown. As such, this study was used to identify natal habitats of adult silver carp in the upper portion of the Illinois River. Based on the stable oxygen and stable carbon isotopes of otoliths (earstones) from individual fish, we have determined that silver <b>carp</b> inhabiting the <b>area</b> below the electric barrier originated from within the Illinois River itself, the Middle Mississippi River, and floodplain lakes along the lower Illinois River valley. Because of the geographically widespread points of origin for individual fish, management efforts for eradication or control of silver carp in the upper Illinois River should be directed at a similarly broad geographic scale. While potentially challenging to implement, large-scale removal of silver carp and the closely related bighead carp in the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers could greatly reduce the probability of these species breaching the electrical barriers and entering the Great Lakes...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Wisconsin-River Falls, 2012. vi + 50 leaves. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 46 - 50). Geographic Information System Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) {{present a}} threat to biodiversity throughout the world. They {{have the potential to}} create a monoculture by out-competing the endemic species. Habitat degradation through turbation and resuspention of sediment through feeding processes creates a transition from a macrophyte-dominated clear water state to a phytoplankton-dominated turbid water state. Within the Harney Basin in southeast Oregon lies Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. It is composed of about 187, 000 acres of diverse habitat, mostly falling under the wetland classification. This northern cold desert, characterized by low precipitation and the wetlands in the region are subject to feast-famine water regime, receiving around nine inches of precipitation annually. Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is a cornerstone in the Pacific Flyway for transitional habitat as well as breeding habitat for many species of waterfowl and colonial nesting birds. It is Oregon's most important waterfowl production <b>area.</b> Common <b>carp</b> pose a very significant threat to the integrity of the waterfowl and nesting bird habitat. The first carp were reported around 1950 and now out compete the native species for food and habitat. There have been constant effort to mitigate the issue of carp in Malheur's waters but the myriad of waterways and desirable feeding and spawning habitat and the relatively durable common carp make it an ongoing battle for effective management. One problem is the lack of data on carp distributions and habitat use. The advancements in geographic information systems and an abundance of spatial data creates an opportunity to apply ecological, habitat, and infrastructure data to the carp deterrence process. In this study, an application of the Habitat Suitability Model will be used to identify the most desirable habitat for carp in two stages of the year: high water and low water. By combining the available data, it is possible to identify acreages of suitable habitat for common carp during the high water season and with an updated dataset of the water delivery system, suitable areas for the common carp during the low water season can be identified. In this study, acreages of suitable spawning habitat for carp are identified as well as areas, which are inhabited by <b>carp,</b> and <b>areas</b> that are not. Five pilot areas are identified where carp barriers are being used to identify the possibility of a carp-free water delivery system. These models are to be utilized in the ongoing effort to minimize the common carp distributions, numbers and impacts on waterfowl habitat to the greatest extent possible...|$|R
40|$|Although {{environmental}} DNA (eDNA) {{has been}} used to infer the presence of rare aquatic species, many facets of this technique remain unresolved. In particular, the relationship between eDNA and fish distribution is not known. We examined the relationship between the distribution of fish and their eDNA (detection rate and concentration) in a lake. A quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for a region within the cytochrome b gene of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio or ‘carp’), an ubiquitous invasive fish, was developed and used to measure eDNA in Lake Staring (MN, USA), in which both the density of carp and their distribution have been closely monitored for several years. Surface water, sub-surface water, and sediment were sampled from 22 locations in the lake, including areas frequently used by <b>carp.</b> In water, <b>areas</b> of high <b>carp</b> use had a higher rate of detection and concentration of eDNA, but there was no effect of fish use on sediment eDNA. The detection rate and concentration of eDNA in surface and sub-surface water were not significantly different (p$ 0. 5), indicating that eDNA did not accumulate in surface water. The detection rate followed the trend: high-use water. low-use water. sediment. The concentration of eDNA in sediment samples that were above the limit of detection were several orders of magnitude greater than water on a per mass basis, but a poor limit of detection led to low detection rates. The patchy distribution of eDNA in the water of our study lake suggests that the mechanisms that remove eDNA from the water column, such as decay and sedimentation, are rapid. Taken together, these results indicate that effective eDNA sampling methods should b...|$|R
40|$|Carp {{production}} in Serbia is traditionally conducted in large area fish farms under a semi-intensive farming system. Total area under fish farms in Serbia amounts to approximately 11 thousand hectares, with 8. 5 thousand hectares being under exploitation each year. In 2004, a significant intensification of production began at fish farms in Serbia which have traditionally organized their production under a classic semi-intensive farming system. Intensification of production was undertaken with partial or complete feeding with pelleted complete feeds. That way <b>carp</b> production per <b>area</b> unit (kg/ha) was increased by over 50 %. Apart from intensification {{by means of}} using the complete extruded feeds, construction of specialized fish farms for intensive carp production started in 2003. At this moment (2016) their area amounts to several hundred hectares. Data from intensive carp fish farms indicate that production of one- and two-year fish has been approximately 3 t/ha in the period from 2003 until today, with a mild increase during {{the last couple of}} years. With the purpose of determining the cost effectiveness of investments in fish ponds for intensive carp production two organization-economic models have been analyzed in the study. The models have been formed based on in line with the specific features of the Serbian carp farming, which has been analyzed both on the basis of data obtained from the scientific and specialist literature but also from the production practice. Models of intensive carp {{production in}} technical and production sense have been defined in the study and production plans have been prepared. Therefore, based on such defined models, dynamic methods have been prepared for assessment of economic effects of the investments. The results of the analysis have demonstrated that investment in intensive carp production on 10 ha fish farm is not, and on 50 ha fish farm is barely economically justifiable, as well as methods for improvement of economic effectiveness...|$|R
