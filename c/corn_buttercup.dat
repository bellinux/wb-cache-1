50|$|Forests cover 299.8 km2 (67.26%) of the area. The most {{widespread}} genera {{of trees}} are beech, linden and ash. Other plants include orchids, for example Dactylorhiza fuchsii subsp. sooiana and Ophrys holubyana. Private fields are often home to endangered species, such as corncockle (Agrostemma githago), <b>corn</b> <b>buttercup</b> (Ranunculus arvensis) and Nigella arvensis.|$|E
50|$|Ranunculus arvensis, the <b>corn</b> <b>buttercup,</b> devil-on-all-sides or scratch bur, is a {{plant species}} of the genus Ranunculus. It is native to Europe, {{but it can be}} found on other continents as an {{introduced}} species and sometimes a weed, including in North America and Australia. It was formerly a common annual arable weed in Britain, but is now rare there. It is most often found in moist places, such as spring puddles in meadows.|$|E
40|$|Ranunculus arvensis (<b>corn</b> <b>buttercup)</b> is a {{plant species}} of the genus Ranunculus that is {{frequently}} used in the Far East to treat rheumatic diseases and several dermatological disorders. In Turkey, the plant {{is seen in the}} eastern and southeastern Anatolian highlands, which are underdeveloped areas of the country. Herein, we report three patients who used Ranunculus arvensis for the treatment of arthralgia and osteoarthritis. A distinctive phytodermatitis developed on the right thumb in one patient (48 -year-old male), on the anterior aspect of both knees in another patient (70 -year-old female) and all around both knees in a third (59 -year-old female). The patients were treated with topical antibiotics and daily wound dressing, and none of them experienced any complications. Ranunculus arvensis was confirmed as the cause of the phytodermatitis in the three cases. Poultices of plants applied to the skin demonstrate beneficial effects on many dermatological and rheumatic diseases; however, they have several adverse effects that should not be ignored. In this study, we also present a review of 25 cases reported in the literature...|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} an {{important}} wildlife site - owls, yellowhammers, whitethroats, turtle dove, song thrush, nightingales and bullfinches can be seen. There are also many wild plants such as <b>corn</b> mint, hairy <b>buttercup,</b> sea aster and ox-eye daisy.|$|R
50|$|Carotenoids {{are common}} in many living things; they give the {{characteristic}} color to carrots, <b>corn,</b> daffodils, rutabagas, <b>buttercups</b> and bananas. They {{are responsible for the}} red of cooked lobsters, the pink of flamingoes and salmon and the yellow of canaries and egg yolks.|$|R
50|$|Mount Kedros (Όρος Κέντρος), is a {{mountain}} {{on the island}} of Crete in Greece. It is located southwest of the Ida massif with which it forms the two flanks of the Amari Valley. Mount Kedros is conical-shaped and made of limestone. Its landscape abounds with canyons and rock cliffs and is almost barren, with dry scrubs and phrygana being the major forms of vegetation. Kedros grows endemic or rare flowers such as tulips, anemones, <b>corn</b> marigolds, turban <b>buttercups,</b> tassel hyacinths, orchids, etc., and provides ideal conditions for the nesting of falcons as well as larger birds of prey such as griffon vultures, golden eagles and Bonelli's eagles. Owing to the significance of its flora and fauna, Mount Kedros is a node of the Natura 2000 network of protected areas. An E4 mountain footpath climbs up to the highest peak of the site. To the north of Kedros are located the plateau Gious Kampos and the Kissano gorge.|$|R
