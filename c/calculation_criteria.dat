40|$|Wind-excited {{vibrations}} of slender structures can induce {{fatigue damage}} and cause structural failure without exceeding ultimate limit state. Unfortunately, the growing {{importance of this}} problem is coupled with an evident lack of simple <b>calculation</b> <b>criteria.</b> This paper proposes a mathematical method for evaluating the crosswind fatigue of slender vertical structures, which represents the dual formulation of a parallel method that the authors recently developed with regard to alongwind vibrations.

The aerodynamic crosswind actions on the stationary structure are caused by the vortex shedding and by the lateral turbulence, both schematised by spectral models. The structural response in the small displacement regime is expressed in closed form by considering only the contribution of the first vibration mode. The stress cycle counting is based on a probabilistic method for narrow-band processes and leads to analytical formulae of the stress cycles histogram, of the accumulated damage and of the fatigue life. The extension of this procedure to take into account aeroelastic vibrations due to lock-in is carried out by means of ESDU method.

40|$|Internal {{corrosion}} {{of carbon}} steel pipelines {{is a major}} problem encountered in water service. In terms of prediction of the remaining lifetime for water pipelines based on the corrosion allowance, the three main approaches are corrosion modelling, corrosion inhibitor availability, and corrosion monitoring. In this study we used two theoretical corrosion models, CASSANDRA and NORSOK M- 506 of quite different origin in order to predict uniform corrosivity of hot aquifers in eight different pipelines. Because of the varying <b>calculation</b> <b>criteria</b> for the different models, these can give very different corrosion rate predictions for the same data input. This is especially true under conditions where the formation of protective films may occur, such as at elevated temperatures. The evaluation of models was conducted by comparison using weight-loss coupons and three corrosion inhibitors were obtained from commercial suppliers. The tests were performed during the 60 -day period. Even though inhibitors’ efficiencies of 98 % had been achieved in laboratory testing, inhibitors’ availabilities of 85 % have been used due to logistics problems and other issues. The results, given in mmpy, i. e. millimeter per year, are very consistent with NORSOK M- 506 prediction. This is presumably because the model considers the effect of the formation of a passive iron carbonate film at temperatures above 80 °C and significant reduction in corrosion rate. Corrosion inhibitor A showed a better performance than inhibitors B and C in all cases but the target corrosion rates of less than 0. 1 mmpy were achieved for all inhibitors. The chemical type of corrosion inhibitor A is based on quaternary amines mixed with methanol, isopropyl alcohol, xylene and ethylbenzene. Based on the obtained results the carbon steel lifetime of 30 years, provided proper inhibitors are present and 3 mm corrosion allowance, can be achieved for hot aquifers service with presented water compositions...|$|E

Each patient was studied on three occasions, in random order, separated by at least 48 h. At 0900 h, via an indwelling forearm cannula, 10 micrograms desmopressin, 100 micrograms CRH, or {{a combination of the two}} were given as an iv bolus; thereafter, blood was drawn every 15 min for 2 h. The responses to the individual agents were determined according to the timing and <b>calculation</b> <b>criteria</b> suggested by Nieman et al. (1993). A total of 25 patients with Cushing's syndrome were studied: 17 patients with pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome, Cushing's disease (CD); 5 patients with occult ectopic ACTH secretion (EC); and 3 patients with primary adrenal (ACTH-independent) Cushing's syndrome. In this series, the best discrimination among ACTH-dependent patient groups was achieved using the combined test. Using the responses of plasma cortisol, all 17 patients with CD showed a rise greater than any of the 5 patients with EC, whereas 1 patient with CD showed a plasma ACTH response within the range seen in the patients with EC. Plasma cortisol responses to desmopressin alone were seen in 14 of 17 patients with CD and 1 of 5 patients with EC and, after CRH alone, in 15 of 17 patients with CD but in no patient with EC. In contrast, plasma ACTH responses after CRH alone were seen in 14 of 17 patients with CD and 2 of 5 patients with EC and, after desmopressin alone, in 12 of 17 with CD and 3 of 5 with EC, thus indicating overlapping responses between the groups and poorer discrimination. No responses were seen in the ACTH-independent group. These data indicate that desmopressin causes the secretion of ACTH and cortisol in patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, and that in combination with CRH, it may provide an improvement over the standard CRH test in the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Furthermore, these data suggest that there may be abnormalities in vasopressin receptor function or number in ACTH-secreting tumors...|$|E
