5|$|Second, Giáp made {{a mistake}} in Nà Sản by {{committing}} his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He learned his lesson: at Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and antiaircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Wooden artillery pieces were built as decoys and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire.</b> As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns Giáp possessed.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Minh {{opened fire}} with a massive {{artillery}} bombardment in March. After several days the French artillery commander, Charles Piroth, unable to respond with any effective <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire,</b> committed suicide. The Viet Minh occupied the highlands around Điện Biên Phủ and bombarded the French positions. Tenacious fighting on the ground ensued, reminiscent of the trench warfare of World War I. The French repeatedly repulsed Viet Minh assaults on their positions. Supplies and reinforcements were delivered by air, though as the key French positions were overrun, the French perimeter contracted and the air resupply on which the French had placed their hopes became impossible. As the Viet Minh antiaircraft fire took its toll, fewer and fewer of those supplies reached the French. The garrison was overrun in May after a two-month siege, {{and most of the}} French forces surrendered. A few of them escaped to Laos. The French government then resigned, and the new Prime Minister, the left-of-centre Pierre Mendès France, supported French withdrawal from Indochina.|$|E

50|$|An {{even greater}} problem than lack of {{soldiers}} {{was the lack}} of materiel; foreign shipments of anti-tank weapons and aircraft were arriving in small quantities. The ammunition situation was alarming, as stockpiles had cartridges, shells, and fuel only to last 19-60 days. The ammunition shortage meant the Finns could seldom afford <b>counterbattery</b> or saturation <b>fire.</b> Finnish tank forces were operationally non-existent.|$|R
25|$|Despite heavy <b>counterbattery</b> and sniper <b>fire</b> on all gun {{positions}} {{during the}} final five days of the siege, the second platoon of Company B fired approximately 200 rounds per day and eliminated a number of pill boxes and other reinforced positions, enabling units of the 29th Infantry Division to steadily move forward.

25|$|In July, the {{division}} began combat operations during the Lublin–Brest Offensive. On {{the night of}} 1 August, a group of scouts led by Nikolayev crossed the Vistula. They were fired upon by German artillery and Nikolayev {{was wounded in the}} leg. Once upon the other bank, he reportedly refused to go back across the river. When {{the division}}'s assault began, Nikolayev used his radio {{with the help of the}} other men in the patrol to report coordinates of German artillery batteries. This allowed for effective <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire,</b> reportedly contributing to the success of the attack. The division's advance created the Magnushevsky bridgehead. On 26 October 1944, Nikolayev was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin.|$|E
25|$|There, she was {{attached}} to Rear Admiral Noble's TG78.2 on 26 June and again sailed for Borneo. This time the objective was Balikpapan, Borneo, where the First Australian Corps was to be landed. Smith began shore bombardment at 0700, 1 July, and received return fire from enemy guns ashore that splashed close aboard. The Japanese gunners finally got her range and sent three shells through her number one stack. The shells failed to explode, and only superficial damage was done. One visible gun emplacement was taken under <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire</b> and silenced. Smith left the next day for Morotai, picked up a resupply convoy, and was back in Balikpapan on 16 July.

25|$|The 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment and 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment {{began moving}} {{forward to the}} front line, in {{preparation}} of {{the launch of the}} attack. Tanks which were assigned to a secondary role in the attack, moved toward the front lines to move into support positions. Before 09:00, the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment opened up with close-in mortar concentrations and sustained machine gun fire to prevent the Japanese from seeking protection next to the Marine lines. Just before the attack commenced, Japanese artillery began a counterbarrage which blasted the Marine lines, pounding the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment positions and the assembly areas of the assault battalions, with the extremely accurate fire threatening to force a halt to the attack plans. The value of the forward observers on the ridge was utilized to discover the location of the Japanese battery and <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire</b> was requested.

50|$|McNair {{departed}} New York on 5 March 1944 for the Pacific. By 14 June, {{as a unit}} of Destroyer Squadron 54 (DesRon 54), she was in {{the screen}} for the battleships that opened their guns against Japanese shore installations on Saipan. For the next 19 days, she provided fire support and carried out antisubmarine patrols. On 3 July, she was detached from TF 52 to escort ships between Eniwetok and Saipan. Rejoining that force on the 25th, she provided fire and screening support for the invasion of Tinian. Detached again 2 August, McNair steamed to Guadalcanal to prepare for the next offensive operation, the Palaus. From 6-21 September, she supported the land forces effecting the capture and occupation of the southern Palaus with <b>counterbattery</b> and harassing <b>fire.</b> After the battle of Angaur, she sailed south to Manus Island, the staging area for the Leyte invasion.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedKey threat trends have identified shortfalls in Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), a mission {{area that is}} undergoing rapid evolution. The Navy's ability to effectively provide sea-based fire support to ground forces is profoundly challenged by mobile and reduced dwell time targets. Furthermore, longer range enemy weapon systems, which must be destroyed at greater ranges prior to their engagement of friendly forces, will make NSFS timeliness a difficult proposition. To overcome these threat trends, the United States is developing sophisticated weapons that promise increased lethality, greater ranges and improved responsiveness. However, the development of robust firing policies to ensure effective weapon utilization has lagged behind the hardware. Existing computer models and simulations have not addressed the question of NSFS gun/missile firing policy. This thesis develops the Naval Surface Fire Support Simulation (NSFSSim) model, a discrete-event simulation that serves as an analysis tool to determine favorable firing policies for future NSFS gun and missile systems in support of determining the appropriate NSFS weapons mix. NSFSSim models ships and their associated NSFS weapons in <b>counterbattery</b> and call <b>fire</b> missions against mobile, reduced dwell time targets. Exploratory analysis using NSFSSim yields useful insights, and the component-based architecture underlying the model provides significant flexibility for further analysis[URL] Navy (U. S.

25|$|On September 4, the IDF {{withdrew from}} the Alayh and Shuf Districts, falling back to the Awwali River. The LAF was not {{prepared}} to fill the void, moving instead to occupy the key junction at Khaldah, south of BIA. That same day, BIA was again shelled, killing two Marines and wounding two others. No retaliation was given due to the ROE. As the LAF moved slowly eastward into the foothills of the Shuf, accounts of massacres, conducted by Christians and Druze alike, began to be reported. On September 5, a Druze force, reportedly reinforced by PLO elements, routed the Christian LF militia at Bhamdun and all but eliminated the LF as a military factor in the Alayh District. This defeat obliged the LAF to occupy Suq-AlGharb to avoid conceding all of the high ground overlooking BIA to the Druze. U.S. positions were again subjected to constant indirect fire attacks; consequently, <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire</b> based on target acquisition radar data was employed. F-14 tactical airborne reconnaissance (TARPS) missions were conducted {{for the first time on}} September 7. On September 8, naval gunfire from offshore destroyers was employed for the first time in defense of the U.S. Marines.|$|E
500|$|Richard Ewell's {{orders from}} Lee {{had been to}} launch a demonstration, or minor diversionary attack, on the Union right flank. He started the attack at 4 p.m. with an {{artillery}} bombardment from Benner's Hill, which caused little damage to the Union lines, but the <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire</b> returned upon the lower hill was murderous. Ewell's best artillerist, 19-year-old Joseph W. Latimer, the [...] "Boy Major", was mortally wounded. Ewell did not launch a conventional infantry attack until after 7 p.m., after Anderson's assault on Cemetery Ridge had crested. At around 8 p.m., two brigades of Jubal Early's division reached the Union artillery of East Cemetery Hill near the Baltimore Pike, but Union reinforcements drove them from the hill.|$|E
500|$|The {{weapon is}} less {{accurate}} than conventional artillery guns, but is extremely effective in saturation bombardment, and was particularly feared by German soldiers. A battery of four BM-13 launchers could fire a salvo in 7–10 seconds that delivered 4.35 tons of high explosives over a [...] impact zone, making its power {{roughly equivalent to}} that of 72 conventional artillery guns. [...] With an efficient crew, the launchers could redeploy to a new location immediately after firing, denying the enemy the opportunity for <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire.</b> Katyusha batteries were often massed in very large numbers to create a shock effect on enemy forces. The weapon's disadvantage was the long {{time it took to}} reload a launcher, in contrast to conventional guns which could sustain a continuous low rate of fire.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} more convoy runs, Nevada {{set sail}} for the United Kingdom {{to prepare for}} the Normandy Invasion, arriving in April 1944. Her float plane artillery observer pilots were temporarily assigned to VOS-7 flying Spitfires from RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus). She was chosen as Rear Admiral Morton Deyo's flagship for the operation. During the invasion, Nevada supported forces ashore from 6–17 June, and again on 25 June; during this time, she employed her guns against shore defenses on the Cherbourg Peninsula, [...] " [...] to lean back as [...] hurled salvo after salvo at the shore batteries." [...] Shells from her guns ranged as far as [...] inland in attempts to break up German concentrations and counterattacks, even though she was straddled by <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire</b> 27 times (though never hit).

Returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 May, she escorted aircraft carriers on exercises in Hawaiian waters and on the 31st got underway for the Mariana Islands. Stopping en route at Kwajalein, she arrived off Saipan on 14 June and with Fire Support Unit I commenced firing on the island. Closing to , Remey was straddled by shore battery fire, but her return fire destroyed two of the offending batteries. The next morning, while screening [...] off Tinian, she destroyed three more guns. In the afternoon, she shelled Saipan and throughout that day and the next continued <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire.</b> On 17 June, she provided gunfire support for the troops on Saipan, then on 18 June returned to the battleships and remained with them through the aerial attacks of the Battle of the Philippine Sea. On 22 June, she resumed shore bombardment duties and shelled enemy troop concentrations and supply dumps. Through June–July, she remained in the area, continuing her support for operations on Saipan and extending it to ground forces fighting on Tinian after 24 July.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fortification}} at Schoenenbourg is the {{one that}} saw the most combat between September 1939 and June 1940. [...] Over this period, over 17,000 shells were fired from the fort, and it was itself the target of over 3000 shells and 160 bombs. [...] Schoenenbourg was in action against the German 146th Infantry Division, which applied pressure along the Line. On 19 June 1940, German Stukas attacked Schoenenbourg and other ouvrages, returning on the 20th and 21st. [...] The attacks on the 21st were joined by a bombardment with 420mm siege mortars, lasting three days. [...] The bombardment cracked walls, but did not disable the position. Schoenenbourg fired during this period in support of nearby casemates, not seriously affected by the bombardments. Schoenenbourg's turrets were retracted to receive the heavy shells, and raised during the lengthy reloading period for <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire.</b> The inventory of German ordnance fired against Schoenenbourg was assessed after the armistice, and found to comprise 160 aerial bombs, 50 42cm shells, 33 28cm shells, and approximately 3000 smaller projectiles, the most ammunition used against any fortification in France. The final surrender of Schoenenbourg was effected on 1 July 1940, in accordance with the terms of the Second Compiègne armistice. Following the surrender Schoenenbourg was used as a backdrop for propaganda films and as an indoctrination center for Hitler Youth.|$|E

For a five-day period, Stuart rested his men and entertained local civilians at a gala ball at Urbana, Maryland. His reports make no reference to intelligence gathering by his scouts or patrols. As the Union Army drew near to Lee's divided army, Stuart's men skirmished at various points on the approach to Frederick and Stuart was not able to keep his brigades concentrated enough to resist the oncoming tide. He misjudged the Union routes of advance, ignorant of the Union force threatening Turner's Gap, and required assistance from the infantry of Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill to defend the South Mountain passes in the Battle of South Mountain. His horse artillery bombarded the flank of the Union army as it opened its attack in the Battle of Antietam. By mid-afternoon, Stonewall Jackson ordered Stuart to command a turning movement with his cavalry against the Union right flank and rear, which if successful would be followed up by an infantry attack from the West Woods. Stuart began probing the Union lines with more artillery barrages, which were answered with [...] "murderous" [...] <b>counterbattery</b> <b>fire</b> and the cavalry movement intended by Jackson was never launched.|$|E
