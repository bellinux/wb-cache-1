40|$|This {{study of}} a coastal settlement, in {{challenging}} its traditional classification as a "fishing village", may strengthen the case for more investigations of the kind. Coastal erosion at Robin Hood's Bay created a compactness which contributed to the cohesion of the population. Confined between Highland and the North Sea, the settlement shared the remoteness, cultural even more than geographical, of seaward-looking Whitby. With enclosure as a detectable factor, population was probably drawn from the adjacent countryside in the fifteenth century, to accumulate around a fishing-farming nucleus. In the seventeenth century the traditional manorial situation in Fylingdales began to change, {{with the introduction of}} 1, 000 -year leaseholds in Robin Hood's Bay. This contributed to relative immobility of the settlement's population. Servicing by sea of the local alum industry, {{and the rise of the}} east-coast coal trade, became the means of extending the equalitarian and co-operative order of fishing to seafaring and shipping enterprise. The return on this, assisted by the unusually long tenure, was sufficient to support the growth of networks of kin so forbidding in their complexity that family reconstitution, from parish registers and wider genealogical sources, became essential to the study. Concern to protect the family is observable, but the growth of strong, puritanical Nonconformity did not frustrate opportunities presented by smuggling. Attitudes, traditional skills and the economic and social order enabled great advantage to be taken of the increase in nineteenth-century shipping, until steam-power intervened. At the heart of both enterprise and resistance to change was the finest mesh of long-standing, entrepreneurial kin testifying to the powerful socialisation that had fostered <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and maritime employment. The ethic, and the social and economic order by which this obscure community made the description "fishing village” inadequate, suggests that further scrutiny of the coast, not only for the history of merchant shipping, but for people conditioned to the ordering of their own lives, might be profitable...|$|E
40|$|Chronic pain has a disorganizing {{effect on}} people who {{experience}} it. The extent to which organizations and communities help chronic pain sufferers among them to effectively organize and manage pain, indicates the desires and abilities of these groups to support their members. ^ The Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC), a relatively new form of residential community for the elderly, is organized to provide communal resources and <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and care from relatively independent living to skilled nursing care. The gradual movement of residents through this system is conceived by CCRC proponents to be a benevolent way of providing health care and services without drastically interrupting the lifestyles and daily habits of residents. Because large communities of older people invariably contain significant numbers of chronic pain sufferers, the study of how chronic pain experiences are organized, communicated, and managed within CCRCs offers a way of understanding the nature of CCRCs as health-care and community-service organizations and as communities of elders. ^ I conducted in-depth interviews with residents and staff in their living and work environments at two CCRCs. Interviews were supplemented with observations of interactions among people in the CCRCs, participation observation of community-wide and staff meetings, and analysis of documentary materials. ^ Using chronic pain as a probe, I found that the organization of CCRCs offered opportunities for residents in independent living units to exercise discretion and autonomy in choosing when and with whom to disclose their pain and how to manage it. However, as residents moved through the system of care, they gradually lost this autonomy. The community of elders provided powerful moderating forces for constructing ways in which chronic pain was experienced, publicly expressed, and privately and publicly managed. Community influences mediated organizational approaches to handling chronic pain. However, as individuals moved through the system of care, these community forces became less influential as organizational protocol for managing chronic pain increasingly defined the residents 2 ̆ 7 pain experiences. ^ I conclude that, although CCRCs are benevolent institutions, they must find ways to assure that residents maintain as much independence and choice as possible at all levels residence and care. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> care {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} {{as important for}} patients with multi-morbidity but simple, service-orientated indices cannot capture the full impact <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> in complex care delivery systems. The patient's perspective is important to assess outcomes fully and this is challenging because generic measures <b>of</b> patient-perceived <b>continuity</b> are lacking. We investigate the Chao Perception <b>of</b> <b>Continuity</b> (Chao PC) scale to determine its suitability as a measure <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care for patients with a long-term condition (stroke), and co-morbidity, in a primary care setting. Methods: Design and Setting: A questionnaire study embedded in a prospective observational cohort study of outcomes for patients following acute stroke. Participants: 168 community dwelling patients (58 % male) mean age 68 years a minimum one year post-stroke. Functional status: Barthel Index mean = 16. Intervention: A 23 -item questionnaire, the Chao Perception <b>of</b> <b>Continuity</b> (Chao PC) scale, sent by post to their place <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> or administered face to face {{as part of the}} final cohort study assessment. Results: 310 patients were invited to participate; 168 (54 %) completed a questionnaire. All 23 questionnaire items were entered into a Principal Component Analysis. Emergent factors from the exploratory analysis were (1) inter-personal trust (relational continuity); (2) interpersonal knowledge and information (informational and relational continuity) and (3) the process <b>of</b> care (managerial <b>continuity).</b> The strongest <b>of</b> these was inter-personal trust. Conclusion: The context-specific items in the Chao PC scale are difficult for respondents to interpret in a United Kingdom Primary Care setting resulting in missing data and low response rates. The Chao-PC therefore cannot be recommended for wider application as a general measure <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care without significant modification. Our findings reflect the acknowledged dimensions <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> and support the concept <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care as a multi-dimensional construct. We demonstrate the overlapping boundaries across the dimensions in the factor structure derived. Trust and interpersonal knowledge are clearly identified as valuable components of any patient-perceived measure <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care and preventive health care and emergency department (ED) use in a universal health care system. Data Sources/Study Setting. Administrative data that capture health care use of {{the entire population of}} a midwestern Canadian city. Study Design. A population-based, retrospective study of all individuals who had a least one physician contact in 1998 or 1999 (total N 5 536, 893). Methods. Logistic regressions were conducted to examine {{the relation between}} con-tinuity of care, defined in terms of the proportion of total visits to family physicians (FPs) made to the same FP, and cervical cancer screening, breast cancer screening, influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination, and ED visits, controlling for demographic variables, socioeconomic status (defined in terms of relative affluence <b>of</b> neighborhood <b>of</b> <b>residence),</b> and health status. Principal Findings. <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> care was related to better preventive health care and reduced ED use. A consistent socioeconomic gradient also emerged. For instance, the odds of having a mammogram was double for individuals living in the wealthiest neighborhoods, relative to those in the poorest neighborhoods (adjusted odds ra-tio 5 2. 31, 99 percent CI 2. 13 – 2. 50). Conclusions. Having a long-term relationship with a single physician makes a dif-ference even in a universal health care system. Moreover, socioeconomic disparities remain, suggesting the need to target specifically individuals from lower socioeconomic strata for preventive health care.

40|$|Taking the {{position}} that micro-historical studies of local Jewish communities serve to illuminate the wider picture of Jewish life in medieval Mediterranean Spain, this dissertation focuses on the Jews of Barcelona {{during the reign of}} Jaume I, 'el Conqueridor,' (1213 - 1276). Through a systematic examination of over three thousand paper and parchment documents from the Archives of the Crown of Aragon and the Capitular Archives of Barcelona (a project never undertaken before), this dissertation studies the physical, economic and social environment of Barcelona's Jews in the thirteenth century, and offers important insights into their daily commercial and family lives. Collation and close examination of the archival sources (along with use of several important archaeological reports) enabled: a discussion of methodological problems and earlier, fragmented scholarly studies (Chapter 1); an historical survey of Jewish settlement in Barcelona from late antiquity to the thirteenth century, indicating longevity and <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> Jewish <b>residence</b> (Chapter 2); a reconstruction of the boundaries and important public edifices of Barcelona's Jewish quarter and identification of the location of one to the quarter's main entrance points, (Chapter 3); a compilation of genealogies and mini-histories for some of the city's most prominent Jewish families, leading to the conclusion that Barcelona's Jewish patriciate guided and molded the character of Jewish life in the city (Chapter 4); a thorough study of Barcelona's Jews as moneylenders, indicating that the scale of their involvement in this enterprise was fairly modest (Chapter 5); an assessment of the daily, mundane ("unofficial") contacts between Jews and Christians in Barcelona, which suggests that inter-faith relations were amicable but distant, and were generally guided by pragmatic interests (Chapter 6); compilation of an onamasticon for Jews living in thirteenth-century Barcelona (Appendix B); and presentation of a selection of hitherto unpublished documents from the capitular and royal archives.

40|$|Objective: <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> care is {{considered}} foundational to high-quality care. Traditional <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care constructs may adequately characterize care quality in general populations, but may merit reconceptualization {{for patients with}} multiple chronic conditions. Specifically, interactions between multiple chronic condition patients and providers involve complex medication management; therefore care continuity measurement may be more relevant if focused on the provider subset who prescribes essential medications for chronic conditions—a construct we call <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management. Our objective was to explore conceptual distinctions between <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management and <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care, survey existing evidence in this area, and discuss implications of our findings for future research and intervention development. Methods: In this topical review, we discuss conceptual distinctions between <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management and <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care, review the limited <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management–related empirical evidence, and discuss implications for future research and interventions. Results: <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management represents a potential conceptual and measurement advance by reflecting interpersonal continuity and management continuity, and may provide a means of identifying patients at high-risk of adverse events. Empirical evidence also establishes support for <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management as a meaningful measure <b>of</b> care <b>continuity.</b> Finally, <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management {{may also be a}} potential target for future intervention to improve care delivery among multiple chronic condition patients. Conclusion: If <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management is validated in diverse populations, correlated with patient outcomes, and responsive to change, then it may be an important target for improving the health and health care of multiple chronic condition patients...|$|R
