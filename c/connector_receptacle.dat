40|$|Mechanized right-angle {{electrical}} connector configured {{with and without}} removable handle. Resembles (but does not operate in same way as) one described in "Right-Angle Mechanized Electrical Connector" (LEW- 15465). Handle attached to engage mechanized connector with, or disengage it from, receptacle. If handle removed while connector fully engaged with <b>receptacle,</b> then <b>connector</b> and <b>receptacle</b> remain locked in engagement. Actuated manually or robotically...|$|R
5000|$|The terms plug, pin, and prong {{are also}} {{often used for}} [...] "male" [...] <b>connectors,</b> and <b>receptacle,</b> socket, and slot are used for [...] "female" [...] connectors. In many cases these terms are more common than male and female, {{especially}} in documentation intended for the non-specialist. These nearly synonymous terms can cause {{a fair amount of}} confusion when the designations are shortened in labels.|$|R
50|$|Accessories or Backshells are {{mechanical}} devices (e.g., strain reliefs, cable clamps, adapters, potting boots) {{that are}} threaded onto the rear connector accessory threads of plug or <b>receptacle</b> <b>connectors</b> {{to make up}} the total connector assembly.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{incompatible}} {{standards for}} key widths on FC/APC and polarization-maintaining FC/PC connectors: 2 mm ("Reduced" [...] or [...] "type R") and 2.14 mm ("NTT" [...] or [...] "type N"). <b>Connectors</b> and <b>receptacles</b> with different key widths either cannot be mated, {{or will not}} preserve the angle alignment between the fibers, which {{is especially important for}} polarization-maintaining fiber. Some manufacturers mark reduced keys with a single scribe mark on the key, and mark NTT connectors with a double scribe mark.|$|R
50|$|The {{connector}} is circular, {{with the}} male connector having two pins placed symmetrically inside a circular shield, {{and the female}} <b>connector</b> having two <b>receptacles</b> surrounded by a circular groove to accept the male shield, in turn surrounded by a second circular shield which projects 6 mm past the mating surface and encloses the male connector.|$|R
500|$|Mini-USB {{connectors}} {{were introduced}} together with USB 2.0 in April 2000 – however the Mini-A connector and the Mini-AB <b>receptacle</b> <b>connector</b> are deprecated (i.e. de-certified, but standardized) since May 2007. Mini-B connectors are still supported, {{but are not}} On-The-Go-compliant; the Mini-B USB connector was standard for transferring data {{to and from the}} early smartphones and PDAs. Both Mini-A and Mini-B plugs are approximately [...]|$|R
5000|$|One {{standard}} {{they have}} is for the wiring of communications between Surface mount technology producing machinery such as a Stencil Printer or a Pick and Place Machine on an Electronics production line. This allows the machines, including the [...] "bridges" [...] between the two known simply as conveyors, to communicate that they are busy, or awaiting a circuit board. The communication only goes sequentially, {{as there is no}} addressing. Instead the machine's SMEMA cables connect to each other's upstream or downstream plug. The plugs and wires are multimate <b>connectors</b> and <b>receptacles</b> consisting of 14 wire connections. However, only 4 wires are used for data, while the 8th pin connection is the shielding.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coupling}} system is usually made of two bayonet ramps machined on the external {{side of the}} <b>receptacle</b> <b>connector</b> and 2 stainless steel studs mounted inside the plug connector’s coupling nut. Several classes of electrical cable connectors, including audio, video, and data cables use bayonet connectors. Examples include BNC, C, and ST connectors. (The BNC connector is not exactly as described in this article, as the male, not female, connector has the slots and spring.) ...|$|R
50|$|A blade {{connector}} {{is a type}} of single wire connection using a flat conductive blade which is inserted into a blade receptacle. Usually both blade <b>connector</b> and blade <b>receptacle</b> have wires attached to them either through of the wire to the blade or crimping of the blade to the wire. In some cases the blade is an integral manufactured part of a component (such as a switch or a speaker unit), and a blade receptacle is pushed onto the blade to form a connection.|$|R
40|$|Future {{bandwidth}} needs {{force the}} development of optical interconnects for data transmission at board level. The aim is to develop technology solutions for embedded optical architectures in data center and network systems to allow significant reduction in power consumption, increased energy efficiency, system density and bandwidth scalability, which is currently unfeasible in today's copper driven systems. A passive optical backplane comprising {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) with integrated optical waveguides and standardized pluggable optical coupling interfaces to the line cards is proposed for future data communication systems. Our activities are focused on embedded glass-based electro-optical circuit boards (EOCB) with integrated gradient-index multimode waveguides, which exhibit very low propagation loss at key optical communication wavelengths. A pre-processed glass panel with planar integrated optical waveguides is embedded into a backplane by using proven industrial PCB processes. A pluggable optical <b>connector</b> and <b>receptacle</b> system is designed for connecting the optical fiber links of the line cards with the optical waveguide circuit of the backplane...|$|R
40|$|First time an {{electro-optical}} {{circuit board}} (EOCB) is demonstrated with integrated planar glass multimode waveguides and with optical pluggable line card connectors. The waveguides are patterned inside commercially available thin-glass panels by performing a two-step thermal ion-exchange process. The resulting low-loss multimode waveguides possess a gradient-index profile. The glass waveguide panel is embedded within the layer stack-up of {{a printed circuit}} board (PCB) using proven industrial processes. Cut-outs inside the PCB are structured for assembling a pluggable optical <b>connector</b> and <b>receptacle</b> system for connecting optical fiber based waveguides on the line cards to integrated optical waveguides in the backplane. The demonstration platform comprises a standardized sub-rack chassis and five pluggable test cards with pluggable optical connectors and designed for housing optical engines. The test cards support a variety of different data interfaces for bidirectional signal integrity measurements. The evaluated demonstrator system performed with bit error free data transmission at 10. 3 Gb/s for the tested wavelengths of 850 and 1310 nm...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} mating fluid {{transfer}} couplings is constructed having a male connector which {{is provided with}} a pair of opposed rollers mounted to an exterior region thereof. A male half of a fluid transfer coupling is rotatably supported in an opening in an end of the connector and is equipped with an outwardly extending forward portion. The forward portion locks into an engagement and locking region of a female half of the fluid transfer coupling, with female half being rotatably supported in a receptacle. The receptacle has an opening aligned with locking region, with this opening having a pair of concentric, annularly disposed ramps extending around an interior portion of opening. These ramps are inclined toward the interior of the receptacle and are provided with slots through which rollers of the connector pass. After the connector is inserted into the receptacle (engaging forward portion into engagement region), relative rotation between the <b>connector</b> and <b>receptacle</b> causes the rollers to traverse ramps until the rollers abut and are gripped by retainers. This axially forces the forward portion into locked, sealed engagement with the engagement region...|$|R

40|$|To {{enable the}} next {{generation}} subsea boosting and processing facilities, high power electrical connectors are strongly needed and {{considered one of the}} most critical components of the system. Electrical tree growth is a precursor to electrical breakdown in high voltage insulation materials. Therefore, the study of the tree growth dependency with hydrostatic pressure is needed to understand the behaviour of the insulation material used in subsea connectors. Silicone rubber (SiR) is used as an insulation material for these applications thanks to its higher viscosity characteristic in comparison with other solid insulation materials used in subsea cables. This property is the main factor that allows the water to be swiped off the <b>connector</b> when a <b>receptacle</b> is mated into the plug of a subsea connector. In addition, the silicone rubber must provide similar electric field control as other insulation materials used in cable terminations and connectors. The characteristics of partial discharges generated during the electrical tree growth and the light emission from the partial discharge pulses, have been studied under different pressure conditions. SiR samples, with a needle to plate electrode configuration, have been put into a pressure vessel to grow the electrical tree in the material under high hydrostatic pressure conditions. The electrical tree growth has been divided in three stages (initiation, intermediate and final or pre-breakdown stage) and tests have been performed at 1, 20 and 60 bar. A digital NIKON camera and a CCD camera have been used, both attached to a long-distance microscope, to observe in real time the tree growth and light emission, respectively. Pictures showed a higher growth speed for the electric tree as voltage and pressure were increased. The length of electrical trees pre-grown at lower pressures collapsed faster as the pressure increased, than those pre-grown at higher pressures under the same pressure increasing conditions. As the pressure increased, Pulse Sequence Analysis performed to the partial discharges measured confirmed the partial discharge inception and extinction voltage increase and showed a polarity dependency to space charge generation in addition to other patterns regarding the charge magnitude and phase of occurrence characteristics. Pressure vessel internal reflections have suggested changes to be done in future studies for the light emission measurement. Finally, partial discharge patterns from the electrical tree growth process have been identified to be characteristics from void faults in the dielectric with a spherical void shape.

5000|$|Following the depressurization, {{the pilots}} {{did not receive}} {{supplemental}} oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation. The wreckage indicated that the oxygen bottle pressure regulator/shutoff valve was open on the accident flight. Further, although one flight crew mask hose connector {{was found in the}} wreckage disconnected from its valve <b>receptacle</b> (the other <b>connector</b> was not recovered), damage to the recovered <b>connector</b> and both <b>receptacles</b> was consistent with both flight crew masks having been connected to the airplane's oxygen supply lines at the time of impact. In addition, both flight crew mask microphones were found plugged into their respective crew microphone jacks. Therefore, assuming the oxygen bottle contained an adequate supply of oxygen, supplemental oxygen should have been available to both pilots' oxygen masks.A possible explanation for the failure of the pilots to receive emergency oxygen is that their ability to think and act decisively was impaired because of hypoxia before they could don their oxygen masks. No definitive evidence exists that indicates {{the rate at which the}} accident flight lost its cabin pressure; therefore, the Safety Board evaluated conditions of both rapid and gradual depressurization.If there had been a breach in the fuselage (even a small one that could not be visually detected by the in-flight observers) or a seal failure, the cabin could have depressurized gradually, rapidly, or even explosively. Research has shown that a period of as little as 8 seconds without supplemental oxygen following rapid depressurization to about [...] may cause a drop in oxygen saturation that can significantly impair cognitive functioning and increase the amount of time required to complete complex tasks.A more gradual decompression could have resulted from other possible causes, such as a smaller leak in the pressure vessel or a closed flow control valve. Safety Board testing determined that a closed flow control valve would cause complete depressurization to the airplane's flight altitude over a period of several minutes. However, without supplemental oxygen, substantial adverse effects on cognitive and motor skills would have been expected soon after the first clear indication of decompression (the cabin altitude warning), when the cabin altitude reached [...] (which could have occurred in about 30 seconds).Investigations of other accidents in which flight crews attempted to diagnose a pressurization problem or initiate emergency pressurization instead of immediately donning oxygen masks following a cabin altitude alert have revealed that, even with a relatively gradual rate of depressurization, pilots have rapidly lost cognitive or motor abilities to effectively troubleshoot the problem or don their masks shortly thereafter. In this accident, the flight crew's failure to obtain supplemental oxygen in time to avoid incapacitation could be explained by a delay in donning oxygen masks; of only a few seconds in the case of an explosive or rapid decompression, or a slightly longer delay in the case of a gradual decompression.In summary, the Safety Board was unable to determine why the flight crew could not, or did not, receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation.|$|R
