The high rate of failure for change efforts (50 % to 90 % failure rates) has been noted by many writers.

That is, either significant aspects of the organization were ignored during the intervention or potential impacts of changes on the elements were overlooked or underestimated. Our own training, technical literature, and professional culture lead us to limited understandings of complex organizations. Change agents must consider all relevant components of organizational performance if interventions are to be meaningful and successful.

40|$|The authors study budget {{constrained}} optimal network improvement problems. Such problems aim {{at finding}} optimal strategies for improving a network under some cost measure subject to certain budget constraints. As an example, {{consider the following}} prototypical problem: Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph with two cost values L(e) and C(e) associated with each edge e, where L(e) denotes the length of e and C(e) denotes the cost of reducing the length of e by a unit amount. A reduction strategy specifies for each edge e, the amount by which L(e) is to be reduced. For a given budget B, {{the goal is to}} find a reduction strategy such that the total cost of reduction is at most B and the minimum cost tree (with respect to some measure M) under the modified L costs is the best over all possible reduction strategies which obey the budget constraint. Typical measures M for a tree are the total weight and the diameter. They provide both hardness and approximation results for the two measures M mentioned above. For the problem of minimizing the total weight of a spacing tree, they provide an algorithm that, for any fixed {gamma},{var_epsilon} > 0, finds a solution whose weight is at most (1 + 1 /{gamma}) times that of a minimum length spanning tree plus an additive constant of at most {var_epsilon} and the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> is at most (1 + {gamma}) times the budget B.

40|$|Recently, equity aspects {{have been}} {{considered}} in {{a growing number of}} models and methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Equity concerns most often relate to fairly allocating workloads and to balancing the utilization of resources, and many practical applications have been reported. However, there has been only limited discussion about how equity should be modelled in the context of VRPs, and various measures for optimizing such objectives have been proposed and implemented without critical evaluation of their respective merits and consequences. This article addresses this gap by providing an analysis of classical and alternative equity measures for bi-objective VRP models. In the survey we review and categorize the literature on equitable VRP models. In the analysis, we identify a set of axiomatic properties which an ideal equity measure should satisfy, collect 6 common measures of equity, and point out important connections between their properties and the properties of the resulting Pareto-optimal solutions. To gauge the extent of some of these implications and to examine further relevant aspects for choosing an equity objective, we conduct a numerical study on bi-objective VRP instances solvable to optimality. We find that the equity of cost-optimal solutions is generally poor, while the marginal <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> is low for all examined measures. We also reveal two contradictions of optimizing equity with non-monotonic measures: Pareto-optimal solutions can consist of non-TSP-optimal tours, and even if all tours are TSP-optimal, Pareto-optimal solutions can be composed of tours which are all equal to or longer than those of other Pareto-optimal solutions. Based on these analyses, we conclude that monotonic equity measures are more appropriate for some types of VRP models, and suggest several promising avenues for further research on equity in logistics applications.

40|$|The European energy {{policies}} {{about climate}} and energy package, {{known as the}} “ 20 - 20 - 20 ” targets define ambitious, but achievable, national energy objectives. As regards the Directives {{closely related to the}} 2020 targets, the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD Recast- DIR 2010 / 31 /EU) is the main European legislative instrument for improving the energy performance of buildings, taking into account outdoor climatic and local conditions, as well as indoor climate requirements and cost-effectiveness. The EPBD recast now requests that Member States shall ensure that minimum energy performance requirements for buildings are set “with a view to achieving cost-optimal levels”. The cost optimum level shall be calculated in accordance with a comparative methodology framework, leaving the Member States to determine which of these calculations is to become the national benchmark against which national minimum energy performance requirements will be assessed. The European standards (ENs- Umbrella Document V 7 (prCEN/TR 15615) are intended to support the EPBD by providing the calculation methods and associated material to obtain the overall energy performance of a building. For Italy the Energy Performance of Building Simulations EPBS must be calculated with standard UNITS 11300. The energy building behaviour is referred to standard and not to real use, nor climate or dynamic energy evaluation. Since retrofitting of existing buildings offers significant opportunities for reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, a case study of retrofitting is described and the CostOptimal Level EU procedure in an Italian context is analysed. Following this procedure, it is shown not only that the energy cost depends on several conditions {{and most of them are}} not indexed at national level but also that the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> depends on local variables and contract tender. The case study highlights the difficulties to apply EU rules, and allows verifying whether this methodology could be used as thermo-economic analysis for investment decisions in energy efficiency improvements and refurbishment in Italy or similar regions.

40|$|Energy is {{essential}} to economic prosperity and quality of life. However it can have {{detrimental effects on the}} environment if not used properly. Moreover, if energy resources are scarce in a given country, then its use will impose economic and financial burdens on the national economy. The cement industry is energy-intensive, which adds a micro dimension to the macro issues mentioned above. Reducing energy consumption without due consideration to production requirements is not an optimal situation. What is needed is to arrive at a situation whereby energy is used rationally. The concept of rational use of energy has two embedded principles. The first is increased energy-use efficiency and the second is environmental protection. Jordan Cement Factories (JCF), located in a developing country where energy resources are not indigenously available and, therefore, costly energy requirements are imported, have realised the importance of addressing the energy management and conservation issues. This thesis describes the efforts initiated and conducted by the author, to address the research problem of improving energy usage through the application of effective management techniques aimed at reducing energy consumption per unit of cement produced. This present research has been concerned with energy management and efficient use of energy. The Jordan Cement Factories were used as a vehicle to demonstrate the proposed research methodology that aimed at improving energy consumption and thus operational efficiency. The methodology is based on establishing statistically significant relationships between interacting problem factors, and assessing the economic impact of improving these factors. Economic evaluation entailed the development of economic models and an application methodology combined with illustrative case studies. Consequently, the problem of energy management has been presented in a wider perspective that addressed the whole management system at the organisation. Towards that end, it was first necessary to show the significance of energy cost with respect to the overall manufacturing costs. The analysis of production costs, which demonstrated the significance of energy costs, was followed by the investigation and examination of the basic management factors that have direct impact on energy consumption at the JCF. Among these factors are, for instance, production line availability, production rate, average number of stoppages, and average duration of stoppages. These factors were determined using preliminary data analysis and the experience and technical knowledge of the researcher. The statistical analysis proved the existence of strong relationships between energy consumption and management factors. Several models were developed for a set of selected production lines, in the JFC at Fuhais and Rashadiya plants. These statistical models were generated using actual data for electrical energy and fuel consumption. The derived models have demonstrated the existence of strong relationships between energy consumption and management control factors; for instance, the values of R 2 range from 60 % to 90 %. This implies that an equivalent percentage of the variations in energy consumption {{can be attributed to the}} selected management factors. The economic model developed in this research is concerned with demonstrating that effective management practices associated with proper maintenance and housekeeping can result in highly significant savings in energy usage. Although a simplistic methodology was used to evaluate the economic impact of any improvement programme, the economic treatment showed that the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> is actually negligible compared to the realisable savings in energy usage. The research has dealt with the details of developing a coherent energy management model whose objective is to establish transformational management processes of certain high-level management factors into daily operations and controls. The high-level management. factors are the same factors used as independent variables in the statistical and economic models, which statistically proved to be the major factors affecting the energy consumption at JCF. The research has also presented a detailed analysis of the organisational and procedural aspects of energy management with concentration on management functions, especially planning, controlling, executing, organising, and auditing. A detailed mapping and analysis of these functions as the main components of an Energy Management System (EMS) resulted in establishing job descriptions, organisational charts, work instructions and procedures for all-important functions of the EMS. The type of work described in this thesis could be extrapolated for application in other industries, particularly energy-intensive ones, to arrive at the objective of rational use of energy at the national and international levels. Comprehensive studies would need to be carried out for each type of industry prior to implementation. The cost benefit analysis presented in this research proved, beyond any doubt, the importance of implementing the EMS in JCF. As a result of this implementation it is demonstrated that huge annual savings were realised. Finally, as a result of improving energy control factors, introducing energy conservation measures and employing management techniques at JCF to guarantee the effectiveness of all such activities, resulted in an annual savings amount to about USS 3. 5 million. Therefore, if the same or similar actions are undertaken by all cement, or other highly energy intensive industries then the savings could reach billions of dollars...|$|E
