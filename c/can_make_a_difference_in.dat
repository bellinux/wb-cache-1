25|$|Dark Horse Comics {{acquired}} the rights in 1990 and published The Terminator (titled Tempest in trade paperbacks to distinguish itself), {{where a group}} of human soldiers and four Terminators come to the present, to respectively kill or protect the developers of Skynet. One of the Terminators is Dudley, a human doctor with cybernetic implants, and he betrays his group as he feels he <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the past. In the following year's sequel Secondary Objectives, the surviving Terminator leader, C890.L, is reprogrammed to destroy another Terminator sent to aid him and kill Sarah Connor. In the immediate follow-up The Enemy Within, C890.L rebuilds and modifies himself to become more dangerous than ever, while a team of human assassins attempt to return to the past and kill a Skynet developer. The 1992 Endgame concludes this arc, with human colonel Mary Randall, having lost Dudley and her soldiers in the final battle with C890.L, protecting Sarah Connor as she goes into labor. Sarah gives birth to a girl named Jane, whose future leadership means Skynet is quickly defeated and never develops time travel.|$|E
500|$|Nafaanra {{has seven}} oral and five nasalized vowels. A {{difference}} in vowel length <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> meaning, as in , [...] "to go", vs. , [...] "fetish" [...] or o, [...] "we" [...] vs. oo, [...] "we will". Similarly, the phonemic contrastiveness of nasalization {{can be seen}} in sii, [...] "to be giving birth," [...] vs. , [...] "to build". The vowel system closely resembles that of other Senufo languages. It is like the two Northern Senufo languages Supyire and Mamara in having only five nasal against seven oral vowels. In the orthography, nasalization of vowels is marked by adding the letter [...] "n" [...] after the vowel.|$|E

2500|$|Poorly socialized or frightened Chihuahuas can {{be easily}} {{provoked}} to attack, and are therefore generally unsuitable for homes with small and undisciplined children. The breed tends to be fiercely loyal to one particular person {{and in some cases}} may become over protective of the person, especially around other people or animals. They are frequently not introduced to or socialized with dogs of other breeds, and as a result do not interact as well with them as other dogs who have been socialized to interact with different breed types and tend to have a [...] "clannish" [...] nature, often preferring the companionship of other Chihuahuas or Chihuahua mixes over other dogs. These traits generally make them unsuitable for households with children who are not patient and calm. If properly managed by older children, 13 and up, they can adapt to this kind of living with a dedicated owner. The temperament of its owner <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the temperament of the pup.|$|E
