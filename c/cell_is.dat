5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E

5|$|If a cell {{containing}} {{the key is}} found, the search returns the value from that cell. Otherwise, if an empty <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> found, the key cannot be in the table, {{because it would have}} been placed in that cell in preference to any later cell that has not yet been searched. In this case, the search returns as its result that the key is not present in the dictionary.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{cellular}} automata {{and other}} computational systems {{are capable of}} emulating the behavior of Rule 90. For instance, a configuration in rule 90 may be translated into a configuration into the different elementary cellular automaton Rule 22. The translation replaces each Rule 90 cell by three consecutive Rule 22 cells. These cells are all zero if the Rule 90 <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> itself zero. A nonzero Rule 90 <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> translated into a one followed by two zeros. With this transformation, every six steps of the Rule 22 automaton simulate a single step of the Rule 90 automaton. Similar direct simulations of Rule 90 are also possible for the elementary cellular automata Rule 45 and Rule 126, for certain string rewriting systems and tag systems, and in some two-dimensional cellular automata including Wireworld. Rule 90 can also simulate itself in the same way. If each cell of a Rule 90 configuration {{is replaced by a}} pair of consecutive cells, the first containing the original cell's value and the second containing zero, then this doubled configuration has the same behavior as the original configuration at half the speed.|$|E
40|$|The {{regional}} {{distribution and}} frequency of the pancreatic endocrine cells in the ddN mouse were studied using specific antisera against insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and human pancreatic polypeptide (hPP). In the pancreatic islets, most of insulin-immunoreactive (IR) <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> located in the central region, and glucagon-, somatostatin and hPP-IR <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> located in the peripheral region regardless of the lobe. In the splenic part, glucagon-IR <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> also located in the central regions, and more numerous somatostatin-IR <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> detected in the central regions {{as compared with the}} duo-denal part. hPP-IR <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> restricted to the peripheral regions in both lobes but more numerous <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> detected in the duodenal portion. In the exocrine parenchyma of the splenic lobe, only insulin- and glucagon-IR <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> detected but all four kinds of IR <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> observed in the duodenal portion. In addition, insulin and hPP-IR <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> also demonstrated in the pancreatic duct regions.

5|$|Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the {{catalytic}} {{component of}} the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time.

In mouse, the two alternative first exons are MKYK and MWAR. Their function is not known. NM_001142393 initiates translation at an upstream location compared to NM_006403.3, but both transcripts have 7 exons.

40|$|The dielectrophoretic {{behavior}} of active, dead, and dormant Mycobacterium smegmatis bacterial <b>cells</b> <b>was</b> studied. It {{was found that}} the 72 -h-old dormant cells had a much higher effective particle conductivity (812 ± 10 μS cm− 1), almost double that of active cells (560 ± 20 μS cm− 1), while that of dead (autoclaved) M. smegmatis <b>cells</b> <b>was</b> the highest (950 ± 15 μS cm− 1) overall.

5|$|The nuclear {{pores are}} highly {{efficient}} at selectively allowing {{the passage of}} materials {{to and from the}} nucleus, because the nuclear envelope has a considerable amount of traffic. RNA and ribosomal subunits must be continually transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Histones, gene regulatory proteins, DNA and RNA polymerases, and other substances essential for nuclear activities must be imported from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope of a typical mammalian cell contains 3000–4000 pore complexes. If the <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> synthesizing DNA each pore complex needs to transport about 100 histone molecules per minute. If the <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> growing rapidly, each complex also needs to transport about 6 newly assembled large and small ribosomal subunits per minute from the nucleus to the cytosol, where they are used to synthesize proteins.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{structural}} and biochemical effects that viruses {{have on the}} host <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> extensive. These are called cytopathic effects. Most virus infections eventually result {{in the death of}} the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis, alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis. Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activities because of suppression by virus-specific proteins, not all of which are components of the virus particle.|$|E

5|$|The total {{complement}} of genes in an organism or <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> known as its genome, {{which may be}} stored on one or more chromosomes. A chromosome consists of a single, very long DNA helix on which thousands of genes are encoded. The region of the chromosome at which a particular gene is located is called its locus.

5|$|Triglycerides, {{stored in}} adipose tissue, {{are a major}} form of energy storage both in animals and plants. The adipocyte, or fat <b>cell,</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} for continuous synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides in animals, with breakdown controlled mainly by the activation of hormone-sensitive enzyme lipase. The complete oxidation of fatty acids provides high caloric content, about 9kcal/g, compared with 4kcal/g for the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins. Migratory birds that must fly long distances without eating use stored energy of triglycerides to fuel their flights.|$|E
5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E
