Onion bulb of Bombay Red cultivar was stored for 90 days in naturally ventilated storage structure and in <b>house</b> <b>floor.</b> The study was conducted from end of April to Jun 2011. Hourly temperature and relative humidity of ambient and storage environment were monitored and the physiological weight loss, sprouting percentage, rotting percentage and percentage of marketable bulbs on stored bulb were recorded every ten days interval. The observation {{has shown that the}} temperature profile of naturally ventilated storage structure has followed similar pattern with the ambient environment. Total percentage of bulb loss increases with storage period in both storage methods and lower values were observed in naturally ventilated structure than in <b>house</b> <b>floor</b> storage method. On the 50 th day after storage, the overall bulb losses in naturally ventilated structures and in <b>house</b> <b>floor</b> storage were found to be 68. 51 % and 78. 56 % respectively...|$|R
