50|$|Before {{becoming}} one of the most feared criminal power brokers in the Gioia Tauro plain, Mommo Piromalli was a cowherd. In 1939 he was charged with illegal <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>firearms,</b> in 1940 for grievous bodily harm, in 1944 for robbery with violence and in 1950 for murder. In 1967, the court imposed a five-year mandatory internal banishment (soggiorno obbligato) to remove Piromalli from his home town and criminal associates.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), Australia's {{civilian}} national {{foreign intelligence}} agency, established a special forces unit, named the Covert Action Directorate, {{to develop a}} special recovery capability. The Directorate, which included a female operative, received training from the military to conduct overseas counter terrorism operations. The SASR had recently developed a domestic counter terrorism capability establishing the Tactical Assault Group. In November 1983, the Directorate held a bungled hostage rescue training exercise at the Sheraton Hotel without proper approvals, including the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>firearms,</b> culminating in the public exposure of the unit. The ASIS covert military function approval was subsequently revoked, ASIS subject to a Royal Commission investigation and the special recovery role assigned to the SASR.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2012 Royal Mail again {{attempted}} to prohibit the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> all <b>firearms,</b> air rifles and air pistols from 30 November 2012. It cited Section 14(1) <b>of</b> the 1998 <b>Firearms</b> (Amendment) Act, which requires carriers <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> to [...] "take reasonable precautions" [...] for their safe custody {{and argued that}} to comply would involve disproportionate cost. A Royal Mail public consultation document on the changes said: [...] "We expect the impact on customers to be minimal".|$|R
25|$|In 2004 Royal Mail {{applied to}} the then postal {{regulator}} Postcomm to ban the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> sporting <b>firearms,</b> saying they caused disruption to the network, that a ban would assist police with firearms control, and that ease of access meant the letters network was a target of criminals. Postcomm issued a consultation on the proposed changes in December 2004, to which 62 people and organisations responded.|$|R
50|$|From the {{historical}} cell-site records, {{the government was}} able to determine that Carpenterâ€™s cell phone communicated with cell towers {{at the time and}} within a two-mile radius of four robberies. Carpenter was later charged and arrested and eventually convicted by a jury with several counts of aiding and abetting robbery that affected interstate commerce, and aiding and abetting the use or <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> a <b>firearm</b> during a federal crime of violence. Carpenter was sentenced by Judge Sean Cox of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to 1,395 months, or 116.25 years, in federal prison.|$|R
5000|$|Although LEOSA preempts {{state and}} local laws, there are two notable exceptions: [...] "the laws of any State that (1) permit private persons or {{entities}} to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms on their property" [...] (such as a bars, private clubs, amusement parks, etc.), or [...] "(2) prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any State or local government property, installation, building, base, or park" [...] Additionally, LEOSA does not override the federal Gun-Free School Zone Act (GFSZA) which prohibits carrying a firearm within 1,000 feet of elementary or secondary schools. Although the GFSZA authorizes on-duty law enforcement officers to carry firearms in such circumstances, off-duty and retired law enforcement officers are still restricted from doing so unless they have a firearms license issued from the state in which they reside and then it is only good for the state in which they reside. [...] Individuals must also obey any federal laws and federal agency policies that restrict the carrying of concealed firearms in certain federal buildings and lands, as well as federal regulations prohibiting the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> on airplanes.|$|E
5000|$|Specialist police firearm {{units are}} present in foreign Law {{enforcement}} agencies in which firearms are routinely carried by officers. These units are provided with increased firepower, more equipment and training than regular officers. Foreign firearms units are not intended to deal with routine firearms incidents, as they are attended to by officers who routinely carry firearms. Such units are normally only called upon when firearms incidents are of such a nature, that they require specialist intervention whereas the firearms units within the United Kingdom respond to all firearms related incidents, as UK police (with the exception of Northern Ireland) are not routinely armed. The New Zealand Police had a similar policy to the UK of no routine <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> by officers and established Armed Offenders Squads around their country to respond to firearms incidents. However, New Zealand police officers whilst still not carrying firearms are now being provided with ready access and training that is diminishing {{the role of the}} Squads. Examples of tactical units include Ireland's Garda Emergency Response Unit and Garda Regional Support Unit and Australian Police Tactical Groups. The United States has tactical units referred to commonly as Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) units.|$|E
2500|$|New Zealand Police {{officers}} do not routinely carry firearms; officers only carry OC spray (pepper spray), batons and tasers. The Diplomatic Protection Squad and Airport {{officers are}} the only officers who routinely carry <b>firearms.</b> The majority <b>of</b> New Zealand Police officers are trained {{in the use of}} the Glock 17 pistol and Bushmaster XM15 M4A3 Patrolman rifle and wear a holster attachment for the pistol to enable <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>firearm</b> if necessary. Senior officers can approve carrying <b>of</b> these <b>firearms</b> located in stations if necessary. In addition, since 2012, frontline vehicles have had a locked box in the passenger foot-well containing a loaded and holstered Glock 17, and in the rear of the vehicle, there is at least one Bushmaster rifle secured in a case together with ballistic vests. The vehicles are fitted with glass break car alarms. Each officer in the vehicle carries a set of vehicle keys and a set of safe keys. [...] Officers are required to advise their supervisor or communications if a firearm is to be retrieved from their vehicle and carried. New Zealand Police are heavily armed in contrast to neighbouring Australian Police services that require carrying of handguns, however, do not equip their officers with rifles routinely issued to United States Police such as the Bushmaster.|$|R

40|$|This review essay {{examines}} {{a number}} of recent works that contribute to the history <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> in colonial and pre-colonial Africa; two based upon new and original research (Story and Guy) and the others on reproductions of earlier seminal contributions to the historiography <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> in Africa (Lamphear and Smaldone). Given the nature <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> {{it is not surprising that}} the vast majority of literature on this technology focuses on their role in warfare and conflict. This is the primary concern of Smaldoneâ€™s work and the Lamphear collection. However, the scholarship on the role and use <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> in Africa has undergone considerable changes over the last half-century and, given the dramatic transformations in political context within Africa over the same period, this is hardly surprising. Storeyâ€™s contribution adds important depth to the study <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> by examining a vast range of uses to which firearms were put in South Africa, as well as the numerous ways the colonial state sought to control the trade and possession <b>of</b> <b>firearms.</b> By discussing these works together, this essay explores what, if any, new developments have taken place in the historiography <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> in colonial and pre-colonial Africa. While there are still some massive gaps in the literature, as this essay review exposes, the history <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> in Africa should still be seen as an exciting field of study that has a great deal to offer potential researchers...|$|R
50|$|The 1960s {{were marked}} {{by a series of}} anti-government {{movements}} that escalated to the Tlatelolco massacre, prompting then-President EcheverrÃ­a and Mexican Congress to modified Article 10 of the Constitution to its present form today, which permits private ownership <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> within the home only. In January 1972, with the enactment of the Federal Law <b>of</b> <b>Firearms</b> and Explosives, the legal proliferation <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> among the population was heavily limited and restricted.|$|R
