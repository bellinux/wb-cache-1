40|$|This was a {{prospective}} study of 52 stroke patients. The incidence of post-stroke depression was 55 %. A past history of depression was {{significantly associated with}} the <b>clinical</b> assessment of <b>depression.</b> There was no association between the <b>clinical</b> assessment of <b>depression</b> and type and site of lesion and intellectual impairment. The <b>clinical</b> assessment of <b>depression</b> {{was significantly associated with}} the degree of functional impairment. The <b>clinical</b> assessment of <b>depression</b> also correlated well with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. We conclude that post-stroke depression is unlikely to be caused by neuronal injury due to the cerebrovascular accident. There is also a significant reactive component to it. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is suitable for assessing the severity of depression in stroke patients...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{differences in}} perfectionism between burned-out employees (n = 77), depressed employees (n = 29), anxiety-disordered employees (n = 31), employees with comorbid disorders, that is, {{a combination of}} <b>clinical</b> burnout, <b>depression,</b> or anxiety disorder (n = 28), and individuals without <b>clinical</b> burnout, <b>depression</b> disorder, or anxiety disorder (clinical control group; n = 110). The results suggest that setting high personal standards per se is not associated with clinical disorders. In contrast, maladaptive aspects of perfectionism, including perceived discrepancy between standards and performance and socially prescribed perfectionism, were related to clinical disorders, and in particular to comorbidity.

5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in <b>clinical</b> <b>depression</b> — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E

Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E

In a late Season episode it is revealed that Wilson suffers from <b>clinical</b> <b>depression</b> and takes medication. Wilson is also seen to write with his left hand, a trait he shares with Cuddy and Foreman, but when he performs detailed medical work, such as injections or incisions, or gesticulates while speaking, appears to be right-handed in general, suggesting he may be ambidextrous.|$|E

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. <b>Clinical</b> <b>depression</b> itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E
