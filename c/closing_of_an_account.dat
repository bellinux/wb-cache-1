40|$|The {{design of}} a {{videotape}} recording for teaching politeness to learners of English as a Second Language is described. The recording attempts a step-by-step analysis of politeness realization markers and acts, especially face-threatening acts, simultaneously mapped onto the paralinguistic features accompanying them. It contains four bank scenes in which visitors request services of a bank teller, a goal-directed transaction that ultimately fails. Two of the scenes focus on an account withdrawal; two pertain to the <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>account.</b> In each pair of scenes, one teller handles the situation tactfully and one experiences pragmatic failure. Failure is used to de-emphasize the transaction aspect of the scene and point up the interpersonal aspect. Communication acts and problems are analyzed in captions and narrative voice-over. The intent is to suggest alternatives to behavior that leads to pragmatic failure. A transcription of the video scenes and narrative are appended.

40|$|D. Com. (Marketing Management) The size of South Africa's banking {{industry}} grew from R 398 billion in 1995 to R 471 billion in 1996 while banking transactions totalled R 58 634 billion during 1996. Like most other service companies, the {{banking industry}} also experiences customer turnover. During the period March 1995 to February 1996 customer switch, which refers to the <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> at one institution {{and the opening of}} a new account at another institution, by clients of all banks amounted to 4, 9 percent. Mutual interaction between a service provider and a client is a very important determinant of customer satisfaction with a service. It is therefore important for the company to focus on the retention of customers because it is more profitable to retain a customer rather than recruiting new customers. Customer switching can damage the future stream of income of a company. The loss of a customer therefore, is not only one transaction, the company looses a life long stream of income. Customer satisfaction therefore influences the primary source of future income of most companies directly. Quality service is of utmost importance for the success and survival of companies in today's competitive environment. To be successful it is necessary for each department within the company to operate effectively and to be client orientated. Companies believe that they will be more profitable if a marketing orientation is established within the company. Employees must therefore, understand their role in the total service chain.

60|$|The plaza {{was small}} and dark, though a thin {{crescent}} moon was just rising over the clustering roofs. Its faint light silvered the higher portions of the two square church towers that rose blackly against the velvety indigo with one great star between them, {{but the rest of}} the building, which was the one Nettie Harding had found shelter in, was blurred and shadowy. Beyond it a few lights blinked in the calle he had just passed through, but they only intensified the darkness of the narrow gap between the flat‐roofed houses, and—for it was getting late— the street seemed utterly silent. Yet Appleby had certainly heard footsteps, and no <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> door to <b>account</b> for their cessation. The houses were large in that vicinity, and built, for the most part, round a patio, the outer door of which not infrequently consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heavy iron grille which could scarcely be closed noiselessly. In front of him two streets branched off, one broad and well paved, the other narrow and very dark. The latter, however, led straight to the “Four Nations,” past the carniceria, or butchery, and two or three of the little wine‐shops of shady repute which are usually to be found close to the principal church in a Spanish town. Here and there <b>a</b> blink <b>of</b> light streamed out from the open lattice of one of them.|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. The size of South Africa's banking {{industry}} grew from R 398 billion in 1995 to R 471 billion in 1996 while banking transactions totalled R 58 634 billion during 1996. Like most other service companies, the {{banking industry}} also experiences customer turnover. During the period March 1995 to February 1996 customer switch, which refers to the <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> at one institution {{and the opening of}} a new account at another institution, by clients of all banks amounted to 4, 9 percent. Mutual interaction between a service provider and a client is a very important determinant of customer satisfaction with a service. It is therefore important for the company to focus on the retention of customers because it is more profitable to retain a customer rather than recruiting new customers. Customer switching can damage the future stream of income of a company. The loss of a customer therefore, is not only one transaction, the company looses a life long stream of income. Customer satisfaction therefore influences the primary source of future income of most companies directly. Quality service is of utmost importance for the success and survival of companies in today's competitive environment. To be successful it is necessary for each department within the company to operate effectively and to be client orientated. Companies believe that they will be more profitable if a marketing orientation is established within the company. Employees must therefore, understand their role in the total service chain. A client's perception of a service becomes reality when he/she experiences the service during a service encounter where interaction between the customer and the company takes place with the employee as intermediary. Employees of the company are seen as individuals who are in a relationship with the company similar to that between an external customer and the company. A company must therefore concentrate on both his external and internal clients because quality service rendered to internal clients results in quality service to the external client. The rendering of quality service is a very important dimension, in ensuring success and survival of a company. If investment in service quality therefore results in perceived improvement in service, quality is a profit strategy. Although theoretical studies suggest that companies offering a higher degree of service quality generate higher profits, no published studies or model exist where the total series of consequences, from the allocation of resources to customer satisfaction and eventually profitability, is discussed. Researchers believe that customer satisfaction results in profitability, but question the possibility of a positive correlation between market share and customer satisfaction. Against this background it was {{the purpose of this study}} to determine the impact of service quality, customer retention and staff retention on the market share and profitability of a financial institution by constructing a service quality-profitability relationship model to determine the relationship between the different dependent and independent variables. A literature and empirical study was therefore undertaken to on the one hand evince the role and importance of the relationship between the service company and the customer, employee and internal markets in accomplishing a loyal customer base and enduring market share and to on the other hand relate service quality with market share and profitability. The primary finding of this study is that relationships exist between the various dependent and independent variables of the hypothesized model which confirms that service quality do impact on market share which in turn correlates with the profitability of a company. Moreover, customer retention positively correlates with profitability. It was also determined that customer retention positively correlates with market share. It was, however, found that no correlation exists between service quality and customer retention whilst relationships between marketing costs and market share and marketing costs and profitability could also not be determined. In view of the findings of the empirical investigation, it is recommended that the chosen bank attends to the following aspects: the improvement of service excellence; the improvement of aspects accomplishing customer and employee retention; establishing a more Afrosentric rather than a Eurosentric dimension of culture within the organisational culture and managerial practice of the bank; determining the critical psychological state of employees; establishing a positive and constructive psychological state within the bank; revising the format of reporting management information in order to calculate the impact of service quality on profitability rather than determining relationships between the elements. In taking this approach, the bank should be able to employ the service quality-profitability relationship model to the advantage of the bank to measure the impact of service quality on profitability and optimizing the relationship between service quality and profitability...|$|E
