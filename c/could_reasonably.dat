5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he <b>could</b> <b>reasonably</b> have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 2003, {{only two}} weeks after the fall of Baghdad, a dozen Turkish special forces were arrested in Da Quq (a tribal village 45 minutes north of Kirkuk). According to Time, a weekly world news magazine, they were wearing {{civilian}} clothes and intended to infiltrate Iraq, lagging behind a humanitarian convoy, in order to destabilize the region to a level where Turkey <b>could</b> <b>reasonably</b> send its own peacekeeping force. However, they were intercepted by American forces, who claimed they had received prior knowledge of the group.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 of the Act {{includes}} new {{provisions to}} cover this sort of situation. Section 4(1) establishes a general duty to repair and maintain the property, owed by the landlord to anyone who <b>could</b> <b>reasonably</b> {{be expected to be}} harmed by a breach; this includes tenants, their friends and family and also trespassers. This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect. Additionally, a landlord who merely has the right to repair property rather than an obligation to do so may still be found liable, if one of the groups described in Section 4 was harmed by their failure to repair.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant <b>could</b> <b>reasonably</b> have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that <b>could</b> <b>reasonably</b> be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E

25|$|In English law, {{high treason}} was {{punishable}} by being hanged, drawn and quartered (men) or burnt {{at the stake}} (women), although beheading could be substituted by royal command (usually for royalty and nobility). Those penalties were abolished in 1814, 1790 and 1973 respectively. The penalty was used by later monarchs against people who <b>could</b> <b>reasonably</b> be called traitors, although most modern jurists would call it excessive. Many of them would now just be considered dissidents.|$|E

25|$|A {{precursor}} to the dory type was the early French bateau type, a flat bottom boat with straight sides used as early as 1671 on the Saint Lawrence River. The common coastal boat of the time was the wherry and the merging of the wherry design with the simplified flat bottom of the bateau resulted in {{the birth of the}} dory.

25|$|In the Kalpanath case, the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society of Singapore had {{determined}} {{that there was}} a sufficiently serious case for disciplinary action to be taken against the applicant, a lawyer.

The applicant claimed that this showed the respondent <b>could</b> <b>reasonably</b> be thought to have displayed bias, and as a result the whole Committee was tainted by the bias. The proceedings were eventually quashed upon a finding of apparent bias.|$|E

25|$|However, the First Cause {{does not}} {{necessarily}} have to be temporally the first. Thus, {{the question of whether}} or not the universe can be imagined as eternal was fiercely debated in the Middle Ages. The University of Paris's condemnation of 1270 denounced the belief that the world is eternal. Aquinas' intellectual rival, Bonaventure, held that the temporality of the universe is demonstrable by reason. Aquinas' position was that the temporality of the world is an article of faith, and not demonstrable by reason; though one <b>could</b> <b>reasonably</b> conclude either that the universe is temporal or eternal.|$|E

Maurice rejected the offer, being able to negotiate much more favourable peace terms in 591, after substantial successes on the battlefield. For the time being, however, he had to abide by Avar and Slavic incursions and hope that his forces garrisoned at Singidunum could deter the invaders, posing a constant threat to the Avar homeland, just {{on the other side of}} the Danube. The Roman presence at Singidunum was strong enough to effect constant break-offs of Avar raids. However, it could not prevent the attacks.|$|E
