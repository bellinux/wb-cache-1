2500|$|On the {{tropical}} island paradise of Mata Nui, the Matoran villagers {{live in fear}} of an all-powerful being known as the Makuta - alleged to have cast his 'brother', the Great Spirit Mata Nui (the Matoran's god-like savior of whom the island is named after) into a deep sleep. Now, Makuta has taken control of the Rahi, the island's fauna, to attack the Matoran and their villages. One Matoran, Takua, banished due to his lack of work ethic, now travels the island looking for stories to tell; earning him the nickname [...] "The Chronicler". On one journey, he finds six ancient power stones and brings them to Kini Nui, {{the heart of the}} island. There, he joins them together and unknowingly triggers a beacon for six canisters floating in the ocean to travel to Mata Nui. Once ashore, the canisters burst open to reveal six powerful beings, destined to save the island and the Great Spirit: Tahu - Toa of Fire; Gali - Toa of Water; Lewa - Toa of Air; Onua - Toa of Earth; Pohatu - Toa of Stone and Kopaka - Toa of Ice. Carrying formidable tools to channel their elemental energies and donning great 'Kanohi' masks of power, the Toa remember nothing of their former lives except their names. Prior to meeting each other, they rebuild themselves on the seashores and travel to one of the six villages on the island, where they learn of the Matoran's war against the Rahi. The Toa soon join the conflict, and with the aid of the Matoran and their Turaga leaders, begin searching for more Kanohi masks, each of which possess a different ability. Collecting six each, they exchange their masks for Golden Kanohi that carry the power of all their former ones and descend underground to face Makuta. Prior to arriving at the villain's lair, they form two Toa Kaita (titan beings created when Toa fuse together) to challenge Makuta's Manas crabs and battle dark manifestations of themselves dubbed [...] "Shadow Toa". When the Toa arrive, Makuta appears {{in the form of a}} Matoran to trick them, but then transforms into a swirling vortex of tentacles and rusty machine parts. They defeat the Makuta by combining their elemental powers onto him. Triumphant, the heroes return to the surface. But Takua, having secretly followed the Toa down, discovers a large hive of cocoons hidden away from the battle site. He sees one burst open, but quickly escapes back to the surface before he <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E

Because the Almighty so willed it, our Governor will say, taking it for granted that He willed everything of which a record is given in the Old Testament.

Everybody knows how much {{easier it is to}} get up the history and geography of a country when you are actually in it than when you are merely reading about it. It lives and moves before you.

The Tombs of the Kings are worth many papyri.

60|$|If, therefore, any of {{you should}} ask me how to study history, I should answer--Take by all means biographies: wheresoever possible, autobiographies; and study them. Fill your minds with live human figures; men of like passions with yourselves; see how each {{lived and worked in}} the time and place in which God put him. Believe me, that when you have thus made a friend of the dead, and brought him to life again, and let him teach you to see with his eyes, and feel with his heart, you will begin to {{understand}} more of his generation and his circumstances, than all the mere history-books of the period would teach you. In proportion as you understand the man, and only so, will you begin to understand the elements in which he worked. And not only to understand, but to remember. Names, dates, genealogies, geographical details, costumes, fashions, manners, crabbed scraps of old law, which you used, perhaps, to read up and forget again, because they were not rooted, but stuck into your brain, as pins are into a pincushion, to fall out at the first shake--all these you will remember; because they will arrange and organize themselves around the central human figure: just as, if you have studied a portrait by some great artist, you cannot think of the face in it, without recollecting also the light and shadow, the tone of colouring, the dress, the very details of the background, and all the accessories which the painter's art has grouped around; each with a purpose, and therefore each fixing itself duly in your mind.

I am free to confess that I have learnt what little I know of the middle-ages, what they were like, how they came to be what they were, and how they issued in the Reformation, not so much from the study of the books about them (many and wise though they are), as from the thumbing over, for years, the semi-mythical saints' lives of Surius and the Bollandists.|$|E
