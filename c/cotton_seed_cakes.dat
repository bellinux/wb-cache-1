The feedstuffs having different digestibilities showed significant (P< 0. 05) differences in the rate and amount of gas production, metabolizable energy (ME) and digestibility of organic matter. Predicted metabolizable energy values were very low in feedstuffs having high fiber and low protein contents. These feedstuffs included various grasses, crop residues and wheal straw. Lowest ME value of 4. 7 MJ/kg of dry matter (DM) was found in wheat straw.

40|$|Due to acute {{shortage}} of quality feeds the majority or ruminants {{have to depend}} mainly on poor quality roughages. Two main drawbacks of such roughages are low ad libitum consumption and poor utilization. In the Sudan hummra is characteristic of the grass dominant in the pasture and as the bulk of animal population in the Sudan {{is in the hands}} of nomads, livestock depend entirely on these grasses, which are low in nitrogen content and are presumably inadequate for meeting the growth requirements of these animals. So limited supplementation experiments were designed to see the effects of supplementation of hummra with molasses, minerals, urea and <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> (Either separately or together) on its utilization by desert sheep and desert goats and the performance of these animals. Twenty-five young male desert sheep and a similar number of young male desert goats were divided to five groups each, which were matched according to body weight. Group I was fed chopped hummra, group II: chopped hummra + 10 %molasses, Group III: chopped hummra + 10 % molasses + 3 % minerals + vitamins, Group IV: chopped hummra + 10 % molasses + 3 % minerals + vitamins + 2. 7 % urea and Group V fed chopped hummra + 10 % molasses + 3 % minerals + vitamins + 25 % <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake.</b> Feeding trials were carried out for 6 to 9 weeks. Water was available all the time. The following parameters were used for measuring the extent of utilization of unsupplemented and supplemented desert grass and the effect of supplementation on the performance of desert sheep and desert goats: 1. Feed intake and dry matter digestibility. 2. Nitrogen balance. 3. Growth (Body weight changes) 4. Blood chemical composition. 5. Rumen liquor chemical composition. 6. Dressing percentage. In the light of the above measurements a comparison was made in the efficiency of feed utilization by desert sheep and desert goats. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Feed intake and apparent dry matter digestibility: supplementation with molasses alone or with molasses plus minerals had no significant effect. Supplementation with urea <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> increased food intake and dry matter digestibility. 2. Feeding hummra alone or hummra plus molasses and mineral mixture, resulted in negative nitrogen balance. Supplementation with urea or <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> resulted in a positive nitrogen balance which was greater in case of <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> supplementation than urea supplementation. 3. Growth: In both sheep and goats the group fed grass only and group fed grass plus molasses or molasses and minerals failed to growth or even to maintain body weight. Group IV which received urea supplement managed to maintain its body weight. The only group of sheep and goats which showed positive growth was the group supplemented with protected protein in the form of <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake.</b> 4. The blood constitutes (total serum protein, albumin, urea, glucose, inorganic phosphorous, magnesium and calcium) were not much affected by the various treatments. The major change occurred in serum urea level, which was significantly higher in groups fed urea and cottonseed cake. 5. Supplementation with <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> or urea resulted in increased levels of ammonia and total volatile fatty acids in rumen fluid. PH decreased as the levels of total volatile fatty acids increased and showed significant variation. The other rumen liquor components studied (Na, K, osmolarity) showed no significant difference between treatments in both sheep and goats. 6. Supplementation with urea or <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> resulted in a significant increase in dressing percentage in both sheep and goats but there was no marked difference between feeding hummra alone, hummra plus molasses or molasses plus minerals. The efficiency of utilization of unsupplemented and supplemented desert grass was essentially similar in both sheep and goats. However, supplementation with urea and <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> was rather more beneficial to goats than sheep. It is concluded from the results of this work than desert grass (hummra) is inadequate for meeting the growth requirements of young desert sheep and desert goats. Supplementation with molasses or molassess and minerals did not improve the utilization of this low-quality roughage. Addition of urea (2. 7 %) to the molasses/minerals supplement improved utilization of desert grass and almost reached the maintenance requirements of both sheep and goats. Supplementation with protected protein in the form of <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> improved utilization of hummra and resulted in a gain in body weight in both sheep and goats. So it is recommended to use urea as a cheap source of nitrogen supplement for low-quality roughage together with grain or <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> as a source of protected protein...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Alpha-amylase is an {{important}} commercialized enzyme among the starch-hydrolyzing ones.  The bacterial amylase is widely utilized in various sectors of industry due to its advantages to amylases derived from plant or animal sources. Also the use of agricultural products and their residues as inexpensive fermentation substrates has high impact on minimizing the cost of α-amylase production. The principle {{aim of this study}} is to optimize α-amylase production by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens using low cost agricultural resources with Response Surfaces Methodology (RSM). Materials and methods: The Effect of different amounts of the carbon source (extract of pea) and nitrogen source (cotton <b>seed</b> <b>cake)</b> on production of α-amylase by B. amyloliquefaciens using statistical methods of RSM was studied. Carbon and nitrogen sources were considered in 5 levels during the submerged fermentation and used central composite rotatable design with 10 experiments. Results: The best conditions for maximum production of α-amylase by B. amyloliquefaciens were pea extract of 75 g/L and <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> of 33. 3 g/L, so that in these conditions the enzyme production rate was 69. 74 Uml- 1.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} at Livestock Research and Development Station Surezai, Peshawar during June to August 2011. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the effect of <b>Cotton</b> <b>Seed</b> <b>Cake</b> (CSC) on milk yield, milk composition, feed intake, Body Condition Score (BCS) and live weight of Holstein Friesian (HF) crossbred cows. A total of nine mid-lactation crossbred cows were randomly distributed to three groups and allocated to diets containing zero (control), 20 and 35 percent CSC. All the three rations were Isocaloric and Isonitrogeniuos. Each cow was given a daily feed ration according to NRC standards. Mean daily milk yield differed (P 0. 05) effect on protein content in milk as cows on 35 % CSC diet produced the least 2. 7 ± 0. 09 percent protein, while the control group produce the highest 3. 00 ± 0. 09 percent. The concentration of Lactose and total milk solid not fat (SNF) content was higher (P> 0. 05) for control group than the cows fed on other diet. There was significant (P 0. 05) effect on mean changes in BCS. The Live weight was not effected significantly (P> 0. 05) by rations, However highest mean change in weight gain of 7. 66 ± 4. 95 kg/ 45 day was recorded for cows fed ration having 35 % CSC while least 5. 00 ± 7. 90 kg/ 45 day was recorded for cows fed zero% CSC in the ration. Economically ration having 35 % CSC had the lowest cost of milk production (Rs: 17. 14 /kg) as compared to ration having 20 % (Rs. 19. 68 /kg) and Zero% CSC (Rs. 21. 6 /kg). These results concluded that milk yield; milk fat and feed intake was increased with supplementation of high level of <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> in the dairy cattle ration. Higher proportion of CSC (35 %) has shown the best efficiency of production as compare to other rations...|$|R

40|$|Twenty {{sexually mature}} Desert ewes {{were used to}} {{study the effects of}} {{concentrate}} supplementation on thermoregulation and reproductive traits. The ewes were divided into two equal groups, control and supplemented; the supplemented group received daily 500 g of concentrate mixture (crushed sorghum grain and <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake).</b> In both groups, oestrus was synchronized with hormonal method and the ewes were naturally inseminated. Pregnancy was diagnosed by the ultra-sonography technique. Dietary supplementation resulted in a shorter time of oestrus onset, higher rates of conception, lambing and a significant decrease in gestation length. The fertility and fecundity of ewes were also improved. Supplementations also increased significantly the pre-and post lambing weight of ewes and the birth and weaning weights of the lambs. The body weight, rectal temperature and respiratory rate increased significantly with the advance of pregnancy in both groups of ewes. These indices decreased significantly with the progress of lactation. The supplemented ewes maintained higher values of these indices during pregnancy and lactation...|$|R
30|$|The results {{obtained}} {{in this study}} were in agreement with other literature reports, where rice grain was found to be the most suitable media for mass culture of B. bassiana (Sharma et al. 2002; Sahayaraj and Namasivayam 2008). Sahayaraj and Namasivayam (2008) reported rice (11.24  ×  106 spore/g) and wheat grain (11.76  ×  106 spore/g) as the most suitable substrate for B. bassiana spore production. However, in comparison to above studies, the present study which utilizes agricultural waste (unsuitable for human consumption) as substrate holds much significance. Moreover, utilization of food grains for biopesticide production would not be economical. Investigations concerning fungal enzyme production on <b>seed</b> oil <b>cake</b> have been reported (Joshi and Khare 2011). The low spore production obtained with <b>seed</b> <b>cakes</b> (jatropha and pongamia) in this study could be attributed to their organic content (C/N ratio) or presence of antinutritional factors such as phorbol esters, curcin and trypsin inhibitors (Ameen et al. 2011). Makkar et al. (2008) reported Jatropha curcas <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> meal to be toxic to rats, mice, ruminants and humans. However, recent reports on reductions of cyanide, tannin, oxalate, trypsin inhibitors and other toxins from the J. curcas <b>seed</b> <b>cakes</b> during SSF with fungi (Belewu and Sam 2010; Ameen et al. 2011), indicates that jatropha if used as substrate, would not only help in biopesticide production, but the detoxified <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> would also serves as protein rich feed for livestock. Literature reports on B. bassiana spore production on some other <b>seed</b> <b>cakes</b> as; gingelly <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> (5.35  ×  1010 spores/ 100  g) and <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> (4.31  ×  1010 spores/ 100  g) medium, observed comparatively higher spore yield (Abraham et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to isolate the {{gossypol}} (Phenolic compound) and screening of phytochemical constituents from seed extract. During this study gossypol was extracted from <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> and <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake</b> using different organic solvents like acetone, ethanol, methanol, pet ether, chloroform and hot water and screened for phytochemical constituents. Analysis revealed the presence of phenols, glycosides, flavonoids, and steroids. Specific tests were conducted for each group of the phytochemicals. Among the extracts tested polar solvents like acetone, ethanol, methanol extracts showed more phytochemicals than others followed by pet ether, hot water, chloroform. The phytochemicals like saponins, flavonoids, tri-terpenoids, and tannins were not found in seed extract, specifically showed phenols with more quantity in polar solvent extract like acetone, ethanol and methanol cardiac glycosides and steroids are observed in both polar and non-polar solvent of seed extracts. Similar kind of compounds are present in Bt and non-Bt but the appearance of test coloration of seed extracts predicted as is slightly darker for Bt variety. This could be due to more amount of the component may be present in Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> extract than non-Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> extract. The compound Gossypol was detected in extracts by applying Chromatographic technique as well as chemical tests with antimony chloride (SbCl 3), and stannic chloride (SnCl 3) and leadacetate (Pb(CH 3 COO) 2).
