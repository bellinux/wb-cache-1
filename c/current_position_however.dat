In case of indoor environment which cannot support GPS information, SLAM is especially necessary to recognize <b>current</b> <b>position.</b> <b>However</b> it is difficult to generate large-scale map because of cumulative error of the sensors.

40|$|An {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) must be able {{to safely}} reach its destination even, when it can only gather limited information about its environment. When an obstacle is detected, the UAV {{must be able to}} choose a path that will avoid collision with the obstacle. For the collision avoidance scheme, we apply the velocity obstacle approach since it is applicable even with the UAV’s limited sensing capability. To be able to apply the velocity obstacle approach, we need to know the parameter values of the obstacle such as its size, current velocity and <b>current</b> <b>position.</b> <b>However,</b> due to the UAV’s limited sensing capability, such information about the obstacle is not available. Thus, by evaluating sensor readings, we get the changes in the possible positions of the obstacle in order to generate the velocity obstacle and make the UAV choose a collision-free trajectory towards the destination. We performed simulation on different obstacle movements and the collision-free trajectory of the UAV is shown in the simulation results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Mobile robots {{are often}} {{required}} to navigate environments for which prior maps are incomplete or inaccurate. In such cases, initial paths generated for the robots {{may need to}} be amended as new information is received that is in conflict with the original maps. The most widely used algorithm for performing this path replanning is Focussed Dynamic A * (D*), which is a generalization of A * for dynamic environments. D * {{has been shown to be}} up to two orders of magnitude faster than planning from scratch. In this paper, we present a new replanning algorithm that generates equivalent paths to D * while requiring about half its computation time. Like D*, our algorithm incrementally repairs previous paths and focusses these repairs towards the <b>current</b> robot <b>position.</b> <b>However,</b> it performs these repairs in a novel way that leads to improved efficiency.

40|$|Determining {{the spatial}} {{position}} of a speaker finds a growing interest in video conference scenario where automated camera steering and tracking are required. Speaker localization can be achieved with a dual step approach. In the preliminary stage microphone array is used to extract the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the speech signal. These readings are then used by the second stage for the actual localization. Since speaker trajectory must be smooth, estimates of close speaker positions {{might be used to}} improve the <b>current</b> <b>position</b> estimate. <b>However,</b> many methods, although exploiting the spatial information obtained by different microphone pairs, do not exploit this temporal information. In this contribution we present two localization schemes, which exploit the temporal information. The first is the well known extended Kalman filter (EKF). The second is a recursive form of a Gauss method, which we denote Recursive Gauss (RG). Experimental study supports the potential of the proposed methods. ...|$|R

Since users can easily move to different positions around a table, systems must allow people to orient artifacts to their <b>current</b> <b>position.</b> <b>However,</b> it is only recently that rotation and translation techniques have been specifically designed for tabletops, and existing techniques still do not feel as simple and efficient as their real-world counterparts. To address this problem, we studied the ways that people move and reorient sheets of paper on real-world tabletops. We found that in almost all cases, rotation and translation are carried out simultaneously, and that an open-palm hand position {{was the most common}} way to carry out the motion. Based on our observations, we designed a new set of reorientation techniques that more closely parallel real-world motions. The new techniques, collectively called TNT, use three-degree-of-freedom (3 DOF) input to allow simultaneous rotation and translation.

40|$|Young stars {{observed}} in the distant Galactic halo are usually thought to have formed elsewhere, either in the Galactic disk or perhaps the Galactic center, and subsequently ejected at high velocities to their <b>current</b> <b>position.</b> <b>However,</b> some of these stars have apparent lifetimes shorter the required flight time from the Galactic disk/center. We suggest that such stars have evolved in close runaway or hypervelocity binaries. Stellar evolution of such binaries can drive them into mass transfer configurations and even mergers. Such evolution could then rejuvenate them (e. g. blue stragglers) and extend their lifetime after their ejection. The extended lifetimes of such stars could then be reconciled with their flight times to the Galactic halo. We study the possibilities of binary runaway and hypervelocity stars and show that such binaries could have been ejected in triple disruptions and other dynamical interactions with stars or with massive black holes. We show that currently observed "too young" star in the halo could have been ejected from the Galactic disk or the Galactic center and be observable in their current position if they were ejected as binaries. Specifically it is shown that the hypervelocity star HE 0437 - 5439 could be such a rejuvenated star. Other suggestions for its ejection from the LMC {{are found to be}} highly unlikely. Moreover, it is shown that its observed metallicity is most consistent with a Galactic origin and a Galactic center origin can not currently rule out. In addition, we suggest that triple disruptions by the massive black hole in the Galactic center could also capture binaries in close orbits near the MBH, some of which may later evolve to become more massive rejuvenated stars.

40|$|Asinara Island {{is located}} in northwestern Sardinia (Italy) and only {{recently}} has been divested as a maximum-security prison and returned to nature protection as a National Park with Marine Protected Area along the coastal perimeter. Geologically, the island is formed by a Paleozoic basement in transition between the metamorphic rocks and the Pre-Hercynian granitic batholith of Sardinia. New surveys carried out to reconstruct the recent evolution of the landscape have shown a lot of deposits formed by large blocks of granitoid and anphibolitic rocks representing a favorable situation to produce this material formation in terms of differential erosion in periglaciar environment. Similar morphologies are possible to observe in many places in Sardinia continental hard rocks as effect of the conditions of refreezing periods ("glacial"). These deposits {{are commonly known as}} " block streams " or " block fields " and reported {{for the first time in}} Italy in 1990 in the central area of the island of Sardinia, about 500 meters above sea level. Their presence in Sardinia is always documented in a range of altitudes not less than 350 - 400 meters and, in this case for the first time they have been identified in close proximity to the coastline. In addition, some of these deposits cover the thalwegs present on the granite rocks in the central portion of the island. The most interesting cases are represented by the deposits located on the northwestern side, near the lighthouse of Punta Scorno. The widespread presence of these deposits suggests significant areal erosion of the island terrain; they probably accumulated during the colder episodes that have characterized the Middle and Upper Pleistocene of the entire western Mediterranean. These testify the existence of an energy relief higher than the present one and a coastline located about 25 kilometers from the <b>current</b> <b>position,</b> <b>however,</b> documented by the block stream of Cala Arena, the first deposit located for the first time under the sea...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces the}} model of opportunistic adaptation to explain new venture growth. In established firms processes of change and adaptation usually imply a transition from one steady-state strategy to another and a problem oriented perspective as firms change in response to potential threats to their <b>current</b> <b>positions.</b> <b>However,</b> {{in the context of}} new ventures, adaptation is less about moving from one existent strategy to another and more about the entrepreneur’s effort to reach a steady state for the first time by continuously experimenting and combining resources in creative and innovative ways. The model of opportunistic adaptation rests on three key assumptions: 1.) new venture growth results from actions grounded in an opportunistic (proactive) logic; 2.) entrepreneurial cognition is viewed as an antecedent to all organizational actions leading to growth; 3.) the relationship between entrepreneurial cognition and action is influenced by industry and firm level attributes. The model is tested using quantitative and qualitative data on new ventures founded between 1996 and 2006 in technology intensive industries. The results provide partial support for the notion of opportunistic adaptation as a process in which entrepreneurial cognition, firm and industry related factors are closely intertwined. The results of the dissertation suggest that some aspects of entrepreneurial cognition, such as entrepreneurial schema focus have a more direct effect on actions related to new venture growth than others whose effect is strongly moderated by contextual influences such as industry growth and social network heterogeneity. This dissertation also finds that not all types of organizational actions associated with an opportunity logic lead to new venture growth. Of the three action types included in the model (fast, diverse and frequent) only action diversity was found to {{have a positive impact on}} new venture growth. Theoretical implications of the study results for both the literature on new venture growth and the literature on organizational adaptation, as well as practical implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a method for}} market risk measurement of an interest rate derivatives portfolio. The potential value loss of the portfolio is tested {{on a daily basis}} using market scenarios for interest rates and interest rate volatilities. Test scenarios are chosen to represent plausible changes in the market factors. The portfolio being tested consists of interest rate instruments including swaps, forward rate agreements, futures contracts, futures options, interest rate caps and floors and swaptions. Valuation models for these instrument types are introduced. The market scenarios are specified from historical interest rate data using principal components analysis. The resulting principal components are interpreted as typical market movements and are therefore chosen as test scenarios. Scenarios testing is used as a supplementary market risk measurement tool in conjunction with the incumbent risk management tools. It is found that the risk measures that result from the test scenarios do help the dealers and the risk managers to evaluate the structure of the <b>current</b> derivatives <b>position.</b> <b>However,</b> the benefits over the current risk measures are limited, and better results could be obtained by methods like scenario simulation and Value at Risk...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown a social gradient in health that suggests that better health is found for people in more advantaged positions in society. This {{research has}} mainly {{been focused on the}} relationship between social position in childhood and health or <b>current</b> <b>position</b> and health. <b>However,</b> {{little is known about the}} impact of positions held in between these two time-points. In this paper a potentially lasting health effect of occupational class positions is explored. The study starts with a description of the work-life biographies for people in different <b>current</b> class <b>positions.</b> Then goes on to investigate if the effect of current class is modified when including previous positions during adulthood, as well as how much extra information is gained by utilizing information on individual work histories. An association between accumulated experience of manual working class and self-rated health is found. Also, when controlling for accumulated class experience, the social gradient for current class is no longer significant. Furthermore, even for non-manual employees the odds of reporting less than good self-rated health is increasing with each added year of previous manual experience. This suggests that the social gradient in health is more complex than just a matter of <b>current</b> social <b>position</b> influencing <b>current</b> health, and that the effects would potentially be modified if the full complexity of life-time social positions were taken into account...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a modified random walk which uses unvisited edges whenever possible, {{and makes a}} simple random walk otherwise. We call such a walk an edge-process. We assume there is a rule A, which tells the walk which unvisited edge to use whenever there is a choice. In the simplest case, A is a uniform random choice over unvisited edges incident with the <b>current</b> walk <b>position.</b> <b>However</b> we do not exclude arbitrary choices of rule A. For example, the rule could be determined on-line by an adversary, or could vary from vertex to vertex. For even degree expander graphs, of bounded maximum degree, we have the following result. Let G be an n vertex even degree expander graph, for which every vertex is {{in at least one}} vertex induced cycle of length L. Any edge-process on G has cover time (n+ (n log n) /L). This result is independent of the rule A used to select the order of the unvisited edges, which can be chosen on-line by an adversary. As an example, With high probability, random r-regular graphs, (r at least 4, even), are expanders for which L = Omega(log n). Thus, for almost all such graphs, the vertex cover time of the edge-process is Theta(n). This improves the vertex cover time of such graphs by a factor of log n, compared to the Omega(n log n) cover time of any weighted random walk. Comment: 13 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
