40|$|Petroleum {{production}} {{is a relatively}} inefficient process. For oil production, it is, generally, less than 60 % effective on a macro scale and less than 60 % effective on a micro scale. This results, commonly, in an actual oil recovery of less than 35 %. Optimization of the production process will, therefore, {{have a significant impact}} on the supply of energy. At various locations in the world consortia have been set up to develop new technology that would help optimize the production process. In 2005 Shell, Delft University of Technology, and Netherlands Organization for Applied Research TNO have started the ISAPP knowledge centre. ISAPP aims to develop innovative solutions for petroleum production based on a closed loop integrated systems approach. The projects in ISAPP address both reservoir characterization issues and control issues. Apart from a short overview, this paper presents two cases from the ISAPP project portfolio: An optimal control example that shows how well head <b>choke</b> <b>control</b> can be used to prevent wax deposition during production; a reservoir characterization example that deals with production history matching and prediction of production from new wells...|$|R
5000|$|Most rotaries had normal inlet valves, so {{that the}} fuel (and {{lubricating}} oil) was taken into the cylinders already mixed with air - as in a normal four-stroke engine. Although a conventional carburetor, {{with the ability to}} keep the fuel/air ratio constant over a range of throttle openings, was precluded by the spinning crankcase; it was possible to adjust the air supply through a separate flap valve or [...] "bloctube". The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting (usually full open) and then adjust the fuel/air mixture to suit using a separate [...] "fine adjustment" [...] lever that controlled the air supply valve (in the manner of a manual <b>choke</b> <b>control).</b> Due to the rotary engine's large rotational inertia, it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel/air mixture by trial and error without stalling it, although this varied between different types of engine, and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary knack. After starting the engine with a known setting that allowed it to idle, the air valve was opened until maximum engine speed was obtained.|$|R

Subsea trees may range in size and weight from a few tons to approximately 70 tons for high pressure, deepwater (>3000 feet) guidelineless applications. Subsea trees contain many additional valves and accessories compared to Surface trees.

40|$|Kick {{tolerance}} {{is a key}} parameter {{to indicate}} whether shut-in operation {{can be carried out}} safely and a proper well killing method should be chosen in well drilling. At present, however, the calculation of kick tolerance in deepwater drilling is not efficient enough. In this paper, a calculation method for volume kick tolerance of deepwater drilling was developed by means of theoretical derivation and example verification. Based on deepwater borehole temperature profile, choke manifold and annulus circulating pressure loss, the calculation model of volume kick tolerance was established under the constraint of the pressure-bearing capacity of the formation at the casing shoe, resistance to internal pressure of casing, blowout preventer (BOP) and <b>choke</b> <b>control.</b> Then, its reliability was verified by using the calculation results of a deepwater well in the South China Sea. It is indicated that the well can be shut in safely and the well killing will be safer if the Engineer's Method is used. The result is in agreement with the measures that were adopted on site. Finally, the newly developed calculation model was compared with those which don't take temperature and pressure loss into account, and the effect of choke manifold, annulus pressure loss and temperature inside wellbore on kick tolerance was analyzed. It is shown that the volume kick tolerance will get smaller if the effect of pressure loss and temperature is not taken into account, and the well killing conditions will be more rigorous. In addition, the technical measures to increase kick tolerance were proposed after the influential laws of pit gain and overflow depth on kick tolerance were analyzed...|$|R
