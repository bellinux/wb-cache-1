Mattingly broke down the classification further into which foundry, and in which series, each coin came from. Mattingly and Sydenham were joined by C. H. V. Sutherland in producing volumes IVb (1938) and IVc (1949), and by Percy H. Webb for volumes Va (1927) and Vb (1933). After 1930, the editorship {{of each of the}} final volumes was given to a specialist of the period. After Mattingly's death in 1964, Sutherland and R. A. G.

40|$|A {{corpus of}} 217 wooden statues {{dating from the}} Egyptian Old Kingdom is {{examined}} and discussed in detail. 127 statues have been dated to individual reigns within the Old Kingdom and are placed in <b>chronological</b> order (<b>Catalogue</b> A). They {{form the basis of}} a chronological feature list. Using the dating criteria from the feature list, and by drawing parallels with Catalogue A, a further 75 statues (Catalogue B) have been assigned to individual reigns within the Old Kingdom. New features from Catalogue B are then added to the <b>chronological</b> feature list. <b>Catalogue</b> C comprises statues which have no parallels in Catalogue A, but do sometimes have a parallel in Catalogue B, and which in the absence so far of evidence to the contrary, may be assigned to the Old Kingdom. Appendix I discusses the texts inscribed on 51 of the statues. These consist of the names and titles of the tomb owner. The texts are usually inscribed on the bases, but in two instances they are on the skirt, and once on the sceptre. The titles are examined in detail to see whether their date range is consistent with the dates suggested in the text. Unfortunately the inscriptions give no further dating assistance. The phrase im 3 hw hr is examined in detail and it emerges that its use changed over time. Appendix 2 is a discussion of the material of the statues, as far as this is known. Only 8 statues have been scientifically analysed, a further 4 have been identified visually, and another 2 have unconfirmed analyses. From this meagre information it emerges that indigenous woods were preferred to imported woods. The most popular indiginous woods are sycamore and acacia.

40|$|This thesis {{attempted}} a historical-ethnographic {{study of the}} evolution of luthiers’ profession in Athens from the mid 19 th century until the interwar era. It also attempted to identify those cultural conditions and influences that shaped the musical identity of the Athenian civil society and generated similar needs for the manufacture and trade of specific musical instruments. The manufacture of musical instruments, as a profession and as an artistic activity, was connected to the geopolitical, economic, social and technical frame. In this way the causes that shaped the course, the rise and decline of the profession were sought. The instrument maker was examined as a unit, {{as a part of a}} wider professional branch, but also as a body of the local musical culture. Construction was associated with trade and artisanal production was compared to the industrial mass one. The persons who served professionally the art of manufacture and trade of musical instruments were revealed, while their activity was recorded in time and space. This research fills in an important gap in modern Greek music history and displays the diachronic value of luthiers’ profession, who were an important part of greek craftsmanship and one of the key drivers of the local musical culture. The Athenian professional instrument manufacture, immediately after the proclamation of the city as the capital of Greece, began to accept significant influences from the western instrument manufacture, both on aesthetic and technical level, which is related to the general europeanization of urban centres of the country and generally the region of Eastern Mediterranean. The introduction of the concept of international commercial and industrial exhibitions, some of which were called 'universal', raised the issue of comparing the quality of Greek products to their respective European ones, while it also strengthened an informal "competition" on a local level between the craftsmen. In Greece were organised domestic commercial and industrial exhibitions based on the respective 'universal' standards. The Greek manufacturers of musical instruments were not indifferent to this challenge and won some distinctions, enhancing their professional image. Athens, during the period studied, was constantly extending its geographical limits parallel to the rapid population growth. The reconstruction of the population, due to internal migration and refugee populations, created or strengthened different musical genres, influencing accordingly the demand for musical instruments. The luthiers of Athens were operating according to the European standards of free market, without applying earlier forms of professional organisation, such as unions. The manufacture of musical instruments was organised in cooperation with the trading shops of musical products in 1927, when the "Association of Musical Product Traders and Luthiers" was first established. From the decades of 1930 - 40 on, there are evidence that prove the existence of the "Panhellenic Association of Luthiers. " The mapping and <b>chronological</b> <b>cataloguing</b> of the local luthiers’ shops and music stores in Athens were two of the most important achievements of this research. Until about the 1910 ’s mainly luthiers ran the trade of musical instruments, as the purely commercial shops were very few. However, the shops that sold musical instruments were gradually strengthened and became independent. Since late 1920 's, the reduction on demand for indigenous musical instruments’ manufacture in combination with the excessive supply of imported one, led many craftsmen to specialize in repairing. In the early 1930 ’s the old centre of Athenian instrument manufacture, that resided in the neighbourhood of Kolokotronis street, appears weakened, closing an important cycle in the local history of the profession. Numerous refugees who settled in the suburbs of Athens and Piraeus after the Asia Minor Catastrophe introduced a rich musical culture. They soon gained a very important position in the local music life, while some of them were involved in instrument making, particularly in Piraeus, inaugurating a new era in local history of this art. Overall, from 1835 till 1957, 62 luthiers and 86 stores of musical instruments were recorded in Athens, Piraeus and the suburbs. The history of Greek instrument-making remains an open field for research which can contribute significantly to the understanding of local musical culture, offering excitement to the researchers who will deal with it. ...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{geological}} hazards affecting the Italian territory (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, slope movements, floods, wildfires, etc.), and causing severe losses and casualties, sinkholes are rarely considered in {{hazard and risk}} analysis. Nevertheless, their occurrence, with the consequent negative effects on the built-up environment and human infrastructures, affect large parts of Italy, covering the whole country {{with a variety of}} typologies. Sinkholes mostly occur in karst areas, where soluble rocks such as carbonates and evaporites crop out or are present at low depth (De Waele et al., 2011). Development of sinkholes, however, may also be registered in alluvial plains, involving thick sequences of alluvial and colluvial deposits (Fig. 1). Recently, an effort was produced by the Institute of Research for the Hydrogeological Protection with the National Research Council of Italy (CNR-IRPI) to build a <b>chronological</b> <b>catalogue</b> on sinkhole phenomena in Italy, addresses toward the evaluation of the sinkhole hazard (Parise & Vennari, 2013; Parise et al., 2013). The <b>chronological</b> <b>catalogue</b> of sinkholes is specifically focused on the time of occurrence of the events, that is considered a crucial element for the definition of the sinkhole hazard. Even though the catalogue takes into account both natural and anthropogenic sinkholes (these latter being those events related to presence of manmade underground caves), given the topic of this conference, the present contribution will deal exclusively with natural sinkholes. Knowledge of the dates of occurrence of sinkholes represents the necessary element for definition of the hazard; at the same time, discriminating between sinkholes related to presence of natural or man-made caves may determine very different scenarios to be faced, in terms of civil protection actions. A sinkhole at the surface appears as punctual (site-located), and typically of limited dimensions. This, however, {{does not mean that the}} affected area is limited to that specific point, since underground the caves responsible for the event may potentially develop for a much wider extension. With respect to natural sinkholes, these typically are found in areas with soluble rocks affected by karst processes, or alluvial sediments in peculiar geological situations. Thus, the zonation of the sinkhole-prone areas may be done for natural sinkholes based solely upon geology as a first approximation...|$|E
