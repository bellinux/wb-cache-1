5|$|Most of the storm's {{effects were}} felt in Florida where it made {{landfall}} {{on the morning}} of June 18, causing gales, heavy rains, flooding, beach erosion and tornadoes. The highest winds were recorded at 41mph (66km/h) and up to 48mph (77km/h) during a thunderstorm at Macdill Air Force Base in Tampa on June 18. Rainfall peaked at 10.72inches (272.28mm) in Desoto City, while {{much of the rest of}} the state reported between 15inches (25125inches) of precipitation. High tides and waves caused flooding and beach erosion from Naples to the Tampa Bay area. Some waterfront buildings suffered damage from undermining including widespread damage of marinas and some boats. Several bulkheads and rock revetments experienced minor damage in Naples and Marco Island. Several man‑made dune structures seaward of the Coastal Construction <b>Control</b> <b>Line</b> in Collier County received minor damage at Vanderbilt Beach and Marco Island. Three people were killed in Florida in association with the subtropical storm with a further thirteen people injured. A Brevard County woman died when a canoe overturned and an Orange County child was killed when he was swept into a drainage ditch. 130 families were evacuated a few days after the storm from the Arcadia River area because the Peace River crested above flood stage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of approaches for synthesis and optimization of reversible circuits received significant {{attention in the}} past. This {{is partly due to}} the increasing emphasis on low power design methodologies, and partly motivated by recent works in quantum computation. While most of them relied on a gate library composed of multiple-control Toffoli (MCT) gates with positive <b>control</b> <b>lines,</b> some initial works also exist which additionally incorporate negative <b>control</b> <b>lines.</b> This usually leads to smaller circuits with respect to the number of gates as well as the corresponding quantum costs. However, despite these benefits, negative <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> have hardly been considered in post-synthesis optimization of reversible circuits so far. In this paper, we address this issue. We are presenting an optimization scheme inspired by template matching which explicitly makes use of negative <b>control</b> <b>lines.</b> Experimental evaluations demonstrate that exploiting negative <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> in fact lead to a {{reduction in the number of}} gates and the quantum costs by up to 60 % and 25 %, respectively...|$|R

Drivers were no longer allowed to overtake prior to the <b>control</b> <b>line.</b> The safety car restart procedure was eventually changed back to the 2013 system, with Todd Kelly stating that the 2014 procedure had been difficult to manage for the drivers.|$|E
25|$|Methanol is {{occasionally}} used to fuel {{internal combustion}} engines. Pure methanol {{is required by}} rule {{to be used in}} Champcars, Monster Trucks, USAC sprint cars (as well as midgets, modifieds, etc.), and other dirt track series, such as World of Outlaws, and Motorcycle Speedway, mainly because, {{in the event of an}} accident, methanol does not produce an opaque cloud of smoke. Since the late 1940s, Methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for radio control, <b>control</b> <b>line,</b> free flight airplanes, cars and trucks; such engines use a platinum filament glow plug that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction. Drag racers, mud racers, and heavily modified tractor pullers also use methanol as the primary fuel source. Methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a Top Alcohol Dragster and, until the end of the 2006 season, all vehicles in the Indianapolis 500 had to run on methanol. As a fuel for mud racers, methanol mixed with gasoline and nitrous oxide produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Synthesis of {{reversible}} circuits {{has attracted}} the attention of many researchers. In particular, approaches based on Decision Diagrams (DDs) have been shown beneficial since they enable the realization of corresponding circuits for large functions. However, all existing approaches rely on a gate library composed of positive <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> only. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} the additional use of negative <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> enables significant reductions of the respective circuit costs. In this paper, we aim for exploiting this potential. To this end, two complementary schemes are investigated. First, a post-synthesis optimization that exploits the power of negative <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> is utilized to optimize the circuits generated by previously proposed DD-based methods. Second, negative <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> are explicitly considered during synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches result in a significant reduction with respect to gate count as well as quantum costs. I...|$|R

2500|$|A bang-bang {{charge pump}} phase {{detector}} must {{always have a}} dead band where the phases of inputs are close enough that the detector detects no phase error. For this reason, bang-bang phase detectors [...] are associated with significant minimum peak-to-peak jitter, because of drift within the dead band. However these types, having outputs consisting of very narrow pulses at lock, are very useful for applications requiring very low VCO spurious outputs. [...] The narrow pulses contain very little energy and are easy to filter out of the VCO control voltage. [...] This results in low VCO <b>control</b> <b>line</b> ripple and therefore low FM sidebands on the VCO.|$|E

2500|$|The 2014 season saw {{changes to}} the {{regulations}} regarding abandoned starts which require an additional formation lap and for the suspension and resumption of races {{in the case of}} a red flag. The procedure used for safety car restarts was also revised. Previously, the lead car controlled the pace until the safety car entered the pit lane at which point the lead car could accelerate. The new rules dictated that the lead car must maintain a speed between fifty and sixty kilometres-per-hour until it reached the [...] "Acceleration Zone" [...] located before the <b>control</b> <b>line</b> – mimicking the restart procedure used for the second half of the 60/60 Sprint format used in 2013 – at which point the driver could accelerate and racing resumed. This was in response to several incidents where the lead car accelerated too early on the safety car restart, most notably at the 2013 Austin 400 where Fabian Coulthard, Jamie Whincup and Craig Lowndes were penalised for the infringement.|$|E
2500|$|Dropping the fly {{onto the}} water and its {{subsequent}} movement on or beneath the surface is one of fly fishing's most difficult aspects; the angler is attempting to cast {{in such a way}} that the line lands smoothly on {{the water and}} the fly appears as natural as possible. At a certain point, if a fish does not strike, depending upon the action of the fly in the wind or current, the angler picks up the line to make another presentation. On the other hand, if a fish strikes, the angler pulls in line while raising the rod tip. This [...] "sets" [...] the hook in the fish's mouth. The fish is played either by hand, where the angler continues to hold the fly line in one hand to control the tension applied to the fish, or by reeling up any slack in the line and then using the hand to act as a drag on the reel. Most modern fly reels have an adjustable, mechanical drag system to <b>control</b> <b>line</b> tension during a fish's run.|$|E
2500|$|Avro Anson bombers used by Bass Island Airways {{on the run}} to King Island were housed and {{serviced}} at the Belmont Common, {{one being}} destroyed by floods in 1952.

The land returned to grazing use however the aero tie down stations remained, the old aero work shop became a metal working shop ( [...] Coghlan and Russell [...] ) and the common was still being [...] used by crop dusters and other bi-planes up till early 60's who would make sweeps low down to herd cattle away from the landing approach.It was rumored that Percy mentioned above also completed the [...] "first" [...] under bridge pass of the steel Moorabool street bridge. [...] Gliding was still conducted up till early 1960's as well at the Common with a winch truck used to winch the gliders to sufficient thermaling height. Returning to land was sometimes left a little late with low height remaining after a flight with one tree alongside the Moorabool street bridge reduced in height somewhat by a low passing glider. The glider shed was located approximately under the present main intersection at Barwon Heads / Settlement road intersection.
