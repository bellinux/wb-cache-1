Bacterial and fungal <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> are shed into body fluids in large amounts during infection. The goal of our {{study was to examine}} the in vivo fate and distribution of the γDPGA capsular polypeptide. Mice were injected via the intravenous route with various amounts of purified γDPGA. Blood, urine, and various organs were harvested at different times after treatment. Sites of γDPGA accumulation were determined by immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies specific for γDPGA. The results showed that the liver and spleen were the primary sites for the accumulation of γDPGA. As found in previous studies of <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides,</b> the Kupffer cells of the liver and splenic macrophages were sites for the cellular accumulation of γDPGA. Unlike <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides,</b> the hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells were also sites for γDPGA accumulation. γDPGA was rapidly cleared from serum and was excreted into the urine. γDPGA in the urine showed a reduced molecular size relative to native γDPGA. The results indicate that in vivo clearance of the polypeptide capsular antigen of B. anthracis shares several features with the clearance of <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides.</b> Key differences between the in vivo behaviors of γDPGA and <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> include the accumulation of γDPGA in hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and a γDPGA clearance rate that was more rapid than the clearance reported for <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{age-specific}} {{prevalence of}} serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> of Streptococcus pneumoniae, as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was studied in 1, 301 Ecuadorian children {{enrolled in a}} national nutrition and health survey. This prevalence was 6 % in infants < 6 months old and increased to 28 % in children 6 to 11 months old, 49 %o in those 12 to 17 months old, and 58 % in those 18 to 23 months old. About 80 % of the 5 -year-old children had this antibody. When tested separately against six different <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides,</b> serum IgM antibody reacted with decreasing frequency with serotype 3, 8, 19, 6, 23, and 1 <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides.</b> We did not observe a broadening of the antibody response with increasing age {{in the sense that}} more and more serotypes were recognized.

A smaller German serum collection showed a comparable age-related prevalence of pneumococcus-specific serum IgG and IgM antibodies. The highest incidence of respiratory diseases was observed in 1 - and 2 -year-old Ecuadorian children.

NK cells and NK-like T cells showed the strongest activation, followed by monocytes.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis forms part of a continuing programme concerned with the structural determination of <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> of some Enterobacteriaceae.

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae is a {{significant}} pathogen of young children and the elderly. Systemic infection by pneumococci is a complex process involving several bacterial and host factors. We have investigated the role of CD 40 L in host defense against pneumococcal infection. Treatment of mice with MR- 1 antibody (anti-CD 154 /CD 40 L) markedly reduced antibody responses to the pneumococcal protein PspA, elicited by immunization of purified protein or whole bacteria. In mice immunized with whole bacteria, MR- 1 treatment reduced antibody responses to <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> but not cell wall polysaccharides. MR- 1 did not suppress antibody responses to isolated <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> but did reduce the production of antibody to a capsular polysaccharide-protein conjugate, indicating that when presented {{in the context of}} whole bacteria, the humoral response to <b>capsular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> is partially T-cell dependent. Despite the reduction of the protective humoral responses to pneumococcal infection, administration of MR- 1 had no effect on sepsis, lung infection, or nasal carriage in nonimmune mice inoculated with virulent pneumococci.
