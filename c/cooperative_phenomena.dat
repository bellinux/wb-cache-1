The temperature dependence of physical properties {{in the vicinity of}} a quantum critical point (QCP) opens up a realm of new and unexplored physics. Research into quantum critical phenomena is not only conducive to a study of new physics in its own right, but is expected to lead to a much broader understanding of the complex yet fundamental behavior of elementary particles in metals and the <b>cooperative</b> <b>phenomena</b> in them that lead to the wide variety of useful applications of intermetallics in everyday life.

40|$|The {{study is}} {{proposed}} {{of a group}} of phenomena so far not systematically treated.

A brief survey of some possible <b>cooperative</b> <b>phenomena</b> in static and in stationary systems is given and their importance in physics, astrophysics, and biology is pointed out. Incidentally a generalization of thermodynamics from static systems to stationary systems is discussed. The view is advanced that the existence of crystals is due to certain <b>cooperative</b> <b>phenomena</b> which fact would in general necessitate the existence of a secondary structure of crystals.

40|$|We study {{a simple}} model of DNA {{divalent}} cationic surfactant complexation.

This binding transition occurs for concentrations that are lower for divalent than for monovalent surfactants. Since the electrostatic strength is larger in the first case and the amount of surfactant lower, we suggest that multivalent amphiphilic molecules would be more efficient than monovalent for transfection.

The orientational ordering of the molecules due to their short range highly anisotropic quadrupolequadrupole interactions presents an original case study of the combined effects of frustration and disorder. At low temperatures the NMR results show that the N 2 molecules adopt random frozen-in orientations for which any residual motion occurs at frequencies less than 10 - 2 Hz.

40|$|Size {{dependencies}} of {{the peak}} effect and irreversibility field in superconducting Sm- 123 powder specimens were investigated. The peak effect {{was found to}} disappear in the two-dimensional pinning regime in which powder size is smaller than pinning correlation length. This shows that the peak effect does not originate directly from elementary pinning mechanisms, but from a <b>cooperative</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of flux lines, as proposed by the pinning-induced disorder transition model. In addition, when powder size is smaller than virtual pinning correlation length in the ideal creep-free case, irreversibility field decreases with powder size. This supports the hypothesis that longitudinal flux bundle size is given by this length, as predicted by flux creep theory. These findings indicate that pinning correlation length is a general parameter that determines various properties associated with flux pinning phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{have been}} used to study a collective atomic transport phenomenon by repeated Ar$^+$ irradiations in the Ti/Pt interfacial system. The ion-induced injection of surface atoms to the bulk, the ejection of bulk atoms to the top layers together with surface erosion is strongly enhanced by interfacial mixing. This process leads to a dense interfacial material, and broadening of the interface region. The process scales with the relative difference of the atomic masses. We find that surface roughening and interfacial mixing is strongly coupled via an enhanced counterflow material transport normal to the surface which might be a novel surface damage mechanism. This <b>cooperative</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is active when the bilayer system is subjected to a high dose ion irradiation (multiple ion irradiations) and leads to surface cavity growth.
