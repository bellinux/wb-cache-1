5|$|In drug design it is {{important}} to consider the concentrations of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed. For example, some protein kinase inhibitors have chemical structures that are similar to adenosine triphosphate, one of the substrates of these enzymes. However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the <b>cell.</b> <b>Protein</b> kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP. As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.|$|E

40|$|Rice {{is a model}} plant {{widely used}} for basic and applied {{research}} programs. Plant <b>cell</b> wall <b>proteins</b> play key roles in {{a broad range of}} biological processes. However, pres-ently, knowledge on the rice cell wall proteome is rudimen-tary in nature. In the present study, the tightly-bound cell wall proteome of rice callus cultured cells using sequential extraction protocols was developed using mass spec-trometry and bioinformatics methods, leading to the identi-fication of 1568 candidate proteins. Based on bioinformat-ics analyses, 389 classical rice <b>cell</b> wall <b>proteins,</b> pos-sessing a signal peptide, and 334 putative non-classical <b>cell</b> wall <b>proteins,</b> lacking a signal peptide, were identified. By combining previously established rice <b>cell</b> wall <b>protein</b> databases with current data for the classical rice <b>cell</b> wall <b>proteins,</b> a comprehensive rice cell wall proteome, com-prised of 496 proteins, was constructed. A comparative analysis of the rice and Arabidopsis cell wall proteomes revealed a high level of homology, suggesting a predomi-nant conservation between monocot and eudicot <b>cell</b> wall <b>proteins.</b> This study importantly increased information on <b>cell</b> wall <b>proteins,</b> which serves for future functional anal-yses of these identified rice <b>cell</b> wall <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
25|$|In a <b>cell,</b> <b>protein</b> {{molecules}} of the host's own phenotype or of other biologic entities are continually synthesized and degraded. Each MHC molecule {{on the cell}} surface displays a molecular fraction of a protein, called an epitope. The presented antigen can be either self or non-self, thus preventing an organism's immune system targeting its own cells. In its entirety, the MHC population is like a meter indicating the balance of proteins within the cell.|$|E
500|$|Protein {{molecules}} {{that do not}} bind to cell membranes or the cytoskeleton are dissolved in the cytosol. The amount of protein in cells is extremely high, and approaches 200mg/ml, occupying about 20-30% {{of the volume of}} the cytosol. However, measuring precisely how much protein is dissolved in cytosol in intact cells is difficult, since some proteins appear to be weakly associated with membranes or organelles in whole cells and are released into solution upon cell lysis. [...] Indeed, in experiments where the plasma membrane of cells were carefully disrupted using saponin, without damaging the other cell membranes, only about one quarter of <b>cell</b> <b>protein</b> was released. These cells were also able to synthesize proteins if given ATP and amino acids, implying that many of the enzymes in cytosol are bound to the cytoskeleton. However, the idea {{that the majority of the}} proteins in cells are tightly bound in a network called the microtrabecular lattice is now seen as unlikely.|$|E
2500|$|The virus invades both {{cancerous}} {{and healthy}} cells, but it cannot replicate in healthy cells because it lacks Infected <b>cell</b> <b>protein</b> 34.5 (ICP34.5). [...] When cells {{are infected with}} a virus they shut down and die, but ICP34.5 blocks this stress response, allowing the virus to hijack the cell's translation machinery to replicate itself. A herpesvirus lacking the gene coding for ICP34.5 cannot replicate in normal cells. However, in many cancer cells the stress response is already disrupted, so a virus lacking ICP34.5 can still replicate in them. [...] After the virus has replicated many times, the cell swells and finally bursts, killing the cell and releasing the copies of the virus, which can then infect nearby cells.|$|E

40|$|A new {{analysis}} for monitoring host <b>cell</b> <b>proteins</b> in preparations of transgenically produced protein pharmaceuticals is described. A capacitive biosensor {{with a very}} high sensitivity is used to monitor trace amounts of host <b>cell</b> <b>proteins.</b> The sensor consists of a gold electrode, the surface of which is well insulated and on which a preparation of a population of polyclonal antibodies raised against the complete protein set-up of the host <b>cell.</b> Host <b>cell</b> <b>proteins</b> are present at very low concentrations during {{the production of a}} transgenic protein. The system studied here is a mode system with an enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Due to the high sensitivity, it may even be possible to dilute the samples to be analyzed, thereby reducing negative influence from non-specific binding to the sensor surface...|$|R
40|$|Melanomas {{demonstrate}} chromosomal instability (CIN). In fact, CIN {{can be used}} {{to differentiate}} melanoma from benign nevi. The exact molecular mechanisms that drive CIN in melanoma have yet to be fully elucidated. Cancer/testis antigens are a unique group of germ <b>cell</b> <b>proteins</b> that are found to be primarily expressed in melanoma as compared to benign nevi. The abnormal expression of these germ <b>cell</b> <b>proteins,</b> normally expected only in the testis and ovaries, in somatic cells may lead to interference with normal cellular pathways. Germ <b>cell</b> <b>proteins</b> that may be particularly critical in CIN are meiosis proteins. Here, we review pathways unique to meiosis with a focus on how the aberrant expression of meiosis proteins in normal mitotic cells “meiomitosis” could impact chromosomal instability in melanoma and other cancers...|$|R
2500|$|S. pyogenes has a {{cell wall}} {{composed}} of branched polymers which sometimes contain M protein, a virulence factor {{that is highly}} antigenic. The antibodies which the immune system generates against the M protein [...] may cross-react with heart muscle <b>cell</b> <b>protein</b> myosin, heart muscle glycogen and smooth muscle cells of arteries, inducing cytokine release and tissue destruction. [...] However, the only proven cross-reaction is with perivascular connective tissue. This inflammation occurs through direct attachment of complement and Fc receptor-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. [...] Characteristic Aschoff bodies, composed of swollen eosinophilic collagen surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages {{can be seen on}} light microscopy. [...] The larger macrophages may become Anitschkow cells or Aschoff giant cells. [...] Rheumatic valvular lesions may also involve a cell-mediated immunity reaction as these lesions predominantly contain T-helper cells and macrophages.|$|E
2500|$|The viral {{particle}} binds to cell surface receptors. Cell surface receptors are characterized for each serotype of picornaviruses. For example, poliovirus receptor is glycoprotein CD155 which is special receptor for human {{and some other}} primate species. For this reason, poliovirus couldn’t be made in many laboratories until transgenic mice having a CD155 receptor on their cell surface were developed in the 1990s. These animals can be infected and used for studies of replication and pathogenesis. Binding causes a conformational change in the viral capsid proteins, and myristic acid are released. These acids form a pore in the cell membrane through which RNA is injected [...] Once inside the cell, the RNA un-coats and the (+) strand RNA genome is replicated through a double-stranded RNA intermediate that is formed using viral RDRP (RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase). Translation by host cell ribosomes is not initiated by a 5' G cap as usual, but rather is initiated by an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site). The viral lifecycle is very rapid with {{the whole process of}} replication being completed on average within 8 hours. However, as little as 30 minutes after initial infection, <b>cell</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis declines to almost zero output – essentially the macromolecular synthesis of cell proteins is shut off. Over the next 1–2 hours there is a loss of margination of chromatin and [...] in the nucleus, before the viral proteins start to be synthesized and a vacuole appears in the cytoplasm close to the nucleus that gradually starts to spread as the time after infection reaches around 3 hours. After this time the cell plasma membrane becomes permeable, at 4–6 hours the virus particles assemble, and can sometimes be seen in the cytoplasm. At around 8 hours the cell is effectively dead and lyses to release the {{viral particle}}s.|$|E

40|$|Blood plasma {{proteins}} are {{an active}} part of the complex integrated system of body proteins. This thesis has been supported by various contributions coming from this laboratory. There is ample evidence that a constant ebb and flow exists between plasma and <b>cell</b> <b>proteins,</b> a dynamic equilibrium. We believe that this protein exchange may {{be at least as}} important in cell nutrition as the commonly accepted passage of amino acids from the digestive tract to the special <b>cell</b> <b>proteins</b> (2, 10, 14, 7). This protein exchange, this ebb and flow between plasma and <b>cell</b> <b>proteins</b> is in large part dependent upon the reserve store of protein within various body cells (e. g., in liver and in muscle cells). But this reservoir of protein material is in no sense an idle pool of protein. It participates in the constant steady state maintained between the plasma proteins {{on the one hand and}} the integral <b>cell</b> <b>proteins</b> on the other. It may be likened to a beaver pond beside a rapid stream, which rises and falls as does the stream and is further modified by drainage from and seepage into the adjacent banks...|$|R

40|$|The protein {{composition}} of the virulent M 129 strain of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was {{compared to that of}} its homologous avirulent strain by the use of standard one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Forty-nine individual M. pneumoniae <b>cell</b> <b>proteins</b> were resolved by this method, and the virulent strain was shown to possess a single high-molecular-weight protein not present in avirulent cells. Variability in the resolution of this particular protein in one-dimensional gels prompted the application of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to the analysis of M. pneumoniae <b>cell</b> <b>proteins.</b> The sequential use of isoelectric focusing in the first dimension and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension permitted the resolution of a least 142 individual M. pneumoniae <b>cell</b> <b>proteins.</b> Application of nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis in the first dimension achieved the resolution of at least 20 additional basic proteins.
