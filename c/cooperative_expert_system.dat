40|$|Abstract Background Cooperatives {{delivering}} out {{of hours}} {{care in the}} Netherlands are hesitant {{about the use of}} <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> during triage. Apart from the extra costs, cooperatives are not sure that quality of triage is sufficiently enhanced by these systems and believe that call duration will be prolonged drastically. No figures about the influence of the use of an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> during triage on call duration and triage decisions in out of hours care in the Netherlands are available. Methods Electronically registered data concerning call duration and triage decisions were collected in two cooperatives. One in Tilburg, a cooperative in a Southern city of the Netherlands using an <b>expert</b> <b>system,</b> and one in Groningen, a cooperative in a Northern city not using an <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> Some other relevant information about the care process was collected additionally. Data about call duration was compared using an independent sample t-test. Data about call decisions was compared using Chi Square. Results The mean call time in the cooperative using the TAS <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> is 4. 6 minutes, in the cooperative not using the <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> 3. 9 minutes. A significant difference of 0. 7 minutes (0. 4 – 1. 0, 95 % CI) minutes. In the <b>cooperative</b> with an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> a larger percentage of patients is handled by the assistant, patients are less often referred to a telephone consultation with the GP and {{are less likely to be}} offered a visit by the GP. A quick interpretation of the impact of the difference in triage decisions, show that these may be large enough to support the hypothesis that longer call duration is compensated for by less contacts with the GP (by telephone or face-to-face). There is no proof, however, that these differences are caused by the use of the triage system. The larger amount of calls handled by the assistant may be partly caused by the fact that the assistants in the <b>cooperative</b> with an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> more often consult the GP during triage. And it is not likely that the larger amount of home visits in Groningen can be attributed to the absence of an <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> only offers advice whether a GP should be seen, not in which way (by consultation in the office or by home visit). Conclusion The differences in call times between a <b>cooperative</b> using an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> and a <b>cooperative</b> not using an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> are small; 0. 4 – 1. 0 min. Differences in triage decisions were found, but it is not proven that these can be contributed to the use of an <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|To be {{considered}} <b>cooperative,</b> an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> must {{be easy to}} interact with. It must produce responses that are contextually appropriate, sensitive {{to the needs of}} users and suited to the user's level of sophistication. <b>Expert</b> <b>system</b> responses must be explained in a clear and concise fashion, often to untrained users. We have constructed a student advising system called ADVISOR, which contains a rule-based <b>expert</b> <b>system,</b> to test our ideas in natural language understanding, user modeling, use-oriented explanation, and text generation. ADVISOR assists computer science majors in course selection by providing information and offering advice during a natural language question-answering dialogue.

40|$|Abstract-Despite {{lip service}} that "most {{knowledge-based}} systems {{are intended to}} be of assistance to human endeavor and are almost never intended to be autonomous agents", knowledge-based systems research has not been focused enough on the nature and the requirements of cooperative problem solving systems. The emphasis of our work is on creating computer systems to facilitate the cooperation between a human and a computer. Cooperation requires more from a system than having a nice user interface or supporting natural language dialogs. One needs a richer theory of problem solving, which analyzes the functions of shared representations, mixed-initiative dialogs, argumentation and management of trouble. Our evolving theoretical framework for this approach {{has led to a}} number of prototypical systems developments which serve as vehicles for future research. Examination of these systems provides evidence that learning and effective problem solving can be improved through the use of cooperative problem solving systems.
