5000|$|Fernet-Branca {{is often}} {{consumed}} neat as a digestif, typically {{served in a}} <b>cordial</b> <b>glass,</b> or as a mixing component (usually supportive and not as the primary ingredient) in cocktails such as the [...] "Toronto", the [...] "Fanciulli", and the more prolific [...] "Hanky Panky".|$|E
40|$|The {{foreground}} is {{pink and}} the sky a darker pinkish red. In the foreground is a green table like form and leading to it is a pink and purple striped pathway leading from a blue platform. A yellow and orange <b>cordial</b> <b>glass</b> appears to be dancing with a purple <b>cordial</b> <b>glass.</b> These forms {{can be seen in}} this artist's three-dimensional works. Here the glasses appear particularly active. Three green <b>cordial</b> <b>glass</b> shapes are placed on the blue platform and one on the striped walkway. Several small geometric shapes float in the upper right portion of the artwork...|$|E
40|$|The collage artwork {{depicts a}} {{foreground}} in pink and {{a background in}} red. Rectangular, square and triangular containers sit at various angles in the foreground. The interiors of the container shapes are in colors differing from the exteriors. A vertical <b>cordial</b> <b>glass</b> sits atop a yellow pedestal. This <b>cordial</b> <b>glass</b> shape {{can be seen in}} this artist's three-dimensional works as well...|$|E
40|$|A two-part {{shape that}} resembles this artist's {{three-dimensional}} <b>cordial</b> <b>glasses</b> stands in an interior {{into the floor}} {{of which is a}} rectangular cut out. Into this recess in the floor falls two small triangular shapes. Two windows are {{on the walls of the}} interior while a square shape is cut out of the ceiling. The artwork is made up of white, purplish grays and black...|$|R
25|$|Glassware {{was also}} {{replenished}} at this time. Mrs. Lincoln ordered 24 plain cut goblets (probably for family dining) in November 1864 and January 1865 from the D.C. firm of Webb & Beveridge. The cost was just $30. On January 30, 1865, she also ordered glassware to replace broken and stolen glassware for public events from John Kerr's China Hall, {{at a cost}} of $612.50. This service included four dozen each of goblets, champagne glasses, claret glasses, burgundy glasses, madeira glasses, sherry glasses, hock <b>glasses,</b> and <b>cordial</b> <b>glasses.</b> The bases appear to have been plain (unlike the 1861 order), except for the madeira glassesâ€”which were more richly carved and featured the rays on the foot. The hock glasses were ruby (not green) in color, and the madeira glasses may also have been red colored. She ordered another four decanters on March 25.|$|R
2500|$|She {{completed}} her purchases by ordering glassware. [...] She purchased the glassware on July 3, 1861, from A. P. Zimaudy of Washington, D.C. [...] This $1,500 set of glassware was richly cut and one side inscribed with the U.S. coat of arms. The glassware was manufactured by Christian Dorflinger, a {{company based in}} Brooklyn, New York, and was much thinner and lighter than the typical White House heavy crystal which had been used since the Andrew Jackson administration. [...] Small flowers were depicted on the sides and backs of the glassware. [...] A decorative border of umbrella-like shapes was etched into the lip, and the base featured a star and fan of spreading rays. The exact content of the glassware order is not clear, but probably included four dozen complete settings (water glass, red wine glass, white wine glass, champagne flute, dessert wine glass, and all-purpose glass) {{as well as some}} serving dishes. White House glassware historian Jane Shadel Spillman believes the glassware collection was probably similar to a [...] "presentation" [...] set given to Japanese diplomats by E.V. Haughwout the year before. This presentation set included goblets, champagne glasses, wine glasses, claret glasses, green-tinted hock <b>glasses,</b> <b>cordial</b> <b>glasses,</b> quart- and pint-size decanters, claret decanters, bowls, side dishes, finger bowls, and saltcellars. The setting also probably included punch bowls, double-handled punch cups, ice cream plates, carafes, sugar bowls, and celery vases. Among the known serving dishes were a relish dish and a compote dish.|$|R
40|$|The {{geometric}} black, {{white and}} gray collage appears to depict a person afloat {{in the middle}} of a body of water. However, a shape like this artist has used before for a <b>cordial</b> <b>glass</b> sits atop a set of three steps in the foreground and receding into the distance are planks ranging from white to black. There are some cutouts in the platform that appear to be traps for the seated figure...|$|E
