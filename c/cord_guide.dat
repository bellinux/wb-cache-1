40|$|The {{measurement}} of pressures in the chambers {{of the right}} side of the heart or pulmonary artery and withdrawal of blood samples for gas analysis pro-vide invaluable information for the study of patients with cardiac or pulmonary disease. If these patients are severely ill, it may be a risky procedure to move them to the catheterization laboratory, and a technique which allows these measurements to be made at the bedside, has been developed, and is described. TECHNIQUE A femoral or cubital vein is entered percutaneously with a Coumand needle (No. 160) and a catheter is inserted by the Seldinger technique (1953). Following insertion of the needle, a nylon cord (diameter 0 7 mm.) is passed into the vein. The needle is thereupon with-drawn and two teflon catheters are successively passed over the nylon <b>cord</b> <b>guide,</b> after enlarging the skin puncture with a small knife blade (Fig. 1). The vein may thus be entered with a catheter of larger diameter than the needle. The nylon cord and the inner teflon catheter are withdrawn after advancing the larger teflon catheter approximately 20 cm. into the vein. A polyethylene catheter (PE 50, outer diameter 1 0 mm. or PE 60 outer diameter 1 - 2 mm.) is then passed through the teflon catheter. The polyethylene catheter is connected to a pressure transducer and is advanced, the position of its tip being confirmed by observation of the pressure pulse on an oscilloscope or recorder. A special adaptor (Fig. 2) is used to flush the teflon catheter to keep its lumen free of blood. An outer catheter of teflon is preferred, because it is easy to pass through the tissues and can be sterilized, for use again, by boiling. The tips of the catheters must be adapted carefully, so that there are no sharp edges which might prevent the catheters passing easily through the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and vessel wall.

40|$|Background: Infraclavicular {{approach}} to the brachial plexus sheath provides anesthesia for surgery on the distal arm, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. It {{has been found that}} evoked distal motor response or radial nerve-type motor response has influenced the success rate of single-injection infraclavicular brachial plexus block. Aim: We conducted this study to compare the extent and effectiveness of infraclavicular brachial plexus block achieved by injecting a local anesthetic drug after finding specific muscle action due to neural stimulator <b>guided</b> posterior <b>cord</b> stimulation and lateral cord/medial cord stimulation. Methods: After ethical committee approval, patients were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the two study groups of 30 patients each. In group 1, posterior cord stimulation was used and in group 2 lateral/medial cord stimulation was used for infraclavicular brachial plexus block. The extent of motor block and effectiveness of sensory block were assessed. Results: All four motor nerves that were selected for the extent of block were blocked in 23 cases (76. 7 %) in group 1 and in 15 cases (50. 0 %) in group 2 (P: 0. 032). The two groups did not differ significantly in the number of cases in which 0, 1, 2, and 3 nerves were blocked (P> 0. 05). In group 1, significantly lesser number of patients had pain on surgical manipulation compared with patients of group 2 (P: 0. 037). Conclusion: Stimulating the posterior <b>cord</b> <b>guided</b> by a nerve stimulator before local anesthetic injection is associated with greater extent of block (in the number of motor nerves blocked) and effectiveness of block (in reporting no pain during the surgery) than stimulation of either the lateral or medial cord...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCommissural interneurons (CI) of the {{vertebrate}} spinal <b>cord</b> are <b>guided</b> ventrally {{toward the}} floor plate, but subsequently cross the midline and select a longitudinal fascicle at specific dorsal–ventral (D–V) positions. We examined at high resolution the detailed behaviors of individual pathfinding CI growth cones on the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the spinal cord of living Xenopus embryos. We find that pre-crossing CI growth cones exhibit distinct pathfinding behaviors compared to post-crossing axons and that the behavioral switch occurs immediately upon crossing to the contralateral side. Groups of pioneer commissural axons typically extend simultaneously toward the ventral midline following discrete paths with separation between adjacent commissurals apparently maintained through contact inhibition. In contrast, shortly after crossing the midline, commissural axons turn longitudinally and begin to fasciculate with other crossed CIs. However, growth cones of crossed commissurals often select their final D–V longitudinal track {{through a series of}} rapid step-like dorsal adjustments that may be due to differential fasciculation with longitudinal axons. Together, our results suggest that guidance of commissural axons is controlled in part through interactions among CIs that switch rapidly from avoidance to fasciculation after midline crossing...|$|R

News-Journal wire services FREMONT, Calif. - Run this computer mouse over {{an image of a}} tennis racket and it gives a series of small twitches, as if hitting the racket's hard plastic <b>cords.</b> <b>Guide</b> the iFeel MouseMan mouse over a picture of an ice cube, and it seems to glide more smoothly across the middle. A novelty for geeks or a milestone in the evolution of computing? Logitech, the world's largest maker of computer mice, is betting this new mouse that &quot;feels &quot; will change the way we interact with PCs. The iFeel MouseMan, for sale this fall, looks like most other mice but contains a motor that relates a sense of texture to the hand guiding it. It's basically a gimmick borrowed from the world of video games. But to Logitech's executives, this is a mouse that roars. They say it activates a part of human intuition now dormant in computing- and that someday nearly every Web page will have something to touch. &quot;If you look at how people use their PCs today, it's visual, &quot; said Wolfgang Hausen, senior {{vice president and general manager}} of Logitech's control devices division. &quot;You look at it. You get sound back from speakers, but that's it. Well, people have other senses. &quot; Logitech's chief executive, Guerrino De Luca, calls the mouse a &quot;seed for a revolution in user interface. &quot; It remains to be seen whether consumers will be so excited. &quot;I'd score it on the weak side [...] . but it's certainly interesting and it does have potential, &quot; said Martin Reynolds, a vice president at Dataquest, a market research firm. The premise is known as force-feedback technology, which is used in military simulators and medical training devices. In video games, it makes the steering wheel shake when a virtual driver crashes or causes the joystick to shudder when a player fires a virtual machine gun. Logitech and its biggest competitor, Microsoft, make many of those video game devices. Logitech, which claims about 60 percent of the market for computer mice, came out last year with another mouse that used force-feedback technology. But that was a clunky model that had to remain on a console. The sleek new mouse uses optical technology, meaning there is no need for a track ball to register its movement. It is expected to list at $ 39 in a standard mouse shape and $ 59 in a contoured shape for right-handers...|$|R
40|$|Nitrate {{levels in}} farm ponds are {{determined}} {{with the aid}} of a water sampler that can be operated from the shore The quality of pond water in southern and western Illinois is being determined {{with the aid of}} a new type of water sampler developed in the Department of Agricultural Engineering. Work on the sampler began as part of a study of water supplies in Washington County. This study, which is being conducted through the College of Agriculture Council on Environmental Quality, was initiated in the winter of 1970, after high nitrate levels were found in the county 2 ̆ 7 s water supplies. Both ponds and wells are being sampled to determine their acceptability as sources of water. For accurate tests of pond water, samples must be obtained at various depths and distances from the shore. A boat, however, is bulky and difficult for one person to handle. The new sampler was therefore devised so that an investigator can sample pond water at any depth without ever leaving the shore. How the sampler is made The sampler consists of a telescoping rod manufactured for window- washing units; a float, a sampler head, and a bottle at one end of the rod (Fig. 1); and a T-handle and two operating reels at the other end (Fig. 2). One reel contains the cord to the float; the other, the cord that operates the sampler head. <b>Cord</b> <b>guides</b> are attached to the rod sections. The sampler head (Fig. 1) is made up of three components: the sampler head base, the bottle plate, and the stopper plate. The sampler head base is attached to the sampling rod and contains the water port through which water enters the sample bottle. An extension to the water port, which extends into the sample bottle, is attached to the sampler head base. In addition, the base contains an air e cape port. The bottle plate is attached to the sampler head base and is fabricated with threads for the sample bottle. The bottle plate may be easily removed from the sampler head base so that other bottle plates fitting different sample bottles may be used with the same sampler head. The stopper plate with stopper is spring-loaded to seal the water port while it is being positioned for sampling and after the sample has been taken. How the sampler works To obtain a sample, the rod is extended to the desired length and the bottle is attached to the sampler head on the pond shore (Fig. 3 a). The bottle and sampler head are floated to the desired position on the pond surface with the float held tightly to the sampler end of the rod (Fig. 3 b). The cord to the float is then released to allow the sampler head and bottle to sink to the desired sampling depth (Fig. 3 c) ...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveReal-time {{information}} about regional spinal <b>cord</b> ischemia can <b>guide</b> intraoperative management {{and reduce the}} risk of paraplegia after thoracic aortic surgery. We hypothesized that near-infrared spectroscopy could provide such information during intercostal and lumbar artery ligation in pigs. MethodsTranscutaneous near-infrared spectroscopic sensors were placed in the midline over the upper and lower thoracic vertebrae of 4 progressively larger pigs (weight range 21 - 70 kg). After the entire aorta was exposed, segmental arteries from T 6 through L 1 were sequentially ligated while regional oxygen saturation was monitored. Decreases in regional oxygen saturation were calculated as percentage changes from baseline. The degrees of ischemia in the upper and lower spinal cord were compared histopathologically. ResultsBaseline regional oxygen saturations were similar in the upper (68. 8 % ± 9. 0 %) and lower (68. 0 % ± 11. 5 %, P =. 82) cord. After ligation, however, regional oxygen saturation levels were significantly lower in the lower cord (41. 3 % ± 10. 1 %) than in the upper cord (64. 8 % ± 9. 3 %, P =. 037). The regional oxygen saturation had decreased by 39. 0 % ± 11. 5 % in the lower cord but only by 6. 3 % ± 7. 6 % in the upper cord (P =. 026). This difference was confirmed microscopically: upper-cord sections had fewer ischemic neurons (8. 8 ± 9. 4) than did lower-cord sections (21. 3 ± 13. 6, P =. 002). ConclusionIntraoperative spinal cord ischemia was detectable with near-infrared spectroscopy in pigs weighing as much as 70 kg. The potential utility of this technique in patients undergoing thoracic aortic surgery warrants investigation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Perioperative {{assessment}} of spinal <b>cord</b> oxygenation might <b>guide</b> measures to prevent neurologic deficits secondary to ischemic or traumatic damage of the spinal cord. Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) partial pressure of oxygen (Po- 2) measurement {{has been used}} to detect spinal cord ischemia (SCI), the diagnostic value and the temporal resolution of CSF Po- 2 measurement compared with functional {{assessment of}} the spinal cord is unknown. This study compared CSF Po- 2 with transcranial motor evoked potentials (tcMEPs) for detection of experimental SCI. Methods: The aorta and segmental arteries were exposed in 10 sufentanil-ketamine-anesthetized pigs (weight, 40 - 50 kg). Myogenic tcMEPs were recorded from the upper and lower limbs, and continuous assessment of CSF Po- 2 was provided by two Clark-type microcatheters inserted in the lumbar and thoracic intrathecal space. Graded lumbar SCI was produced by sequential clamping of segmental arteries. The relation between CSF Po- 2 and tcMEP during graded SCI was determined using linear regression. Diagnostic characteristics of CSF Po- 2 values for clinical SCI were determined using different cutoff points of CSF Po- 2. Results: Lumbar CSF Po- 2 (baseline, 44 [interquartile range, 38 - 54] mmHg) decreased below 50 % in all animals and was linearly related to loss of tcMEP amplitude in all animals. The median lumbar CSF Po- 2 during reduction of tcMEP to less than 25 % of baseline was 11 (4 - 29) mmHg, whereas thoracic CSF Po- 2 remained constant (40 [28 - 50] mmHg). During absence of the tcMEP signal, lumbar CSF Po- 2 was less than 20 mmHg in 80 % of the animals. Optimal sensitivity and predictive values of CSF Po- 2 measurement for SCI were in the range of 40 - 60 % of baseline. Conclusions: The data indicate that intrathecal Po- 2 measurement is a sensitive monitoring technique to track real-time changes in local spinal cord oxygenation. Continuous monitoring of CSF Po- 2 might he applied for evaluation of patients who are at risk for direct or secondary SCI...|$|R
