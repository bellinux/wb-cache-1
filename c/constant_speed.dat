5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E
5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a <b>constant</b> <b>speed.</b> They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{elementary}} {{objects of}} geometry –points, lines, triangles– are traditionally defined in three-dimensional space or on two-dimensional surfaces. In 1907, Hermann Minkowski, Einstein's former mathematics {{professor at the}} Swiss Federal Polytechnic, introduced a geometric formulation of Einstein's special theory of relativity where the geometry included not only space but also time. The basic entity of this new geometry is four-dimensional spacetime. The orbits of moving bodies are curves in spacetime; the orbits of bodies moving at <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> without changing direction correspond to straight lines.|$|E

25|$|Three-phase {{systems have}} the serious {{disadvantage}} of requiring {{at least two}} separate overhead conductors plus rail return. Locomotives operate at one, two or four <b>constant</b> <b>speeds.</b> Most modern locomotives with variable frequency drives can also do regenerative braking on both AC and DC systems and {{are not limited to}} <b>constant</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The early systems used a low {{frequency}} ( [...] Hz), and {{a relatively low}} voltage (3,000 or 3,600 volts) compared with later AC systems. The system provides regenerative braking with the power fed back to the system, so it is particularly suitable for mountain railways provided the supply grid or another locomotive on the line can accept the power. Three-phase systems have the serious disadvantage of requiring at least two separate overhead conductors plus rail return. Locomotives operate at one, two or four <b>constant</b> <b>speeds.</b> Most modern locomotives with variable frequency drives can also do regenerative braking on both AC and DC systems and {{are not limited to}} <b>constant</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Whereas some cruise missiles, such as {{the block}} IV Tomahawk, {{have the ability to}} loiter and have some sensory and remote control features, their primary mission is {{typically}} strike and not target acquisition. Cruise missiles, as their name implies, are optimized for long-range flight at <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> both in terms of propulsion systems and wings or lifting body design. They are often unable to loiter at slow fuel-efficient speeds which significantly reduces potential loiter time even when the missile has some loiter capabilities.|$|E
5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker. Different models have different combinations of speakers, but the most common model, the 122, {{consists of}} a single woofer for bass and a single compression driver and acoustic horn for treble. The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or drum. An electric motor rotates both horn and drum at a <b>constant</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at <b>constant</b> <b>speed.</b> In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E

40|$|Continuously {{variable}} transmissions {{have been}} increasingly {{used in the}} automotive industry to eliminate shift shock and improve vehicle efficiency. This thesis evaluates {{the effectiveness of a}} differential continuously variable transmission (DCVT) used in a different application: wind turbine generators. The Controls Advanced Research Turbine (CART) was modeled utilizing Matlab, Simulink, and SymDyn. First the CART was modeled using its normal fixed ratio transmission. It was then modeled to incorporate a two stage planetary gear train differential, in which the speed of second stage ring gear was controlled to achieve two operating goals: <b>constant</b> generator <b>speed</b> and <b>constant</b> tip <b>speed</b> ratio. The results were then analyzed to determine the DCVT 2 ̆ 7 s effects on power production, and also on the torques and speeds associated with that power, in an attempt to optimize the wind turbine generator system. It was discovered that when the system was controlled to achieve a <b>constant</b> generator <b>speed</b> and <b>constant</b> tip <b>speed</b> ratio there was an increase in power production. Though when the system was controlled to maintain a <b>constant</b> tip <b>speed</b> ratio the amount of power used to control it was approximately twice that of the <b>constant</b> generator <b>speed</b> model, while producing larger torques then either of the other systems. Due the negative aspects associated with the <b>constant</b> tip <b>speed</b> ratio system, and the fact the average power produced of the two controlled systems were approximately equally to each other, the <b>constant</b> generator <b>speed</b> appears to be the more promising of the two...|$|R

5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft {{movement}} as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|If one interprets each 1-cell in Rule 184 as {{containing}} a particle, these particles behave {{in many ways}} similarly to automobiles in a single lane of traffic: they move forward at a <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> if there is open space in front of them, and otherwise they stop. Traffic models such as Rule 184 and its generalizations that discretize both space and time are commonly called particle-hopping models. Although very primitive, the Rule 184 model of traffic flow already predicts some of the familiar emergent features of real traffic: clusters of freely moving cars separated by stretches of open road when traffic is light, and waves of stop-and-go traffic when it is heavy.|$|E

25|$|The {{governor}} {{could not}} actually hold a set speed; the engine would assume a new <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> {{in response to}} load changes. The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring <b>constant</b> <b>speed,</b> such as cotton spinning.|$|E

25|$|In {{the notable}} {{case of a}} force applied to a body always at an angle of 90° from the {{velocity}} vector (as when a body moves in a circle under a central force), no work is done at all, since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero. Thus, no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit (this is ideal, as all orbits are slightly elliptical). Also, no work is done on a body moving circularly at a <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> while constrained by mechanical force, such as moving at <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> in a frictionless ideal centrifuge.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} common methods used for testing {{centrifugal}} compressors is to test along lines of constant shaft speed or along lines of constant throttle. If the shaft speed is held constant, test points are taken along a <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> line by changing throttle positions. In contrast, if a throttle valve is held constant, test points are established by changing speed (common gas turbine practice). The map shown in Figure 5.2 illustrate {{the most common}} method; lines of <b>constant</b> <b>speed.</b> In this case we see data points connected via straight lines at speeds of 50%, 71%, 87%, and 100% RPM.
