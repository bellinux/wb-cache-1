40|$|Introduction Graph {{theory for}} <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> is often studied {{for the fact}} that labeled graphs are suited to express the {{connectivity}} of <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> [4]. However, in the field of chemoinformatics, methods using graph algorithms have not entered the mainstream because graph problems comparing two graphs are often intractable. For example, the problem of finding the maximum common subgraph of two graphs is known to be NP-hard [1], even for two graphs of bounded degree [3]. Therefore, we focus on <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> in biological pathways and analyze the characteristics of the <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> to reduce the problem space to allow for tractable comparisons of graphs. In analyzing these characteristics, we can focus on consistent measures for estimating the similarity of <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds.</b> Such measures are essential for gaining an understanding of the structural aspects of <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds.</b> They also assist in useful tasks such as querying chemical databases.

5|$|The geranium, for example, {{produces}} a unique <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> in its petals {{to defend itself}} from Japanese beetles.

5|$|In 1945, B. B. Cunningham {{obtained}} the first bulk <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> of a transplutonium element, namely americium hydroxide. Over {{the next three}} to four years, milligram quantities of americium and microgram amounts of curium were accumulated that allowed production of isotopes of berkelium (Thomson, 1949) and californium (Thomson, 1950). Sizeable amounts of these elements were produced only in 1958 (Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thomson), and the first californium compound (0.3µg of CfOCl) was obtained only in 1960 by B. B. Cunningham and J. C. Wallmann.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) chloride, {{also called}} ferric chloride, is an {{industrial}} scale commodity <b>chemical</b> <b>compound,</b> with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state.

40|$|Different {{extraction}} methods {{affect the}} yield and <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> of gaharu oil. Hydrodistillation, Soxhlet and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) methods were studied for their extraction yields and percentages of five specific <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds,</b> namely, 3 -phenyl- 2 -butanone, α-guaiene, a-agarofuran, 10 -epi-γ-eudesmol and agarospirol. <b>Chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Results showed that ASE method exhibited the highest oil recovery (2. 12 %) compared with Soxhlet (1. 67 %) and hydrodistillation (0. 18 %). The total {{percentage of the}} five <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> were higher in gaharu oil extracted using ASE (21. 60 %), followed by Soxhlet (9. 51 %) and hydrodistillation (5. 08 %) methods. However, hydrodistillation exhibited fewer <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> (only three of five, i. e. a-agarofuran, 10 -epi-γ-eudesmol and agarospirol) compared with Soxhlet and ASE methods. ASE was the most suitable method to obtain high amount of gaharu oil containing the five <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> with highest total compound percentage.

5|$|Siddiqui's first {{breakthrough}} in research {{came when he}} successfully isolated an antiarrhythmic agent in 1931 from the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina. He named the newly discovered <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> as Ajmaline, after his mentor Hakim Ajmal Khan {{who was one of}} the illustrious practitioners of Unani system of medicine in South Asia. Later on, Siddiqui also extracted other alkaloids from Rauwolfia serpentina that included Ajmalinine, Ajmalicine (C21H24N2O3), Isoajmaline, Neoajmaline, Serpentine and Serpentinine. Many of these are still used worldwide for treatment of mental disorders and cardiovascular ailments, especially as antiarrhythmic agents in Brugada syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores.

Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat.

5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E
5|$|Lignin is {{a complex}} {{polymeric}} <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> that is a major constituent of wood. Resistant to biological decomposition, its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed to light. The species C.bulleri contains three lignin-degrading enzymes: lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase. These enzymes have potential applications {{not only in the}} pulp and paper industry, but also to increase the digestibility and protein content of forage for cattle. Because laccases can break down phenolic compounds they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants, such as dyes used in the textile industry. C.bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by Escherichia coli, making it the first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host. C.pallidus can biodegrade the explosive compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), suggesting it might be used to decontaminate munitions-contaminated soils.|$|E

5|$|Looking Forward is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from James Oliver Curwood's short story of the same name, the film follows a young chemist named Jack Goodwin. He discovers a <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> that puts a person {{into a state of}} sleep for a determined period of time and decides to test it upon himself. The first test is a success and Jack makes arrangements for his sleep of a hundred years, in a state similar to suspended animation. When he awakes in 2010 into a world ruled by women, he woos the female mayor. Jack joins a society to campaign for men's rights. The society ends up before the female mayor who jails all of them, save for Jack who she proposes to. Jack accepts on the condition that men are given back their rights and she accepts. The cast and production credits of the film are not known, but Theodore Marston was not the director. The film was released on December 20, 1910. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The old man kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by {{pricking}} {{him with}} a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he bursts into flames. Police receive a tip that the old man is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses in the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from the picture that the old man is a time traveller who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.|$|E

We present several time complexity results that include: NP-hardness result for a general case, polynomial time algorithm for tree structured compounds with fixed K, and polynomial time algorithm for K= 1 based on graph detachment. Then we review practical algorithms for the pre-image problem, which are based on enumeration of chemical structures satisfying given constraints.
