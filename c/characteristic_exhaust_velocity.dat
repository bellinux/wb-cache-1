50|$|For {{air-breathing}} jet engines, particularly turbofans, {{the actual}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> and the effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> are different by orders of magnitude.

The swirl coax combustion was statistically stable and quiet with and without combustion stability aids. Artificial perturbations to assess dynamic stability generated overpressures from 2 to 15 percent of chamber pressure, and all combustion oscillations were damped within 3 millisec. Chug-free throttle was demonstrated to 65 percent of the nominal operating chamber pressure. Combustion performance in an ablative-lined chamber was calculated with both specific impulse and <b>characteristic</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity,</b> and averaged about 97 percent.

A series of subscale (single element) cold flow and hot fire experiments was employed to establish design criteria for a 3000 -lbf (sea level) engine operating at 500 psia. The subscale experiments characterized both high performance core elements and peripheral elements with enhanced injector/chamber compatibility. The full-scale injector which evolved from the study demonstrated a performance level of 99 percent of the theoretical shifting <b>characteristic</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> with low chamber heat flux levels.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} conducted to investigate the rocket combustion and heat transfer characteristics of liquid oxygen/kerosene (LOX/RP- 1) mixtures at high chamber pressures. Two water-cooled calorimeter chambers of different combustion lengths were tested using 37 - and 61 -element oxidizer-fuel-oxidizer triplet injectors. The tests were conducted at nominal chamber pressures of 4. 1, 8. 3, and 13. 8 MPa abs (600, 1200, and 2000 psia). Heat flux Q/A data were obtained for the entire calorimeter length for oxygen/fuel mixture ratios of 1. 8 to 3. 3. Test data at 4. 1 MPa abs compared favorably with previous test data from another source. Using an injector with a fuel-rich outer zone reduced the throat heat flux by 47 percent with only a 4. 5 percent reduction in the <b>characteristic</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> efficiency C* sub eff.

The injector had the advantage of delivering a homogenous mixture to the combustion chamber, lower soot production, and higher performance potential by removing the fuel atomization process which affects the combustion process and is inherent for non-premixed injectors. The premixed injector was operated at oxygen-fuel ratios from 1. 0 to 1. 8 with a mass flow of 0. 024 kg/sec achieving a chamber pressure of 76 psi without propensity of flashback for 0. 032 [gamma] injector orifices.

50|$|An {{air-breathing}} {{engine is}} thus much more propellant efficient than a rocket engine, because the actual exhaust speed is much lower, the air provides an oxidizer, and air {{is used as}} reaction mass.

All tests were conducted at MSFC. The first four fuels were provided by the U. S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Edwards Air Force Base, CA. The U. S.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{contraction}} ratio and chamber {{pressure on the}} combustion performance of a gaseous-hydrogen-liquid-oxygen combustor was investigated analytically and experimentally. The experiment was conducted with a "two-dimensional" gaseous-hydrogen-liquid-oxygen engine of about 150 -pound thrust. The contraction ratio was varied from 1. 5 to 6 by changing the nozzle throat area. This variation resulted in a chamber pressure variation of about 25 to 120 pounds per square inch. The experimental results were corrected for heat transfer to the engine walls and momentum pressure losses. The experimental performance, as evaluated in terms of <b>characteristic</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity,</b> was 98 percent of theoretical at contraction ratios greater than 3 but decreased very rapidly at smaller contraction ratios. The heat-transfer rate increased with increasing contraction ratio and chamber pressure; it was about 1 Btu per square inch per second at a contraction ratio of 1. 5 and increased to about 3 at a contraction ratio of 6. The combined effects of contraction-ratio and chamber-pressure changes on performance were investigated analytically with a mixing model and a vaporization model. The mixing model predicted very poor mixing at contraction ratios below 3 and almost perfect mixing at higher contraction ratios.

40|$|A {{recently}} completed experimental test program obtained performance data on an optimally contoured nozzle with an exit-to-throat area ratio of 1025 : 1 {{and on a}} truncated version of this nozzle with an area ratio of 440 : 1. The nozzles were tested with gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants at combustion chamber pressures of 12. 4 to 16. 5 mPa (1800 to 2400 psia). Testing was conducted in the altitude test capsule at the NASA Lewis Research Center's Rocket Engine Test Facility (RETF), and results were compared with analytical performance predictions. This testing builds on previous work with this nozzle at Lewis, where testing was completed at nominal chamber pressure of 350 psia. High-area-ratio nozzles have long been sought {{as a means to}} increase the performance of spacebased rocket engines. However, as the area ratio increases, the physical size and weight of the nozzle also increase. As a result, engine and vehicle designers must make tradeoffs between nozzle size and performance enhancement. Until this test program, very little experimental data existed on the performance of the high-area-ratio nozzles used in rocket engine designs. The computer codes being used by rocket engine designers rely on data extrapolated from tests of low-area-ratio nozzles, and these extrapolations do not always provide the accuracy needed for a reliable design assessment. Therefore, we conducted this high-area-ratio nozzle testing program to provide performance data for use in rocket engine design and analysis computer codes. The nozzle had a nominal 2. 54 -cm- (1 -in. -) diameter throat, an exit diameter of 81. 3 -cm (32. 0 -in.) at an exit-to-throat area ratio of 1025, and a length of 128. 6 cm (50. 6 in.). Testing was conducted in an altitude test capsule to simulate the static pressure at altitude by vacuum pumping. Data such as propellant mass flow, oxidizer-to-fuel mixture, and thrust were measured.
