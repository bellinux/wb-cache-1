The paper also aims to examine whether or not the National Health Service (NHS) appears to experience a higher level of negative behaviour than private sector organisations and whether lower frequency behaviour has similar levels of effect as higher frequency behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed‐method approach is used whereby a mainly quantitative questionnaire is complemented by the inclusion of qualitative questions and the collection of qualitative data <b>collected</b> <b>within</b> the <b>two</b> NHS Trusts concerned. Findings - The evidence collected draws attention to the considerable impact that workplace incivility, which may or may not be classed as bullying, has on the well‐being of employees and the effectiveness of organisations. Where aggression is present, the levels of effect are shown to be higher and the behaviour is always classed as bullying. The evidence also shows that the NHS does appear to experience a higher level of negative behaviour than private sector organisations, and that lower frequency behaviour does indeed appear to have similar levels of effect as higher frequency behaviour. Originality/value - This article shows that the focus placed by many researchers and organisations on countering/eliminating behaviour purely perceived as bullying is unlikely to be effective unless they also adopt a similar approach to the full range of negative behaviours that employees experience/witness in organisations...|$|R

40|$|A micro-method {{has been}} devised for {{isolating}} a lung-derived membranous fraction from human amniotic fluid. The phospholipid content of this fraction, known as Ia-mellar body phospholipid, provides {{an indication of}} fetal lung maturity (Ann. Gun. Biochem 16 : 191, 1979). This method has now been applied to 479 samples of amniotic fluid from 330 pregnancies. The lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio has also been determined {{for each of the}} samples by the routine method currently in use in the hospitals pro-viding the samples. Hyaline membrane disease was as-sociated with a low concentration of lamellar body phos-pholipid (< 35 mg/L) in all eight cases encountered in this study.

40|$|Remote sensing has the {{potential}} to provide truly synoptic views of water quality, in particular, the spatial distributions of phytoplankton. Whilst the spectral capabilities of satellites used in ocean colour work have improved significantly over recent years, the application of satellite remote sensing to lake water is constrained by the need for high spatial resolution image data and thus remains limited by spectral resolution capabilities. This becomes a significant problem when attempting to quantify chlorophyll a (Chl a) in waters characterized by high and heterogeneous suspended sediment concentrations (SSC). The SSC dominates the spectral reflectance, masking the spectral influence from other components in broad spectral band systems, making Chl a determination from remote sensing imagery difficult. This paper presents a linear mixture modelling approach to derive accurate estimates of Chl a from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. This approach was tested in Lake Balaton, Europe's largest shallow lake characterized by high suspended sediment and, until recently, frequent eutrophic and hypereutrophic episodes. The last significant bloom occurred in September of 2000 and a Landsat TM image was acquired for 11 th September, during which ground reference data of water quality was collected. The modelled image-derived results of Chl a demonstrate an excellent correspondence (r 2 = 0. 95) between the ground-based measurements of Chl a, and yield considerable detail of lake phytoplankton distributions. The September 2000 calibration was then successfully applied to a July 1994 Landsat TM image and validated with Chl a data <b>collected</b> coincidently <b>within</b> <b>two</b> days of the image. The comparability between water sample data and image results demonstrates that there is temporal stability and robustness in the approach and calibration described...|$|R

There, detachment faulting, continuous over 11 Myr, exhumed large areas of mantle-derived rocks. These exhumed mantle domains occur in the form of a smooth rounded topography with broad ridges locally covered by a thin highly discontinuous volcanic carapace. We present high-resolution data combining deep-tow magnetics, side-scan sonar images and dredged samples <b>collected</b> <b>within</b> <b>two</b> exhumed mantle domains between 62 ° E and 65 ° E.

The analysis of the magnetic properties of the dredged samples and careful comparison between the nature of the seafloor, the deep-tow magnetic anomalies and the seafloor equivalent magnetization suggest that the serpentinized peridotites do not carry a sufficiently stable remanent magnetization to produce seafloor spreading magnetic anomalies in exhumed mantle domains...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of strong potential synergies between the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Habitats Directive (HD) is widely acknowledged. Indeed, ensuring favourable conservation conditions for aquatic habitats and species of conservation concern {{is closely related}} to the achievement of a good ecological status in water bodies. However, since these two sets of European laws are generally applied without any coordination, an inefficient use of resources may adversely affect their goals. The main negative outcome is an increase in the cost of monitoring programs for collecting data in nature (i. e., physical and chemical parameters, species and habitats, plant communities). The use of macrophytes as a bioindicator, as imposed by the WFD, may instead help to integrate data on aquatic EU habitats and enhance knowledge of such habitats outside the Natura 2000 network. The aim of present study was to evaluate the usefulness of data collected in WFD monitoring surveys as a means of inferring the occurrence and the distribution of lacustrine aquatic habitats in countries belonging to the European Union (EU). The main aim of the analysis was to identify the depth gradient distribution of diagnostic macrophyte taxa in two EU habitats (3140, i. e., Chara -dominated benthic communities, and 3150, i. e., natural eutrophic lakes) using data collected in lakes in Lombardy (northern Italy), some of which are included in the Natura 2000 network (10 out 16). While recognizing the limitations of the data <b>collected</b> <b>within</b> the <b>two</b> frameworks, the results confirmed the marked usefulness of WFD data as a means of enhancing the knowledge available on lacustrine aquatic habitats in the EU.

METHODS: In seven MAGNIMS centres we retrospectively identified 182 patients with benign (B) MS (EDSS score ≤ 3. 0, disease duration ≥ 15 years) and 187 patients with non-disabling relapsing-remitting MS (NDRRMS) (Expanded Disability Status Scale score ≤ 3. 0, disease duration between 5 and 14 years), in whom clinical data were <b>collected</b> <b>within</b> <b>two</b> weeks from a brain T 2 -weighted scan. Brain T 2 lesion volume (LV) was measured in all patients. In 146 BMS and 146 NDRRMS patients, clinical data were also available after a median follow up of 29 months (range: 7 - 104 months). RESULTS: Mean LV was higher in BMS than in NDRRMS patients (p< 0. 001), but the mean ratio between LV and disease duration was higher in NDRRMS than in BMS patients (1. 1 vs. 0. 6 ml/year, p< 0. 001).

The level of PCR detection of P. falciparum parasites and the human thalassaemia gene {{was the same as}} samples optimally collected with an anticoagulant. The commercial clot protocol and centrifugation through a sieve failed to fully dissolve the clots and resulted in lower sensitivity of PCR detection. Conclusions High speed shaking was a simple and efficacious method for homogenizing frozen blood clots before DNA purification and resulted in PCR templates of high quality both from humans and malaria parasites. This novel method enables genetic studies from stored blood clots. </p...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundClinical {{significance}} of isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) from respiratory specimens {{in patients with}} pulmonary tuberculosis is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical impact of NTM in pulmonary tuberculosis patients. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data of patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis from 2000 to 2006. Those in whom NTM were isolated from respiratory specimens <b>collected</b> <b>within</b> <b>two</b> months before and nine months after the index culture of tuberculosis was plated were compared with those without NTM. Patients were followed for one year after initiation of anti-tuberculous treatment. ResultsAmong 2133 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, 48 (2. 3 %) with multiple and 106 (5. 0 %) with one isolate(s) of NTM were identified. Another 144 without NTM were selected and compared. The one-year mortality rates were similar among three groups. Patients with multiple NTM isolates {{were more likely to}} be symptomatic, sought medical help earlier, had smear-positive respiratory specimens, and received anti-tuberculous treatment later than those with single/no isolate(s). Cavities were more commonly visualized radiographically in patients with multiple/single NTM isolate(s) than those without NTM isolates. The mean duration of anti-tuberculous treatment was 8. 8 months for patients with multiple NTM isolates, significantly longer than that in patients with single (7. 6 months) and no NTM isolate(s) (7. 5 months). ConclusionsNTM were present in the respiratory tract of 7. 3 % of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Although the outcomes were similar, the presence of NTM was associated with different clinical manifestations and had a significant impact on the treatment of tuberculosis...|$|E
