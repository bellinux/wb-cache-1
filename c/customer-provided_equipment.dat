50|$|With {{the gradual}} {{breakup of the}} Bell monopoly, {{starting}} with Hush-A-Phone v. United States 1956, which allowed some non-Bell owned equipment {{to be connected to}} the network (a process called interconnection), equipment on customers' premises became increasingly owned by customers, not the telco. Indeed, one eventually became able to purchase one's own phone - hence, <b>customer-provided</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{satellite}} modem {{serves as an}} interface between the outdoor unit and <b>customer-provided</b> <b>equipment</b> (i.e. PC, router) and controls satellite transmission and reception. From the sending device (computer, router, etc.) it receives an input bitstream and converts or modulates it into radio waves, reversing that order for incoming transmissions, which is called demodulation. It provides two types of connectivity: ...|$|E

40|$|Spectrum sensing is {{critical}} for cognitive systems to locate spectrum holes. In the IEEE 802. 22 proposal, short quiet periods are arranged inside frames to perform a coarse intra-frame sensing as a pre-alarm for fine inter-frame sensing. However, the limited sample size of the quiet periods may not guarantee a satisfying performance and an additional burden of quiet-period synchronization is required. To improve the sensing performance, we first propose a quiet-active sensing scheme in which inactive <b>customer-provided</b> <b>equipments</b> (CPEs) will sense the channels in both the quiet and active periods. To avoid quiet-period synchronization, we further propose to utilize (optimized) active sensing, in which the quiet periods are replaced by 'quiet samples' in other domains, such as quiet sub-carriers in OFDMA systems. By doing so, we not only save the need for synchronization, but also achieve selection diversity by choosing quiet sub-carriers based on channel conditions. The proposed active sensing scheme is also promising for spectrum sharing applications where both the cognitive and primary systems can be active simultaneously. Â© 2010 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|This section {{provides}} the expected ground and flight environments that a SC may encounter during a Proton launch campaign and flight. 3. 1 THERMAL/HUMIDITY In this section, the thermal and humidity {{environment for the}} SC is defined for transportation from the Yubileiny Airfield through launch base processing, launch and separation. SC component temperatures, {{to be used for}} assessing ground and flight thermal compatibility, will be determined by analysis using a Customer-supplied SC thermal model. 3. 1. 1 SC Ground Thermal and Humidity Environment Ambient temperatures at the Baikonur Cosmodrome are provided in Table 3. 1. 1 - 1. Facility and transportation temperatures and relative humidity are provided in Table 3. 1. 1 - 2. During transport, the SC is air-conditioned either by <b>Customer-provided</b> air conditioning <b>equipment</b> or by a railcar-mounted thermal control unit. While on the pad, thermal control is provided by the Air Thermal Mode Control System (ATMCS) and/or the Liquid Thermal Mode Control System (LTMCS) ...|$|R
