5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, the 42nd Street Shuttle {{will become}} ADA accessible, and the shuttle will be reconfigured from three tracks to two tracks, and the trains will become six cars long. The whole project will cost $235.41 million. The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway would be installed from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, a new control area would be installed {{at the bottom of the}} stairway, and 21 columns would be removed. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> part of the project is $28.93 million. Also included in the Capital Program is funding for a study that would develop the requirements for a second program to automate the shuttle. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> part of the project is $30 million. The project is delayed, and construction will start in May 2018.|$|E

5|$|The Ninth Fort, {{begun in}} 1903, {{was the first}} of its kind in the Empire. The {{structure}} was a trapezoid, encompassing one infantry rampart, and was equipped with two armored watchtowers, electricity, and ventilation. The walls of its cannon casemates were covered with cork to reduce firing noise. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> single fort was 850,000 rubles.|$|E

5|$|A {{gristmill}} {{built at}} the mouth of the creek was one of the first manufacturing buildings on the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of Big Island. In 1864 a large sawmill was constructed on Tangascootack Creek a short distance above the mouth and several years later a shingle mill was built in the area. The sawmill was also expanded and six dams were constructed on the creek. The total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> project was $100,000. Agriculture was another industry that was practiced in the area of the creek in the early 1900s. In 1859 the Sunbury and Erie Railroad went into the creek's valley.|$|E

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, the high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during {{the whole of the}} 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Civil {{war broke}} out in 1642 between the {{followers}} of King Charles I and those of Parliament. Initially, Captain Barnaby Burley, a relative of John, and an ardent Royalist, held the castle {{on behalf of the}} King with a tiny garrison. Burley negotiated surrender terms, including that he initially be allowed to remain in the castle with armed protection, and the castle remained in the control of Parliament {{for the rest of the}} war. Early during the Interregnum it was decided to increase the size of the garrison at the castle from 30 to 70 soldiers, due to concerns about a potential Royalist attack from the island of Jersey. Most of the soldiers lived outside the castle itself. The annual <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> force was around £78 and in 1655 the garrison was made smaller again to reduce costs.|$|E
5|$|However, landing paratroopers, and {{especially}} gliders, without {{the cover of}} darkness left them exceedingly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. The official history of the British Airborne Divisions highlights the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> trade-off, stating that of the 416 gliders that landed, only 88 remained undamaged by enemy fire, and that between 20–30percent of the glider pilots were casualties. Another historian argues that the gliders landing in daylight was a calamity, with the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment having two-thirds of their gliders hit by ground fire and suffering heavy casualties as they landed. The casualty rates were worsened by the slow rates of release and descent of the gliders themselves, {{and the fact that}} each aircraft towed two gliders, slowing them even further; as the time to release a glider unit was 3–4 times longer than a parachute unit, the gliders were vulnerable to flak.|$|E

5|$|In June 2008, {{based on}} Birkenfeld's revelations, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation made a formal request to enter Switzerland to probe a multimillion-dollar tax evasion case {{involving}} UBS. That same month, the United States Senate panel that Birkenfeld had communicated with accused Swiss banks, including UBS, of helping wealthy Americans evade taxes through offshore accounts, and estimated the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> practice {{to be in}} excess of US$100billion annually. According to the findings, U.S. clients held about 19,000 accounts at UBS, with an estimated US$18billion to US$20billion in assets, in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The {{delay of}} the Soviet advance allowed over 25,000 Estonians and 3,700 Swedes {{to flee to}} neutral Sweden and 6,000 Estonians to Finland. Thousands of {{refugees}} died on boats and ships sunk in the Baltic Sea. In September, 90,000 soldiers and 85,000 Estonian, Finnish and German refugees and Soviet prisoners of war were evacuated to Germany. The sole German <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> evacuation was {{the loss of a}} steamboat. More German naval evacuations followed from Estonian ports, where up to 1,200 people were drowned in Soviet attacks.|$|E
5|$|In 1513, King James IV led an {{invasion}} of northern England {{in support of the}} French and the Auld Alliance. On 9 September, the Scots met the English at the Battle of Flodden, and were heavily defeated, with King James killed on the field. An English invasion was widely expected, and in Edinburgh it was resolved to build a new town wall. However, the new wall was also an opportunity to control smuggling into the burgh, and the town council accordingly decided to extend the wall south to take in the Grassmarket and Cowgate areas of the burgh. Construction began the following year, but was not completed until 1560. Work started at the western end, and the final section was the stretch from Leith Wynd to the Nor Loch, incorporating the New Port. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> last work was £4/10s Scots per rood (one rood = six ells or 5.6metres) for the wall, plus 40s per rood for the battlements.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, the Bureau of Ships {{prepared}} two {{feasibility studies}} to explore whether Alaska and Guam could be suitably converted into guided-missile cruisers. The first study involved removing {{all of the}} guns in favor of four different missile systems. At $160million, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> proposed removal was seen as prohibitive, so a second study was initiated. The study left the forward batteries (the two 12-inch triple turrets {{and three of the}} 5-inch dual turrets) unchanged, and added a reduced version of the first plan on the stern of the ship. Even though the proposals would have cost approximately half as much as the first study's plan ($82million), it was still seen as too expensive. As a result, both ships were stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960. Alaska was sold for scrap on 30 June 1960, and Guam on 24 May 1961.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1914 Rowell and {{his classmates}} were {{commissioned}} as first lieutenants in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). At the time, Rowell's class {{had not yet}} completed its military training. The AIF's commander, Major General William Throsby Bridges, decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he allotted the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the AIF, rather than as staff officers. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> decision was high; of the 134 commissioned in time to serve at the front, 42 were killed and 38 wounded. Cadets were posted to units being formed in their home states, so Rowell was posted to the 10th Infantry Battalion. When he discovered that the 3rd Light Horse Regiment was {{to be commanded by}} his cousin, Lieutenant Colonel F. M. Rowell, Sydney obtained permission to swap places with another member of his Duntroon class Lieutenant Eric Wilkes Talbot Smith. It was a fateful decision; Smith was fatally wounded on Anzac Day.|$|E
5|$|Sections of {{the track}} were removed and relaid at other {{athletics}} venues, and the internal ground level was lowered {{to make way for}} an additional tier of seating, on terracing already constructed then buried for the original configuration. The three temporary stands with a total capacity of 16,000 were dismantled, and replaced with a permanent structure of similar design to the existing one at the southern end. This work took nearly a year to complete and added 23,000 permanent seats, increasing the capacity of the converted stadium by 7,000 to approximately 48,000. Manchester City F.C. moved to the ground in time {{for the start of the}} 2003–04 season. The total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> conversion was in excess of £40 million, with the track, pitch and seating conversion being funded by the city council at a cost of £22million; and the installation of bars, restaurants and corporate entertainment areas throughout the stadium being funded by the football club at a cost of £20million. The Games had made a small operating surplus, and Sport England agreed that this could be reinvested in converting the athletics warm-up track adjacent to the main stadium into the 6,000 seat Manchester Regional Arena at a cost of £3.5 million.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Commission's {{proposals}} were extensively debated. Hendrick van Kol, {{who was one}} of the leaders of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, argued that building up a strong fleet would hinder Dutch neutrality by making it impossible to avoid battle with foreign fleets which passed through NEI waters en route to other destinations. Other critics of the plan believed that it would be unwise for the Netherlands to join the naval arms race which was taking place in Europe at the time, and that competition between the major powers meant that none of them would allow another nation to occupy either the Netherlands or the NEI. The Dutch Army also opposed the development of a strong fleet in the NEI, arguing that a land force centered on Java would be better able to mount a prolonged resistance against a large invasion force and that reducing the size of the Army to fund the fleet would leave it unable to suppress insurrections. The Governor-General of the NEI, Alexander Willem Frederik Idenburg, argued that both a stronger Army and Navy were necessary, and advocated for seven battleships to be stationed in the Indies. He believed that the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> alternative could be managed by reducing the planned battleship force in European waters to three small ships. Other supporters of the proposal, led by the Onze Vloot ("Our Fleet") naval advocacy association, argued that it was necessary to build a strong fleet which was capable of defending the NEI as the loss of the colonial empire would greatly damage the Dutch economy and reduce the country's prestige. The Dutch Naval staff also debated the relative merits of torpedo boats and battleships, and concluded that while small craft and submarines were suitable for defending the Netherlands, large warships were needed to effectively protect the sprawling East Indies.|$|E
