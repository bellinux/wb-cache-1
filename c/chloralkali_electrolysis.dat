40|$|The {{results of}} a {{fundamental}} mass transport model based on the Maxwell}Stefan approach are compared to experimental data obtained by Akzo-Nobel for a Dupont Na"on ion-selective membrane as used in <b>chloralkali</b> <b>electrolysis</b> processes. The main problem {{in the application of}} the Maxwell Stefan based mass transfer model to the <b>chloralkali</b> <b>electrolysis</b> process is a lack of available di!usivities for the membrane. Estimation of these di!usivities in the membrane based on a method presented by Wesselingh et al. (1995. Chem. Engng J., 57, 75 } 89) gave unrealistic high membrane potential drops. Therefore, another method was followed. First, a sensitivity analysis was carried out which resulted in a reduced set consisting of the dominating Maxwell}Stefan di!usivities. First estimates of these remaining di!usivities were determined for single layer sulfonic and a carboxylic membranes. With a slight adjustment of the values of the di!usivities obtained for the separate sulfonic and carboxylic layers, the performance parameters of the DuPont Na"on membrane could be predicted well for a reference experiment. These di!usivities also proved to be suitable for other anolyte strengths. However, for other catholyte strengths and current densities these di!usivities (even after a correction for the water uptake according to the method of Wesselingh et al. (1995. Chem. Engng. 5., 57, 75 } 89)) did not result in a good agreement between the simulated and experimentally observed performance parameters. Only after a correction of the di!usivities the simulations yielded approximately the same performance parameters as experimentally observed. From this it can be concluded that although a fundamental model is used in order to describe the mass transfer in a membrane, a single set of di!usivities is not su$cient in orde...|$|E
40|$|Supergravity {{fields with}} high gravity {{acceleration}} can promote interphase ship velocity and convection velocity. Over the past decade, {{research has been}} devoted to enhancing electrochemical reactions by using supergravity fields. The enhancement of electrochemical reactions is ascribed to the acceleration of mass transfer and bubble separation. In this Minireview, the intensification kinetics of a supergravity field on mass transfer and bubble separation during electrochemical reactions are analyzed theoretically. The progress in terms the enhancement of electrochemical reactions (such as metal electrodeposition, water electrolysis, and <b>chloralkali</b> <b>electrolysis)</b> under a supergravity field is reviewed. The structures and properties of functional films electrodeposited under a supergravity field on both the cathode and the anode are summarized. The Minireview is helpful to understand the effect of the mechanism of the supergravity field on electrochemical reactions and to expand potential applications...|$|E
25|$|There are {{indirect}} {{and rarely}} used means of using copper ions in solution to form copper(II) chloride. Electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride with copper electrodes produces (among other things) a blue-green foam {{that can be}} collected and converted to the hydrate. While this is not usually done due to the emission of toxic chlorine gas, and the prevalence of the more general <b>chloralkali</b> process, the <b>electrolysis</b> will convert the copper metal to copper ions in solution forming the compound. Indeed, any solution of copper ions can be mixed with hydrochloric acid and made into copper chloride by removing any other ions.|$|R
30|$|The {{production}} of chlorine by <b>chloralkali</b> <b>electrolysis</b> using graphite electrodes, {{which started in}} the 1890 s, has generated large amounts of PCDD/Fs in waste sludge [9, 133, 138, 139]. Since the 1970 s’ graphite electrodes have largely been superseded by metal electrodes, PCDD/F releases have greatly been reduced [9]. The detailed assessment of a chloralkali plant operating since 1890 s in Rheinfelden/Germany revealed an inventory of 8.7  kg TEQ in landfills and soils [133]. The historic deposits have been partly remobilized and distributed during city development over nearly a century, resulting in the need for detailed mapping of PCDD/F pollution in the entire city [133]. Studies of eggs in the 1990 s showed the highest levels ever reported (up to 514  pg I-TEQ/g fat) [140]. The eggs were 200 -fold above the current EU maximum level of 2.5  pg PCDD/F-TEQ/g fat. Eggs produced 2.5  km from a chloralkali and pesticide production site had PCDD/F levels 16 times above EU regulatory limits [30].|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} which describes the mass transfer in ion-selective membranes {{as used in}} the <b>chloralkali</b> <b>electrolysis</b> process. The mass transfer model {{is based on the}} Maxwell–Stefan theory, in which the membrane charged groups are considered as one of the components in the aqueous mixture. The Maxwell–Stefan equations are re-written {{in such a way that}} the current density can be used as an input parameter in the model, which circumvents an extensive numerical iterative process in the numerical solution of the equations. Because the Maxwell–Stefan theory is in fact a force balance, and the clamping force needed to keep the membrane charged groups in its place is not taken into account, the model is basically over-dimensioned: the mole fraction of the membrane can be calculated by using the equivalent weight (EW) of the membrane or by using the equations of continuity. In this work, the latter method has been chosen. The results of the computer model were verified in several ways, which show that the computer model gives reliable results. Several exploratory simulations have been carried out for a sulfonic layer membrane and the conditions as encountered in the <b>chloralkali</b> <b>electrolysis</b> process. As there are no (reliable) Maxwell–Stefan diffusivities available for a Nafion membrane, in this trend study the diffusivities were all chosen equal at a more or less arbitrary value of 1. 10 − 10 m 2 s− 1. Due to this, the absolute values of several performance parameters are incorrect as compared with industrial chloralkali operation (e. g. an unrealistically high current efficiency of 95. 7 % was found), but the model can still be used to obtain trends. For example, it is shown that the thickness of the membrane hardly increases the current efficiency (CE), however, the required potential drop proportionally increases with thickness. The pH rapidly increases to values greater than 12 just inside the membrane at the anolyte side. Moreover, for different values of the pH in the anolyte, the pH profiles inside the membrane nearly coincide with each other. A change in the anolyte strength does not have a significant effect on the performance of the membrane. At low values of the current density, a high value of the current efficiency is found. However, this is not due to a low OH− counter flux, but to the simultaneous transport of OH− and Cl− towards the catholyte. ...|$|E
40|$|A mercury-resistant {{bacterial}} strain which {{is able to}} reduce ionic mercury to metallic mercury was used to remediate in laboratory columns mercury-containing wastewater produced during electrolytic production of chlorine. Factory effluents from several chloralkali plants in Europe were analyzed, and these effluents contained total mercury concentrations between 1. 6 and 7. 6 mg/liter and high chloride concentrations (up to 25 g/liter) and had pH values which were either acidic (pH 2. 4) or alkaline (pH 13. 0). A mercury-resistant {{bacterial strain}}, Pseudomonas putida Spi 3, was isolated from polluted river sediments. Biofilms of P. putida Spi 3 were grown on porous carrier material in laboratory column bioreactors. The bioreactors were continuously fed with sterile synthetic model wastewater or nonsterile, neutralized, aerated chloralkali wastewater. We found that sodium chloride concentrations up to 24 g/liter did not inhibit microbial mercury retention and that mercury concentrations up to 7 mg/liter could be treated with the bacterial biofilm with no loss of activity. When wastewater samples from three different chloralkali plants in Europe were used, levels of mercury retention efficiency between 90 and 98 % were obtained. Thus, microbial mercury removal is a potential biological treatment for <b>chloralkali</b> <b>electrolysis</b> wastewater. Industrial use of mercury, a highly toxic metal, has led to significant mercury pollution of the environment (4, 16) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of mercury-reducing communities in two bioreactors retaining Hg(II) from <b>chloralkali</b> <b>electrolysis</b> wastewater for 485 days was analyzed based on effluent community DNA. Packed bed bioreactors with lava chips as carrier of the biofilm were inoculated with nine Hg(II) -resistant isolates {{that belonged to}} the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the proteobacteria. A rapid DNA-fingerprinting method was applied, using the intergenic spacer region (ISR) of the 16 S- 23 S rDNA for analysis of the community composition. This allowed discrimination of the inoculum strains down to subspecies level. A merA specific PCR permitted the discrimination of the com-munity’s merA genes. During the 485 days of operation, the bioreactors were exposed to various physical stresses (mixing, gas bubbles, temperature increase up to 41 °C, increased flow velocity) and repeated high mercury inflow concentrations, resulting in reduced bioreactor performance and decreased culturable cell numbers in the reactor effluent. Nevertheless, the {{composition of}} the microbial community remained rather stable throughout the investigated time period. Of the inoculum strains, two could be detected throughout, whereas three were sometimes present with varying periods of nondetection. Two inoculum strains were only detected within the first month. Two strains of gamma-proteobacteria that were able to reduce ionic mercury invaded the bioreacto...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Mercury is an {{extremely}} toxic pollutant that is currently being emitted mainly by low level industrial sources. It is distributed globally through the atmosphere, from where it precipitates {{onto the surface of}} the Earth, enters aquatic organisms, accumulates in fish and finally affects the health of human populations. Microbes have evolved a mechanism for mercury detoxification [mercu-ry resistance operon (mer) ] based on intracellular reduc-tion of Hg 2 + to non-toxic Hg 0 by the mercuric reductase enzyme and subsequent diffusional loss of Hg 0 from the cell. It was shown that Hg 0 produced by microbial detoxification can be retained quantitatively in packed bed bioreactors, in which biofilms of mercury-resistant bacteria are grown on porous carrier material. This review describes operation of this system on a technical, fully automated, scale, and its operation at a <b>chloralkali</b> <b>electrolysis</b> factory. It was shown to work with high efficiency under fluctuating mercury concentrations and to be robust against transiently toxic conditions. The gradient of mercury concentration in the technical scale system exerted a strong selective pressure on the micro-bial community, which resulted in a succession of mercury-resistant strains at high mercury concentrations and an increase in phylogenetic and functional diversity at low mercury concentrations. Clean-up of mercury-con-taining wastewater by mercury-resistant microbes is a simple, environmentally friendly and cost-effective alter-native to current treatment technologies...|$|E
40|$|Istraživanja podrijetla i raspodjele postojanih organoklorovih (OC) spojeva u okolišu u nas uključuju organoklorove (OC) pesticide, poliklorirane bifenile (PCB), poliklorirane dibenzop- dioksine (PCDD) i poliklorirane dibenzofurane (PCDF). Njihove razine ispituju se u površinskim, podzemnim i pitkim vodama, moru, riječnim i morskim sedimentima, tlu, zraku, oborinama te iglicama crnogoričnog drveća. U vodama su u proteklih dvadesetak godina najčešće detektirani pesticidi bili p,p’-DDT i njegovi metaboliti, gama-heksaklorcikloheksan (gama-HCH) i heksaklorbenzen. Najviše razine PCB-a izmjerene su u vodama krškog područja. Malobrojni podaci o OC spojevima u tlu/sedimentima upućuju na povišene razine PCB-a u tlu uz oštećene trafostanice i unutar zračnih luka. Razine PCDD-a i PCDF-a oko 50 puta više od onih tipičnih za seoska i urbana područja izmjerene su u tlu neposredno uz postrojenje kloralkalne elektrolize. OC pesticidi i PCB-i detektirani su u oborinama i zraku na području Zagreba te u iglicama crnogoričnog drveća na različitim lokacijama. Uočen je skorašnji unos gama-HCH i p,p’-DDT-ja u atmosferu. Najviše razine PCDD/PCDF-a u zraku na području Zagreba izmjerene su u industrijskom dijelu grada. Studies {{of origin}} and {{distribution}} of persistent environmental organochlorine (OC) pollutants in Croatia have comprised three groups of compounds: OC pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and more recently polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF). The use of OC pesticides in Croatia is restricted, and hexachlorobenzene is even forbidden. PCBs {{may be used in}} closed systems only. The main source of PCDD/PCDF in the environment is combustion, but these also occur as byproducts in certain pesticide and other chemical formulations. Common to all those compounds are high hydrophobicity, poor solubility in water, and low volatility. They are rapidly and strongly sorbed by most soils and are often associated with bottom sediments in aquatic systems. Circulation of air masses, precipitation of particles onto which pollutants are sorbed, and wet depositions washing them out from the atmosphere may transport OC pollutants over long distances. The levels of persistent OC micropollutants in Croatia were investigated in surface, ground, and drinking water, sea water, river and marine sediments, soil, air, wet depositions, and coniferous tree needles. Most data collected for the last 20 years concern regular or periodical determination of OC pesticides in water. The most often detected compounds were p,p’-DDT and its metabolites, -hexachlorocyclohexane (-HCH), and hexachlorobenzene. Recent measurements show that the concentrations of OC pesticides in different waters keep within the range of ecotoxicologically acceptable and legally prescribed values. The highest PCB levels (> 100 ng/dm 3) were measured in source and surface waters in karst areas where elimination of water pollutants by natural filtration through soil layers was almost negligible. The data on persistent OC compounds in soil and sediments are rare although, due to sorption and bioconcentration tendency, OC compounds are more likely to show higher levels in these media than in water. The most frequently detected OC pesticides in soils/sediments were the DDT-type compounds and -HCH. In most analysed soils and sediments PCB mass fractions were characteristic for global environmental pollution. Higher PCB levels were determined in soils collected in the close vicinity of transformer stations, in the airport areas, and close to some industrial plants. PCDD/PCDF levels in the airport soil kept within the range typical for urban and rural areas, whereas they rose by about 50 times in soils collected near a <b>chloralkali</b> <b>electrolysis</b> plant. Traces of OC pesticides and PCB were detected in wet depositions collected in urban and rural areas. The rain and snow samples collected in Zagreb contained traces of PCDD/PCDF and the highest concentrations at pg/dm 3 level were measured for octa-CDD. The only data on OC pesticide, PCB and PCDD/PCDF levels in the ambient air were reported for air samples collected in 1997 and 1998 in the Zagreb city area. The highest pesticide concentrations were measured for -HCH. The highest PCDD/PCDF level was determined in the industrial zone of the city. The level of environmental pollution in a certain location can be evaluated through measurement of OC compounds in coniferous tree needles. All needle samples collected in the 1991 – 1998 period in different regions of Croatia contained OC pesticides and PCB. The mass fraction ratio _-HCH/_-HCH< 1 found by the analysis of needle, air, and rain samples confirmed recent release of lindane in the environment as a consequence of its frequent local usage...|$|E
