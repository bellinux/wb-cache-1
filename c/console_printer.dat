5000|$|On the IBM 1620 {{there are}} four switches, and their state can be tested via special forms of the IF-statement offered by the FORTRAN {{compiler}} for the IBM 1620. For the IBM 1130 there are sixteen switches matching the sixteen-bit word size of the computer, plus a toggle switch adjacent to the power on/off switch. These bit-switches are more normally used with the computer stopped to specify some memory address to be viewed (via the indicator lights on the front panel), or set. The state of these switches can be determined by a program, and so a running program might modify its behavior depending on the switches, such as change the amount of progress information printed, alter the tactics of a multi-variable optimization attempt, and so on. The IBM 1130 also has an [...] "Interrupt Request" [...] key associated with the <b>console</b> <b>printer,</b> whose pressing might cause a suitably programmed long-running program to type a progress report on the <b>console</b> <b>printer.</b> In the more usual batch job environment, it was pressed by the computer operator to signal the operating system to terminate a running program that had perhaps overrun its allowed time, or commenced misbehavior such as repeatedly printing blank lines.|$|E

5000|$|The IBM 2741 came in two {{different}} varieties, one using [...] "correspondence coding" [...] and the other using [...] "PTT/BCD coding." [...] These refer to the positioning of the characters around the typeball and, therefore, the tilt/rotate codes {{that have to be}} applied to the mechanism to produce a given character. A [...] "correspondence coding" [...] machine can use type elements from a standard office Selectric (i.e. elements used for [...] "office correspondence"). [...] "PTT/BCD coding" [...] machines need special elements, and did not have as wide a variety of fonts available. The IBM 1050 and its derivatives were only available in PTT/BCD coding. The two element types are physically interchangeable, but code-incompatible, so a type element from, say, a System/360 <b>console</b> <b>printer</b> (a variety of IBM 1050) produces gibberish on a [...] "correspondence coding" [...] 2741 or an office Selectric, and vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|NorthStar BASIC was a dialect of the {{programming}} language BASIC originally provided {{for use on}} the NorthStar Horizon and NorthStar Advantage. The interpreter was written using only Intel 8080 instructions {{so that it could}} run also on custom systems. [...] One notable difference with other dialects of BASIC of the time was the array-like way in which strings were addressed. For example, A$(13,17) in NorthStar BASIC corresponded to MID$(A$,13,5) in other dialects. This string addressingtechnique is analogous to the one used in Fortran, and was also used in HP-3000 Basic and Atari BASIC. Strings were allocated 10 bytes maximum length unless DIMensioned otherwise. It was still possible to use arrays of strings, but these were declared in two or more dimensions, for example DIM B$(10,50) created 11 strings (0-10) of maximum length 50 bytes. Input from the keyboard and output to the <b>console</b> and <b>printers</b> were treated {{in the same way as}} reading and writing to data files. Some other differences were that POKE became FILL, PEEK became EXAM, and INSTR became MATCH.|$|R
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} holds {{a pool of}} ink and controls the amount of ink that enters the inking system. The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade and the {{ink fountain}} roller can be controlled by adjusting screw keys to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the ink fountain roller turns to obtain the desired quantity of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the adjusting screws are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press <b>console.</b> Thus the <b>printer</b> can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the ink fountain roller.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} is quoted from UT78:Calma's computer-aided design and drafting systems (also {{referred to as}} interactive graphics systems) are [...] component hardware modules, electronic interfaces, and software programs. Most of the systems sold are constructed by combining available components {{to meet the requirements}} of the customers' specific design or drafting application. Calma's systems enable customers to automate a wide variety of design and manufacturing processes which have previously been performed manually.The primary hardware components of a system are a central processing unit, operator stations and plotter outputs.Their GDS I and II software operated on Data General Corporation's Nova and Eclipse line of 16 bit mini Computers. Sketches or layouts of electronic system were first manually drawn on mylar or paper to scale and were placed on large backlit 48 by 60 inch table digitizers. Using a moving stylus, these layouts were organized in layers, first placing the smaller common and custom circuits, created in a library, then manually traced their interconnecting circuitry on further layers, the completed layout then stored in computer files. Printed Circuit Boards (PCB's) and Small Scale Integrated Circuits (SSIC) were manually traced buy an operator, usually a draftsman or electronic engineer then plotted on a large pen plotter (In later years to faster Electrostatic Plotters) to be visually inspected to confirm that the physical layout properly matched the schematic. Once the layout and schematics final edits were manually checked to confirm their accuracy, the multiple layers of the physical circuitry were sent to a film plotter to create masks for fabrication.The central processing unit consists of a minicomputer, a computer <b>console</b> and page <b>printer,</b> a magnetic tape transport and a magnetic disk memory unit.Other optional peripheral devices such as card readers and paper tape punches are also available. These components are interfaced with Calma-designed and manufactured controllers, and integrated into a single unit with system software designed and programmed by Calma.An operator station consists of a digitizing device, an interactive cathode ray tube (CRT) display unit, coordinate readouts and a keyboard. The main difference between stations is in the type of digitizing input station used. The Calma digitizer is a backlit 48 by 60 inch table. To digitize analog graphical data directly on computer-compatible medium, the operator of the digitizer manually traces graphical data with a moveable stylus. The graphic tablet has a smaller surface and is operated with an electromechanical graphic pen and were used primary to edit an electronic layout once it was digitized.The digitizing input station is linked by system software to the CRT display, which allows an almost instantaneous display of any segment of the source drawing or a graphic element from the library. The CRT display also has windowing and magnification capability.An alphanumeric keyboard is used for entering text, scaling information, dimensions and commands, and an optional functional keyboard is available for entering frequently used functions, symbols and macro commands.The output most commonly used in Calma's systems is a graphic plotter. Calma software supports both on and off-line pen and photo plotting devices.Calma's computer-aided design systems are used {{in a wide variety of}} applications. To date systems have been sold principally to electronics firms for use in the design of integrated circuits, printed circuit boards and electrical schematics; to governmental agencies and public utilities for use in cartographic applications; and to manufacturing companies for use in the design of mechanical parts and systems.|$|R
