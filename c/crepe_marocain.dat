The shrinkage of the cloth 	which attended on dipping was simultaneously measured， and which {{proved to be a}} good 	measure of the penetration of the resin solution into the interstices of the fiber. The 	samples were then cured at 130 ℃ for 10 minutes after intervened drying. 	The samples were then tested by running crease tester under 500 g and 2000 g loads， 	and the resin contents and the mode of distribution was studied. 	The optimum temperature of "Pre-heating" was found to be 120 ℃， and the time of 	heating 1. 5 minutes， folIowed by the dipping for 10 minutes in order to assure a good 	result. 	The dipping duration of an ordinary padding or mangling， usually within 60 seconds 	at best， was obviously suspected to be too short for such fabrics from the shrinkage 	curves obtained; and it was actually found that even 2 minutes' dipping was insufficient， 	causing the resin to deposit {{on the surface of the}} fibers and/or yarns， and accordingly 	giving an exceedingly poor crease recovery for the heavier load， a 1 though it showed a 	pretty high crease resistance for the lighter load. 	The sample properly treated showed a higher crease recovery for both lighter and 	heavier loads， with higher fixed resin contents and lower surface resin. 	<b>Crepe</b> <b>marocain</b> treated by the same principle under a series of most favourable conditions 	produced a highly improved fabric， having such an outstanding properties as being 	dimentionally stable with a slightest shrinkabitity on wetting，which，however，was 100 % 	reversible on drying; being somewhat more elastic and lofty， and having an agreeable 	hand with a higher crease recovery as well as an increased strength for tear and wear. 	The present study throws light upon the theory and practice of resin-treatments of 	fabrics in general， although some modifications may be necessary in the actual application 	to various kinds of fabrics in question...|$|E
