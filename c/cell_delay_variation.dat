The monitor can be used remotely returning information on ATM traffic flows to a central site. The monitor is interfaces to a GPS timing receiver, which provides an absolute time accuracy of better than 1 µsec. By monitoring the same traffic flow at different points in a network it is possible to measure <b>cell</b> <b>delay</b> and <b>delay</b> <b>variation</b> in real time, and with existing traffic. The monitoring system characterises cells by a CRC calculated over the cell payload, thus special measurement cells are not required. Delays in both local area and wide-area networks have been measured using this system. It is possible to measure delay in a network that is not end-to-end ATM, as long as some cells remain identical at the entry and exit points.

In this work, a method for the accurate measurement of <b>cell</b> <b>delay</b> <b>variation</b> using OAM cells, which does not rely on synchronised clocks at the measurement points is presented. This is achieved by assuming that each ATM switch has the capability to process and to modify the information contained in the OAM cells.

Even an initially deterministic input stream of cells will be perturbed by cross traffic, producing <b>cell</b> <b>delay</b> <b>variation</b> that varies across the network. In this paper we particularly focus on the dimensioning of playout buffers, and investigate how earlier work of van den Berg and Resing [5] and of D’Ambrosio and Melen (11 can be combined with classical bounds for the GI /G / l queue to give insight into the output buffer required if a smooth playout of cells is to be achieved. We investigate the effect of both the number of stages across the network {{and the rate of}} the stream. A possibly surprising conclusion is that as the rate of the stream decreases the required output buffer size may actually increase.

The performance of such scheduling mechanisms critically relies on the regularity properties of the template. An important application, which motivated our study, arises {{in the context of}} weighted round-robin cell scheduling algorithms used for (de) multiplexing the various traffic streams in high-speed switches. In that setting, regularity of the template significantly reduces <b>cell</b> <b>delay</b> and <b>delay</b> <b>variation</b> (jitter), and equally important, the burstiness of the outgoing stream. We propose a measure for quantifying the regularity in terms of the spacing of the slots assigned to the various classes. The proposed criterion is consistent with common regularity notions, while the structural form allows for the computation of an optimal template using a quadratic assignment formulation. We also establish the asymptotic optimality of simple and fast heuristic algorithms in a scenario with a large number of traffic classes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the heuristic procedures yield excellent results, even if the regime of asymptotic optimality does not strictly apply...|$|R

This allows distinguishing the effects of process <b>variations</b> on the <b>cell</b> <b>delay</b> from defectinduced <b>cell</b> <b>delays</b> under process <b>variations.</b> To provide a suitable interface for test algorithms at higher levels of abstraction, the distributions are represented as histograms and stored in a histogram data base (HDB).

40|$|Recently, {{the concept}} of Voice and Telephony Over ATM (VTOA) has been widely studied. Although ATM {{benefits}} voice communications in many aspects, its packet-switched nature impairs the speech quality. In this paper, we evaluate the speech quality {{with a focus on}} the impact of <b>Cell</b> <b>Delay</b> <b>Variation</b> (CDV). We build an experimental system to do the evaluations. We also define a new parameter, named <b>Cell</b> <b>Delay</b> <b>Variation</b> Accumulation Length (CDVAL), to measure the impact of CDV on speech quality. Ne observe that the speech quality mainly depends on the value of CDVAL, but does not strongly depend on the other items, including the distribution of cell end-to-end delay, the position and even the number of the intermittence caused by CDV. We find that there exists an acceptable threshold of CDVAL. According to our experiments, to keep the speech in "good" quality (MOS congruent to 3. 5), the CDVAL value must be less than 3 ms without any speech cell loss; such a threshold drops to 2 ms if 5 % speech cells are lost. The results indicate that buffer is necessary for doing CDV compensation at the far end devices in VTOA.

40|$|Photolithography {{has been}} a key enabler of the {{aggressive}} IC technology scaling implicit in Moore's Law. As minimum feature sizes approach the physical limits of lithography and the manufacturing process, resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) dictate certain tradeoffs with various aspects of process and performance. This in turn has led to unpredictable design, unpredictable manufacturing, and low yield. As a result, close communication between designer and manufacturer has become essential to overcome the uncertainties of design and manufacturing. The design for manufacturability (DFM) paradigm has emerged recently to improve communications at the design-manufacturing interface and to reduce manufacturing variability. DFM {{is a set of}} technologies and methodologies that both help the designer extract maximum value from silicon process technology and solve "unsolvable" manufacturing challenges. Traditional DFM techniques, which include design rule check (DRC) and optical proximity correction (OPC), have been successfully used until now. However, as the extent and complexity of lithography variations increase, traditional techniques are no longer adequate to accommodate the various lithography demands. This thesis focuses on ways to mitigate the impact of lithography variations on design by establishing new interfaces between design and manufacturing. The motivations for doing so are improved printability, timing and leakage as well as reduced design cost. To improve printability, we propose a detailed placement perturbation technique for improved depth of focus and process window. Using a dynamic programming (DP) -based method for the perturbation, the technique facilitates insertion of scattering bars and etch dummy features, reducing inter-cell forbidden pitches almost completely. We also propose a novel auxiliary pattern-enabled cell-based OPC which can improve the edge placement error over cell-based OPC. The technique improves runtime which has grown unacceptably in model- based OPC, while retaining its runtime advantage as well as timing and leakage optimization. The detailed placement framework is also available to allow opportunistic insertion of auxiliary pattern around cell instances in the design layout. Aberration leads to linewidth variation which is fundamental to achieve timing performance and manufacturing yield. We describe an aberration-aware timing analysis flow that accounts for aberration-induced <b>cell</b> <b>delay</b> <b>variations.</b> We then propose an aberration-aware timing-driven global placement technique which utilizes the predictable slow and fast regions created on the chip due to aberration to improve cycle time. The use of the technique along with field blading achieves significant cycle time improvement. DoseMapper technique adopted in advanced lithography equipments has been used to reduce the across-chip linewidth variation. We propose a novel method to enhance timing yield as well as reduce leakage power by combined dose map and placement optimizations. The new dose map is not determined to have the same critical dimension (CD) in all transistor gates, but optimized to have different linewidths. That is, for devices on setup timing-critical paths, a smaller than nominal CD will be desirable, since this creates a faster- switching transistor. On the other hand, for devices on hold timing-critical paths, a larger than nominal gate CD will be desirable since this creates a less leaky transistor. Last, the golden verification signoff tool using simulation-based approach represents a runtime- quality tradeoff that is high in quality, but also high in runtime. We are motivated to develop a low-runtime pre- filter that reduces the amount of layout area to be analyzed by the golden tool, without compromising the overall quality finding hotspots. We demonstrate a dual graph-based hotspot filtering technique that enables fast and accurate estimatio...|$|R
