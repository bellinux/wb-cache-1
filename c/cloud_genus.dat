25|$|When the {{precipitation}} {{reaches the}} ground without completely evaporating, it is {{designated as the}} feature praecipitatio. This normally occurs with altostratus opacus, which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation, and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development. Of the latter, upward-growing cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers, while downward growing nimbostratus is capable of heavier, more extensive precipitation. Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, {{has the capacity to}} produce very heavy showers. Low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation, but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this <b>cloud</b> <b>genus</b> lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga.|$|E

50|$|To {{alleviate}} this confusion, scientists Richard S. Scorer and Corfidi {{propose a}} cloud classification {{based only on}} physical criteria obtained from vertical soundings and observations from meteorological satellites to reclassify the castellanus as a <b>cloud</b> <b>genus</b> {{at the same level}} as a cumulus or a cirrus. Corfidi has long criticised the resistance from official bodies to this change. However, the 2016 version of the International Cloud Atlas will not change the status of the castellanus. The same scientists have a similar opinion about lenticular clouds that can exist at different levels that are not recognised as a full <b>cloud</b> <b>genus</b> but only as a species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cloud</b> rats (<b>genus</b> Phloeomys) are {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} murid rodents by their densely furred tails. Phloeomys pallidus is {{distinguished from}} its relative Phloeomys cumingi by its slender tail (P. cumingi have bushy tails). P. pallidus has long, dense pelage that is highly variable in color and pattern. The pelage is usually white with a black mask and collar, but can also be entirely white.|$|R
50|$|The largest free-convective <b>clouds</b> {{comprise}} the <b>genus</b> cumulonimbus which are multi-level {{because of their}} towering vertical extent. They occur in highly unstable air and often have complex structures that include cirriform tops and multiple accessory clouds.|$|R
50|$|Further terms can {{be added}} to {{describe}} the origin of the cloud. Homogenitus is a suffix that signifies that a cloud originates from human activity. For instance Cumulus originated by human activity is called Cumulus homogenitus and abbreviated as CUa. If a homogenitus <b>cloud</b> of one <b>genus</b> changes to another genus type, it is termed a homomutatus cloud.|$|R
50|$|It is a cloud species {{attached}} to the cloud genera cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus and stratocumulus. Species of the clouds include cirrus castellanus, cirrocumulus castellanus, altocumulus castellanus and stratocumulus castellanus. Sometimes cumulus castellanus are referred to, but the type is not recognised by the France's national meteorological service Météo-France, or by the American Meteorological Society and World Meteorological Organisation. Those clouds some would classify as cumulus castellanus typically {{do not have a}} common base and are not arranged in a line, thus differing to some extent from the more universally-recognised castellanus types. Some scientists also think that the castellanus should be a full <b>cloud</b> <b>genus,</b> and not just a cloud species. The Federal Aviation Administration implicitly considers a castellanus as a full <b>cloud</b> <b>genus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Altostratus is {{a middle}} {{altitude}} <b>cloud</b> <b>genus</b> {{belonging to the}} stratiform physical category characterized by a generally uniform gray to bluish-green and sheet or layer. It is lighter in color than nimbostratus and darker than high cirrostratus. The sun can be seen through thin altostratus, but thicker layers can be quite opaque.|$|E
50|$|Another vital {{property}} is the icing characteristic of various <b>cloud</b> <b>genus</b> types at various altitudes, which can have {{great impact on}} the safety of flying. The methodologies used to determine these characteristics include using CloudSat data for the analysis and retrieval of icing conditions, the location of clouds using cloud geometric and reflectivity data, the identification of cloud types using cloud classification data, and finding vertical temperature distribution along the CloudSat track (GFS).|$|E
5000|$|Moreover, the International Cloud Atlas (ICA) is {{not entirely}} precise {{regarding}} how to determine the genus of a convective cloud. Per the ICA (1975, p. 15-16), {{the base of a}} cumulus cloud is usually between the surface and 2 km. This height limit originates from observations in temperate climates where the surface temperature and humidity are about average. It {{does not take into account}} how the cloud is formed. In the American West, the base of cumulus clouds can reach 4000 m, since the combination of a low dew point (10 C) and high temperature (up to 45 C) will yield a very high convective condensation level. While the ICA allows that a cumulus cloud can have a base higher than 2 km (by saying that cumulus clouds usually have their bases at or below this height), guidance given on page 16 of the ICA could lead to misclassification of a high cumulus cloud. This guidance says that a <b>cloud's</b> <b>genus</b> can be determined [...] "by making a choice from among the genera normally encountered in the etage (height range) corresponding to its height." [...] This could lead the observer to rule out cumulus as a possible <b>genus</b> for a <b>cloud</b> that has all the ICA-described characteristics of a cumulus except that its base is above the [...] "Low" [...] etage (surface to 2 km). The observer, conscientiously trying to comply with ICA classification guidance, might then misclassify this cloud as an altocumulus (perhaps altocumulus floccus), although the instability creating it is at a different level compared to an altocumulus.|$|R
500|$|Interstellar cirrus {{clouds are}} {{composed}} of tiny dust grains smaller than a micrometer and are therefore not true <b>clouds</b> of this <b>genus</b> which {{are composed of}} ice crystals or other frozen liquids. They range from a few light years to dozens of light years across. While they are not technically cirrus clouds, the dust clouds {{are referred to as}} [...] "cirrus" [...] because of their similarity to the clouds on Earth. They also emit infrared radiation, similar to the way cirrus clouds on Earth reflect heat being radiated out into space.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{framework}} to compute geodesics on implicit surfaces and point clouds. Our framework {{consists of three}} parts, particle based approximate geodesics on implicit surfaces, Cartesian grid based approximate geodesics on point clouds, and geodesic correction. The first two parts can effectively generate approximate geodesics on implicit surfaces and point clouds, respectively. By introducing the geodesic curvature flow, the third part produces smooth and accurate geodesic solutions. Differing {{from most of the}} existing methods, our algorithms can converge to a given tolerance. The presented computational framework is suitable for arbitrary implicit hypersurfaces or point <b>clouds</b> with high <b>genus</b> or high curvature...|$|R
50|$|Nearly all {{atmospheric}} water vapor or moisture {{is found in}} the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather-associated <b>cloud</b> <b>genus</b> types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into {{the lower part of the}} stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.|$|E
50|$|These {{forms are}} cross-classified by {{altitude}} range or level into ten genus types {{which can be}} subdivided into species and lesser types. High-level clouds form at altitudes of 5 to 12 kilometers. All cirriform clouds are classified as high-level and therefore constitute a single <b>cloud</b> <b>genus</b> cirrus. Stratiform and stratocumuliform clouds in {{the high level of}} the troposphere have the prefix cirro- added to their names yielding the genera cirrostratus and cirrocumulus. Similar clouds found in the middle level (altitude range 2 to 7 kilometers) carry the prefix alto- resulting in the genus names altostratus and altocumulus.|$|E
5000|$|Altocumulus (From Latin Altus, [...] "high", cumulus, [...] "heaped") is a middle-altitude <b>cloud</b> <b>genus</b> {{that belongs}} {{mainly to the}} stratocumuliform {{physical}} category characterized by globular masses or rolls in layers or patches, the individual elements being larger and darker than those of cirrocumulus and smaller than those of stratocumulus. [...] However, if the layers become tufted in appearance due to increased airmass instability, then the altocumulus clouds become more purely cumuliform in structure. Like other cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, altocumulus signifies convection. A sheet of partially conjoined altocumulus perlucidus is sometimes found preceding a weakening warm front, where the altostratus is starting to fragment, resulting in patches of altocumulus perlucidus between the areas of altostratus. Altocumulus is also commonly found between the warm and cold fronts in a depression, although this is often hidden by lower clouds.|$|E
500|$|Cumulus <b>clouds</b> are a <b>genus</b> of free-convective low-étage cloud {{along with}} the related limited-convective {{cumuliform}} or stratocumuliform cloud stratocumulus. These clouds form from ground level to [...] at all latitudes. Stratus clouds are also low-étage. In the middle étage are the alto clouds, which consist of the limiited-convective cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud altocumulus and the stratiform cloud altostratus. Middle-étage clouds form from [...] to [...] in polar areas, [...] in temperate areas, and [...] in tropical areas. The high-étage clouds are all cirriform, one of which, cirrocumulus, is also cumuliform of limited convection or stratocumuliform. The other clouds in this étage are cirrus and cirrostratus. High-étage clouds form [...] in high latitudes, [...] in temperate latitudes, and [...] in low, tropical latitudes. Cumulonimbus clouds, like cumulus congestus, extend vertically rather than remaining confined to one étage.|$|R

50|$|In Central America, Adelomyrmex occur {{primarily}} in mature wet forest habitats, in rotten wood and leaf litter {{on the forest}} floor. They are far more abundant in montane cloud forest than in lowland rainforest. In some cloud forest habitats they can occur in nearly 100% of miniWinkler samples (1 m2 samples of sifted litter) and dozens of individuals may occur in samples. In lowland rainforest they are rare, occurring in fewer than 10% of miniWinklers, and usually as one or two individuals per sample. Highland species are typically larger as well. Thus in some cloud forests Adelomyrmex make up {{a large proportion of}} the ant biomass (often sharing that role with another dominant <b>cloud</b> forest myrmicine <b>genus,</b> Stenamma). In contrast, in lowland habitats they are very rare and a minute proportion of the biomass. In South America they are always rare, whether in lowlands or cloud forest.|$|R

40|$|As a {{first step}} for remote sensing cloud properties, a data base of cloud genera has been established.

2500|$|The genitus and mutatus {{categories}} {{have been}} {{expanded to include}} certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds. The term flammagenitus (Latin for 'fire-made') applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions. Smaller low-level [...] "pyrocumulus" [...] or [...] "fumulus" [...] clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus homogenitus (Latin for 'man-made'). Contrails formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling any of the high cloud genus-types and are now officially designated as cirrus, cirrostratus, or cirrocumulus homogenitus. If a homogenitus <b>cloud</b> of one <b>genus</b> changes to another genus type, it is then termed a homomutatus cloud. Stratus cataractagenitus (Latin for 'cataract-made') are generated by the spray from waterfalls.
