50|$|Nova Dies British Virgin Islands (BVI) International Business Company (IBC) {{functions}} as a business shell covering a consortium of international trusts and other asset managers investing in natural resources and mining industry. Its shares are controlled through a <b>complex</b> <b>trust</b> scheme and its management is nominally performed not by a Board of Directors but by a Management Company, subsidiary of Nova Dies itself. However, it is speculated that Nova Dies scheme mostly covers investments of Colombian, Dutch, Greek and Congolese interests. Founded in 2010, its official seat exists in the offshore haven of the Island of Tortola in British Virgin Islands, but its business core is located in Piraeus Greece. There, Nova Dies retains a Customs and Transportation Management Representative Office, as most of Nova Dies non-financial operations concern imports of coltan and other minerals through the sea route Dar es Salaam (Tanzania)-Port of Piraeus. In Piraeus, the mineral shipments are unloaded and distributed throughout Eastern Europe by a network of trans-Balkan land routes coordinated from Piraeus. Nova Dies also operates a secondary Cargo Management Office in the Port of Rotterdam Free Zone (Netherlands), a Financial Management Office in Nicosia (Cyprus) and an Investment Management Office in Madeira International Off-Shore Business Centre (Portugal).A key characteristic of Nova Dies is that it employs no operational or managerial staff. It is rather managed by a network of independent agents, lawyers, trustees and representatives. This network further intermediates between the company and numerous independent contractors hired for executing the actual corporate operations. Furthermore, Nova Dies does not retain any assets itself, as it only {{functions as}} a management company performing investments on behalf of its clients, exercising the ownership and management rights of other corporate and trust schemes on their own corporate and financial assets and administrating networks of third affiliated companies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract An {{increasing}} number of systems rely on programming language technology to ensure safety and security of low-level code. Unfortunately, these systems typically rely on a <b>complex,</b> <b>trusted</b> garbage collector. Region-based type systems provide an alternative to garbage collection by making memory management explicit but verifiably safe. However, {{it has not been}} clear how to use regions in low-level, type-safe code. We present a compiler intermediate language, called the Capability Calculus, that supports region-based memory management, enjoys a provably safe type system, and is straightforward to compile to a typed assembly language. Source languages may be compiled to our language using known region inference algorithms. Furthermore, region lifetimes need not be lexically scoped in our language, yet the language may be checked for safety without complex analyses. Finally, our soundness proof is relatively simple, employing only standard techniques...|$|R
40|$|Trust network {{analysis}} with subjective logic (TNA-SL) simplifies <b>complex</b> <b>trust</b> graphs into series-parallel graphs {{by removing the}} most uncertain paths to obtain a canonical graph. This simplification could in theory cause loss of information and thereby lead to sub-optimal results. This paper describes a new method for trust {{network analysis}} which is considered optimal {{because it does not}} require trust graph simplification, but instead uses edge splitting to obtain a canonical graph. The new method is compared with TNA-SL, and our simulation shows that both methods produce equal results. This indicates that TNA-SL in fact also represents an optimal method for trust network analysis and that the trust graph simplification does not affect the result. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Globally unique domain {{names and}} IP {{addresses}} that {{are provided in}} real time by the DNS (Domain Name System) represent the fundamental sign-posts for navigating the Internet and for locating remote hosts. It is therefore paradoxical that the traditional method for secure identification of remote hosts is not directly based on DNS, but on the browser PKI which is external to the trust structure of the DNS and thereby introduces new and <b>complex</b> <b>trust</b> prob-lems. This paper argues that certificates for global host names must be issued through DNSSEC. According to this principle, certificates for domain names are issued by DNS registrars or DNS server organisations. This greatly simplifies the trust models for online authentication and significantly improve Internet security. ...|$|E

Especially for business integration scenarios, Federated Identity Management emerged as a possibility to propagate identity information as security assertions across company borders {{in order to secure}} the interaction between different services. Although this approach guarantees scalability regarding the integration of identity-based services, it exposes a service provider to new security risks. These security risks result from the <b>complex</b> <b>trust</b> relationships within a federation.

Consequently, the service provider has to rely on authentication results received from...|$|E

40|$|The Web {{has become}} one of the primary ways people {{interact}} with their computers, connecting people with a diverse landscape of content, services, and applications. Users can find new and interesting content on the Web easily, but this presents a security challenge: malicious Web-site operators can attack users through their Web browsers. Browsers face the challenge of keeping their users safe while providing a rich platform for Web applications. Browsers are an appealing target for attackers because they have a large and <b>complex</b> <b>trusted</b> computing base with a wide network-visible interface. Historically, every browser at some point has contained a bug that let a malicious Web-site operator circumvent the browser’s security policy and compromise the user’s computer. Even after these vulnerabilities are patched, many users continue to run older, vulnerable versions. 5 When these users visit malicious Web sites, they run the risk of having their computers compromised. Generally speaking, the danger posed to users comes from three factors, and browser vendors can help keep their users safe by addressing each of these factors: • The severity of vulnerabilities. By sandboxing their rendering engine, browsers can reduce the severity of vulnerabilities. Sandboxes limit the damage that can be caused by an attacker wh...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{authentication}} {{of users}} in distributed systems poses special problems because users lack the ability to encrypt and decrypt. The same problems arise when users wish to delegate some of their authority to nodes, after mutual authentication. In most systems today, the user is forced to trust the node he wants to use. In a more satisfactory design, the user carries a smart-card with sufficient computing power to assist him; the card provides encryption and decryption capabilities for authentication and delegation. Authentication is relatively straightforward with a powerful enough smart-card. However, for practical reasons, protocols that place few demands on smart-cards should be considered. These protocols are subtle, as they rely on fairly <b>complex</b> <b>trust</b> relations between the principals in the system (users, hosts, services). In this paper, we discuss a range of public-key smart-card protocols, and analyze their assumptions and the guarantees they offer...|$|E

Clients ’ lack of direct resource {{control in the}} cloud prompts concern {{about the potential for}} data privacy violations, particularly abuse or leakage of sensitive information by service providers. Cryptography is an oft-touted remedy. Among its most powerful primitives is fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), dubbed by some the field’s “Holy Grail, ” and recently realized as a fully functional construct with seeming promise for cloud privacy. We argue that cryptography alone can’t enforce the privacy demanded by common cloud computing services, even with such powerful tools as FHE. We formally define a hierarchy of natural classes of private cloud applications, and show that no cryptographic protocol can implement those classes where data is shared among clients. We posit that users of cloud services will also need to rely on other forms of privacy enforcement, such as tamperproof hardware, distributed computing, and <b>complex</b> <b>trust</b> ecosystems. ...|$|E
