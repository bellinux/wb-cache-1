60|$|Dearest Sis,--You {{received}} a letter written last thing on Wednesday, 18th. We started next day with perfectly fine mild weather and every sort of comfort, and got to our first night's stage, Poggio Bagnoli, with great ease; with the same advantages next day, we passed Arezzo and reached Camuscia, and on Saturday slept at Perugia, having found the journey delightful. Sunday was rainy, but just as mild, so Ba did not suffer at all; we slept at Spoleto. Rain again on Monday. We reached Terni {{early in the day}} in order to go to the Falls, but the thing was impossible for Ba. Eckley, his mother-in-law, and I went, however, getting drenched, but they were fine, the rain and melted snow having increased the waters extraordinarily. On Tuesday we had fine weather again to Cività Castellana; there we found that on the previous day, while we were staying at Terni, a carriage was stopped and robbed in the road we otherwise should have pursued. They said such a thing had not happened for years. On Wednesday afternoon, four o'clock, we reached Rome, with beautiful weather; so it had been for some four out of our seven days. Ba bore the journey irregularly well; of course she has thus had a week of open air, beside the change, which always benefits her. We always had the windows of the carriage open. We passed Wednesday night at an hotel in order to profit by any information friends might be able to furnish, but we ended by returning to the rooms here we occupied before, of which we knew the virtues--a blaze of sun on the front rooms--and absolute healthiness. Rents are enormous; we pay only ten dollars a month more than before, in consideration of the desire the old landlady had to get us again. To anybody else the price would have been 20 more--60 in all--for which we are to pay 40. The Eckleys took good rooms and pay 1,000 (£210 or 15) for six months! One can't do that. The best is that they have thoroughly cleaned and painted the place, and everything is very satisfactorily arranged. We take the apartment for four months, meaning to be at liberty to go to Naples if we like. We have no fire this morning while I write, but it is before breakfast and Ba may like the sight of one, tho' I rather think she will not. Rome looks very well, and I hope we shall have a happier time of it than before. Many friends are here and everybody is very kind. The Eckleys were extravagantly good to us, something beyond conception almost. We have seen Miss Cushman, Hatty,[60] Leighton, Cartwright, the Storys, Page and his new (third) wife, Gibson, beside the Brackens and Mrs. Mackenzie; and there are others I shall see to-day. Ferdinando was sent on by sea with the luggage, and met us at the gate. It has been an expensive business altogether, but I think we shall not regret it. I daresay you have mild weather at Paris also. These premature beginnings of <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> down and leave {{the rest of the year}} the warmer, if not the better for them. Dearest Sis, write and tell me all the news of your two selves. Do you hear anything about Reuben's leaving London? Anything of Lady Elgin? How is Madame Milsand? I will send you the last 'Ath.' I have received, but break off here rather abruptly, in order to let Ba write. Good-bye. God bless you both. Kindest love to Milsand.|$|E
40|$|Tomato {{processing}} {{includes a}} break step, which involves rapid heating of freshly chopped toma-toes to> 90 ˚C for hot break, or 60 ˚C to 77 ˚C for <b>cold</b> <b>break.</b> Pectolytic enzyme deactivation is be-lieved {{to be the}} key element in the hot break step; therefore, pectin content of different products should be qualitatively distinct. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of hot break versus <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> on the cell-wall pectin of tomato. Cell-wall pectin from hot and <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> tomato products was isolated and analyzed for carbohydrate composition, degree of polymeriza-tion, and degree of esterification. The results showed no observable differences in the cell-wall pectin isolated from the two products, indicating that there was no significant pectolytic break-down of the tomato in the <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> product, and the pectin might not, by itself, contribute to the differences in the final product viscosity resulting from the two processing techniques...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the effect of a}} temperature break on the quality and conservation of stored fruit, Hass avocados were harvested at 2 stages of ripeness (10 - 12 % and 13 - 15 % oil) weighed, refrigerated at 7 ± 1 ºC and 90 - 95 % of relative humidity, for 20, 25 and 30 days. On day 15, part of the fruit was subjected to a temperature break, for 24 hours, 50 % at 15 °C (59 °F) and the other half at 25 °C (77 °F), and another group for 48 hours at 15 and 25 °C, respectively, keeping a control with no temperature break. At the end of every storage period, the following was determined: weight loss, pulp resistance to pressure (PRP), epidermis color, physiological disorders and pathological damages. Subsequently, the fruit was left to soften at ambient temperature up to 1. 81 kg of PRP, with the same variables being evaluated again. <b>Cold</b> <b>breaks</b> at 15 °C (59 °F) for 2 days maximum, do not provoke a reduction in the post-harvest life and final quality of the fruit, until 30 days of storage, in both ripeness stages. <b>Cold</b> <b>breaks</b> at 25 °C (77 °F) for 2 days cause an early softening, a decrease of chroma and brightness with absence of pathogens and physiological disorders. <b>Cold</b> <b>breaks</b> at 25 °C for 1 or 2 days cause a greater weight loss than the other treatments, evaluated during the 3 refrigeration periods...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} not only a likely {{prospect}} for the end of this century, but it is already occurring. Part of the changes will include global warming and increasing temperature variability, both at global and regional scales. This increased variability was investigated in this paper {{from the point of view}} of the occurrence of cold spells in the Alps in the future climate (2071 – 2100), compared with the present climate (1961 – 1990). For this purpose, a regionalisation of the climate change effects was performed within the Alps. To avoid possible errors in the estimate of the 2 m air temperature, the analysis was performed on the soil surface temperature. To get realistic values for this variable, a land surface scheme, UTOPIA, has been run on the selected domain, using the output of the Regional Climate Model (RegCM 3) simulations as the driving force. The results show that, in general, the number of <b>cold</b> <b>breaks</b> is decreasing over the Alps, due to the temperature increment. However, there are certain zones where the behaviour is more complicated. The analysis of the model output also allowed a relationship to be found between the number of <b>cold</b> <b>breaks</b> and their duration. The significance of these results over the whole area was assessed...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the role of pectin in protecting casein from coagulation by heat and acid during the preparation of tomato soup. Three varieties of tomatoes were used for the study, Ace, Improved Garden State and Campbell 146, and each variety was processed two ways, by heating the tomatoes rapidly to 100 °C before juicing (hot break) and by holding the mascerated tomatoes for 30 minutes before heating (<b>cold</b> <b>break).</b> Juice of the Ace variety had the highest pH and Campbell 146 the lowest by both processing methods. In all cases, <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> juice had lower pH values than did the hot break juice. Proportion of serum to solids resulting from centrifugation of a sample of each juice was used as one index to the amount of degradation of the pectin. The amount of solids in the <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> juice was less than the amount of solids in the hot break juice. Serums from juices prepared by the hot break method were more viscous than those by the <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> method. Of the hot break juices, Improved Garden State was the most viscous and Campbell 146 the least. The concentration of pectin in the serums of juices prepared by the <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> method was from one-third to one-half that in serums of juices by the hot break method. Juices of the three varieties of tomatoes by both methods of processing were combined with reconstituted non-fat milk and heated as for tomato soup. Curdling was assessed by measuring the nitrogen in the filtrate by the micro-Kjeldahl method. Juices of Ace, the low acid variety, caused the least amount of curdling. Of the four juices from the two more acid varieties, Campbell 146 by the <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> method had the lowest concentration of pectin in the serum and the soup curdled most, while Improved Garden State by the hot break method was highest in pectin and resulted in the least curdling of the soup. Juice from Campbell 146 by the <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> method was the most acid of the four and that of Improved Garden State by the hot break method was the least acid. When an amount of high-methoxy pectin equal to the difference between the concentration of pectin in the <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> and that in the hot break juices of the Improved Garden State variety was added to a sample of the juice before making soup, curdling was less than when untreated juice was used, and the pH was slightly higher. Thus any protective effect that pectin might have had. on the casein was clouded by differences in the pH values of the juices. Pectin possibly has a role in protecting the casein, but the acidity certainly is the determining factor in the coagulation of casein in the preparation of tomato soup...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY How multifragmentation {{happens in}} heavy ion {{collisions}} {{is still a}} matter of debate. Explanations reach from nucleation over self organization, spinodal decomposition to <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> [...] up and survival of initial correlations. For an overview see ref. [1]. A key question is the time scale of the reaction. Slow processes like nucleation or self organization are hindered if {{the expansion of the}} whole system is too fast. Another issue is the relaxation time for thermal and chemical equilibrium which is important when statistical models are used to explain multifragmentation [2, 3, 4, 5]. If one considers the decay of excited spectator matter which has not been compressed, the expansion preceding the fragmentation might be slow enough to allow for global equilibration. However, below excitations energies of about 6 MeV per nucleon an equilibrated nucleus will most likely cool down by evaporating nucleons but not by breaking into many intermediate mass fragment...|$|E
40|$|Tendrils {{may be said}} {{to possess}} a sense of touch, and the {{direction}} and amplitude of the coiling response can be used to define the characteristics of this sense. These characteristics are, first, that the tendril will coil only in response to ventral mechanical stimulation, that this coiling can be inhibited by subsequent dorsally presented stimulation, and that dorsal stimulation alone causes no coiling. This phenomenon seems to be due to some asymmetry in the response system. Second, the nature of the response is always determined by the location (i. e., dorsal or ventral) of the last stimulation the tendril experienced. Third, the ability of dorsally presented stimulation to reverse ventrally stimulated coiling is gradually lost. Complete escape from reversibility is attained if the interval between ventral and dorsal stimulation reaches 9 minutes. Fourth, the magnitude of response is determined by both the number and the frequency of the stimuli. Both ventrally stimulated coiling and dorsally stimulated inhibition of coiling can be temporarily stopped by a 9 -minute <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> at 10 C, given immediately after stimulation. As soon as the tendrils are restored to room temperature, they proceed to respond to the stimulus...|$|E

40|$|The pectic enzyme, Pectinmethylesterase (PE) and Polygalacturonase I and II (PGI and PGII), in {{the tomato}} fruit {{released}} after crushing during tomato processing reduce the viscosity of tomato paste by {{breaking down the}} insoluble pectin in the cell wall. To achieve higher viscosity tomato paste, the <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> (60 - 95 °C) processes {{can be used to}} inactivate the pectic enzyme and to achieve higher viscosity tomato paste. The study of tomato solids and PG enzyme activity showed that the levels of insoluble solids, total solids, pectin, and °Brix in Ferry Morse tomatoes were independent of fruit ripeness. The amount of PG enzymes was high in orange and dark red tomatoes and the activity of PG enzymes increased as a function of ripeness, from green to dark red. In the dark red tomato, the inactivation of PG enzyme activity was required to retain the level of pectin. <b>Cold</b> <b>break</b> temperatures below 60 °C can not inactivate the PG enzyme activity. The PG enzymes started to be denatured when the hot break temperature was above 65 °C and be completely destroyed when the break temperature was above 80 °C. A mathematical model of the break process was formulated and Matlab programme was used to predict the effect of break temperatures on the pectin and PG enzyme concentration of the tomato pulp in the break tank for any inputs of feed rate (the flow rate to the break tank), feed ripeness, and residence time. The model was used to demonstrate the understanding and the optimisation of break process performance. Longer residence time of dark red tomato pulp in the break tank can decrease pectin fraction residual and increase enzyme inactivation in the tank temperature range 40 to 60 °C. The pectin fraction remaining increased when the tank temperature was above 60 °C because of the inactivation of PG enzymes. At 80 °C there was no effect of residence time, the pectin fraction residual increased and reached 90 % and enzyme fraction residual decreased to 10 %. The effect of mixed tomato ripeness between the ripe fruit (orange and dark red) with the unripe fruit (green, breaker, and turning), the level of PG enzymes in the break tank decreased and affected on the higher pectin fraction remaining. Lower break temperature can be therefore used in this process to inactivate the low amount of PG enzyme and to achieve the same extent of pectin hydrolysis. The interruption of the feed coming into the break tank during tomato processing can increase the pectin fraction remaining and the enzyme fraction remaining in a new steady state when the feed was turned on...|$|E
40|$|Applesauce is {{made from}} a blend of {{varieties}} and processed year round due to the availability of apples from cold storage and controlled atmosphere storage, factors that affect applesauce quality. Applesauce attributes are also affected by processing operations; thus, understanding how these factors influence the final product will help to improve applesauce quality. Our goals were to assess the effect of processing parameters on rheological, {{physical and chemical properties}} of applesauce, considering variety and ripening effects, and to optimize processing conditions to improve sauce quality. We investigated the following factors: hot and <b>cold</b> <b>break</b> process; extractor rotational speed; addition of diced apples to extractor sauce output; addition of exogenous pectin methyl esterase (PME) and calcium; and activation of endogenous PME. Samples were analyzed for rheological properties (consistency index, yield stress, USDA consistency values) and physico-chemical properties (particle size distribution, pH, soluble solids, pectin content, pectin degree of methoxylation (DM)). Results were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test (p ! 0. 05). Best sauce quality (thicker sauce with low syneresis) was achieved when applesauce had a mean particle size ! 700 [MICRO SIGN]m, particle size distribution span " 1. 75, total soluble pectin " 0. 25 %, and pectin DM ! 60 %. Ripening or processing conditions could modify these parameters to meet targeted applesauce rheology. Processing effects differed with variety and ripening stage. Overall, higher rotational extractor speed and addition of " 50 % diced apples to extractor sauce output prior to final pulping, resulted in increased sauce viscosity and decreased syneresis, due to an increase in total soluble pectin, a lower mean particle diameter and a wider particle size distribution. Exogenous PME addition caused a decrease in pectin DM, leading to higher sauce viscosity and less syneresis. When PME and Ca 2 + were added, viscosity was highest but resulted in higher syneresis. Activation of endogenous PME at 5560 °C for 10 min lowered the pectin DM from 83 % to 60 - 70 % but no change on applesauce rheology was observed. By understanding how sauce physico-chemical and rheological properties are affected by variety, ripening and processing parameters, it is possible to optimize all relevant conditions to achieve better consistency and quality. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the application of High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) on quality attributes of tomato products. The effect of high hydrostatic pressure processing (0, 1 - 800 MPa, 40 - 80 °C) on the endogenous tomato enzymes, pectin methylestarase (PME) and polygalactouronase (PG), was kinetically studied, using three different tomato varieties: Cherrelino and two industrial hybrids namely Oval Red and Red Sea. For Cherrelino variety, the decrease of enzyme activity during thermal and pressure inactivation for both PME and PG followed first-order kinetics. PME {{was found to be}} pressure-stable while an antagonistic effect of pressure and temperature was observed. On the contrary, PG was more pressure sensitive than PME. PG inactivation rate constant increased with increasing pressure at all temperatures tested indicating a synergistic effect of pressure and temperature. HHP processing at selected processing conditions, did not significantly affect the color and lycopene content of tomato juice, while allowing total PG inactivation with concurrent remaining PME activity leading to high quality products in terms of viscosity and textural properties. PG inactivation for Oval Red and Red Sea, in both thermal and high pressure processing, deviated from 1 st order kinetics and was described by an nth order model. PG was found to be thermotolerant. Red Sea PG was found to be more temperature sensitive than Oval Red PG. On the other hand PG activity was extremely sensitive when thermal treatment was combined with pressure. PME inactivation, for both tomato varieties, followed first order kinetics in all tested process conditions. Red Sea PME inactivation was more temperature sensitive than the PME in Oval Red tomato juice. However, PME was found to be extremely pressure stable, indicating an antagonistic effect of pressure and temperature. Quality characteristics of slightly concentrated tomato juice produced from Red Sea tomatoes processed at selected HHP conditions were evaluated. <b>Cold</b> <b>break</b> treatment and high pressure processing did not affect the color of tomato juice, while during hot break a color deterioration was observed. Pressure treatment led to products of higher viscosity. Increase in applied pressure resulted in an increase in product viscosity and improved consistency. According to the overall results, HHP could be used to replace the traditional industrial tomato processing leading to products with superior quality characteristics. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MComm) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: There {{is great}} {{concern in the}} fruit {{industry}} that too much fruit and money is lost each year due to breaks occurring in the export cold chain of fresh fruit. Therefore, the CSIR (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) and Stellenbosch University were approached to do research on this problem. This particular study focuses on the cold chains of table grapes, summer pears and plums as these fruit are especially sensitive to temperature. Observations were made on fruit farms, in pack houses, in cold stores {{as well as in}} the Port of Cape Town. From these observations it was clear that protocols are not always followed and fruit quality is sometimes neglected because of pressure to speed up the exporting process. In order to analyse the export cold chains of these fruit types, temperature trials were conducted and temperature data received from exporting companies was analysed. The data was analysed from the cold store up to the point where the vessel sailed out of the Port of Cape Town. From the analysis it became clear that too many <b>cold</b> chain <b>breaks</b> occur during fruit exports from South Africa, especially during the loading of containers at cold stores. As a final output to the study, a good cold chain practice guide for the export of table grapes was developed with the aim of assisting the fruit industry in minimizing these <b>cold</b> chain <b>breaks.</b> The guide was developed with simplicity to ensure easy understanding under all role-players in the industry. This study was a small step in the right direction, but it should be highlighted that the complexity of the problems in the fruit cold chains are substantial and further research will have to be done in order to eliminate the occurrence of these <b>cold</b> chain <b>breaks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{consumer}} demand, food industries have shown an increased interest {{in the production of}} healthier, more natural and more tasty vegetable-based products. In that context, a major challenge is to (re) design the manufacturing processes of such food products in order to comply with the increasingly important requested criteria. Flavour {{is one of the most}} important quality attributes in foods affecting consumers’ acceptance. The flavour formation in vegetable-based products is strongly affected by processing and it can be associated with several reaction pathways, resulting in a complex mixture of a large number of volatile compounds which contribute to their aroma. In many cases, vegetable-based foods are submitted to thermal processes aiming to either improve the sensorial characteristics or to increase the stability and extend the shelf-life. Hence, there is a need for an adequate approach to understand the complexity of flavour generation in vegetable-based systems as a function of processing in order to design new/improved vegetable-based foods with better quality. In this perspective, this work aimed at gaining further insight into the potential of a range of processing conditions to modify the volatile fraction of single and mixed vegetable-based systems. Given that this work was carried out in an industrial research enviroment, the selection of the vegetable matrices was based on their economical relevance for the industry, whereas the processing conditions selected were based on real industrial settings. Processing of mixed vegetable systems adds even more complexity to their volatile profile due to the interactions among the vegetable components. Both chemical and enzymatic reactions can potentially occur between compounds of the respective vegetables when they are processed together which can affect the volatile profile of the mixed vegetable-system. Thus, focus was also given on the investigation of potential (bio) chemical interactions between the vegetable ingredients in more complex mixed-vegetable systems. In addition, sensory analyses was performed to validate the results obtained by the instumemtal analyses. To achieve the objective, the experimental part was divided into three parts: (i) impact of processing on the volatile fingerprint of a single vegetable-based system; (ii) impact of processing on the volatile fingerprint of a mixed vegetable-based system; (iii) impact of processing on the odour-active volatiles of a mixed-vegetable system. In all parts, an untargeted analytical approach (fingerprinting) along with multivariate data analysis (MVDA) was applied to detect significant differences in volatile profiles of vegetable purees prepared by different processing conditions in order to obtain an insight into chemical reactions which are influenced by processing. Sensory difference tests were performed to verify whether the differences observed in the instrumentally obtained volatile profiles were perceivable and significant in vivo. In the first experimental part, the potential of the sequence of different thermo-mechanical treatments (cold break/hot break) to control the off-flavour generation in broccoli puree was investigated. Comparison of the headspace GC-MS fingerprinting of the differently processed broccoli purees revealed that an adequate combination of processing steps allows to reduce the level of off-flavour volatiles. Next, insight was obtained into the interrelationship between processing parameters, microstructural changes and flavour generation. Application of mechanical processing before (<b>cold</b> <b>break)</b> or after the thermal processing (hot break) at 90 °C showed to determine the pattern of broccoli tissue disruption, resulting into different microstructures and various enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions inducing volatile generation. Difference sensory tests clearly showed that the differences detected in the volatile profile fingerprints of the differently processed broccoli purees were perceivable by the panelists. These results may aid the identification of optimal processing conditions generating a reduced level of off-flavour in processed broccoli. The second experimental part dealt with changes in volatile fingerprint of a mixed tomato-carrot system as a function of different thermo-mechanical processing conditions. Untargeted GC-MS chemical fingerprinting resulted into a selection of discriminative marker volatile compounds in mixed-vegetable puree, which act as the witness of the process footprint. Besides this, when individual components, in a mixed vegetable system, were processed together ('all-in-one processed') vis-a-vis processed separately and then mixed together ('split-stream processed') different extents of chemical and enzymatic reactions induced changes in their volatile profiles. Results obtained by sensory difference tests showed that the fingerprinting differences are perceivable by humans. The third experimental part focused on the determination of the odour-active compounds of a mixed tomato-onion puree by using gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC−O) and on the impact of different processing on its aroma profile. Based on the results of two olfactometric methods, i. e. detection frequency (DF) and aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA), the most potent aroma components of a mixed tomato-onion puree include: dipropyl disulfide, S-propyl thioacetate, dimethyl trisulfide, 1 -octen- 3 -one, methional, dipropyl trisulfide, 4, 5 -dimethylthiazole, phenylacetaldehyde and sotolone. As a next step, the impact of different processing steps (i. e. thermal blanching, all-in-one and split-stream processing) on the volatile profile and aroma of a mixed tomato-onion puree was investigated using a GC-MS fingerprinting approach. Results showed the potential to control the aroma in a mixed tomato-onion system through process-induced enzymatic modulations for producing tomato-onion food products with distinct aroma characteristics. The present work showed the potential of a range of different processing conditions to modify the flavour of single and mixed vegetable purees. This knowledge forms the scientific basis to select optimal processing conditions for producing vegetable-based food products with distinct headspace profiles.

But {{even at that}} minute curiosity prevailed over every other feeling, and {{somewhat}} reassured by the good-humour of the Giants and their apparent unconsciousness of his presence, he crouched {{in a corner of}} the gallery, in as small a space as he could, and, peeping between the rails, observed them closely.|$|R
60|$|Now a new terror seizes him. Has he money {{enough to}} reach London? Has he his purse at all? Too dreadful to find himself stopped short, on the very brink of deliverance! A <b>cold</b> {{perspiration}} <b>breaks</b> from his forehead, as he feels in every pocket. Yes, his purse is there: but he turns sick as he opens it, and dare hardly look. Hurrah! Five pounds, six--eight! That will take him as far as Paris. He can walk; beg {{the rest of the}} way, if need be.|$|R

[...] "There have been no big battles, but sniping is going on constantly, and several of our men have been killed or wounded. We are all anxious to have the <b>cold</b> weather <b>break</b> up, {{so that we can}} go forward and finish this war. We feel that we can wallop the enemy, if only {{we have a chance to}} get at them." ...|$|R
50|$|During World War II a {{permanent}} establishment for tram and trolleybus transport workers was organized there, the premises could accommodate up to 400 people, {{for whom it}} was a salvation during the <b>cold</b> winter. After <b>breaking</b> through the blockade the hotel began to work as usual.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the approach to}} model Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) in the 900 MWe Nuclear Power Plant Westinghouse PWR reactor. Two thermal-hydraulic system codes were applied: RELAP 5 and CATHARE 2 to simulate steady state conditions and a transient evolution. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyse a 6 -inch <b>cold</b> leg <b>break</b> in both codes and compare calculations performed in frame of the benchmark procedure between RELAP 5 and CATHARE 2 codes. Obtained steady state and transient results for both codes are comparable and predict similar accident sequences. The results are not final, and the benchmark procedure is ongoing...|$|R
50|$|On 6 February a {{prohibition}} order on navigation {{on many of}} the canals in Friesland was extended in order to facilitate the growth of the ice. The following day the Dutch meteorological institute forecast that the <b>cold</b> spell would <b>break</b> on Sunday 12 February or Monday 13 February with the temperature rising above freezing point.|$|R
5000|$|Arctic Outflow Warning - An Arctic Outflow Warning {{is based}} on a {{combination}} of wind speed and temperatures which produce wind chills of at least -20 C for at least six hours during the winter when very <b>cold</b> Arctic air <b>breaks</b> from the interior mainland of British Columbia and spills out through mountain gaps and fjords.|$|R
40|$|Some form of {{lubrication}} {{is required}} {{at each stage}} in the rolling of strip in copper and its alloys. In the finishing operations the problem {{is complicated by the}} need to produce a clean, stain-free surface, which imposes severe limitations on the types of lubricants and additives that can be used. This paper briefly reviews the reasons for lubrication during rolling and then discusses the qualities required in the lubricants, how near the precise requirements can be achieved in practice, and the limitations which currently available lubricants place on the processes. Hot rolling and <b>cold</b> <b>breaking</b> down give little trouble, but intermediate and finish rolling are more critical; the types of both oil-in-water emulsions and neat oils needed are dealt with in some detail for slow- and high-speed mills. The problem of contamination of the rolling lubricant by the oils and greases used as mill lubricants and in mill hydraulic systems is considered and suggestions are presented for minimizing the trouble by the use of special lubricants and modem methods of lubrication, including the latest practices on cluster-type Sendzimir mills. The design of roll coolant systems for modem high-speed four-high strip m i l l s and cluster-type Sendzimir mills is discussed, in so far as it affects the lubricant and strip finish. The paper concludes with a brief review of the problems posed by the latest development of the pendulum mill and their possible solutions...|$|R
60|$|The day was {{beginning}} to <b>break,</b> <b>cold</b> and blue, with flying squalls of snow. Close under the lee of the Good Hope, the coast lay in alternate rocky headlands and sandy bays; and farther inland the wooded hill-tops of Tunstall showed along the sky. Both {{the wind and the}} sea had gone down; but the vessel wallowed deep, and scarce rose upon the waves.|$|R
500|$|Melanie Ash, Paul Gibbon and Rufus Jones were {{selected}} as the three actors to feature in Bedsitcom. Jones had previously portrayed the part of Crispin in the 2002 drama White Teeth; Gibbon had played the lead role of Link in the series Stone <b>Cold.</b> To avoid <b>breaking</b> character, all three used their real names while living in the flat and went through weeks of rehearsals. O'Connor described the entire process as [...] "exhausting".|$|R
60|$|When {{it was all}} prepared, {{he carried}} the box {{to the house and}} managed to lay it down beside the bed; but he could not bring himself to touch the body. He went out to see if some one were not coming. The sound of a human voice would have {{relieved}} him at once, and he could have gone on without hesitation. But {{there was no one in}} sight, and no one was likely to be; so he returned, and summoning all his resolution, took one of the quilts from the bed and placed it in the bottom of the box. Then he removed the pillow from beneath the head of the dead woman and placed that in the box. Then he paused, the <b>cold</b> moisture <b>breaking</b> out on his face.|$|R
