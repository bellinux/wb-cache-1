25|$|Another {{purpose of}} {{tracking}} {{is to provide}} graded service or to manage a large driver and crewing staff effectively. For example, suppose an ambulance fleet has an objective of arriving {{at the location of}} a <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> within six minutes of receiving the request. Using an AVL system allows to evaluate the locations of all vehicles in service with drivers and other crew in order to pick the vehicle that will most likely arrive at the destination fastest, (meeting the service objective).|$|E
25|$|Large private telelocation or AVL systems send {{data from}} GPS {{receivers}} in vehicles to a dispatch center over their private, user-owned radio backbone. These systems {{are used for}} businesses like parcel delivery and ambulances. Smaller systems which don't justify building a separate radio system use cellular or PCS data services to communicate location data from vehicles to their dispatching center. Location data is periodically polled from each vehicle in a fleet by a central controller or computer. In the simplest systems, data from the GPS receiver is displayed on a map allowing humans to determine the location of each vehicle. More complex systems feed the data into a computer assisted dispatch system which automates the process. For example, the computer assisted dispatch system may check {{the location of a}} <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> and then pick a list of the four closest ambulances. This narrows the dispatcher's choice from the entire fleet to an easier choice of four vehicles.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} year in office, O'Malley adopted a statistics-based crime {{tracking}} system called CitiStat, modeled after Compstat. The system logged every <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> into a database for analysis. The Washington Post wrote in 2006 that Baltimore's [...] "homicide rate remains stubbornly high and its public school test scores disappointingly low. But CitiStat has saved an estimated $350 million and helped generate the city's first budget surplus in years." [...] In 2004, CitiStat accountability tool won Harvard University's [...] "Innovations in American Government" [...] award. The system garnered interest from Washington, D.C.

This report examined <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> at properties with chronic nuisance enforcement to determine if enforcement {{was associated with a}} reduction in <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>service.</b> Enforcing the chronic nuisance ordinance is associated with reduced <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> but is costly in terms of officer and analyst hours.
