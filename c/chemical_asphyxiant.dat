[...] In 2013, Enbridge won the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's permission to refuse delivery of any oil with hydrogen sulfide that exceeded 5 parts per million, half the maximum exposure recommended by federal regulators, finding levels as high as 1,200 parts per million in some crude oil shipments from Bakken formation crude oil.|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is {{a well-known}} <b>chemical</b> <b>asphyxiant,</b> which causes tissue hypoxia with prominent neurological and cardiovascular injury. After exposure to CO, several cardiac manifestations have been reported, including arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction, and pulmonary edema. However, an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to CO poisoning is a very rare presentation, and the treatment for STEMI due to CO poisoning is not well established. Here, we report a rare case of STEMI complicated by increased thrombogenicity secondary to acute CO poisoning and complete revascularization after antithrombotic treatment.

50|$|Noxious gases can be {{categorized}} as : Simple <b>asphyxiants,</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>asphyxiants,</b> and irritant gases. The simple asphixiants are nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide.The <b>chemical</b> <b>asphyxiants</b> are carbon monoxide, sulfuretted hydrogen and hydrogen cyanide.|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) {{is one of}} {{well known}} <b>chemical</b> <b>asphyxiants</b> which cause tissue hypoxia with prominent neurologic and cardiovascular injury. Cardiac dysfunction after CO poisoning can be presented as two clinical patterns. One is transient global left ventricular (LV) dysfunction {{and the other is}} LV dysfunction with regional wall motion abnormalities. In this case report, we present a case with transient LV systolic dysfunction caused by intentional exposure to CO. After conservative treatment including high concentration of oxygen, the patient recovered completely without any complication...|$|R
