5|$|In New York City, a {{man with}} a camera follows a woman from an {{elevator}} through a corridor to another elevator, where all the people appear to be gray. He gets off on a floor before the woman and runs down the stairs. Lights flicker and the elevator cable snaps. As the man reaches the basement, the cab crashes and its door spills open to reveal the woman's wrist, <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood.</b> The man begins to snap photos. Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case. Scully's partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks at the material on Scully's desk and points out that the case looks like an X-file—and that Kersh is obviously splitting them up.|$|E
5|$|Team 3D fought AMW in a Tag Team Elimination Tables {{match at}} Turning Point. The storyline behind this match {{began on the}} October8, 2005 episode of Impact! where AMW and Jeff Jarrett violently {{assaulted}} Team 3D leaving them <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood.</b> Afterwards, Team 3D were not seen due to a scripted injury, with Jarrett, AMW, and Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, Eric Young, Petey Williams, and Coach Scott D'Amore) hosting a segment where they buried Team 3D's careers on the October15, 2005 episode of Impact!. Team 3D made their return from injury at Bound for Glory, attacking Jarrett and AMW. At Genesis, Team 3D teamed with Rhino to defeat AMW and Jarrett in a Six-Man Tag Team match. A Tables match between Team 3D and AMW was announced on the November19, 2005 episode of Impact! to {{take place at the}} show.|$|E

25|$|Night fell; clouds {{accumulated}} {{above the}} Baal. The funeral-pile, which was flameless now, formed a pyramid of coals {{up to his}} knees; completely red like a giant <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood,</b> he looked, with his head thrown back, {{as though he were}} staggering beneath the weight of his intoxication.|$|E
25|$|The {{shots that}} rang {{for about five}} minutes, were made by {{regulation}} firearms carried by the military {{as well as the}} three machine guns located {{on the banks of the}} square. 36 Several peasants with machetes wounded several soldiers.

25|$|Although Moton was <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood,</b> {{the bullets}} had missed him. He lay {{motionless}} when the Klansmen reached {{the car to}} check on their victims. After the Klansmen left, Moton began searching for help, and eventually flagged down a truck driven by Rev. Leon Riley. Rev Riley was, like Moton and Liuzzo, shuttling civil rights workers back to Selma.|$|E

60|$|But Romola's {{suspicion}} {{was not to}} be dissipated: her {{horror of}} his conduct towards Baldassarre projected itself over every conception of his acts; {{it was as if she}} had seen him committing a murder, and had had a diseased impression ever after that his hands were <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> fresh <b>blood.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 31 July 1943, newlyweds Ronald Knapp and Winifred Standing {{were killed}} when they were pulled under a train from Lewes to East Grinstead. The couple walked along the railway on a dark rainy night. When the train got to Horsted Keynes, the guard found a {{raincoat}} <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood</b> on the engine. Another coat was found near two bodies {{in the middle of}} the tracks. The ganger who found them told the inquest the couple must have been walking with their backs to the train.|$|E
25|$|Although meeting stiff resistance, Hardee {{drove the}} Union troops back three miles (5km) to the {{railroad}} and the Nashville Pike by 10 a.m., where Johnson {{was able to}} rally them. Rosecrans canceled Crittenden's attack on the Confederate right, which had begun with Brig. Gen. Horatio P. Van Cleve's division crossing the river at 7 a.m., and instead rushed reinforcements to his own right flank. He had been slow to recognize the threat, assuming incorrectly that McCook {{would be capable of}} turning back Hardee's assault. As Rosecrans raced across the battlefield directing units, seeming ubiquitous to his men, his uniform was <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood</b> from his friend and chief of staff, Col. Julius Garesché, beheaded by a cannonball while riding alongside.|$|E
25|$|At daybreak police {{reinforcements}} {{arrived from}} Benalla, Beechworth, and Wangaratta. Superintendent John Sadleir came from Benalla with nine more men. Sergeant Steele, of Wangaratta, brought six, {{for a total}} of about 30 men. Before daylight Senior-Constable Kelly found a revolving rifle and a silk cap lying in the bush, about 100 yards from the hotel. The rifle was <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood</b> and a pool of blood lay near it. They believed it to belong to one of the bushrangers, hinting that they had escaped. They proved to be those of Ned Kelly himself. At daybreak the women and children among the hostages were allowed to depart. They were challenged as they approached the police line, to ensure that the outlaws were not attempting to escape in disguise.|$|E

25|$|In late December, Rosecrans {{began his}} march against Bragg's Army of Tennessee, encamped outside Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The Battle of Stones River was the bloodiest {{battle of the}} war in terms of {{percentages}} of casualties. Both Rosecrans and Bragg planned to attack the other's right flank, but Bragg moved first, early in the morning of December 31, driving the Union army back into a small defensive perimeter. As he realized the severity of the surprise attack, Rosecrans demonstrated the nervous hyperactivity for which he was known in battle. He personally rallied his men along the line, and gave direct orders to any brigades, regiments or companies he encountered. Disregarding his own safety, he rode back and forth at the very front of his line and sometimes between his men and the enemy. As Rosecrans raced across the battlefield directing units, seeming ubiquitous to his men, his uniform was <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood</b> from his friend and chief of staff, Col. Julius Garesché, beheaded by a cannonball while riding alongside.|$|E
25|$|Two plebeian tribunes, Favonius and Cato, led the {{opposition}} to the steps of the consuls. However, they did not get far, due to popular support for the measures. Favonius was given little time to speak before the plebeian council, and Cato applied obstructionist tactics that did not work. He was led away from the assembly, but he kept returning and he was eventually arrested. Gallus, a senator, slept in the senate house intending to join the proceedings in the morning. Trebonius locked the doors and kept him there for most of the day. The comitia (the meeting place of for the assembly) was blocked by a cordon of men. An attempt to pass through was repulsed violently and there were casualties. When people were leaving after the vote Gallus, who had been let out of the senate house, was hit when he tried to pass through the cordon. He was presented <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood</b> to the crowd. People were upset. The consuls stepped in with a large and intimidating bodyguard, called a meeting and put the measure in favour of Caesar to the vote. It was passed.|$|E
500|$|As Livy described, [...] "So many {{thousands}} of Romans were dying... Some, whom their wounds, pinched by the morning cold, had roused, as they were rising up, <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood,</b> from {{the midst of the}} heaps of slain, were overpowered by the enemy. Some were found with their heads plunged into the earth, which they had excavated; having thus, as it appeared, made pits for themselves, and having suffocated themselves." [...] Cowley claims that nearly six hundred legionaries were slaughtered each minute until darkness brought an end to the bloodletting. Only 14,000 Roman troops managed to escape, most of whom had cut their way through to the nearby town of Canusium.|$|E
60|$|I {{had to let}} go my grasp. The bandit, {{once more}} released, fell upon me with fury, and gave me several blows with the butt end of his carbine, one of which wounded me {{severely}} in the forehead, and <b>covered</b> me <b>with</b> <b>blood.</b> He took advantage of my being stunned to rifle me of my watch and whatever valuables I had about my person.|$|R
50|$|The first {{cathedral of}} Autun was consecrated during his episcopate. In 542, Nectarius {{travelled}} to Milan to venerate the relics of Saint Nazarius, {{and although he}} was unable to obtain any of them for Autun, he was offered a piece of cloth <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> the <b>blood</b> of Nazarius and his companion Celsus, which on his return he gave to the new cathedral, which was then dedicated to Nazarius.|$|R
60|$|At {{the top of}} {{the first}} rise the long-legged Orme caught him, but persuade him to return was more than he, or I when I arrived, could do.

But in vain did we beg him to be content with his luck and the honours he had won.|$|R

After the performance, she and her friends find themselves in a dark place, and after some dialogue, Gaga's friends run off, leaving her alone to deal with the Fame Monster, a giant angler fish. Gaga starts singing [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and eventually kills the Fame Monster by shooting sparks from her pyrotechnic bra and underwear. She then leaves for the Monster Ball and after appearing there, meanwhile fans assume the show is over, suddenly Gaga appears on stage and [...] performs the final song, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] while standing inside a giant gyroscope.|$|E
500|$|In {{an opening}} {{statement}} {{for the trial}} on May 4, Cisneros's defense denied her client's participation in the murder, and called Martínez a liar. They stated that Martínez and Garza orchestrated the murder without Cisneros's involvement. The prosecution told the jury that Cisneros orchestrated the murder. Fischer's mother took the stand and repeated her versions {{of the story and}} of the two loud noises she heard before finding her son's corpse <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood</b> on the driveway. In addition to her, other witnesses took the stand to tell the jury their stories, including his stepfather and a gardener, who saw a vehicle with Mexican license plates leaving the house when Fischer was shot dead. Martínez testified in court again that Cisneros agreed to pay her to find someone to murder Fischer after Martínez told her that he was not in love with her daughter. Investigators who worked on the case also testified in court and stated that Martínez cooperated with them to set up a meeting with Cisneros after she assisted her in finding someone to have Fischer killed. The prosecution stated they had audio tapes of Martínez's meeting with Cisneros, but they were asked to hold off on presenting the evidence because the defense stated the tapes were tampered with. [...] The recordings were admitted to court on May 8 and presented to the jury through translated transcripts.|$|E
500|$|Within {{the area}} of the Omarska mining complex that was used for the camp, the camp {{authorities}} generally confined the prisoners in three different buildings: the administration building, where interrogations and killings took place; the crammed hangar building; the [...] "white house", where the inmates were tortured; and on a cement courtyard area between the buildings known as the [...] "pista", an L-shaped strip of concrete land in between, also a scene of torture and mass killings. There was another small building, known as the [...] "red house", where prisoners were sometimes taken in order to be summarily executed. With the arrival of the first detainees, permanent guard posts and anti-personnel landmines were set up around the camp. The conditions in the camp were horrible. In the building known as the [...] "white house", the rooms were crowded with 45 people in a room no larger than [...] The faces of the detainees were distorted and bloodstained and the walls were <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>blood.</b> From the beginning, the detainees were beaten with fists, rifle butts and wooden and metal sticks. The guards mostly hit the heart and kidneys whenever they decided to beat someone to death. In the [...] "garage", between 150 and 160 people were [...] "packed like sardines" [...] and the heat was unbearable. For the first few days, the detainees were not allowed out and were given only a jerry can of water and some bread. Men would suffocate during the night and their bodies would be taken out the following morning. The room behind the restaurant was known as [...] "Mujo’s Room". The dimensions of this room were about [...] and the average number of people detained there was 500, most of whom were Bosniaks. The women in the camp slept in the interrogations rooms, which they would have to clean each day as the rooms were covered in blood and pieces of skin and hair. In the camp one could hear the moaning and wailing of people who were being beaten.|$|E

50|$|Napoléon Gallois later relayed {{the legend}} that an {{unspecified}} French frigate had encountered {{the wreck of}} Duc de Dantzig drifting at sea, <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> dried <b>blood</b> and the putrefying corpses of her crew, many crucified to the masts or the deck. There were no signs {{that she had been}} in a recent battle: no new shot holes, and her sails and rigging were intact. Some blood-stained papers found in the captain's cabin identified her captain as François Aregnaudeau. The crew of the frigate set the brig ablaze.|$|R
