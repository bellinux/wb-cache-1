The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers.

[...] The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver.

50|$|The {{rectilinear}} <b>comb</b> uses a <b>circular</b> <b>comb</b> {{mounted on}} a drum to comb out the fringe and remove short fiber (set by a scale so fibers less than, for example, 25 mm are removed) not held by a clamping mechanism. The row of pins known as a top comb is a very fine tooth comb, for example 25 teeth per inch; it is inserted in cylindrical combed fringe {{to act as an}} impediment to contaminates (burr, seed etc.) flow. The top comb acts as an impediment to contamination moving into a combed sliver. On a next <b>circular</b> <b>combing</b> short finer and contaminates are removed. The <b>circular</b> <b>combing</b> without short fibers are placed on a moving belt in an overlapping motion. The <b>circular</b> <b>combing</b> and top comb insertion is repeated and combed fibers - now called tuft are overlapped. The overlapping produces some cohesion allowing the tuft then to be twisted to form a combed sliver. This sliver is weak and unsuitable for spinning. To allow spinning to take place additional gilling is required to introduce fiber end irregularity (Sokolov 1994).|$|R

This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|R
50|$|Combing is {{a method}} for {{preparing}} carded fiber for spinning. Combing is divided into linear and <b>circular</b> <b>combing.</b> The Noble comb {{is an example of}} <b>circular</b> <b>combing.</b> The French comb is an example of linear combing. The process of combing is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out carded or combed top making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibers by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibers in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When combing wool, the discarded short fibers are called noils, and are ground up into shoddy.|$|R
50|$|Cartwright also {{patented}} a wool <b>combing</b> <b>machine</b> in 1789 and a cordelier (machine {{for making}} rope) in 1792. He also designed a steam engine that used alcohol instead of water.|$|R
50|$|The <b>circular</b> <b>combs</b> used {{have long}} metal teeth, and only barely {{resemble}} the comb used on hair. However, {{they are used}} {{in a similar fashion}} with one comb holding the fiber, which is slowly dubbed in by a brush, while the other is moved through, slowly transferring the fiber to the moving comb.|$|R

During the Cotton Famine, the company obtained rights to Heilmann's <b>combing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{support of}} the flannel emphasis, in 1865 Coldharbour Mill moved over to {{producing}} worsted yarn rather than woollen yarn. This necessitated {{the need for more}} power to drive new <b>combing</b> <b>machines.</b> (Worsted yarn is made from sheep with long hair fleeces and the wool has to be combed to ensure that all the fibres are parallel.) ...|$|R
50|$|The wool <b>combing</b> <b>machine</b> {{was invented}} by Edmund Cartwright, the {{inventor}} of the power loom, in Doncaster. It was patented on 1790. This machine was used to arrange and lay parallel by length the fibers of wool, prior to further treatment. The machine was important in the mechanization of the textile industry. The machine was refined by many later inventors.|$|R
25|$|Combing {{straightens}} the fibres, isolates {{the long}} ones (tops) for spinning and discards the short ones (noil). There are {{various types of}} <b>combing</b> <b>machines</b> here, including the French comb, the Lister comb and the Holden comb. The Noble comb {{was the most popular}} as it would comb long, medium and fairly short staple wool, but the slivers needed special preparation in a punching machine beforehand.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of automatic machinery, there was little difficulty in attaining a straight fibre, as long wool was always used, and the sliver was made up by hand, using combs. The introduction of Richard Arkwright's water frame in 1771, and the later introduction of cap and mule spinning machines, required perfectly prepared slivers. Many manufactories used one or more preparatory <b>combing</b> <b>machines</b> (called gill-boxes) before worsting, to ensure straight fibres and to distribute the lubricant evenly.|$|R
25|$|The combed slivers {{produced}} on {{any type of}} <b>combing</b> <b>machine</b> are passed through {{a process known as}} finishing. This process takes place in a series of gill boxes in which the fibres are redistributed, the slivers made uniform in thickness and moisture added in order to give the wool its natural suppleness and condition. Blending is done where necessary to keep the top up to a given standard of quality and, if dyed, consistency of colour. The top ball produced is suitable for packing for transport and unwinding. The top represents the wool comber's finished product, and it is in this form that the wool is bought and sold as the spinner's raw material.|$|R
30|$|According to Adanur (2001), the open-end is {{a process}} notably {{employed}} to produce denim yarn. The open-end yarns are cheap and rustic for not passing through machines that add a sophisticated finishing, such as textile laminating and <b>combing</b> <b>machines,</b> differing, for example, from the ring spinning process where a set of parallelized fibers is well twisted so there is high cohesion and strength. Additionally, in open-end spinning, the individual fibers are not uniformly arranged in the produced yarn as in the spinning ring produced yarn. In an open-end spinning yarn most of the fibers are parallel, but with some intersections and some irregular fibers surrounding the main cable (Fabriclink – Fabric University 2012).|$|R

The difficulty of harvesting berries from plants that differ greatly in shape and size requires a large expenditure of labour which leads to high production costs. However, besides the need to increase the availability of berries, in order to reduce costs it is necessary to use proper harvesting systems that are respectful of plants and fruit, but which are most of all capable of facilitating harvesting. The present study compares the results of different harvesting tests on low-, medium- and high-growing plants with a <b>combing</b> <b>machine</b> powered by a generator and a portable battery...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1940s {{after the}} {{imperative}} of wartime production had passed, Michell set about modernising the company's operations. State-of-the-art British <b>combing</b> <b>machines</b> were imported, utilising both the traditional Noble type {{and the more}} efficient French type. This enabled {{an increase in the}} overall output of wool tops by 30%, as well as the utilisation of shorter-fibered wool varieties, which previously had been sent overseas for processing. The quality of tops was also improved by this method, producing wool suitable for the manufacture of fine clothing. [...] In 1947, Michell pioneered an incentive wage scheme at the company's Hindmarsh and Fremantle processing facilities, whereby the typical worker could earn an average of 27% above the award wage for production beyond standard output levels.|$|R
50|$|Elmore {{seems to}} have been {{associated}} with The Clique, a group of young artists who saw themselves as followers of Hogarth and David Wilkie. According to his friend William Powell Frith he was member of the group, but since it was most active while he was in continental Europe, his involvement was probably short-lived. Most of Elmore's later works were historical narrative paintings. Religious Controversy and The Novice were implicitly anti-Catholic in character. Other paintings set episodes from Shakespeare, or the history of the French Revolution. They often contained subtle explorations of the process of creation, most importantly his two paintings about technological innovation, The Invention of the Stocking Loom (1847, Nottingham Castle Museum) and The Invention of the <b>Combing</b> <b>Machine</b> (1862, Cartwright Hall, Bradford). Both portray the process of industrialisation by depicting picturesque pre-industrial handicrafts. The inventor is supposed to be pondering these manual skills while he forms in his mind a mechanism to replace them.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} a laterally rotating micromachined platform integrated under optical waveguides {{to control the}} in-plane propagation direction of light within a die to select one of multiple outputs. The platform is designed to exhibit low constant optical losses throughout the motion range and is actuated electrostatically using an optimized <b>circular</b> <b>comb</b> drive. An angular motion of ± 9. 5 ° using 180 V is demonstrated. To minimize the optical losses between the moving and fixed parts, a gap-closing mechanism is implemented to reduce the initial air gap to submicron values. A latch structure is implemented to hold the platform in place with a resolution of 0. 25 ° over the entire motion range. The platform was integrated with silicon nitride waveguides to create a crossbar switch and preliminary optical measurements are reported. In the bar state, the loss {{was measured to be}} 14. 8 dB with the gap closed whereas in the cross state it was 12. 2 dB. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first optical switch based on a rotating microelectromechanical device with integrated silicon nitride waveguides reported to date...|$|R
25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the <b>combing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{magnetostrictive}} phased array sensor (MPAS) with a polycrystalline nickel patch of a <b>circular</b> <b>comb</b> shape {{in order for the}} use of the ultrasonic guided Lamb wave inspection technique. The MPAS was comprised of two main components of the surface-mounted nickel patch and a mobile magnetic circuit device enclosing six sensing coils and center-positioned cylindrical biasing magnets. The magnetic circuit device detects the magnetic property change induced by the elastic wave propagation through the magnetostrictive nickel patch bonded to a thin aluminum plate. The individual sensing coils were configured to have directional preferences specified along the perpendicular direction of the coil winding, and they were arranged in a hexagon with a radius of 0. 5 ” to form a compact-sized phased array sensor. Although the magnetic circuit device contains only six physical sensing coils, the MPAS enables to increase the total numbers of sensing positions by altering the orientation of the magnetic circuit device. The enhanced directional sensing capability of the presented MPAS was achieved as a result of the combined effect on the high magnetic shape anisotropy feature along the individual comb finger directions of the nickel patch and the directional sensitivity of the hexagon magnetic circuit device itself...|$|R
