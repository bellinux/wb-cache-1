While authenticity, friendships, and honesty remain foregrounded {{in a number of}} Children’s British Broadcasting Corporation (CBBC) shows, these are constructed through a national discourse that connects to transnational models of the tween girl but also mobilizes a <b>cultural</b> <b>specificity</b> that is inextricable from the broadcasting context in which it is produced...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} {{identify}} the influences of <b>cultural</b> <b>specificity</b> upon managerial decision flows within a sports camp. This influence is analyzed {{from the perspective of}} cultural dimensions elaborated by G. Hofstede, F. Trompenaas, and Ed. Hall. This effort represents a pilot-research and the purpose is to elaborate a methodology for assessing the intercultural management of the sports camps in Romania. This research aims {{to identify the}} elements of <b>cultural</b> <b>specificity</b> within a sports camp, with a focus on the activity of the manager, of the managerial team, and on the employees’ attitude. We have initiated this research starting from the hypothesis that there exist and that one may use the elements referring to the dimensions elaborated by the aforementioned authors on the level of a sports camp. We may conclude that, through the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the intercultural dimensions, we will emphasize on the dynamic of the cultural influences in the managerial aspect of the sports camp in the geo-cultural area of Moldavia, Romania...|$|R

40|$|The current {{research}} in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is showing the potential that the Information Technologies can have in music related applications. A major research challenge {{in that direction}} is how to automatically describe/annotate audio recordings {{and how to use}} the resulting descriptions to discover and appreciate music in new ways. But music is a complex phenomenon and the description of an audio recording has to deal with this complexity. For example, each music culture has specificities and emphasizes different musical and communication aspects, thus the musical recordings of each culture should be described differently. At the same time these <b>cultural</b> <b>specificities</b> give us the opportunity to pay attention to musical concepts and facets that, despite being present in most world musics, are not easily noticed by listeners. In this paper we present some of the work done in the CompMusic project, including ideas and specific examples on how {{to take advantage of the}} <b>cultural</b> <b>specificities</b> of different musical repertoires. We will use examples from the art music traditions of India, Turkey and China. 1...|$|R

Despite Boswell’s friendly relations with Foucault, he remained adamantly opposed to the French theorist’s views, which he characterised as a reemergence of medieval nominalism, and defended his own striking essentialism in the face of changing academic fashions.|$|R

40|$|If it can {{be assumed}} that {{everything}} that can be translated thereby lacks <b>cultural</b> <b>specificity,</b> the items that most resist translation may be considered good markers of the substantiality and limits of a culture. The proposition might take time to sink in, but I suspect it could be of interest for arguments concerning cultural regionality, beyond identity as a question of presupposed sovereignty and closed frontiers. With respect to the translation of Australian literature, I have attempted to apply this idea by asking “how much of Australia fits into Spain?” (Pym 1989), assuming that whatever did not fit during the rendering of some ten short stories into Spanish {{was likely to be}} an index of Australian <b>cultural</b> <b>specificity.</b> The succinct answer to that mostly ethical question was “too much”, since effective solutions were found for almost all the ostensible translation problems and the only available conclusion was thus that Australian identity has no flourishing specificity. This might be a fashionable finding, but it is not highly satisfactory, especially if you are Australian. As a second approach to this problem I would like to focus on translation difficultie...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis of}} the University of Economics in Prague deals with problems of Haiti and the Dominican Republic {{from the perspective}} of business and <b>cultural</b> <b>specificity.</b> The theme was chosen because of {{significant differences between the two}} countries, both in culture and in the economy. Another reason was that the author was visiting the island of Hispaniola during one month. This visit left mixed feelings for the author. Significant differences in the maturity of both countries and especially poverty in Haiti are discussed throughout the work and then outlines some possible methods for increasing standard of living and a better future for the population. The thesis deals first with historical development, then divided into two parts, i. e. the first one is devoted to Haiti and the second one to the Dominican Republic. It is approached from different point of view, perspectives, such as the economic situation, relations with the Czech Republic, the <b>cultural</b> <b>specificity</b> and current events. Further progress of the two independent states on the island of Hispaniola would have been very successful not only for the territory itself but also for the success of our entire civilization...|$|R
40|$|The formal {{features}} {{that have made}} Spanish cinema {{what it is and}} the technical processes behind them (camerawork, production design, editing) have passed through the same stages of trial and error, hurdles, crises, and conflicts as has been the case with other national cinemas. The notion of the exceptionalism of Spanish cinema is not supported by evidence, unless by “anomaly” we just mean “cultural <b>specificity.</b> ” <b>Cultural</b> <b>specificities</b> there have been, as there are today: the highly idiosyncratic set designs of popular adaptations (of zarzuelas, of literary texts) in the 1920 s; the enforced experimentation of the Civil War; the claustrophobic atmosphere of the postwar years; the prolongation of the studio age perhaps longer than in any other country; and the modest impact of lightweight cameras and direct sound in the modernizing phase that began in the late 1950 s. But are these <b>cultural</b> <b>specificities</b> any greater than those represented by 1920 s German expressionism and Soviet montage, 1930 s French poetic realism, the New York underground, or the cyclical recurrence of genres in Japan? A good case can be made for giving Spanish cinema back its normality; that is, its unsurprising singularity...|$|R
