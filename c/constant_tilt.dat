40|$|Recently, dispersionless (coherent) {{motion of}} (noninteracting) massive Brownian particles, at {{intermediate}} time scales, {{was reported in}} a sinusoidal potential with a <b>constant</b> <b>tilt.</b> The coherent motion persists for a finite length {{of time before the}} motion becomes diffusive. We show that such coherent motion can be obtained repeatedly by applying an external zero-mean square-wave drive of appropriate period and amplitude, instead of a <b>constant</b> <b>tilt.</b> Thus, the cumulative duration of coherent motion of particles is prolonged. Moreover, by taking an appropriate combination of periods of the external field, one can postpone the beginning of the coherent motion and can even have coherent motion at a lower value of position dispersion than in the <b>constant</b> <b>tilt</b> case.

40|$|The Fourier {{method of}} {{interferogram}} analysis requires {{the introduction of}} a <b>constant</b> <b>tilt</b> into the inteferogram to serve as a 'carrier signal' for information on the figure of the surface under test.

However, in the problem of aligning optical components and systems, knowledge of part orientation is crucial to proper instrument performance. This paper outlines an algorithm which uses the normally ignored carrier signal in Fourier analysis to compute an absolute tilt (orientation) of the test surface.

The system is studied in the region where the force is close to the critical value $F_c$ at which the barriers separating neighboring potential wells disappear. We show that, when $F$ crosses the critical value, the shape of the Mean-Square Displacement (MSD) curves is strongly modified. We identify a diffusive regime at intermediate time scales, with an effective diffusion coefficient which is much larger than the late time diffusion coefficient for $F>F_c$, whereas for $F<F_c$ the late time and intermediate time diffusive regimes are indistinguishable. Explicit asymptotic regimes for the MSD curves are identified at all time scales...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} Monte Carlo simulations for {{the estimation}} of the transient probability that the infinite server queue reaches high levels within a predefined time window. Under the light traffic assumption this is a rare event. The simulations are speed up by applying importance sampling using a change of measure. In case of Poisson arrivals and exponential servers, the M/M/ ∞ model, an exponential change of measure with a <b>constant</b> <b>tilting</b> factor gives poor results. The reason being that the optimal path to high levels is not a straight line. However, from {{the expression of the}} optimal path we deduce a change of measure under which the arrival and service time distributions are updated after each jump time of the process. We prove that the importance sampling algorithm with this measure is asymptotically optimal. For the general case we adapt this algorithm using a few heuristics that are based on the observation that the importance sampling simulations in the Poisson/exponential model with a few updates of the distributions give good performance. The algorithms are tested by simulation experiments. ...|$|R

The analytical solution is obtained to leading order in the small parameter d/w. The critical state depends on how the applied magnetic field is switched on, e. g., at <b>constant</b> <b>tilt</b> angle, or first the perpendicular and then the parallel field component. For these two basic scenarios the distributions of current density and magnetic field are obtained in the critical states.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{simplified}} molecular model of mesogenic dimers {{consisting of two}} identical uniaxial mesogenic cores separated by a fixed-length spacer and allowed to assume only two, statistically equivalent, conformations which are non-planar and of opposite handedness. In the mean-field approximation, with additive interactions among the mesogenic cores, the model yields up to three positionally disordered phases, one isotropic and two nematic. The low temperature nematic phase (N_X) has a local two-fold symmetry axis {{which is also a}} direction of molecular polar ordering and is tightly twisted about a macroscopic phase axis. The onset of polar ordering generates spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, manifested primarily by the twisting of the polar director and the formation of chiral domains of opposite handedness. Within these domains the statistical balance between the two enantiomer conformations is shifted and the principal axes of the ordering tensors of the molecular segments twist at <b>constant</b> <b>tilt</b> angles with the helix axis. Key experimental results on the N_X phase of liquid crystalline dimers are discussed {{in the light of the}} theoretical predictions of the model, which are also contrasted with the predictions of the twist-bend nematic model.

40|$|Newly born magnetars are {{promising}} sources for gravitational wave (GW) detection {{due to their}} ultra-strong magnetic fields and high spin frequencies. Within the scenario of a growing tilt angle between the star's spin and magnetic axis, due {{to the effect of}} internal viscosity, we obtain improved estimates of the stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) from magnetic deformation of newly born magnetars. We find that the GW background spectra contributed by the magnetars with ultra-strong toroidal magnetic fields of 10 ^ 17 G could roughly be divided into four segments. Most notably, in contrast to the background spectra calculated by assuming <b>constant</b> <b>tilt</b> angles χ=π/ 2, the background radiation above 1000 Hz are seriously suppressed. However, the background radiation at the frequency band ∼ 100 - 1000 Hz are moderately enhanced, depending on the strengths of the dipole magnetic fields. We suggest that if all newly born magnetars indeed have toroidal magnetic fields of 10 ^ 17 G, the produced SGWBs should show sharp variations with the observed frequency at several tens to about 100 hertz. If these features could be observed through sophisticated detection of the SGWB using the proposed Einstein Telescope, it will provide us a direct evidence of the tilt angle evolutions and further some deep understandings about the properties of newly born magnetars.

40|$|There {{is a great}} {{interest}} in smectic materials that show no layer shrinkage (NLS) in the transition from smectic A to smectic C. Such materials are often discussed in terms of ode Vries materialso or ode Vries behavioro after A. de Vries, who proposed different mechanisms for this NLS behavior, involving a significant tilt of the individual molecules in the smectic A phase. According to the original proposition of de Vries, the molecules are already tilted in this kind of smectic A phase, with a large <b>constant</b> <b>tilt</b> and the same tilt direction in each layer but random tilt direction between different layers. Despite the individual molecular tilt the smectic A phase remains uniaxial and the transition to the biaxial smectic C state is seen as a global ordering in the tilt directions. The model thus ad hoc predicts that there is zero layer shrinkage at the A - C transition. We refer to this model as the ohollow cone distributiono. As later pointed out by de Vries there are, however, other possible models for describing a tilt disorder (thermodynamically unavoidable) in the A phase. Nevertheless, the hollow cone has been a widely accepted model in the literature and is repeatedly referred to in discussing de Vries behavior or even taken as a basis for theories describing it. We discuss different smectic A orientational distribution functions that could be related to de Vries behavior or de Vries transitions. We find that two opposite models have comparable predictive power but only one gives a consistent picture together with existing data. Our conclusion is that the smectic A - smectic C transition can have a continuously changing character from a opure tilto to a opure de Vrieso, and we illustrate the orientational distribution functions in the A and C phases for these two limiting cases. We find that de Vries behavior is not related to any exotic distribution of hollow cone or similar kind in the A phase, but instead to an unusual combination of low nematic order and high smectic order in the de Vries smectic A. As the technical interest in such materials is considerable, a directed effort toward the synthesis of new optimized materials would be important...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} derives {{and demonstrates}} {{a new approach}} to the design of wide-field interferometric telescopes. The first part of this dissertation is a tutorial on multiple aperture systems. Design basics such as PSF and OTF, fill factors, resolution, and temporal coherence are investigated. We show that the perfect image for a multiple aperture system is the sum of an image from each aperture and a set of fringes from each pair of apertures. Four example systems are designed by applying the derived design rules. The first system is a rotationally-symmetric Paul system that is then segmented to make a four-aperture system. The low-order design rules in this system are shown to be automatically satisfied. The second system is an array of four afocal telescopes that share a three-mirror combining telescope. Fold flats are used in the inner two arms to satisfy the requirement that the axial pathlengths should match. Linear piston errors are eliminated by forcing the beam configuration into the combiner to be a scaled version of the afocal array. The angles of the fold flats are chosen to eliminate any <b>constant</b> <b>tilt</b> errors. As a third example, the design of a beam combiner for the Large Binocular telescope is explored. By applying the design rules, coherent imaging with a 1 arcminute field of view is achieved with just three reflections. Linear defocus errors appear, but are minimized by bringing the beams to focus as closely together as possible. The sine condition is satisfied for the axial rays so that the linear piston errors are zero. As a fourth example, a space telescope design is presented that utilizes a flat gossamer mirror technology. The system would consist of a primary array of flats, a shared secondary mirror, and a tertiary array with one mirror corresponding to each of the primary flats. Each branch of the system consists of a primary flat, the shared secondary, and a tertiary that brings the beam to the correct image point. The position of the tertiary is chosen to eliminate axial pathlength errors. The RMS wavefront error is calculated {{as a function of the}} system parameters. This gives an efficient method for exploring design space for the gossamer systems. The performance of a system of five flats is explored in this way. A few specific five-flat systems are modeled with full interferometric raytraces, and the results show good agreement with the Strehl values predicted by calculation of the RMS wavefront errors.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{focuses on the}} theoretical study and analysis of novel types of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) with tunable polarization properties. Four different PCF designs are proposed, which are demonstrated to support single-polarization (SP) and/or polarization-maintaining (PM) guidance, {{as well as the}} thermal and electrical dynamical control of their polarization properties, such as the value of modal birefringence, the polarization axes and the transition among different operational states. The first PCF type consists in an index-guiding PCF enhanced with a hollow core capillary, which is infiltrated by a nematic liquid crystal (LC). By proper selection of the material refractive indices SP guidance is achieved, while the allowed polarization axis is controlled via the application of an external electric field. Both uniform and more realistic nematic direct profiles are investigated. The reduction of the central defect hole radius leads to PM properties, with finely adjustable high values of modal birefringence. A final example also demonstrates the capability of switchable operation between an off-state and SP/PM guidance. The impact of the infiltration of the cladding capillaries in a honeycomb photonic bandgap fiber with a nematic material is investigated in the next section. The selection of the material indices in this case as well is proven to be crucial in terms of the fiber’s polarization properties, owing to the different effective indices sensed in the cladding holes by light of orthogonal polarization. Both SP and PM guidance is predicted, with very high levels of birefringence in the later case. The possibility to thermally tune the value of birefringence and to operate between zero- and high-birefringence states is also assessed. The third example of the proposed polarizing PCFs is based on a hybrid mechanism approach supported by an accordingly designed liquid-crystal infiltrated PCF. By letting the refractive index of the glass lie between the indices of the nematic material a tunable electrical transition is demonstrated in terms of the fiber’s polarization state. As the intensity of the applied field increases, the fiber progressively passes through a zero- to high-birefringence state, followed by a SP interval, and finally extremely-high birefringence operation. The fiber’s electro-optic response is investigated both considering <b>constant</b> <b>tilt</b> angles of the LC molecules, and realistic director patterns calculated for various values of the applied voltage. A concurrent combination of favorable characteristics is demonstrated, namely guidance in a solid glass core, the elimination of the need for selective infiltration or specific anchoring conditions, moderate LC molecule switching values, and both wavelength- and voltage-selective polarization properties. In a different context, a fourth design is finally proposed, considering long period gratings (LPG) inscribed in an index-guiding highly-birefringent PCF with liquid-infiltrated holes. The geometrical birefringence of the PCF induces the splitting of the resonance LPG wavelegths corrsponding to the two orthogonal polarizations of the fundamental mode. Thus, a simple polarizing filter results, whose operation wavelength may be adjusted by properly selective the LPG period. The impact on the polarization properties of such fibers is thoroughly studied with respect to the infiltration of the cladding capillaries with an isotropic optical liquid. The thermooptic response of the liquid is shown to lead to extensive thermal tunability of the resonance wavelengths. Two different designs, aiming at maximizing the grating’s thermal sensitivy and at providing linear low-loss response are presented. The fiber’s sensitivity is also discussed in the context of highly accurate refractometric applications. In conclusion, four different designs of tunable polarizing PCFs have been presented, based on liquid-crystal infiltrated and long period grating liquid-infiltrated fibers. The utilization of such fibers might prove indispensable {{in a wide range of}} applications where extensive control of light’s polarization state is a prerequisite. These include, for instance, coherent communication systems, fiber-based gyroscopes and interferometers, fiber laser systems, photonic switching devices and optical coherence tomography or quantum cryptography applications. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Effective {{control of}} (upright) body posture {{requires}} a proper representation of body orientation. Stroke patients with pusher syndrome {{were shown to}} suffer from severely disturbed perception of own body orientation. They experience their body as oriented 'upright' when actually tilted by nearly 20 ° to the ipsilesional side. Thus, it can be expected that postural control mechanisms are impaired accordingly in these patients. Our aim was to investigate pusher patients' spontaneous postural responses of the non-paretic leg and of the head during passive body tilt. Methods A sideways tilting motion {{was applied to the}} trunk of the subject in the roll plane. Stroke patients with pusher syndrome were compared to stroke patients not showing pushing behaviour, patients with acute unilateral vestibular loss, and non brain damaged subjects. Results Compared to all groups without pushing behaviour, the non-paretic leg of the pusher patients showed a <b>constant</b> ipsiversive <b>tilt</b> across the whole tilt range for an amount which was observed in the non-pusher subjects when they were tilted for about 15 ° into the ipsiversive direction. Conclusion The observation that patients with acute unilateral vestibular loss showed no alterations of leg posture indicates that disturbed vestibular afferences alone are not responsible for the disordered leg responses seen in pusher patients. Our results may suggest that in pusher patients a representation of body orientation is disturbed that drives both conscious perception of body orientation and spontaneous postural adjustment of the non-paretic leg in the roll plane. The investigation of the pusher patients' leg-to-trunk orientation thus could serve as an additional bedside tool to detect pusher syndrome in acute stroke patients. </p...|$|R

[1]Metallacyclophanes are strained, ring-tilted complexes that have a propensity to undergo ring-opening polymerizations (ROPs). On the basis of using bulky, intramolecularly coordinating ligands, the [1]metallacyclophanes described within have been synthesized and characterized. By exploring known transition-metal catalyzed ROP methodologies, a serendipitous discovery has been made. The gallium-bridged [1]molybdarenophane undergoes ring-opening reactions catalyzed by sigma donors such as thf and triethylphospine or by pi donors such as 1, 5 -cyclooctadiene. Known transition-metal catalyzed ROP methodologies proved to be unsuccessful with the aluminum- and gallium-bridged [1]metallarenophanes, possibly due to steric overprotection.

Gallium-bridged [1. 1]metallarenophanes have been determined to be Class II compounds through investigations by cyclic voltammetry. Aluminum-bridged [1. 1]metallarenophanes can not be successfully characterized by electrochemical measurements because of their acute sensitivity towards oxygen and moisture.

The parameter dependence of the decay rate is revealed by investigating the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation in the low temperature case under the spatially periodic boundary condition (PBC). We apply the WKB method to the associated Schrödinger equation. While eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian FP operator are complex in general, in a small tilting case the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are almost vanishing. Then the Schrödinger equation is solved with PBC. The decay rate is analyzed in the context of quantum tunneling through a triple-well effective periodic potential. In a large tilting case, the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of FP operator are crucial. We apply the complex-valued WKB method to the Schrödinger equation with the absorbing boundary condition, finding that the decay rate saturates and depends only on the temperature, the potential periodicity and the viscous <b>constant.</b> The intermediate <b>tilting</b> case is also explored. The analytic results agree well with the numerical data for a wide range of tilting. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnreinforced adobe or mud-brick {{structures}} have in {{the past}} suffered severe damage from seismic forces and have caused a vast number of deaths. However, a number of adobe buildings located in seismic regions have performed well under several seismic events. Most of these traditional buildings’ shapes are symmetrical which has significant bearing on the performance of the building during strong earthquakes. This paper presents an experimental comparison between two symmetrical shapes, i. e., a square and a circular model of unreinforced adobe walls. One-third scale models were built and tested using a static tilt test for seismic performance evaluation of both structures. The adobe house models were subjected to a <b>constant</b> acceleration when <b>tilted</b> on a tilt-up table. The lateral component of model weight was used as a parameter to quantify the maximum seismic force for each model. The paper describes the configuration of both specimens and testing method. The results of these comparative experiments indicated a better performance of the circular structure. There are simple and effective solutions for construction of new adobe buildings located in seismic hazard areas which can assist in decreasing damage and death...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} the {{surprising}} formation of square-based facetted islands with linear {{dimension of the}} order of 500 nm upon dewetting of a Cr multilayer onW(100). We show that these square islands are composed of inclined facets surrounding a depressed center such that the facet slopes inward with the outer edges of the islands thicker than the centers. The islands’ shapes do not represent traditional equilibrium crystal shapes as expected for a Wulf construction. In situ UV and x-ray photoelectron emission microscopy allied to spatially resolved spectroscopy throws considerable light {{on the nature of the}} dewetting and shows that the metal surface between the islands remains covered by a thin pseudomorphic wetting layer of ∼ 1 ML. Low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopies allow quantification of facet slopes, and we identify a predominance of tilted Cr(100) facets ± 5 ◦ off of the substrate normal bound by (210) planes at ∼ 26 ◦. The epitaxial Cr islands adopt the bulk Cr lattice <b>constant</b> but are <b>tilted</b> with respect to the surface normal. We suggest that the Cr crystallite tilting creates a vicinal-like interface structure that determines the island morpholog...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} in normal human subjects how semicircular canal and otolith signals interact in {{the estimation of}} the subjective visual vertical after constant velocity or <b>constant</b> acceleration roll <b>tilt.</b> In the <b>constant</b> velocity paradigm, subjects were rotated in darkness at +/- 60 degrees/s for five complete cycles before being stopped in one of seven orientations ranging from 0 to +/- 90 degrees (right/left ear down). In the constant acceleration paradigm, subjects were rotated with an acceleration of + 30 or - 30 degrees/s 2 to the same seven end positions between - 90 and + 90 degrees, by way of passing once through the upside-down position. The subjective visual vertical was assessed by measuring the setting of a luminous line that appeared at different test delays after stop rotation in otherwise complete darkness. The data suggest that gravitational jerk signals generated by otolith-semicircular canal interactions and/or carried by phasic otolith signals {{are responsible for the}} observed transient bias in the estimation of the subjective visual vertical. This transient bias depended on both rotation and <b>tilt</b> direction after <b>constant</b> velocity rotations, but was almost abolished following constant acceleration rotations...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that vestibular otolith organ stimulation contributes to human orthostatic responses. Twelve subjects underwent three 60 degrees upright tilts: (1) with the neck flexed from 0 degrees to 30 degrees {{relative to the}} body during 60 degrees tilt, such that the head moved from horizontal to 90 degrees above horizontal (0 to 1 Gz otolith stimulation); (2) with the head and body aligned, such that they tilted together to 60 degrees (0 to 0. 87 Gz otolith stimulation); and (3) with the neck flexed 30 degrees relative to the body during supine conditions, and the neck then extended to - 30 degrees during 60 degrees body tilting, such that the head remained at 30 degrees above horizontal throughout body <b>tilting</b> (<b>constant</b> 0. 5 Gz otolith stimulation). All three tilt procedures increased thoracic impedance, sympathetic nerve activity (N = 8 of 12), arterial pressure, and heart rate relative to supine conditions (all P < 0. 04). Within the first 20 s of tilt, arterial pressure increased most obviously in the 0 to 1 Gz otolith condition. Thoracic impedance tended to increase more in otolith-constant conditions, but no dependent variable differed significantly between tilt conditions, and no significant time x tilt interactions emerged. Otolith inputs may contribute to early transient adjustments to orthostasis. However, lack of significant main effects of tilt condition and time x tilt interactions suggests that potential otolith effects on the variables we studied are relatively subtle and ephemeral, or that other mechanisms compensate {{for a lack of}} change in otolith input with orthostasis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlamethicin is a 19 -amino-acid residue {{hydrophobic}} peptide of the peptaibol {{family that has}} been the object of numerous studies for its ability to produce voltage-dependent ion channels in membranes. In this work, for the first time electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was applied to study the interaction of alamethicin with oriented bicelles. We highlighted the effects of increasing peptide concentrations on both the peptide and the membrane in identical conditions, by adopting a twofold spin labeling approach, placing a nitroxide moiety either on the peptide or on the phospholipids. The employment of bicelles affords additional spectral resolution, thanks to the formation of a macroscopically oriented phase that allows to gain information on alamethicin orientation and dynamics. Moreover, the high viscosity of the bicellar solution permits the investigation of the peptide aggregation properties at physiological temperature. We observed that, at 35 °C, alamethicin adopts a transmembrane orientation with the peptide axis forming an average angle of 25 ° with respect to the bilayer normal. Moreover, alamethicin maintains its dynamics and helical <b>tilt</b> <b>constant</b> at all concentrations studied. On the other hand, by increasing the peptide concentration, the bilayer experiences an exponential decrease of the order parameter, but does not undergo micellization, even at the highest peptide to lipid ratio studied (1 : 20). Finally, the aggregation of the peptide at physiological temperature shows that the peptide is monomeric at peptide to lipid ratios lower than 1 : 50, then it aggregates with a rather broad distribution in the number of peptides (from 6 to 8) per oligomer...|$|R
