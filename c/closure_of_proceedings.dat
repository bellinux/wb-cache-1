40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} openness in {{the common}} law tradition and considers how the underlying values of this vital principle should apply to restrictions on access to proceedings and publication bans {{in the era of}} the Charter. It argues that <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> trial <b>proceedings,</b> entirely or in part, should rarely be upheld under the Charter. The Criminal Code provision dealing with closure is unnecessarily broad and can only be applied constitutionally in a narrow range of circumstances. Publication bans also offend the principles of openness and publicity. Mandatory bans should not be found constitutional in the absence of compelling circumstances. Prior restraints cannot be justified as a matter of routine, and the government should be required to articulate compelling reasons in every case. Likewise, where identities are shielded from disclosure, the government must be required to give compelling reasons why the public cannot know the names of participants in the criminal justice process...|$|R

Ashcroft (2002), Keith, {{writing for}} a {{unanimous}} {{panel of the}} Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, found that absolute <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> deportation hearings in [...] "special interest" [...] cases was unconstitutional. Under the authorization of Attorney General John Ashcroft, Chief Immigration Judge Michael Creppy told all immigration judges to close {{to the public and}} media all hearings associated with immigration that were thought to be related to September 11 investigation. These cases were advised to be handled in seclusion, [...] "closed off from the public", and were held in special interest of national security. Officials terminated public records of the case and removed them from the court's docket. This rule of closed deportation hearings became known as the [...] "Creppy directive".Members of the press and public filed two of the cases challenging the Government's <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> removal <b>proceedings.</b> The plaintiffs in those cases are (1) the Detroit Free Press, Inc. and Herald Co., Inc.

(the “Detroit News plaintiffs”); the two are collectively the [...] "newspaper plaintiffs". The third case, filed by the ACLU of Michigan representing Rabih Haddad ("Haddad"), one of the men against whom the government had instituted removal proceedings stated that Haddad, a native of Lebanon, resided in Ann Arbor, Michigan, off and on since 1988. Haddadd came to the United States in 1998 on six-month tourist visas. On December 14, 2001, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) took Haddad into custody for overstaying his visa and initiated removal proceedings in Detroit before Immigration Judge Elizabeth Hacker.|$|R
