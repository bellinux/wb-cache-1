5|$|After {{a fire at}} Manchester City's Hyde Road {{ground in}} 1920, the club {{considered}} a move to the Belle Vue athletics stadium, but it was deemed too small. At the behest of Belle Vue director John Henry Iles and John Ayrton, Manchester Central, was formed, and played its home matches at the speedway stadium. One of Manchester Central's first matches at Belle Vue was a visit by FA <b>Cup</b> <b>holders</b> Blackburn Rovers in September 1928.

York won the Fourth Division championship with 101 points in 1983–84, becoming the first Football League team to achieve a three-figure points total in a season. In January 1985, York recorded a 1–0 home victory over First Division Arsenal in the fourth round of the 1984–85 FA Cup, courtesy of an 89th-minute penalty scored by Keith Houchen.

Their finish of seventh in the Third Division in 1985–86 marked the fifth consecutive season York had improved their end-of-season league ranking.|$|E
5|$|In the ODI tri-nation tournament against Australia and Zimbabwe that followed, Pathan was {{the leading}} wicket-taker with 16 wickets {{at an average of}} 31 in his maiden ODI series. After ending with 0/61 from ten overs on debut against Australia, he bounced back to take 3/64 and 3/51 in the next two matches against the World <b>Cup</b> <b>holders.</b> He earned his first {{international}} man of the match award in the tournament, after taking 4/24 against Zimbabwe at the WACA Ground in Perth in his eighth ODI. However, his tour ended on a bad note after he was reprimanded by match referees for mocking the Australian batsman Damien Martyn after his dismissal in the second final. In that match, he took 2/75 as Australia amassed 5/359 and crushed India by 208 runs. Pathan made 30 in the match as his team folded for only 151.

5|$|The {{draw for}} {{the third round of}} the FA Cup saw Manchester United take on <b>cup</b> <b>holders</b> Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in a repeat of the 1994 final.

Cole and Sheringham added to the rout, before Graeme Le Saux and Gianluca Vialli added three between them for Chelsea to keep the score a competitive one. Many journalists and fans regarded the win as United's best of the season. Another five goals were dished out against Division Two outfit Walsall, and in the fifth round they were placed alongside Premiership strugglers, Barnsley, whom they had ripped apart in October. An error by Schmeichel allowed Barnsley to take the lead but Sheringham equalised four minutes later. A replay was needed, much to the discomfort of Ferguson, and in a thrilling cup tie, United were knocked out, putting the ultimate treble dream – comprising the UEFA Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup – on hold for another season.|$|E

5|$|United played <b>cup</b> <b>holders</b> Arsenal in the semi-final at Villa Park on 11 April. Neither {{team was}} able to score even after extra time had been played, {{therefore}} the match was decided in a replay four days later. Beckham opened the scoring for United with a long range effort, but Dennis Bergkamp drew Arsenal level with a shot that deflected off United's centre back Jaap Stam. Arsenal then thought they had taken the lead when Nicolas Anelka put {{the ball in the}} back of United's net, but the goal was ruled out for offside. United's captain Roy Keane was red-carded for two bookable offences and United played the last thirty minutes of normal time with ten men. In injury time {{at the end of the}} second half, Phil Neville fouled Ray Parlour in the penalty area. Peter Schmeichel parried away Bergkamp's resultant spot kick and the game went into extra time.|$|E
5|$|BK Chicken Fries are a {{fried chicken}} product {{sold by the}} {{international}} fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At {{the time of their}} introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and convenience food markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive <b>cup</b> <b>holders.</b> The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.|$|E
5|$|Having left Mansfield, Boulding joined Division One side Grimsby Town on a free {{transfer}} in September 2001. His debut {{was as a}} second-half substitute in a 3–3 draw with Stockport County on 22 September 2001, before he scored his first Grimsby goal a week later away at Bradford City. Boulding was involved in Grimsby's League Cup upset, when they defeated <b>cup</b> <b>holders</b> Liverpool with a 2–1 extra-time victory, but they struggled in the league. Boulding {{was in and out}} of the starting eleven, but when he was recalled to the side for the visit of Crystal Palace on 2 March 2002 in place of Martin Pringle, who had broken his leg, Boulding scored in a 5–2 victory to ease their relegation worries. He scored again three days later in a defeat, and followed it up with the first hat-trick of his career in a 6–2 victory later the same month against Wimbledon, which moved them out of the relegation zone. Grimsby's survival was ensured before the end of the season, when they defeated Burnley 3–1, with two goals from Boulding. Boulding finished Grimsby's leading scorer for the 2001–02 season with 11goals in 39appearances, and with his one-year contract due to expire in the summer, he was offered a new contract by the club. Boulding, however, turned down the offer and instead joined Aston Villa in July 2002 on a Bosman free transfer.|$|E

5|$|In {{the quarter}} final Hearts faced another SPL side, St Mirren. Hearts conceded early on after a Graham Carey free-kick before Craig Beattie scored {{and then set}} up Rudi Skácel to put Hearts in front. Zaliukas then scored a late own goal after {{deflecting}} a Nigel Hasselbaink shot into his own net to level the match. In the replay at St Mirren Park, Carey had an early penalty saved, after a handball by Zaliukas, and Hasselbaink then scored a goal which was ruled out because the referee had not given St Mirren an advantage. Hearts then {{came back into the}} match as Hamill and Skácel scored to give Hearts a 2-0 win. In the semi-final at Hampden Park, Hearts were drawn against <b>cup</b> <b>holders</b> Celtic. Skácel scored shortly after half-time for Hearts before Gary Hooper scored a late equaliser for Celtic. Hearts were then awarded a stoppage-time penalty which former Celtic striker Beattie converted. There was controversy around both Hooper's goal and Beattie's penalty after the match as Hooper had looked offside when he scored his goal and Hearts' penalty was considered to have been wrongly awarded by the referee.|$|E
5|$|Winning six {{of their}} first eight matches in 1984–85, York were top of the Third Division by early October 1984. After a run of two wins from 11 matches, they slipped to 11th place in mid December 1984, though they {{continued}} to occupy a top half position before finishing the season in eighth place. In January 1985, York beat First Division team Arsenal 1–0 {{at home in the}} FA Cup fourth round, courtesty of a late penalty scored by Keith Houchen. They reached the fifth round for the third time and drew 1–1 at home to European <b>Cup</b> <b>holders</b> Liverpool. They lost 7–0 in the replay at Anfield—the club's record cup defeat. York started 1985–86 well and were second in the table by late November 1985, before a poor midseason spell saw them drop into midtable. After being unbeaten in the last nine matches, they finished seventh in the table, marking the fifth consecutive season in which York's end-of-season league placing improved. They reached the FA Cup fifth round for the second consecutive season, again drawing 1–1 at home to Liverpool, before losing 3–1 after extra time at Anfield. York made a strong start to 1986–87, and in late September 1986 they were in second place. They won only seven of their remaining 38 matches and needed a point from their last match to avoid the danger of relegation, which they achieved with a 1–1 draw against Notts County. York finished 1986–87 in 20th place.|$|E
