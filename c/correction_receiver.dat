40|$|The {{objective}} of this research can be categorised into the following aspects : (a) To present an extensive analysis on Internet Routing - Methods, Protocols, Internals, Issues and Trends. (b) To develop an efficient minimal cut set algorithm in order to extract the minimal paths between any source and destination links in a web link network and use this approach for graphical design of web link structures. © To explore optimal web surfing by improvising the classical routing algorithms using fuzzy distance measurers. (d) To present a comprehensive survey of Internet multimedia protocols such as RTP, RTCP, RTSP and TFRCP, and to analyse the performances of SIP and H. 323 for signaling and control of Internet telephony, RSVP and YESSIR for resource reservation in the Internet. (e) To analyse the problems of video streaming over the Internet and to develop qualitative solution models with regard to video streaming based on two architectures (RTP/RTCP and TCP/UDP/IP) and (f) To attain global optimisation through end-to-end congestion control for Internet Routing {{and to develop a}} modified congestion control algorithm for routers in the Internet. In order to study and analyse the internal organisation of links in a web site, a recursive algorithm is used to extract all the links in a specific web-site and link connectivity is represented as a tree structure using graphs and logic gates. Minimal cut sets are extracted to minimise the number of clicks while surfing from the source page to the destination page, that is, to find the minimal path between them. Identifying the presence of minimal cut sets in a web link network positively enhances the reliability and security of the web site. An efficient minimal cut set algorithm is developed to extract the minimal paths between any source and destination links in a web link network. The proposed algorithm is tested on a link tree and the minimal cut sets are obtained. And this approach is found to be effective for the reliability and security of a web site. To explore optimal web surfing (shortest path routing), fuzzy simulation of routing algorithms for finding the optimal path set of links to a target web site in a web link network is implemented. Fuzzy distance measures are derived from the subjective estimation of each link in a web link network by different users with regard to the retrieval rate. Classical routing algorithms (Floyd-Warshall's, Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford's) are extended using fuzzy hamming distance to explore optimal web surfing. Fuzzy Hurwicz rule is taken into account in establishing the optimistic and pessimistic view of different users for various path sets in the web link network. An optimal surfing path is estimated in a web link network using the implemented fuzzy distance based routing algorithms. A range of protocols are certainly necessary to provide streaming multimedia across the Internet. These protocols include mechanisms for data transfer (RTP), resource reservation (RSVP), session setup for specific applications (SDP, SAP), media-on-demand, control of stored and live multimedia (RTSP), Internet telephony, multimedia conference session initiation, call control (SIP), quality-of-service monitoring (RTCP) and congestion control for time-sensitive multimedia data streams (TFRCP). An extensive survey of Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP), Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) and TCP-friendly Rate Control Protocol (TFRCP) are presented. The performances of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and H. 323 standards for signaling and control for internet telephony, Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) and Yet another Sender Session Internet Reservations (YESSIR) for resource reservation in the Internet have been analysed and compared. Based on the performances of the above protocols, certain improvements are suggested for efficient transfer of real-time continuous media data. The problems of video streaming over the Internet I. e., transferring a video file over an Internetwork effectively without the loss of video data is studied and analysed. Video Streaming architectures based on RTP/RTCP and TCP/UDP/IP are analysed and comparisons have been made about real time video streaming applications. Possible qualitative solutions for the improvement of Video Streaming over an Internet. Environment is developed based on key components such as multicast capability, real time data transport, assured QoS, retransmission, forward error <b>correction,</b> <b>receiver</b> buffering and adaptation. In order to address the steady rise of packet loss rates in real time media streaming, two important destination based congestion control algorithms in packet switched networks are examined. They are Random Early detection (RED) algorithm and modified approach called Derivative Random Drop (DRD) algorithm. The original RED algorithm presents two variants of RED namely RED_VAR- 1 and RED-VAR- 2. A new proposal has been made for the RED algorithm with two more different variants called as RED-VAR- 3 and RED-VAR- 4. The performances and the result of all RED variants have been presented.

[...] Broadcasters of the required power generally cluster around larger cities, making such DGPS systems less useful for wide-area navigation. Additionally, most radio signals are either line-of-sight, or can be distorted by the ground, which made DGPS difficult to use as a precision approach system or when flying low for other reasons.|$|R

500|$|The {{broadcast}} media industry is {{at a critical}} turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is {{made possible by the}} production of cheaper, faster and more capable integrated circuits. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as snowy pictures, ghosting and other distortion. These occur {{because of the nature of}} analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [...] and received with signal amplitudes [...] it would still decode to the binary message 1011 — a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using forward error <b>correction</b> a <b>receiver</b> can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.|$|R

However, the accuracy of such a method requires physical discontinuities to be matched by mesh interfaces. In many realistic earth models, the design of such a mesh is difficult and quite ineffective in terms of numerical cost. In this paper, we address a limited aspect of this problem: an earth model with a thin shallow layer below the free surface in which the elastic and density properties {{are different from the}} rest of the medium and in which rapid vertical variations are allowed. We only consider here smooth lateral variations of the thickness and elastic properties of the shallow layer. In the limit of a shallow layer thickness very small compared to the smallest wavelength of the wavefield, by resorting to a second order matching asymptotic approximation, the thin layer can be replaced by a vertically smooth effective medium without discontinuities together with a specific Dirichlet to Neumann (DtN) surface boundary condition. Such a formulation allows to accurately take into account complex thin shallow structures within the SEM without the classical mesh design and time step constraints. <b>Corrections</b> at <b>receivers</b> and source—when the source is located within the thin shallow layer—have been also derived.

The results were compared to the coordinates by the conventional method by using total station. The results showed a complex structure as the accuracy differs from one component to another such as in horizontal coordinates, Y components by CorsTR_VRS and Cors_TR_ FKP showed 'best' results while the same technique provided X components consistent accuracy with the Y component but less accurate than by real time kinematic (RTK). In vertical components, of all the techniques used for the h components, CorsTR_VRS showed 'best' accuracy with three outliers...|$|R
