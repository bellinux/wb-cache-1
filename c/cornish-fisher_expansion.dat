40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{technique}} for estimating steady-state quantiles from discrete-event simu-lation models, with particular {{attention paid to}} cycle-time quantiles of manufacturing systems. The technique is justified through an extensive empirical study and supported with mathematical analysis. The <b>Cornish-Fisher</b> <b>expansion</b> {{is used as a}} basis for this estimation, and it is shown that for an M/M/ 1 system, a system of 5 tandem M/M/ 1 queues, and a full factory simulation model, the technique provides precise, accurate estimates for the most commonly estimated quantiles with minimal data storage. The performance of the <b>Cornish-Fisher</b> <b>expansion</b> is compared to both tra-ditional direct quantile estimation using order statistics and indirect quantile estimates obtained from four-parameter distributions. Based on these evaluations, the <b>Cornish-Fisher</b> <b>expansion</b> is found to be the most appealing quantile estimation technique of the three approaches because it provides accurate results for a variety of systems and has the advantages of being easy to implement and having extremely low data-storage requirements. It also provides the capability for estimating all quantiles of a given random variable from a single set of multiple replications at a given design point, negating the need to know in advance which quantile estimates are desired. ...|$|E
40|$|Consider {{a testing}} {{problem for the}} null {{hypothesis}} H 0 : θ ∈ Θ 0. The standard frequentist practice is to reject the null hypothesis when the P-value is smaller than a threshold value α, usually 0. 05. We ask the question {{how many of the}} null hypotheses a frequentist rejects are actually true. Precisely, we look at the Bayesian false discovery rate Pg(θ ∈ Θ 0 |P − value < α) under a proper prior density g(θ). This depends on the prior g, the sample size n, the threshold value α as well as the choice of the test statistic. For one-sided null hypotheses, we derive a third order asymptotic expansion for the Bayesian false discovery rate in the continuous exponential family when the test statistic is the MLE and in the location family when the test statistic is the sample median. We also briefly mention the expansion in the uniform family when the test statistic is the MLE. The expansions are derived by putting together Edgeworth expansions for the CDF, <b>Cornish-Fisher</b> <b>expansions</b> for the quantile function and various Taylor expansions. Numerical results show that the expansions are very accurate even for a small value of n (e. g., n = 10).

We characterize the linear transformations which preserve exchangeability, distinguishing second-moment exchangeability and global exchangeability; we also examine non-linear transformations. When exchangeability does not hold one may {{try to find a}} transformation which achieves approximate exchangeability; then an approximate permutation test can be done. More specifically, consider a statistic T = b. phis(Y); {{it may be possible to}} find V such that &Ytilde = V (Y) is exchangeable and to write T = b. phis¯((Y) macr). In other cases we may be content that (Y) tilde has an exchangeable variance matrix, which we denote second-moment exchangeability. When seeking transformations towards exchangeability we show the privileged role of residuals. We show that exact permutation tests can be constructed for the normal linear model. Finally we suggest approximate permutation tests based on second-moment exchangeability. In the case of an intraclass correlation model, the transformation is simple to implement.
