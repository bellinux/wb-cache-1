The tube is often cooled either by {{compressed}} air (<10 kW) or cooling water. While the transparency of quartz tube is demanded in many laboratory applications (such as spectrum diagnostic), its relatively poor mechanical and thermal properties pose a risk to other parts (e.g., o-ring seals) that may be damaged under the intense radiation of high-temperature plasma. These constraints limit the use of quartz tubes to low power torches only (<30 kW). For industrial, high power plasma applications (30~250 kW), tubes made of ceramic materials are typically used. The ideal candidate material will possess good thermal conductivity and excellent thermal shock resistance. For the time being, silicon nitride (Si3N4) is the first choice.

In {{order to reduce the}} ignition voltage of an RF plasma torch with a metallic <b>confinement</b> <b>tube</b> the E–H mode transition was studied. A spark generator was used to initiate an arc and the E–H mode transition of the plasma was then filmed using a high-speed camera.

Our study focuses on contact pressures of around 100 [*]MPa and sliding velocities of around 10 [*]m/s. Explosives are brittle materials which fracture when submitted to such pressures in uniaxial compression. They have therefore to be confined to avoid any fracture during the tests. A new Hopkinson bar device which simultaneously enables to confine a sample and rub it on steel has therefore been designed. This device is composed of two coaxial transmission bars. It consists in a cylindrical sample confined in a steel tube, the cylindrical sample being inserted between the incident bar and the internal transmission bar, and the <b>confinement</b> <b>tube</b> being leant against the external transmission bar. The high impedance of the external transmission bar keeps the <b>confinement</b> <b>tube</b> quasi-motionless whereas the impedance of the internal transmission bar is calculated to reach the desired pressure and the desired velocity at the tube–sample interface.

40|$|Concrete-filled-steel-tube (CFST) columns {{are widely}} adopted in many {{structures}} nowadays {{attributed to the}} superior behaviour developed by the composite action. However, the composite action cannot be fully developed because of different dilation properties of steel tube and concrete in the elastic stage. Moreover, due to the inelastic outward buckling of steel tube, CFST columns may suffer serious degradation. To overcome these problems, external confinement, such as rings, ties, spirals and FRP wraps have been studied recently and proven experimentally to have potential in improving the uni-axial behaviour of CFST columns. In this paper, an experimental database containing 422 uni-axial compression test results of unconfined and externally confined CFST columns has been assembled. In addition, a theoretical model has been proposed for predicting the uni-axial behaviour of circular CFST columns. This model consists of mainly three components: (1) Constitutive model of confined concrete modified from Attard and Setunge’s actively confined concrete model. (2) Constitutive model of steel tube under complex stress-state using Prandtl-Reuss theory.

40|$|We {{employ a}} first principles, force-level {{approach}} to self-consistently construct the anharmonic <b>tube</b> <b>confinement</b> field for entangled fluids of rigid needles and for primitive-path (PP) level chains in two limiting situations where chain stretching {{is assumed to}} either completely relax or remain unrelaxed. The influence of shear and extensional deformation and polymer orientation is determined in a nonlinear elastic limit where dissipative relaxation processes are intentionally neglected. For needles and PP-level chains, a Gaussian analysis of transverse polymer dynamical fluctuations predicts that deformation-induced orientation leads to tube dilation. In contrast, for deformed polymers in which chain stretch does not relax we find tube compression. For all three systems, a finite maximum transverse entanglement force localizing the polymers in effective tubes is predicted. The conditions when this entanglement force can be overcome (a force imbalance) by an externally applied force associated with macroscopic deformation can be crisply defined in the nonlinear elastic limit, {{and the possibility of}} a "microscopic absolute yielding" event destroying the <b>tube</b> <b>confinement</b> can be analyzed. For needles and contour-relaxed PP chains, this force imbalance is found to occur at a stress of order the equilibrium shear modulus and thus a strain of order unity, corresponding to a mechanically fragile entanglement tube field. However, for unrelaxed stretched chains, tube compression stabilizes transverse polymer confinement, and {{there appears to be no}} force imbalance. These results collectively suggest that the crossover from elastic to irreversible viscous response requires chain retraction to initiate disentanglement.
