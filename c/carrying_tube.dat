40|$|Two coiled tube {{reactors}} {{were designed}} to investigate the influence of Reynolds number (Re) and diameter of fluid <b>carrying</b> <b>tube</b> on UV-C inactivation of Escherichia coli W 1485 and Bacillus cereus endospores in raw cow milk (RCM) and skimmed cow milk (SCM) at room temperature. UV reactors were constructed using perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) tubing having internal diameters of 1. 6 and 3. 2 mm and each had a residence time of 11. 3 s. Four levels of Re were tested for each milk type, each tube size and each bacteria type. Inactivation efficiency increased as the Re increased in both the reactors for both types of milk. The inactivation of both bacteria was higher in the 1. 6 mm UV reactor than the 3. 2 mm UV reactor. Maximum reduction of 7. 8 log 10 CFU/ml of E. coli was achieved in SCM in the 1. 6 mm UV reactor corresponding to the Re of 532 and higher, whereas the maximum reduction of E. coli in RCM was 4. 1 log 10 CFU/ml {{at the highest level}} of Re (713) tested. For B. cereus, the maximum reduction was 2. 72 log 10 CFU/ml in 1. 6 UV reactor, in SCM at Re of 1024; whereas the maximum reduction of B. cereus in RCM was 2. 65 log 10 CFU/ml at Re value of 713. Inactivation efficiency of both bacteria was more in SCM than RCM. The coiled tube reactor design provided adequate mixing and UV-C dosage for efficient disinfection of E. coli cells in milk...|$|E

30|$|Of the 250 oral rinse samples collected, 204 (81.6 %) {{yielded a}} yeast growth on culture. When the germ tube test was {{conducted}} 167 (81.8 %) {{of the latter}} cohort were <b>carrying</b> germ <b>tube</b> positive yeasts, and the remainder germ tube negative yeasts.

40|$|A {{mechanism}} that blocks concentrated sunlight from reaching a receiver, {{in the event}} of a tracking failure or loss of coolant is described. Sunlight is normally concentrated by a dish reflector onto the opening of a receiver. A faceplate surrounds the opening, and coolant <b>carrying</b> <b>tubes,</b> line the receiver. If the concentrated sunlight wanders so it begins to fall on the faceplate, then the sunlight will melt a portion of a fuse wire portion will break. The wire is attached to a flange on a shutter frame, and breaking of the fuse wire allows the frame to fall. Normally, the shutter frame supports shutter elements that are held open by cam followers that bear against cams...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a method for}} designing 5300 A gas cooled electrical leads for the g- 2 solenoids and 2850 A leads for the g- 2 self shielded inflector dipole magnet. Empirical design equations for annular tube gas cooled leads are presented. The leads are bundled tube leads which are cooled by helium flowing in annular cooling passages between tubes. Each tube in the bundle consists of nested circular copper tubes that can be cooled on both sides. Multiple current <b>carrying</b> <b>tubes</b> will increase the lead current capacity and cooling the tubes on both sides will increase lead efficiency for a given helium flow pressure drop. The design method presented here can applied to leads made {{from a variety of}} materials...|$|R

40|$|A solar {{water heating}} system for {{domestic}} use {{has been designed}} and constructed using locally available materials. Solar energy is received by a ﬂat-plate collector consisting of a thin absorber plate, integrated with underneath grids of ﬂuid <b>carrying</b> <b>tubes,</b> and placed in an insulated casing with a transparent glass cover having a cold and a hot water tank integrated in the system. The radiation emitted by the absorber plate cannot escape through the glass, thus increasing its temperature. The water gets heated and ﬂows into a storage tank through thermosyphon principle. Maximum ﬂuid output temperature, the collector temperature, and insolation of 55 °C, 51 °C, and 1, 480 W/m 2, respectively, were obtained on a sunny day.

40|$|International audienceHeat {{loss from}} {{rotating}} kilns {{may represent a}} significant percentage of the total energy input especially in highly energy-intensive industrial sectors such as cement production. As an alternative to traditional energy recovery methods, the possibility of recovering radiant heat lost through the kiln surface has been proposed in the literature. This may be accomplished by surrounding the kiln with a secondary external shell acting as a heat exchanger for a transfer fluid. In this work a mathematical model for sizing and performance estimation of a heat exchanger recovering waste heat from the external surface of rotating kilns is developed. The equipment has been configured as an array of pressurized water <b>carrying</b> <b>tubes</b> arranged in a longitudinal pattern on the surface of a cylindrical outer shell coaxial with the rotary kiln. An example of model application is utilized to discuss the involved heat transfer process and its impact on equipment design. An economic model has also been developed to determine the optimal size of the equipment...|$|R
