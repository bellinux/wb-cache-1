5|$|The American Red Cross ran out {{of funds}} while {{responding}} {{to the effects of}} Juan and the mid-Atlantic flooding, following the previous responses to hurricanes Elena and Gloria, as well as flooding in Puerto Rico; this prompted an emergency fundraising appeal. The agency had provided about $8million worth of assistance to families in southern Louisiana. Along the Apalachicola Bay, the series of hurricane strikes severely damaged the local oyster industry, leaving hundreds of oystermen out of work. The high waves caused by Juan prompted the United States Minerals Management Service to recommend increased inspections on older rigs and improve evacuation plans. Hurricane Juan was one in a series of hurricanes that struck Louisiana coast over many years that contributed to the loss of the <b>coastal</b> <b>wetlands.</b>|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is a habitat generalist {{as it is}} {{associated}} with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and <b>coastal</b> <b>wetlands</b> throughout northeastern America, including brackish marshes, estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by speckled alder. It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps. Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the American black duck mostly inhabits brackish marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and riverine areas. Ducks usually take shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to brackish and fresh impoundments on conservation land.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay <b>Coastal</b> <b>Wetlands</b> Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E

5|$|Daspletosaurus {{lived in}} a vast {{floodplain}} along the western shore of the interior seaway. Large rivers watered the land, occasionally flooding and blanketing the region with new sediment. When water was plentiful, the region could support {{a great deal of}} plant and animal life, but periodic droughts also struck the region, resulting in mass mortality as preserved in the many bonebed deposits found in Two Medicine and Judith River sediments, including the Daspletosaurus bonebed. Similar conditions exist today in East Africa. Volcanic eruptions from the west periodically blanketed the region with ash, also resulting in large-scale mortality, while simultaneously enriching the soil for future plant growth. It is these ash beds that allow precise radiometric dating as well. Fluctuating sea levels also resulted in a variety of other environments at different times and places within the Judith River Group, including offshore and nearshore marine habitats, <b>coastal</b> <b>wetlands,</b> deltas and lagoons, in addition to the inland floodplains. The Two Medicine Formation was deposited at higher elevations farther inland than the other two formations.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} Oryzomys extends from New Jersey {{in the eastern}} United States through Mexico and Central America south to northwestern Colombia and east to northwestern Venezuela and Curaçao. Species of Oryzomys usually live in wet {{habitats}} such as marshes, streams, and mangroves, but both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi are also occasionally encountered in drier habitats. They occur or occurred on many continental-shelf islands and one oceanic island, Jamaica; their adeptness at colonizing islands {{may be caused by}} their close association with water and frequent occurrence in <b>coastal</b> <b>wetlands.</b> The oldest fossils date to the Rancholabrean of the United States, about 300,000 years ago; although there have been some earlier North American records, those are not in fact referable to Oryzomys or even Oryzomyini. Oryzomyines likely evolved in South America east of the Andes; the presence of Oryzomys in Central America and other trans-Andean regions is thought {{to be the result of}} one of several independent invasions of this region by oryzomyines. Alternatively, Oryzomys may have evolved from the Pliocene North American Jacobsomys. O.antillarum may have reached Jamaica during the last glacial period while sea levels were low.|$|E

40|$|Great {{changes of}} <b>coastal</b> <b>wetland</b> in Pearl River Estuary have taken placed since 1970 s. To {{investigate}} the {{spatial and temporal}} variations of <b>coastal</b> <b>wetland</b> in Pearl River Estuary, Landsat-MSS images in 1975 and Landsat-TM images in 1995 & 2005 were processed, and a wetland database of these three periods was established based on these satellite images. Since the changes of <b>coastal</b> <b>wetland</b> had significant relationship with coastline changes, a model for coastline changes detection was established. By means of GIS and RS, temporal and spatial changes of <b>coastal</b> <b>wetland</b> in Pear River Estuary were studied in this work. The result showed that: (1) During period of 1975 ∼ 1995, <b>coastal</b> <b>wetland</b> area decreased by 3. 3 %, and decreased by 18. 3 % during 1995 ∼ 2005; (2) Among 6 administrative districts of the study area, wetland dynamic degree could be sorted in a descending order as: Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Macao, Dongguan, Zhongshan and Guangzhou; (3) The centroids of wetland in Pearl River Estuary coastal zone moved 0. 6 km in the north direction during 1975 ∼ 1995, and 6. 1 km in the southeast direction during 1995 ∼ 2005; (4) Due to the changes of coastlines in Pearl River Estuary, the area of sea reclamation during 1975 ∼ 2005 in Zhuhai, Macao, Zhongshan, Guangzhou Dongguan, Shenzhen was 12439. 29, 502. 60, 2946. 45, 5372. 21, 1815. 96 and 6317. 88 hectares respectively; (5) Average distance of coastline changes during 1975 ∼ 2005 was 651. 2 m in Zhuhai, 187. 1 m in Macao, 1304. 7 m in Zhongshan, 802. 8 m in Guangzhou, 193. 3 m in Dongguan and 523. 1 m in Shenzhen.

25|$|Wetlands {{in general}} are a {{valuable}} resource both economically and environmentally. For instance, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined wetlands covered only 5% of the land surface of the contiguous 48 United States, but they support 31% of the nation's plant species. These very biodiverse systems provide resources, shelter, nesting sites, and resting sites (particularly Louisiana’s <b>coastal</b> <b>wetlands</b> such as Grand Isle for migratory birds) to {{a wide array of}} wildlife. Human users also receive many benefits from wetlands, such as cleaner water, storm surge protection, oil and gas resources (especially on the Gulf Coast), reduced flooding, and chemical and biological waste reduction, to name a few.

25|$|In 1998, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) {{conducted}} the first Louisiana coast-wide survey, which {{was funded by}} the <b>Coastal</b> <b>Wetlands</b> Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act and titled the Nutria Harvest and Wetland Demonstration Program, to evaluate the condition of the marshlands. The survey revealed through aerial surveys of transects that herbivory damage to wetlands totaled roughly 90,000 acres. The next year, LDWF performed the same survey and found the area damaged by herbivory increased to about 105,000 acres. The LDWF has determined the wetlands affected by nutria decreased from an estimated 80,000+ acres of Louisiana wetlands in 2002-2003 season to about 6,296 acres during the 2010-2011 season. The LDWF stresses that coastal wetland restoration projects will be greatly hindered without effective, sustainable nutria population control.|$|E
25|$|Artificial levees block spring {{flood water}} {{that would bring}} fresh water and {{sediment}} to marshes. Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland. Canals dug for {{the oil and gas}} industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear. And as the communities disappear, more and more people are leaving the region. Since the <b>coastal</b> <b>wetlands</b> support an economically important coastal fishery, the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry.|$|E

MethodsEight different production media were used to isolate actinomycetes from different stations of marine soil sediments in Yalujiang <b>coastal</b> <b>wetland</b> and the genotypic positions were established by 16 S rDNA. ResultsA total of 172 actinomycetal isolates were obtained from 13 samples using five media. The most effective culture media in the isolation of actinobacteria were Gause's Synthetic agar and Starch-casein agar. Among 172 isolates, 46 isolates (26. 74 %) showed antibacterial activity, 70. 93 % belonged to the genus Streptomyces, others were Micromonospora spp. and Rhodococcus spp. Out of the 46 isolates, two cultures were further supported by morphological characterization analysis.

The new-born <b>coastal</b> <b>wetland</b> was formed in 1996, without any effects of human activities since then. Plant communities composed by herbaceous plants and few woody plants characterized the zonal distribution from the river to the sea. The herbaceous plants emerged from the river bank or the sea beach to the inner upland, while the woody plants changed with opposite trends. Most plants near the river were not halotolerant, while plants near the sea were mainly halophytes. Species richness and Shannon-Wiener index coincided with this similar trend. Species diversity in the upland was larger than that near the river or the sea. The upstream seed bank was responsible for vegetation species.
