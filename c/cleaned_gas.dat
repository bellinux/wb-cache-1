40|$|Heat {{demand in}} the Netherlands is {{responsible}} for 38 % of primary energy use and almost half of it (49 %) {{is used in the}} built environment. The EU goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 - 95 % below 1990 levels by 2050 will impose large changes is the used space heating technology of households. The energy demand mix for space heating in the built environment will therefore change. An agent based model has been created to model the behaviour of home owners and their decision for a space heating technology. It was assumed that a space heating energy demand mix with electricity as dominant energy carrier will impose great challenges on the grid with large costs, costs that exponentially enlarge with higher demand from relatively low prices now. <b>Clean</b> <b>gas,</b> an overarching term for biogas, a mix of hydrogen and other CO 2 neutral gasses, distributed via the existing natural gas network, could lower the overall system cost for space heating as <b>clean</b> <b>gas</b> costs are assumed to go exponentially down from a high start price now. As the network can only distribute one kind of gas, this distribution is only possible when home owners decide together to use <b>clean</b> <b>gas.</b> Especially the interaction between agents possibly forming a collective incentive to switch to <b>clean</b> <b>gas</b> has been investigated to see if a gaseous energy carrier can be a sustainable energy carrier in the energy mix. The results show that a collective incentive can arise and a gaseous energy carrier can be sustainable if the price difference between <b>clean</b> <b>gas</b> and electricity is kept small.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Raw gas is cooled in a commercial heat exchanger (1) by cold, clean, gas coming from a refrigerator (2). The temperature of the clean gas in the heat exchanger is controlled by a controller (4) by its temperature at entry by bypassing warm, clean, gas to mix with that from the refrigerator. If necessary, additional heat can be obtained through a heat exchange with the warm air from the condenser of the refrigerator. About 66 % of moisture is removed in the pre-cooler at a temperature of 1 - 17 deg. C. The remainder is removed in the refrigerator, where the gas is cooled to - 40 deg. C.

40|$|The {{utilisation}} {{of energy}} in waste, Waste to Energy (WtE), has become increasingly important. Waste is a wide concept, and to focus, the feedstock dealt with here is mostly municipal solid waste. It is found that combustion in grate-fired furnaces {{is by far the}} most common mode of fuel conversion compared to fluidized beds and rotary furnaces. Combinations of pyrolysis in rotary furnace or gasification in fluidized or fixed bed with high-temperature combustion are applied particularly in Japan in systems whose purpose is to melt ashes and destroy dioxins. Recently, also in Japan more emphasis is put on WtE. In countries with high heat demand, WtE in the form of heat and power can be quite efficient even in simple grate-fired systems, whereas in warm regions only electricity is generated, and for this product the efficiency of boilers (the steam data) is limited by corrosion from the flue gas. However, combination of <b>cleaned</b> <b>gas</b> from gasification with combustion provides a means to enhance the efficiency of electricity production considerably.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Fibrous filter materials are used to remove fine aerosol particles from gases at as low a pressure drop as possible, while achieving the desired quality of <b>cleaned</b> <b>gas.</b> High aerosol removal efficiency at low pressure drop can be achieved if the filter fibres carry an electric charge, allowing aerosol to be collected by additional electrostatic mechanisms. Unfortunately the efficiency of such materials is reduced as they are loaded with aerosol. Prefilter materials can also achieve very high efficiencies, but {{at the expense of}} greater pressure drop, and filter cakes, which have very high pressure drops, form on such materials at low aerosol particle loads. Producing a fibrous filter from both types of material, a composite, allows efficient aerosol collection at low pressure drop, and high dust holding capacity. This work reports on an experimental program studying the aerosol particle penetration through, and pressure drop across a mixed fibre type electrically active material, and a number of prefilter materials of differing packing density, as they are loaded with aerosol particles. The effects of aerosol particle size, aerosol particle charge, aerosol composition, filter face velocity, filter fibre charge, and relative humidity have been studied.

40|$|An Electrostatic {{precipitator}} is a large, {{industrial emission}} control unit, {{which is designed}} to trap and remove dust particles from the exhaust gas stream of an industrial process. Precipitators are used in industries like Power, Electric, Cement, Chemicals, Metals and Paper industries. In many industrial plants, particulate matter created in the industrial process is carried as dust in the hot exhaust gases. These dust-laden gases pass through an Electrostatic precipitator that collects most of the dust. <b>Cleaned</b> <b>gas</b> then passes out of the precipitator and through a stack to the atmosphere. Precipitators typically collect 99. 9 % or more of the dust from the gas stream.

Glass spheres with mean diameter of 77 µm were used to represent the solid phase, while the carrier phase has a working Reynolds number of Re= 1. 0 × 105 (bulk velocity Uo= 10 m/s).

The focus of much current work being performed by the Department of Energy on sorbent development is in the use of zinc ferrite, zinc titanate, and Z-Sorb. The latter sorbent is a commercial product consisting of ZnO, a promoter, and a proprietary supporting matrix designed to provide stability and prolong sorbent life. Although these Zn-based sorbents {{have been the subject of}} extensive pilot-scale and process development work, all sorbents produced to date still experience structural and reactive degradation over multi-cycle use at relatively moderate temperatures. An effective alternative to zinc-based sorbents could be manganese sorbents which withstand high temperature operation and also maintain structural and reactive integrity over many cycles, as investigations by Ben-Slimane and Hepworth have indicated. Thermodynamic limits may prevent MnO from achieving the low sulfur specifications of the product gas for use in a molten carbonate fuel cell, but under the correct conditions the guideline for IGCC systems can easily be achieved. Furthermore, manganese sorbents could possibly be used in conjunction with a polishing sorbent (such as zinc oxide) possessing more favorable thermodynamic properties to reach levels acceptable for fuel cell applications (< 10 ppmv).

Solids enter the system at 80 % (wt) water content from an upstream centrifuge. The solids are dried in a direct-contact dryer where hot gases recycled from the syngas cooler and engine exhaust provide heat to evaporate water, drying the solids to 10 % (wt) water content. Dried solids are briquetted and fed to the gasifier where they undergo a series of reactions (drying, pyrolysis, combustion, gasification). Air is introduced to the gasifier to combust {{a portion of the}} fuel, providing heat for the reactions. The quantity of air is determined dynamically by burning only the minimum amount of fuel solids to satisfy the gasifier energy balance. The syngas produced in the gasifier is cooled from the gasifier temperature of 850 ºC to 150 ºC by air in a heat exchanger. Cool syngas is cleaned by a bag filter (which is not modeled in detail) and a wet scrubber to filter particulates and condense tars.

This material was tested in a single bubbling bed reactor previously developed for studies involving catalytic tar reforming. The bed of feldspar was fluidized with raw gas. The material was tested at three temperatures: 700 C, 800 C, and 900 C. The results indicate that alkali-feldspar shows: (1) a high potential for the Water–Gas Shift reaction even at low temperature (H 2 /CO 3); (2) no reduction of the methane content in the <b>cleaned</b> <b>gas</b> and net formation of methane at 900 C; (3) the elimination of most C 2 H 2 and C 3 H 6 already at 800 C; and (4) a striking tar selectivity, {{which resulted in the}} reformed gas having exclusively pure ring-compounds.
