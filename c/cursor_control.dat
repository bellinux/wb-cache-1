50|$|Num Lock or Numeric Lock (⇭) {{is a key}} on the numeric keypad of most {{computer}} keyboards. It is a lock key, like Caps Lock and Scroll Lock. Its state (on or off) {{affects the}} function {{of some of the}} keys, and is commonly displayed by an LED built into the keyboard.The Num Lock key exists because earlier 84-key IBM PC keyboards did not have <b>cursor</b> <b>control</b> or arrows separate from the numeric keypad. Most earlier computer keyboards had separate number keys and <b>cursor</b> <b>control</b> keys; however, to reduce cost, IBM chose to combine the two in their early PC keyboards. Num Lock would be used to choose between the two functions. On some laptop computers, the Num Lock key is used to convert part of the main keyboard to act as a (slightly skewed) numeric keypad rather than letters. On some laptop computers, the Num Lock key is absent and replaced by the use of a key combination.|$|E
