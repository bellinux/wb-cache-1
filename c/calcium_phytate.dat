A reason that modified <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate</b> treatment was better than pure aqueous <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate</b> is that relatively fewer copper ions were released during the treatment due to its lower water content. The modified <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate</b> followed by calcium hydrogen carbonate treatment caused even more degradation, presumably due to a prolonged treatment time with water-based solution, which led to more migration of copper ions but limited benefit from deacidification, as discussed previously.|$|E

The authors aimed to study the vitamin D status and dietary intake of <b>calcium</b> and <b>phytates</b> in healthy adult volunteers from a city {{in the western part of}} India. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care centre inwestern India. A total of 1137 young (age: 25 e 35 years), healthy volunteers of both sexeswere included in the study. All subjects were assessed for sun exposure, dietary intake of energy, protein, fat, <b>calcium</b> and <b>phytates.</b> Biochemical investigations included calcium, inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), total proteins, albumin and creatinine in serum and spot urinary calcium to creatinine ratio. Results The serum 25 (OH) D concentration for the whole study population was low (17. 469. 1 ng/ml), and that for men and women were 18. 968. 9 ng/ml and 15. 869. 1 ng/ml, respectively. Seventy per cent of the study population had hypovitaminosis D (25 (OH) D < 20 ng/ml) with a slightly higher prevalence in women (76 %). Mean dietary calcium intake of the study population was 322. 926135. 17 mg/day and was very low when compared with the recommended dietary allowance (400 mg/day for adults of both sexes) issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research. Dietary phytate was much higher than calcium intake with a dietary <b>phytate</b> to <b>calcium</b> ratio of 2. 2560. 76.

Study of marine microbial biodiversity is of vital importance for the understanding of the different processes of the ocean, which may present potent novel microorganisms for screening of bioactive compounds. As the microbial communities have a complex ecosystem processes, biodiversity study explore the distribution and roles in the habitat, estimation of microbial diversity is required for understanding the biogeography, community assembly and ecological processes. To investigate the biodiversity of bacteria of Baluchistan coast, a total of 100 attached and free-living bacteria were isolated. Bacterial strains were identified by studying Gram reaction, cellular and colonial morphology biochemical reactions and. by QTS- 24 (quick test strip) and confirmation of three selected strains was carried out by 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Out of the 100 bacterial isolates 81 were identified as Gram-negative and 19 were Gram positive. A remarkable percentage of isolated strains showed resistance against antibiotics and metals. All of the 100 bacterial strains were analyzed for their ability to hydrolyze <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate.</b> Fifteen percent of the strains hydrolyzed <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate</b> on solid media and four strains showed hydrolysis of <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate</b> both on solid and liquid media. The strains which showed release of soluble phosphate as a result of hydrolysis of <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate</b> were selected for bioremediation of lanthanum nitrate from aqueous solution. A bioreactor was constructed using biofilm of mix culture of phytate hydrolysing strains (CMGI 00 l and CMGI 083).

40|$|The {{properties}} of soymilk, which prepared from soybeans of six varieties having different subunit composition, were studied. Soymilk 2 ̆ 7 s protein particles were fractionated in size by differential centrifugation. The particles {{of more than}} 100 nm, 100 - 40 nm, and less than 40 nm in diameter were obtained as large protein particles (LP), medium protein particles (MP), and supernatant protein (SP), respectively. The LP content in all raw soymilks decreased and the MP content increased by heating, but the MP content in soymilk prepared from GILM (7 S rich) did not increase so much by heating. When calcium chloride {{was added to the}} soymilks, the protein solubilities of the soymilk from Karikei 434 (11 S rich) decreased sharply between 6 and 8 mM calcium chloride, while that from GILM decreased sharply between 10 and 12 mM. The concentration of magnesium chloride, which began to decrease the protein solubilities, was similar to that of calcium chloride. But a decreasing slope of the protein solubilities by magnesium chloride was gentler than that by calcium chloride. The precipitation pH of protein by magnesium chloride was 0. 1 pH higher than that by <b>calcium</b> chloride. <b>Phytate</b> in the soymilks accelerated a pH-decrease on the addition of calcium chloride. These results suggest that higher calcium and magnesium concentrations are required for the 7 S globulin rich-soymilk coagulation than for normal soymilk coagulation, and that the pH decrease by the addition of <b>calcium</b> in <b>phytate</b> rich-soymilk is greater than that in low phytate soymilk. ダイズの主要なタンパク質である 7 S及び 11 Sグロブリンの組成比の異なる 6 種類のダイズを用いて豆乳を調製し,粒子組成,フィチン含量,カルシウム及びマグネシウムに対するタンパク質の溶解度などについて測定し豆乳の凝固との関連を検討した.

The first is an {{investigation}} of the effect of vesicular - arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Endogone on the growth of Allium cepa and Allium porrum. Onion and leek seedlings were inoculated with Endogone spores and the progression of the mycorrhizal colonisation followed. The effects of the mycorrhizal association on the plants were determined by measuring the shoot and root dry weight, number of roots produced and height of plant. Plants in which mycorrhiza became well established showed significantly enhanced growth rates. The second part of this study was an investigation on the possible role of vesicular - arbuscular mycorrhiza in the resistance of onion plants to two soil – borne fungal diseases, namely basal root rot, caused by Fusarium oxysporum var. cepa and pink rot, caused by Pyrenochaeta terrestris. A marked resistance to these pathogens was found in plants with a well developed mycorrhizal association. An increased phosphate nutrition of the plants provided by applying CaHPO 4. 2 H 2 O to soil media was found to be insufficient to afford disease resistance. The third part of this investigation was an attempt to culture Endogone in agar media in the presence of A. cepa, using low phosphate concentrations of CaHPO 4. 2 H 2 O, <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate,</b> sodium phytate or lnositol.

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{performed}} to investigate the effects of Eimeria acervulina in-fection (duodenal coccidiosis) on the zinc (Zn) -calcium (Ca) -phytate interrelationship in the chick. Three supplemental levels of Ca (0,. 91, and 1. 82 %), two of Zn (0 or 52 mg/kg), and two of sodium phytate (0 or 1. 2 %) were evaluated as to their effects when added to completely adequate corn-soybean meal diets. Duodenal coccidiosis was produced by multiple crop inoculations of 4 X 10 s sporulated E. acervulina oocysts. Calcium supplementation depressed gain and efficiency of feed utilization, while Zn content of tissue and plasma was also lowered. Coccidial infection tended to reduce these values further. The addition of dietary phytate also depressed performance and deposition of Zn in tissue. Both excess dietary Ca and phytate addition to the diet markedly reduced plasma Zn concentration of birds fed corn-soybean meal diets unsupplemented with Zn. Addition of 52 mg/kg Zn, however, prevented excess Ca or phytate from exerting this effect. Parasitized chicks responded markedly with increased gain and gain/feed ratios when 52 mg/kg supplemental Zn was added to a 24 % protein corn-soybean meal diet containing 1. 82 % total dietary Ca.

The phytate/zinc, (<b>calcium)</b> (<b>phytate)</b> /zinc, and (calcium + magnesium) (phytate) /zinc molar ratios were used to indicate zinc bioavailability. Plasma zinc concentrations and zinc transporter (ZnT 1, ZnT 8, and Zip 1) gene expression in mononuclear cells were measured. Participants with DM consumed 1, 194 ± 824 mg/day (mean±SD) phytic acid, an amount similar to the intake of healthy women (1, 316 ± 708 mg/day). Bread products and breakfast cereals contributed more than 40 % of the phytic acid intake in each group. A positive relationship was observed in all participants between phytic acid and dietary fiber (r= 0. 6, P< 0. 001) and between dietary fiber and the (<b>calcium)</b> (<b>phytate)</b> /zinc ratio (r= 0. 5, P< 0. 001). Compared to the healthy group, the messenger RNA ratio of ZnT 1 (zinc export) to Zip 1 (zinc import) was lower in participants with DM, which may indicate perturbed zinc homeostasis in the disorder. The plasma zinc concentration was not predicted by age, body mass index, health status, zinc bioavailability, or zinc transporter expression. Healthy and diabetic women consume phytic acid in amounts that are likely to decrease the bioavailability of dietary zinc.

Zinc is an essential trace element necessary for over 300 zinc metalloenzymes and required for normal nucleic acid, protein, and membrane metabolism. Zinc deficiency {{is one of the}} ten biggest factors contributing to burden of disease in developing countries. Populations in South Asia, South East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa are at greatest risk of zinc deficiency. Zinc intakes are inadequate for {{about a third of the}} population and stunting affects 40 % of preschool children. In Pakistan, zinc deficiency is an emerging health problem as about 20. 6 % children are found in the levels of zinc, below 60 μg/dL. Signs and symptoms caused by zinc deficiency are poor appetite, weight loss, and poor growth in childhood, delayed healing of wounds, taste abnormalities, and mental lethargy. As body stores of zinc decline, these symptoms worsen and are accompanied by diarrhea, recurrent infection, and dermatitis. Daily zinc requirements for an adult are 12 - 16 mg/day.

Inadequate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D plays {{a vital role}} and further compromises the bone health. Objective: To assess the dietary pattern with special reference to calcium and related minerals in people with epilepsy (PWE) on AED. Materials and Methods: The dietary assessment in PWE was documented by dietary recall method. Patients were categorized according to age: group I: &# 60; 14 years; group II: between 15 - 20 years; group III: between 21 - 45 years; group IV:&# 62; 46 years. From the raw weights, total energy, dietary calcium, dietary phosphorous intake and <b>phytate</b> <b>calcium</b> ratio was calculated using a food composition table by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and analyzed statistically. Results: A total of 362 patients with mean age of 29 &#x 002 B; 15 years were studied. There were 190 women. The mean duration of AED treatment was 4 &#x 002 B; 3 yrs, 64 &#x 0025; on monotherapy 64 &#x 0025; and 36 &#x 0025; on polytherapy. The mean dietary intake of the total chohort was 2, 007 &#x 002 B; 211 Kcal/day, carbohydrate 335 &#x 002 B; 33 gm/day; protein 31 &#x 002 B; 7 gm/day; fat 18 &#x 002 B; 2 gm/day; calcium 294 &#x 002 B; 40 mg/day; phosphorus 557 &#x 002 B; 102; phytates 179 &#x 002 B; 30 mg/day; and phytate/calcium ratio 0. 56 &#x 002 B; 0. 2. Milk and milk products were consumed by 42 &#x 0025; of the total cohort. The daily dietary calcium (301 &#x 002 B; 40 mg/day) intake of men {{was significantly higher than}} women (287 &#x 002 B; 39 mg/day) (P < 0. 001). This was more evident in group II (P < 0. 01) and group III (P < 0. 03). There was a positive correlation between dietary <b>calcium</b> and dietary <b>phytates</b> (P < 0. 001), dietary proteins (P < 0. 001), dietary fat (P < 0. 001), and total energy (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: The dietary consumption of calcium of all the patients was far below the recommended daily dietary allowance (RDA) by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Low dietary calcium could have a confounding effect on PWE on AED in all age groups. There is a need to formulate consensus guidelines to supplement dietary calcium to PWE...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{goals of}} this thesis were to functionalize calcium phosphate nanoparticles with organic phosphates and {{to stabilize the}} nanoparticles as stable colloid. The intention of this project was approached successfully with some organic phosphates. The results are summarized here. The calcium phosphate nanoparticles were prepared by a continuous precipitation method and immediately stabilized as colloid by rapidly adding an aqueous solution of organic phosphate. A variety of organic phosphates (porphyrin, phytic acid, phosphoamino acid and surfactants) was used to functionalize the calcium phosphate surface. The conditions were optimized to prepare stable monodisperse colloids. Organic phosphate showed a high chemical affinity to bind to the calcium phosphate surface which was confirmed by the zeta potential values (- 20 mV…- 35 mV). The particle size, morphology, and porosity were determined by the surface-adsorbed organic phosphates. For example, (a) p-TPPP-functionalized particles – aggregation of primary calcium phosphate particles (ca. 20 - 30 nm) into ca. 250 nm solid spherical particles. (b) Phytic acid-functionalized particles – solid spherical particles. (c) TyrP-functionalized particles – aggregation of primary calcium phosphate particles (ca. 20 - 30 nm) into ca. 250 nm hollow spherical particles (d) Alkyl phosphate-functionalized particles – needle- or flower-like microparticles. The number of phosphate groups present in organic phosphates and their concentration {{played a critical role}} in determining the nature of particle precipitation. For example, the p-TPPP molecule has four phosphate groups. It functionalized the calcium phosphate surface and stabilized the particles in solution only when the p-TPPP to calcium concentration ratio was 1 : 100. If an excess amount of p-TPPP was used (p-TPPP:Ca 2 += 1 : 30), only the calcium salt of p-TPPP was obtained. p-TPPP-functionalized calcium phosphate nanoparticles were prepared and used in cell culture studies to check its viability. In collaboration with the Chair of Molecular Neurochemistry at the University of Bochum, the cell culture experiments were carried out. The p-TPPP-functionalized calcium particles were taken up by the NIH 3 T 3 fibroblast cell and no adverse effect was observed. This showed a good prospect that the nanoparticles can be used as fluorescing agents without any adverse effects in the cells. A new and simple method to prepare <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate</b> nanoparticles was described where calcium phosphate nanoparticles were used as nuclei. This method works only in a narrow concentration range of phytic acid. The size of the <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate</b> nanoparticles can be adjusted by varying the calcium to phytate ratio. As the colloids of <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate</b> are stable and biocompatible, they may be used in biomedical studies (e. g. liver and spleen scintigraphy) without any other stabilizing agents. The one-step synthesis of hollow particles was described in our study which is easy, simple and more convenient. The hollow spherical particles are formed by the direct self-assembly of the primary calcium phosphate nanoparticles in the presence of an excess amount of O-phospho-L-tyrosine. It was found from SEM measurements that the hollow morphology was not stable under mechanical agitation and thermal conditions. The simple procedure for the preparation of hollow calcium phosphate nanoparticles makes it advantageous over template-assisted method. These hollow particles may be used as drug delivery vehicles. The alkyl phosphate-functionalized calcium phosphate colloids showed less stability. SEM measurements showed aggregated microparticles. The content of the alkyl phosphate in the precipitated particles was (about 10 - 30 wt%) estimated by elemental analysis. This indicated that the alkyl phosphates on the surface of hydroxyapatite underwent an ion exchange reaction with inorganic phosphate ions. As a result, the surface of the hydroxyapatite particles covered with the hydrophobic calcium salt of alkyl phosphate was found as precipitate...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare the availabilities of eight phosphorus compounds as a phosphorus sources in the diet for red sea bream, Chrysophrys major. Phosphorus contents of the test diets were adjusted to 680 mg per 100 g of diet in each experiment. The fish were reared on the test diets at 25 ℃ over a 77 day period (Exp. I), 62 day period (Exp. II), and an 88 day period (Exp. III). At {{the end of the}} feeding trial, ten fish from each group were selected for the chemical analyses of the blood serum, liver, and vertebrae. Sodium phosphates (mono-, di-, and tribasic), potassium phosphate monobasic, and calcium phosphate monobasic were more effective than calcium phosphates (di- and tribasic) to prevent the development of phosphorus deficiency symptoms. <b>Calcium</b> <b>phytate</b> was scarcely utilized as the dietary phosphorus source by red sea bream. Therefore, the water soluble phosphorus compounds, from which inorganic phosphorus is easily released, should be employed as the dietary phosphorus source for red sea bream...|$|E
40|$|Phytate is {{the most}} {{abundant}} form of soil organic phosphorus (P). Increased P nutrition of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants derived from phytate has been repeatedly reported. Earlier studies assessed acid phosphatase rather than phytase {{as an indication of}} mycorrhizal fungi-mediated phytate use. We investigated the effect of mycorrhizal hyphae-mediated phytase activity on P uptake by maize. Two maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars, non-inoculated or inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Funneliformis mosseae or Claroideoglomus etunicatum, were grown for 45 days in two-compartment rhizoboxes, containing a root compartment and a hyphal compartment. The soil in the hyphal compartment was supplemented with 20, 100, and 200 mg P kg- 1 soil as <b>calcium</b> <b>phytate.</b> We measured activity of phytase and acid phosphatase in the hyphal compartment, hyphal length density, P uptake, and plant biomass. Our results showed: (1) phytate addition increased phytase and acid phosphatase activity, and resulted in larger P uptake and plant biomass; (2) increases in P uptake and biomass were correlated with phytase activity but not with acid phosphatase activity; (3) lower phytate addition rate increased, but higher addition rate decreased hyphal length density. We conclude that P from phytate can be taken up by arbuscular mycorrhizal plants and that phytase plays a more important role in mineralizing phytate than acid phosphatase...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 440 straight-run Heritage 56 M × fast-feathering Cobb 500 F broiler birds were fed from 11 to 13 d of age to {{determine}} the impacts of <b>calcium</b> (Ca), <b>phytate</b> phosphorus (PP), nonphytate P (nPP) and phytase concentrations on the myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IP 6) flow through the different parts of gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The experiment was a 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 randomized block design with 2 Ca (0. 7 and 1. 0 %), 2 PP (0. 23 and 0. 34 %), 2 nPP (0. 28 and 0. 45 %) and 3 phytase (0 -, 500 -, and 1, 000 - phytase unit (FTU) /kg) concentrations. The experiment was replicated twice (block) with 3 replicates per treatment (Trt) of 10 birds per block. Concentration of IP 6 in crop, proventriculus (Prov) plus (+) gizzard (Giz) and distal ileum digesta {{as well as the}} ileal IP 6 disappearance was determined at 13 d of age. In crop, higher IP 6 concentration was seen with increased Ca (P< 0. 05). Despite the interaction between PP and phytase, higher dietary PP led to greater IP 6 concentration (P< 0. 05). Similar main effects of PP and phytase were also seen in Prov+Giz and ileum (P< 0. 05) without interactions. Interaction between Ca and nPP on IP 6 concentration was seen in Prov+Giz (P< 0. 05). Decreased ileal IP 6 disappearance was found at higher Ca (62. 3 % at 0. 7 % Ca vs. 57. 5 % at 1. 0 % Ca; P< 0. 05). In general, adding phytase improved IP 6 degradation but the degree of impact was dependent on nPP and PP (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, phytase inclusion significantly reduced IP 6 concentration and IP 6 disappearance in distal ileum regardless of GIT segments or diet composition, but impacts of dietary Ca, nPP, and PP differed depending on GIT segment examined.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{different}} ratios of dietary calcium (Ca) to total phosphorus (tP) on the performances {{and retention of}} minerals and phytate phosphorus (pP) by quails were studied using 600 unsexed broiler quails from 1 to 21 days of age. Treatments consist of five corn and soybean meal (CSM) based diets with variable ratios of Ca:tP (1. 96, 1. 81, 1. 66, 1. 53 and 1. 39) with four replicate of 30 birds each. Diets contained 3 g chromium oxide (Cr O) /kg as marker. All ratios of Ca and P had no significant effect on feed consumption 2 3 of birds. There were pronounced differences (P < 0. 05) in body weight gain of chicks among treatments at second and third week of age. Improved (P < 0. 05) feed conversion ratio was observed at 3 wk of age. Higher ratios of Ca:tP (1. 96 and 1. 81) increased (P < 0. 05) the retention of P compared to other treatments while ratio of 1. 96 decreased (P < 0. 05) the retention of Ca and phytate. In conclusion, Ca:tP ratio of 1. 81 showed positive effect on most of parameters measured in this study. Key words: <b>Calcium,</b> total phosphorus, <b>phytate</b> P, broiler quai...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{consumption of}} soybeans {{due to its}} bioactive compounds has attracted interest in describing the grain's constituents and variation during processing. Phytate has been the aim of much research since it chelates essential minerals but also has beneficial antioxidant effects. This study evaluated the variation of <b>phytate,</b> <b>calcium,</b> zinc, and iron during soaking and cooking of soybeans. The phytate: Zn and phytate: Fe molar ratios were determined in order to estimate the bioavailability of these minerals. Six food-type varieties were used: BR 36, BRS 213, BRS 216, BRS 232, BRS 155, and Embrapa 48. The samples were soaked in water 3 : 1 (w/w) for 12 hours at room temperature and cooked. Cooking time was determined by modeling the softening of each variety using fractional conversion. Water content, phytate, and minerals were determined in raw, soaked and cooked samples. The water content of raw grains for all varieties was 9. 9 g. 100 g- 1 increasing {{to a range of}} 58. 1 - 63. 7 g. 100 g- 1 after soaking and 63. 1 - 66. 0 g. 100 g- 1 after cooking. Soaking caused a significant reduction in phytate (23 - 30 %), but cooking caused no additional reduction. The phytate: Zn molar ratio was 20 indicating that zinc absorption could be impaired, while the phytate: Fe molar ratio was 8, below the level of compromising absorptio...|$|R
