Soil sampling and analysis were conducted one month after sowing and one month before harvesting maize. Crop development was measured as total dry biomass at different growth stages and maize and lablab bean yields were harvested as total dry-matter and yields. Results obtained during the two experimental years (2000 - 2001) showed that alley cropping (AL) was the most effective treatment in decreasing runoff and erosion, while CRP was the second best at erosion control. However, CRP had the highest rate of runoff and erosion under high intensity rainfall during the early growing season. Generally, CRP protected the soil surface from the splash erosion and had better soil physical properties, leading to the highest crop water use efficiency, and had the highest growth rate of Lablab bean. Crop yields under CRP and AL were relatively high andcomparable compared with either CC or CR during the dry season of both years...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Occurrence of dry spells {{during the}} {{rainfall}} season {{is the major}} cause of crop failure in semi-arid areas. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) {{is regarded as a}} viable option for mitigating these dry spells. However, benefits of most RWH systems have not been adequately quantified.

Field experiments were set up using a split-plot design in Northern Zimbabwe. Major plots were distinguished by presence/absence of infiltration pits in the <b>contour</b> <b>ridge</b> (CR) channel and minor plots by the tillage method which was at two levels namely conventional tillage (CT) and planting pits (PP). Soil moisture content was measured during 2010 / 11 rainy season using the TDR and gravimetric methods at 0. 20 -m depth intervals to 2. 0 m.

40|$|Low {{productivity}} of cereals, the staple food, in Sahelian zone of Cinzana in Mali {{is caused by}} a range of factors including but not limited to inherent low soil fertility, and insufficient and inadequate distribution of the rainfall due to high climate variability. In addition, the small amount of rain falls as heavy storms in very short periods of time leading to water losses by runoff which in turn causes a lot of erosion. The two phenomena therefore call for a combination of both strategic (combating erosion) and tactical (coping with inter- and intra-annual rainfall variability) measures to cope with the production uncertainties in such risk-prone environment. As opposed to most farmers’ practice of using the same variety, a tactical solution of using varieties of different cycles for different rainfall amounts/patterns was thought to be worth testing. Varieties of different cycles for different rainfall amounts/patterns were combined with a well-known soil and water conservation practice which is the <b>contour</b> <b>ridge</b> tillage (CRT). The combined effects of the two measures on the production of different varieties of sorghum and millet as well as on soil water content were assessed in on-farm participatory trials in five villages. The experiment was run during three consecutive years (2012, 2013 and 2014). Results A key finding of this research is that regardless of the yearly rainfall amount and provided CRT is used, there were large differences in yields between improved varieties and local ones. This is a result of higher soil water conservation and better response of the improved varieties. Conclusion The use of CRT increases considerably the yields of improved varieties of the most important staple crops of the Cinzana commune which are millet and sorghum. Thus, the use of these early maturing improved varieties, along with CRT, could be an accessible adaptation strategy to climate variability by farmers...|$|E

40|$|Realising that {{rainwater}} harvesting (RWH) improves crop productivity, smallholder {{farmers in}} semi-arid Zimbabwe modified contour ridges traditionally used for rainwater management by digging infiltration pits inside <b>contour</b> <b>ridge</b> channels {{in order to}} retain more water in crop fields. However, scientific studies on crop yield benefits of infiltration pits have not been conclusive. Combining field-edge RWH methods such as contour ridges with infiltration pits with in-field practices may enhance crop yield benefits. Thus, {{the objective of the}} study was to assess soil moisture and maize yield improvement of combining infiltration and planting pits. Field experiments were conducted in Rushinga, Zimbabwe for three seasons at three sites using a split-plot design: main-plot factor, field-edge rainwater management method (RWMM); and split-plot factor, tillage method. Soil moisture content was measured weekly using gravimetric and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) methods. A household and field survey to establish farmers’ perceptions, typology and availability of field-edge RWMM was conducted. In order to share experiences and enhance stakeholders’ learning, field days were held. Lateral movement of soil water was measured up to 2 m downslope from infiltration pits, hence infiltration pits did not improve maize yield and soil moisture content in the cropping area. Maize yield (kg ha- 1) was 45 % higher under conventional tillage (2697) than planting pits (1852) but the yield gap decreased from 90 to 30 % in the first and third year respectively. The value of infiltration pits is in reducing soil erosion by water and growing high value horticultural crops inside and close to pits, a view shared by host farmers and other stakeholders. Planting pits are an option for farmers without access to draught power and a fall-back method.

40|$|Cue: One of {{the most}} popular methods of {{trapping}} rainwater in fields, particularly on sloping land, is through the use of contour ridges or bunds. These are raised ridges of soil or rock constructed across the slope, which stop the flow of run off, thereby encouraging water to infiltrate into the soil and preventing soil erosion. Another method is to dig a ditch across the slope. As with the <b>contour</b> <b>ridge,</b> the ditch must not go up or down, but must be perfectly level, to prevent the rain water accumulating in one place; for this reason they are called ?level ditches?. Water collects in the ditch and slowly seeps into the ground: this water then moves down the slope through the soil and is available for plants. Many farmers use level ditches to irrigate either fruit trees or fodder shrubs for livestock, which they plant in a line just below the ditch. Martin Sishekanu is the chief agricultural specialist responsible for land husbandry in the Zambian agriculture ministry. He spoke recently to Chris Kakunta about steps to encourage rainwater harvesting in hilly areas {{in the eastern part of}} the country. Chris began by asking him what technologies the Ministry was promoting, particularly to those cultivating fruit trees and fodder shrubs. IN:		?One, if it is a sloping ground?? OUT:		??consider the area of water harvesting. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 54 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Martin Sishekanu, a land husbandry specialist with the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Sishekanu	One, if it is a sloping ground, we would like to break the slope by having a storm drain constructed by the foot of the hill. This storm drain, once it is constructed it will stop the water which comes and runs which adds also to the erosion of the ground, it stops it, it breaks the energy that erodes the soil and it gently and safely takes this water. Now where we take the water is important. In most cases we use natural depressions, and in some cases we can even divert this water into a water reservoir where we can store the water, which we can use eventually, even during the dry season, for irrigating our fruit trees. And in some cases we use level ditches. Now when the slope is not that great, when we use a level ditch, what we are doing is we would like to intercept the water that would have gotten lost and temporarily store this water, to allow it to filter into the ground. And as the water filters into the ground, it moves slowly down the slope and when we have our tree crops planted below this ditch, the tree crops will be continuously receiving the water that has been allowed to be stored in the ground. Kakunta	That is very interesting Mr Sishekanu. Is it a system that you have been advising small-scale farmers to do here in Eastern Province? Sishekanu	Yes in Eastern Province we have advised some farmers, particularly in the area of the utilisation of level ditches, which you can put and dig along the contour to store some water which eventually will be able to recharge the underground water system and make available some water during the dry season below where the ditch is. And then in some cases, like in the area of Chipangali, actually there is a rock that we have harvested water from. Using that rock catchment, we have put a rim, a small block where we have captured this water. Instead of the water coming from the rock to run and erode fields, we have diverted it into a water tank and from this water tank farmers are tapping the water to be able to apply in their fields. Kakunta	Is this a new technology we are talking about? Because most often, like you indicated, rainwater is actually let go without being tapped the way you have explained? Sishekanu	Well to some extent we may call it new but it is an old system. If you remember, even in the villages when the rain is falling you will find that we put either dishes or buckets by the corners of our houses and we capture water. That is already water harvesting. So the technology is old, but it is the mechanism in which to use and tap this water and utilise it for our own betterment that might be termed as new. Kakunta	Now what are some of the benefits for a small-scale farmer to use this system that you have recommended in terms of raising fruit trees as well as fodder crops for livestock? Sishekanu	The benefit is basically that without water our tree crops will not perform very well and therefore when we tap this water it will enhance the productivity of our trees and shrubs such that at the time when the browsing material in the natural environment is completely dry, there will still be some moisture that will be still available to support the growth of the shrubs from which we can be able to support our livestock. Kakunta	Wonderful. Now what type of physical factors do you need to establish the system for it to actually work out well for the small-scale farmer? Sishekanu	Well basically the level ditches would require that the area has some sandy-related soils where it is not going to over flood; it will be able to absorb the water and allow it to infiltrate. Now in the case of where run off might be higher because of clay soils, particularly when there is also a hill, we will need to capture that water and divert it safely. At the same time, there is also the system where you dig ditches. These ditches will also be capturing water and you plant your fruit trees just by the side of the ditch and in some clay soils that will be quite handy and helpful. Kakunta	So from your own experiences here in Eastern Province, what lessons have you learnt in terms of rainwater harvesting which are practically useful for the small-scale farmers? Sishekanu	The level ditch system has been practically useful for the small-scale farmers because it helps to recharge the underground water reservoir and therefore, even where they have shallow wells, the shallow wells will be facilitated to receive water for a longer period of time than when they are absent. Kakunta	Is there anything that I have left out that you would like to put across in as far as the subject rainwater harvesting is concerned? Sishekanu	Basically I would say that if we harvest the water we will reduce the destruction of our soils and meanwhile we will enhance the productivity of our crops and therefore it will be important that we consider the area of water harvesting.

For farmers this can be an advantage, but {{can also lead to}} {{problems}}. One of the biggest problems is soil erosion. If water falls on steep land with little vegetation, it can become a powerful force of erosion, carrying all the nutrient-rich top soil down into rivers, and ultimately out to the sea. Preventing that damage is vital to a sustainable farming system. One way of achieving that is through <b>contour</b> <b>ridges.</b> These ridges, which can be made of earth or stone, are built across the slope, trapping the rainfall and encouraging it to enter the soil rather than flow down the slope. To be successful, <b>contour</b> <b>ridges</b> must be perfectly level.

BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Lazarus Laiser reporting from Arumeru district in northern Tanzania, a hilly area where farmers are using <b>contour</b> <b>ridges</b> to capture rain water and prevent erosion. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Laiser I visited one of the farmers living in Oltrumet village, Arusha region, on the steep slopes of Mount Meru, the second largest mountain in Tanzania. Due to the steepness of the land he adopted the system of harvesting water to reduce the speed of water and the speed of eroding the soil. I can see the contours on the farm where I am right now standing. I can count one, two, three which is almost 1 metre high and they really did a good job of harvesting water. And Mr Julius Mollel, may you tell us briefly how the system works? Mollel (Vernac) The contours harvest water in the farm and the water remains in the soil instead of running and eroding the soil. Laiser Did you get any benefit? Mollel (Vernac) I can answer yes, I got a lot of advantages. First I got the soil, it was not eroded. Secondly the products increased, both trees and fruits like bananas and others as you can see. And all the rain that has dropped, I am sure it remained in my farm compared to other fields without contour. And lastly, if you come in dry season my farm is green. Laiser Now it is rainy season and I can see that there is a lot of water which remains on the farm, as Julius said. How difficult is it to plan the system? Mollel (Vernac) Difficulty is when you are making them because you need to measure. It is tiresome work and costs time. But when you continue you will be used to it. Of course you will forget all these things after the good product. Laiser Where did you get the knowledge? Mollel (Vernac) I got the knowledge from the project called SCAPA, Soil Conservation and Agroforestry Programme in Arusha, in our district Arumeru. Laiser Julius learned, got the knowledge from SCAPA, one of the projects which was helping the farmers. How much labour did it cost you? Mollel (Vernac) Time and my strength, nothing else. I did not use money. Laiser What lesson have you learnt personally in implementing this technology? Mollel (Vernac) I learnt to increase my income, to make the soil fertile without adding manure. I also learnt how to harvest the rainwater and the benefit of it. I urge my fellow farmers to apply this knowledge of contours to their farm to reduce soil erosion. Our land is small and easy to erode. If we do not put any control to harvest rain, water will not get good products. Laiser That is the farmer Julius Mollel and I can see that he has really benefited a lot, good maize, good fruits which are here.

40|$|The use of geomorphology-based {{transfer}} functions is {{a strong}} perspective of low-calibrated and structurally explicit rainfall-runoff. In this study, the whole basin rainfall-runoff process is considered as the coupling of hillslope and stream network processes. The coupling variable -net rainfall- along the hillslope-river interface cannot be monitored in situ. A robust geomorphology-based transfer function through the river network is proposed, {{as well as a}} methodology for its inversion. Discharge at the catchment outlet is deconvoluted thanks to the geomorphology-based transfer function inversion, which allows to assess average net rainfall. The application of this net rainfall assessment method for two distinct periods, before and after a major hillslope change, for a given catchment allows to deglobalise the hydrological impact from the catchment outlet towards the hillslope foot. In semi-arid regions, erosion is a major problem. <b>Contour</b> <b>ridges</b> are a widely and intensely developed water and soil conservation system at the hillslope scale. The Central Tunisian semi-arid catchment of El Gouazine (18. 1 km²) was intensely and widely changed by the sudden implementation of <b>contour</b> <b>ridges</b> during summers 1997 and 1998. Hydrological impacts have been assessed at the catchment outlet in terms of global runoff coefficient, total volumes and maximum discharge. The application of the deconvolution and deglobalisation geomorphology-based approach to pre- 1997 and post- 1998 runoff events, induced by similar rainfall events, show various significant changes in the hillslope-scale rainfall-net rainfall process which were not appearing in the basin-level rainfall-runoff process. The major changes are the emergence of a time delay (230 min) and of a generation threshold (16 mm) of runoff. This deglobalising approach proves to be a promising impact assessment method from downstream, as an alternative to upscaling and aggregating hillslope approaches, in a catchment where a major hillslope sudden change occurred. It is based on a robust and generic geomorphologybased transfer, which is assumed to be stationary through time since changes occurred on hillslope and not in streams. Quantitative perspectives are open to consider other types of sudden changes (e. g. wildfire), as well as progressive changes (e. g. ageing of landscape artefacts, including of <b>contour</b> <b>ridges</b> themselves). Furthermore, such an assessment of the hillslope-river network coupling variable will allow to develop a library of production functions to be coupled with the geomorphology-based transfer function, according to hillslope types...|$|R

Julius Mollel is a farmer from the village of Oltrumet on the slopes of Mount Meru in northern Tanzania. Lazarus Laiser visited him on his farm {{to find out more about}} how farmers can use <b>contour</b> <b>ridges</b> to capture rainwater and prevent erosion.

BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Lazarus Laiser reporting from Arumeru district in northern Tanzania, a hilly area where farmers are using <b>contour</b> <b>ridges</b> to capture rain water and prevent erosion. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Laiser	I visited one of the farmers living in Oltrumet village, Arusha region, on the steep slopes of Mount Meru, the second largest mountain in Tanzania. Due to the steepness of the land he adopted the system of harvesting water to reduce the speed of water and the speed of eroding the soil. I can see the contours on the farm where I am right now standing. I can count one, two, three which is almost 1 metre high and they really did a good job of harvesting water. And Mr Julius Mollel, may you tell us briefly how the system works? Mollel	(Vernac) The contours harvest water in the farm and the water remains in the soil instead of running and eroding the soil. Laiser	Did you get any benefit? Mollel	(Vernac) I can answer yes, I got a lot of advantages. First I got the soil, it was not eroded. Secondly the products increased, both trees and fruits like bananas and others as you can see. And all the rain that has dropped, I am sure it remained in my farm compared to other fields without contour. And lastly, if you come in dry season my farm is green. Laiser	Now it is rainy season and I can see that there is a lot of water which remains on the farm, as Julius said. How difficult is it to plan the system? Mollel	(Vernac) Difficulty is when you are making them because you need to measure. It is tiresome work and costs time. But when you continue you will be used to it. Of course you will forget all these things after the good product. Laiser	Where did you get the knowledge? Mollel	(Vernac) I got the knowledge from the project called SCAPA, Soil Conservation and Agroforestry Programme in Arusha, in our district Arumeru. Laiser	Julius learned, got the knowledge from SCAPA, one of the projects which was helping the farmers. How much labour did it cost you? Mollel	(Vernac) Time and my strength, nothing else. I did not use money. Laiser	What lesson have you learnt personally in implementing this technology? Mollel	(Vernac) I learnt to increase my income, to make the soil fertile without adding manure. I also learnt how to harvest the rainwater and the benefit of it. I urge my fellow farmers to apply this knowledge of contours to their farm to reduce soil erosion. Our land is small and easy to erode. If we do not put any control to harvest rain, water will not get good products. Laiser	That is the farmer Julius Mollel and I can see that he has really benefited a lot, good maize, good fruits which are here. Also the cows can get good food and as I can see, some of the trees are being used for feeding the animals. End of track.

40|$|Soil {{erosion and}} the {{productivity}} of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) cropping systems, including forage legume intercropping, were monitored under natural rainfall conditions on Inceptisols in southwest Colombia. Trials were conducted over two cropping periods on moderate slopes. The best erosion control and cassava fresh root yields were achieved by sole cropping on <b>contour</b> <b>ridges.</b> Erosion was greater with forage legume intercropping than with cassava sole cropping in the first cropping period but once well established and uniformly distributed, undersown legumes controlled erosion effectively, though yields of cassava were depressed by 40 % or more. Dense stands of grass contour barriers decreased erosion to tolerable levels. Lower cassava yields due to reduced cropping area and competition from the grasses could be compensated for by the production of valuable forage and by increasing cassava planting density.

The simplest common variety {{is a small}} rectangular prism or block, only about 1 × 5/8 × 7/16 inch (2.5 × 1.7 × 1.1 cm) in size. The block-shaped sharpener consists of a combined point-shaping cone that is aligned to the cylindrical pencil alignment guide hole, into which the pencil is inserted. A sharp blade is mounted so that its sharp edge just enters the shaping cone tangentially. The pencil is inserted into the sharpener and rotated while the sharpener is held motionless. The body of the sharpener is often <b>contoured,</b> <b>ridged</b> or grooved to make the small block easier to firmly grip, and is typically made of aluminum alloy, magnesium alloy or hard plastic.|$|R

On-station, four conservation tillage methods namely no-till tied ridging, mulch ripping, clean ripping and hand hoeing {{were compared to}} the control of conventional tillage system and {{the results showed that}} on farm maize yields were significantly different from farmer to farmer, depending on their management skills, seasonal rainfall and soil type. The results from the work by Nyagumbo (1999) showed that there was no scope for giving blanket recommendations to farmers on no-till tied ridging. It was also realised from the study that tied ridging alone could not bring better yield results to the farmers; hence {{there is a need to}} incorporate soil fertility and other management components for improved productivity. Tied ridges could not work without the support of structures such as <b>contour</b> <b>ridges,</b> infiltration pits and other preventive structures. Tied ridges on sandy soils did not overally increase soil water content within the root zone due to the low water holding capacity of sands.|$|R
3000|$|In 1980, when Zimbabwe {{became an}} {{independent}} state, the government formulated new policies for the agricultural sector. However, {{most of these}} policies failed because the authorities employed a top-down policy, {{with the government and}} the secretariat assuming the custodial role (especially regarding the resource-poor farmers). Even today, although perception and approaches are changing, the standard <b>contour</b> <b>ridges</b> are to some extent still predominant, despite the introduction of other practices in soil and water conservation (Gumbo et al. 2012). The uses of water harvesting technologies for improved water use efficiency have been evaluated in several semi arid regions of the country. Farmers in semi arid regions of Chivi have successfully used water harvesting technologies such as the Fanya ju and spreading of termitaria (Hagmann and Murwira 1996 a) to increase crop yields relative to conventional tillage. In addition, farmers driven innovative soil and water harvesting practices e.g. Infiltration pits (chibatamvura), crop rotations, winter cropping, improved tillage techniques and many others have been used in Zimbabwe.

40|$|Mexico is rich {{in ancient}} and {{traditional}} technologies (dating back to the Aztecs and Mayas) on natural resources management; however, a growing demand for water and increasing costs of water supply for domestic use and agriculture production are resulting in a need for Mexicans to maximize the use of diverse water supplies. In the near future {{it will be necessary}} to reinforce programs and projects to face the increasing demand for water and to avoid serious social problems. Mexico, a country with 200 million hectares, an average annual rainfall of 700 mm and a population of 100 million people, has 1 400 000 million m 3 water from rainfall. This gives an annual average of 14 000 m 3 /person, enough for domestic use and agriculture production. Currently different water catchment systems are used in Mexico: 1) for domestic use (water collection from roofs and paved land surfaces) and 2) for agriculture production (microcatchments, <b>contour</b> <b>ridges,</b> trapezoidal bunds, permeable rock dams, water spreading bunds, contour stone bunds and others) ...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{agricultural}} {{practices such as}} the use of the moldboard plough are no longer sustainable due to their extensive soil degradation effects. As a panacea, several Conservation Agriculture (CA) technologies have been promoted to improve soil structure and water conservation. However, adoption of these technologies has been resisted by smallholder farmers and identifying causes of the low adoption rates to facilitate intervention strategies remains a challenge to development practitioners. Using data from 100 farmers, this paper uses a Tobit application to assess the underlying factors important in determining farmers’ adoption of zero-tillage, crop rotation and <b>contour</b> <b>ridging</b> technologies. Empirical results suggest that adoption and use intensity of each of these technologies is affected by a set of distinct household factors. There is also evidence to show complementarities in adoption and use of these technologies, suggesting the need to tailor awareness and promotional strategies depending on the technology in question and socio-economic background of target farmers.

40|$|Estimation {{of local}} surface {{geometry}} (i. e. principle frame and principle quadric) is discussed. It is shown that surface fitting methods are more robust that finite difference based approaches {{for a number}} of reasons. The local surface geometry is used to segment the surfaces into regions corresponding to smooth patches, separated by visibility boundaries, occluding <b>contours,</b> and <b>ridges.</b> Points within each surface patch are then classified by the sign of the Gaussian and mean curvature. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{broad range}} of applications, from {{military}} programs to survey and land use sys tems, rely on Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) for timely and accurate information. As more and more applications make use of this data, demands for both greater land coverage and finer, more accurate details are on the increase. Meeting these requirements can result in vast volumes of data which strain the memory limits of a computer system. Large digital elevation models can also create a bottleneck in the input/output processes and 3 -D perspective rendering algorithms. Therefore, algorithms that generate compact and accurate elevation models are an important topic for research. We present one such algorithm here. This paper describes a triangulation method which builds a DTM {{from a series of}} critical line features such as elevation <b>contours,</b> <b>ridge</b> and valley lines, and other breaklines. The method described is an improvement over current techniques because it triangulates any set of critical lines without human intervention, retains the original lines in the triangulation, adds no more than four points to the data, and runs relatively fast. Implementation results are given at the conclu sion of the paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Conveying shape using feature {{lines is}} an {{important}} visualization tool in visual computing. The existing feature lines (e. g., ridges, valleys, silhouettes, suggestive contours, etc.) are solely determined by local geometry properties (e. g., normals and curvatures) {{as well as the}} view position. This paper is strongly inspired by the observation in human vision and perception that a sudden change in the luminance plays a critical role to faithfully represent and recover the 3 D information. In particular, we adopt the edge detection techniques in image processing for 3 D shape visualization and present Photic Extremum Lines (PELs) which emphasize significant variations of illumination over 3 D surfaces. Comparing with the existing feature lines, PELs are more flexible and offer users more freedom to achieve desirable visualization effects. In addition, the user can easily control the shape visualization by changing the light position, the number of light sources, and choosing various light models. We compare PELs with the existing approaches and demonstrate that PEL is a flexible and effective tool to illustrate 3 D surface and volume for visual computing.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new 3 D surface segmentation al-gorithm that separates a closed surfaces into regions by computing surface <b>contours</b> that traverse <b>ridges</b> of high-curvature surface regions. We {{refer to the}} approach as ridge-walking since these contours tend to follow convex ridge-like structures and concave valley-like substructures present within the geometry of the model. Segmentation is achieved by solving for closed <b>ridge</b> <b>contours</b> on the sur-face, each of which serves to divide the surface into two disjoint regions. A collection of such curves then provides a segmentation of the surface into surface patches which is the segmentation result. The proposed approach also introduces a new parametrization for 3 D models in term of the mesh vertices and edges that is a significant depar...|$|R
