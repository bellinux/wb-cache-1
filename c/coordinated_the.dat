5|$|In contrast, the {{construction}} of war cemeteries, graves and their associated memorials were typically placed {{under the control of}} a central state authority. The Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) took on this role for Britain and her empire. The Commissione nazionale per la onoranze ai caduti di guerra in Italy <b>coordinated</b> <b>the</b> military repatriation of bodies and {{the construction}} of cemeteries. The German war graves commission, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge (VDK), was established in 1919, and took strict control over the creation and style of German war cemeteries. The American Battle Monuments Commission oversaw US military graves in a similar fashion.|$|E

Groves had Lansdale transferred to the Manhattan District, but instead of placing him {{in charge of the}} new CIC unit, Groves made Lansdale his special assistant for security at Manhattan Project headquarters in Washington, D.C.

A game referred to as alea (dice) or tabula (the board), to which the emperor Claudius was notoriously addicted, may have been similar to backgammon, using a dice-cup (pyrgus). Playing with dice {{as a form of}} gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the December festival of the Saturnalia with its carnival, norms-overturned atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|She <b>coordinated</b> <b>the</b> effort {{against the}} Communications Decency Act of 1996, {{which was the}} first attempt by the United States Congress to {{introduce}} a form of censorship of speech on the Internet. Krug strongly opposed the notion that libraries should censor the material that they provide to patrons. She supported laws and policies protecting the confidentiality of library use records. When the United States Department of Justice used the authority of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to conduct searches of what once were confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against this activity by the government.|$|E

5|$|After heavy {{damage from}} Cyclone Bonita in 1996, the {{government}} of Madagascar initiated a disaster response system that was used during Gretelle; there was quick response but efforts were hampered by damaged infrastructure and disrupted transportation. The storm had cut communications in some areas, but by January29, or five days after landfall, telephone service was restored to Manakara. Following the storm, the Madagascar government <b>coordinated</b> <b>the</b> distribution of emergency rice rations and other relief items. On January27, the government launched a fundraiser on television that raised over ₣130million (FMG, $30,000 USD). The southern portion {{of the country was}} declared a disaster area. A plane of relief supplies flew from the capital Antananarivo to Manakara along the southeast coast, where trucks distributed the items to the affected areas. A radio station based out of the country criticized the slow pace of relief, citing the lack of available boats after many were destroyed. In addition, there were reports that government aid was being stolen by looters.|$|E

Le Corbusier's project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the Assembly Hall and the Council Chambers {{near the center of}} the site with the Secretariat tower emerging as a slab from the south. Niemeyer's plan was closer to that actually constructed, with a distinctive General Assembly building, a long low horizontal block housing the other meeting rooms, and a tall tower for the Secretariat. The complex as built, however, repositioned Niemeyer's General Assembly building to the north of this tripartite composition. This plan included a public plaza as well.|$|E
