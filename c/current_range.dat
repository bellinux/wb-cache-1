5|$|In its {{original}} form (1960), the SI defined prefixes for values ranging from pico- (symbol p) having {{a value of}} 10−12 to tera- (symbol T) having a value of 1012. The list was extended at the 12th CGPM (1964), at the 15th CGPM (1975) and at the 19th CGPM (1991) to give the <b>current</b> <b>range</b> of prefixes.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{wood turtle}} populations were forced south by {{extending}} glaciers. Remains from the Rancholabrean period (300,000 to 11,000 years ago) {{have been found}} in states such as Georgia and Tennessee, both of which are well south of their <b>current</b> <b>range.</b> After the receding of the ice, wood turtle colonies were able to re-inhabit their customary northern range (areas like New Brunswick and Nova Scotia).|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, {{there were}} only 200 parrots in the wild, and in 1975 the {{population}} reached an absolute low of 13 individuals. Numbers then recovered, and in August 1989 there were an estimated minimum of 47 individuals. But on September 18, 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the northeast coast of Puerto Rico inflicting heavy casualties on the remaining birds. In {{the aftermath of the}} hurricane the population was estimated at 23 individuals. In 2004, the wild population was 30–35 individuals, and the long-term trend appears to be stable albeit with some fluctuations. The <b>current</b> <b>range</b> of the species is , 0.2% of what it once was.|$|E

5|$|Fishers {{have few}} predators besides humans. They have been trapped since the 18th century for their fur. Their pelts were in such demand {{that they were}} extirpated from several parts of the United States {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Conservation and {{protection}} measures have allowed the species to rebound, but their <b>current</b> <b>range</b> is still reduced from its historic limits. In the 1920s, when pelt prices were high, some fur farmers attempted to raise fishers. However, their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult. When pelt prices fell in the late 1940s, most fisher farming ended. While fishers usually avoid human contact, encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the IUCN {{listed the}} Asian {{elephant}} as endangered {{due to a}} 50% population decline over the past 60–75 years while CITES lists the species under Appendix I. Asian elephants once ranged from Syria and Iraq (the subspecies Elephas maximus asurus), to China (up to the Yellow River) and Java. It is now extinct in these areas, and the <b>current</b> <b>range</b> of Asian elephants is highly fragmented. The total population of Asian elephants {{is estimated to be}} around 40,000–50,000, although this may be a loose estimate. It is likely that around half of the population is in India. Although Asian elephants are declining in numbers overall, particularly in Southeast Asia, the population in the Western Ghats appears to be increasing.|$|E
5|$|At the {{greatest}} {{extent of the}} last glacial period around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the Alpine chough was found as far as south as southern Italy, well outside its <b>current</b> <b>range.</b> Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within {{the last couple of}} centuries. In the Polish Tatra Mountains, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, and the number of pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but are declining or have become locally extinct where intensive farming methods have been introduced, such as Brittany, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Genetic testing results {{published}} in 2001 indicated that Namib Desert Horses {{are one of}} the most isolated horse populations in the world, with the second-lowest genetic variation of all horse populations that have been studied to date. In part, this is due to their small founding population, and generally small modern population, made smaller during periods of drought. Despite the large domesticated breeding population from which the horses originally descended, at least one genetic bottleneck has occurred in the breed's history, resulting in a significant decline in genetic variation over a relatively short period of time. Although an ideal minimum population size for genetic variability would be around 200 horses, the <b>current</b> <b>range</b> cannot support this population given the average rainfall. Estimates for a necessary minimum population to maintain genetic effectiveness range between 100 and 150 animals.|$|E
5|$|Pleistocene fossils {{have been}} found {{throughout}} its <b>current</b> <b>range</b> and beyond it. In Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul, the Lujanian (Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene) Sopas Formation has yielded remains of L. molitor, in addition to such other mammals as the extinct saber-toothed cat Smilodon populator and species of Glyptodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon. The type locality, Lagoa Santa, lies far northeast of the nearest record of live L. molitor; there, it is known only from three skull fragments from a cave known as Laga da Escrivania Nr.5. This cave also contains numerous remains {{of members of the}} extinct South American megafauna, such as ground sloths, litopternans, gomphotheres, and glyptodonts, in addition to 16species of cricetid rodents, but it is not certain that all remains from this cave are from the same age.|$|E
