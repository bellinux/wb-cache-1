The purification strategy includes appropriate combination of extraction, reactive crystallization, and antisolvent cooling crystallization that enables the production of lidocaine hydrochloride formulated solution, for topical application meeting US Pharmacopeia (USP) standards. Based on the optimal yield observed in each step, the system sustains a daily production of 810 doses (dosage strength = 20 mg mL- 1 i. e. 2 % formulation in <b>commercial</b> <b>denomination).</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{wide variety}} of marketed fishery {{products}} sometimes makes the recognition of species difficult, especially in processed food. So the consumer can be exposed to several commercial and health frauds. The European law obliges to indicate the species by specific commercial names only in fresh and prepared fishery products, but not in processed ones, in which the species can be named using generic denominations. In the present study, {{the use of a}} PCR-RFLP technique for species identification in anchovy paste, a widespread product in Italy, is described. After the PCR amplification of a common 272 bp fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from different fish species used as standards (European anchovy, European pilchard, European sprat, twaite shad, round sardinella, Atlantic horse mackerel and Mediterranean horse mackerel), the amplicons were digested using four restriction enzymes (MspI, HincII, Eam 1104 I and Alw 26 I). These patterns were compared with patterns from DNA extracted from anchovy pastes purchased from the market enabling to detect the presence of species different from anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in some of them. The suitability of extending the obligation to indicate the species using specific <b>commercial</b> <b>denominations</b> even to processed fishery products is also discussed...|$|R

These were {{followed}} in 1873 by notes of the Fiji Banking and <b>Commercial</b> Company in <b>denominations</b> of 5 and 10 shillings and 1 and 5 pounds. The Bank of New Zealand introduced notes in 1876 in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 pounds, followed by 10 shillings notes in 1918. The Bank of New South Wales issued 1 pound notes in 1901.|$|R
500|$|The banks {{accustomed}} {{themselves to}} seasonal need for coins, as for quarters and half dollars in Michigan to pay cherry pickers the traditional 75-cent rate, and to local preferences; for example, half dollars were not popular in New York, two quarters being preferred instead. [...] Beginning in late 1959, the Mint {{failed to provide}} enough coins to satisfy demand, and the Fed, through its district banks and branches, imposed rationing. By 1963, there was often rationing of all <b>denominations,</b> <b>commercial</b> banks (and their retail customers) receiving less than they needed. There were widespread shortages of some denominations during the 1962 holiday shopping season. [...] Traditionally, the heavy demand for coinage {{late in the year}} resulted in a large amount of flowback in the winter, but in early 1963, few coins returned to the banks, or to the Fed. [...] Officials suggested responsibility might lie with coin collectors and investors, as well as uncollected coins remaining in the nation's millions of vending machines. The Mint increased production to around-the-clock shifts at Philadelphia and Denver. A new Philadelphia Mint was authorized in 1963, though the hoped-for opening date of 1966 was soon pushed back to 1967 (it eventually opened in 1969).|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, six of {{the seven}} species {{belonging}} to the Genus Lophius have an important commercial value in the national and international markets. Usually they are sold beheaded {{and for this reason}} they are called tails. This kind of preparation is a limit for the specie-identification by means of the morphological characteristics. The mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene is considered a useful genetic marker to identify fish species. In this work, after obtaining the Cyt b complete sequence of the Lophius species that were missed in the databases, we set up a method based on PCR-RFLP able to identify the six species of Lophius with a <b>commercial</b> <b>denomination</b> in the Italian market...|$|E
30|$|There is one {{additional}} remark concerning product definition {{in the data}} set and the size and interpretation of age effects. As explained in Sect. 2.1, products are defined according to the <b>commercial</b> <b>denomination</b> given by the manufacturer and, hence, they are the reflection of firms’ marketing criteria. However, as has been demonstrated, product specifications can (dramatically) change over time. These continuous changes may end up yielding a different product, while the commercial name remains unchanged. On the contrary, firms can modify commercial names with no substantial modification of the products. What impact could these somehow “artificial” renaming strategies subjacent in the data have on the estimated age effects? One has {{to keep in mind}} that model entry and exit are decisions made (optimally) by the firm. Thus, if the name remains despite the amount of changes made to the configuration of the product, it may be precisely because the name has some value in itself. This value is captured through the fixed effect/model dummies and the age, because that value may have accumulated over time. If producers found it optimal to change the commercial name every time they make a major change in characteristics, they would be discarding any “accumulated” reputation (obsolescence). In this case, the size of age effects captured in the hedonic regressions and the corresponding correction of the price index would be smaller. However, we could also expect a smaller price increase from the initial set of characteristics to the second set, because the lost reputation could no longer be used by the firm to increase its markups. Therefore, a smaller age correction would be matched with an overall smaller price increase, such that one should not expect a change in the quality-adjusted price index. If age effects were capturing obsolescence instead of good reputation, the same argument would apply with just the opposite interpretation of age effects. The crucial factor is that the omission of age effects would bias the hedonic estimations and the quality-adjusted price indexes independently of how frequently the name is changing, because in any case there would be some “accumulation” of reputation. It is only the amount of the estimated age effect that would vary.|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} ex post {{returns to}} emerging market debt by combining secondary-market prices with observed flows based on World Bank data. From 1970 - 2000, returns averaged 9 percent per annum, {{about the same}} as returns on a ten-year U. S. treasury bond. This reflects the combined effect of the 1980 s debt crisis and much higher returns during 1989 - 2000. Annual returns since 1986 have been less volatile than emerging market equity returns but more volatile than returns on U. S. corporate or high-yield bonds. However, unlike returns on these bonds, emerging market debt returns do not seem significantly correlated with U. S. or world stock markets.
