40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to use the}} Cal Poly Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics Simulator to provide proof of concept of two {{adaptive}} <b>control</b> <b>theories</b> developed by former Cal Poly students: Nonlinear Direct Model Reference Adaptive Control and Adaptive Output Feedback Control. The Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics Simulator is a student-built air bearing spacecraft simulator controlled by four reaction wheels in a pyramidal arrangement. Tests were performed to determine the effectiveness of the two adaptive <b>control</b> <b>theories</b> under nominal operating conditions, a “plug-and-play” spacecraft scenario, and under simulated actuator damage. Proof of concept of the adaptive <b>control</b> <b>theories</b> applied to attitude control of a spacecraft is provided. The adaptive <b>control</b> <b>theories</b> are shown to attain similar or improved performance over a Full State Feedback controller. However, the measurement capabilities of the simulator need to be improved before strong comparisons between the adaptive controllers and Full State Feedback can be achieved...|$|R

5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence that the}} cerebellum plays {{an essential role in}} some types of motor learning. The tasks where the cerebellum most clearly comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed. There has, however, been much dispute about whether learning takes place within the cerebellum itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures. Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus, who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses. Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened. Most subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an error signal, and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened. Some of these later models, such as the Adaptive Filter model of Fujita made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal <b>control</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{probability}} that buyers are deceived {{with regard to}} the quality or safety of purchased products (moral hazard) increases with the profits which suppliers can earn through opportunistic behaviour. It decreases with the probability and level of losses that result from disclosure of malpractice. It also decreases with protective factors rooted in the suppliers' social contexts - such as values, emotional bonds etc. - that shield them from yielding to economic temptations. This paper describes how a systematic analysis of economic incentives and social context factors can be provided through an interdisciplinary approach which combines the analytical powers of microeconomics (game <b>theory)</b> and criminology (<b>control</b> <b>theories).</b> The approach is discussed with regard to food quality and safety threatened by moral hazard.
