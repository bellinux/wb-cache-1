5|$|At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), <b>Criterion</b> Games' {{director}} of design Alex Ward {{was approached by}} Bruce McMillan, executive vice president at EA Worldwide Studios. McMillan wanted to reconcile EA's relationship with <b>Criterion</b> and partner with them on a game. Initially, Ward refused, citing their past experience {{of working with the}} publisher. However, EA persisted and suggested <b>Criterion</b> make Burnout 3 with them. Originally, the studio was waiting until the next generation of video game hardware launched before starting work on a third instalment. <b>Criterion</b> accepted the deal on the conditions that EA would not interfere with the game's development and that <b>Criterion</b> had the freedom to create the game they wanted. Development on Burnout 3 began immediately after the expo in June 2003, with a larger team of staff working on the game than its predecessors. By January 2004, <b>Criterion</b> had a build of the game ready to demonstrate to EA. The development team had drafted a number of subtitles for Burnout 3 including Fuel Injection, Crash and Burn, Seek and Destroy, Takedown along with some more ridiculous suggestions like See You in Hell. Internally, they felt that Takedown was not an appealing choice, however the outcome of EA's focus testing proved otherwise. Despite a rocky start in their relationship with EA, <b>Criterion</b> admitted to benefiting from the publisher's experience throughout the course of Burnout 3s development. By July 2004, development on the game was nearly complete with the remaining work confined to bug testing and polishing the experience. On 28 July 2004, EA announced that they had acquired <b>Criterion</b> along with the Burnout intellectual property. McMillan stated that their strong expectations for Burnout 3 and ownership of the series were key reasons for buying <b>Criterion.</b>|$|E

5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown was {{developed}} by Guildford-based video game studio <b>Criterion</b> Games. The studio suffered several setbacks during {{the sequence of events}} that led up to the creation of Burnout 3, including the cancellation of a project, a failed pitch, and a fall out with the game's eventual publisher Electronic Arts (EA). In 2002, <b>Criterion</b> was around 130 people divided into two development teams. One team was working on Burnout 2: Point of Impact, a follow up to Burnout, set to be published by Acclaim Entertainment. The other team had completed the development of the extreme sports game AirBlade for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony had intentions of continuing to collaborate with <b>Criterion</b> on a sequel to AirBlade, however the AirBlade team turned down the offer. Instead, <b>Criterion</b> began talks with EA, who had a proposal for <b>Criterion</b> to create a remake of the 1988 skateboarding video game Skate or Die!. <b>Criterion</b> were keen to work with EA and started development on the project. Following Burnout 2s release, <b>Criterion</b> prepared a pitch to EA Canada about working on a second game with the publisher. Criterion's proposed title was Need For Speed: Split Second, a stunt racing game within EA's Need for Speed series. Meanwhile, the Skate of Die! remake project was thrown into disarray when EA requested changes to the game's design and the creative direction of project shifted away from Criterion's vision. With development staff becoming unhappy and stressed about the project, the studio decided to contact EA and cancel the game. EA was displeased with their decision and {{the relationship between the two}} companies soured, leading to dissolution of the proposed Need for Speed game.|$|E

5|$|Scholars use {{a number}} of criteria, such as the <b>criterion</b> of {{independent}} attestation, the <b>criterion</b> of coherence, and the <b>criterion</b> of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events.

Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate.

40|$|Purpose: {{screening}} tool of older people’s prescriptions (STOPP) and {{screening tool}} to alert to right treatment (START) <b>criteria</b> were {{first published in}} 2008. Due to an expanding therapeutics evidence base, updating of the <b>criteria</b> was required. Methods: we reviewed the 2008 STOPP/START <b>criteria</b> to add new evidence-based <b>criteria</b> and remove any obsolete <b>criteria.</b> A thorough literature review was performed to reassess the evidence base of the 2008 <b>criteria</b> and the proposed new <b>criteria.</b> Nineteen experts from 13 European countries reviewed a new draft of STOPP & START <b>criteria</b> including proposed new <b>criteria.</b> These experts {{were also asked to}} propose additional <b>criteria</b> they considered important to include in the revised STOPP & START <b>criteria</b> and to highlight any <b>criteria</b> from the 2008 list they considered less important or lacking an evidence base. The revised list of <b>criteria</b> was then validated using the Delphi consensus methodology. Results: the expert panel agreed a final list of 114 <b>criteria</b> after two Delphi validation rounds, i. e. 80 STOPP <b>criteria</b> and 34 START <b>criteria.</b> This represents an overall 31 % increase in STOPP/START <b>criteria</b> compared with version 1. Several new STOPP categories were created in version 2, namely antiplatelet/anticoagulant drugs, drugs affecting, or affected by, renal function and drugs that increase anticholinergic burden; new START categories include urogenital system drugs, analgesics and vaccines. Conclusion: STOPP/START version 2 <b>criteria</b> have been expanded and updated for the purpose of minimizing inappropriate prescribing in older people. These <b>criteria</b> are based on an up-to-date literature review and consensus validation among a European panel of experts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Multi <b>criteria</b> {{decision}} making involves evaluation of various alternative solutions upon {{a set of}} <b>criteria.</b> The result of multi <b>criteria</b> {{decision making}} is the best alternative which secures the highest score with the predefined <b>criteria.</b> Usually, these <b>criteria</b> are weighted in an order to represent their stake in the final selection. In multi <b>criteria</b> decision making this step is very critical for {{the selection of the}} right product. Often these <b>criteria</b> are traced backed to a set of multi-disciplinary stakeholders participating in the evaluation process. Often these stakeholders differ upon their weighting of a particular <b>criteria</b> with other stakeholders. In this paper we provide a holistic <b>criteria</b> weighting method which allows to assimilate the different <b>criteria</b> weights from different stakeholders to provide a single set of <b>criteria</b> weights, uniformly acceptable by all stakeholders. This paper shows how the <b>criteria</b> weights can be simulated and used priorly to find the design solutions. The simulations results can be used to accept or refute the particular design alternative. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction]: The {{purpose of}} this study was to propose new {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) <b>criteria</b> of diagnosing moyamoya disease (MMD) from cisternal moyamoya vessels (MMVs) on 3 -T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) /magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and compare the diagnostic accuracy of the existing MR <b>criteria</b> and the proposed MR <b>criteria.</b> [Methods]: Participants comprised 20 consecutive patients with MMD (4 males, 16 females) diagnosed clinically using conventional angiography and 20 controls (13 male and 7 female arteriosclerosis patients). In these participants, 3 -T MRI/MRA was evaluated by the existing MR <b>criteria,</b> which use MMVs in the basal ganglia, and the proposed MR <b>criteria,</b> which use cisternal MMVs, and then these two <b>criteria</b> were statistically compared by McNemar’s test. [Results]: Diagnostic accuracy was 62. 5 % with the existing MR <b>criteria</b> and 97. 5 % with the proposed MR <b>criteria.</b> The proposed MR <b>criteria</b> was more sensitive (1. 00) than the existing MR <b>criteria</b> (0. 45), but less specific (0. 95) than the existing MR <b>criteria</b> (1. 00). [Conclusion]: The proposed MR <b>criteria</b> using cisternal MMVs showed significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than the existing MR <b>criteria.</b> We believe that our proposed MR <b>criteria</b> will be beneficial for diagnosing MMD...|$|R
