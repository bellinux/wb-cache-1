5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, {{but it did}} not reflect the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any substantial amount of deck armor or good underwater protection; it <b>came</b> <b>closer</b> to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than to that of a modern warship.|$|E
5|$|Allen reopened {{the company}} in 1859, having added {{machinery}} for the manufacture of hoes, and opened a retail store on site. He found a successful market in the South, where demand was high. His company, newly named the Planters' Hoe Company, was a considerable success. However, as the nation <b>came</b> <b>closer</b> to civil war, demand dropped and sales in the South became impossible. The factory was closed in 1861, not only due to poor sales, but because Allen enlisted in the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|As Lane <b>came</b> <b>closer</b> to the coastline, all the {{seaports}} between Michoacán and Sinaloa were closed, and the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (Mexico) (National Meteorological Service, in Spanish) {{warned the}} general population about the threat of flooding and landslides. When the hurricane made landfall, {{the government of the}} state of Sinaloa issued a state of emergency for the municipalities of Ahome, Guasave, Angostura, Salvador Alvarado, Culiacán, Navolato, Elota, San Ignacio and Mazatlán. The arrival of the hurricane forced the closure of several flights at the General Rafael Buelna International Airport in Mazatlán, Sinaloa.|$|E

Burgmeier scored {{one of the goals}} in the second leg against Neuchâtel Xamax, but Mobulu M'Futi scored to ensure Neuchâtel won over the two legs, and Vaduz stayed in the Challenge League. Despite his side defending their Liechtenstein Cup, Burgmeier missed the final.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Allison {{joined the}} S-1 Section, which coordinated the early {{investigations}} into the feasibility of an atomic bomb. He began building a reactor in the squash courts under the disused stands of Stagg Field. He became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's chemistry section in January 1942, and in March, his small experimental reactor using beryllium <b>came</b> <b>closer</b> to criticality than the graphite-moderated design of Enrico Fermi's group at Columbia University. During 1942, Compton brought all the research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design at Columbia University, Princeton University and the University of California together at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Allison was placed {{in charge of the}} experimental work.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, the Mexican Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (National Weather Service) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for the eastern Mexican Gulf coast between Palma Sola and Cabo Rojo, as soon as Tropical Depression Seven formed. At that time, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued from Cabo Rojo northward, until reaching La Cruz. That same day, the government of Veracruz {{declared a state of}} emergency in 24municipalities of the state, making money from the National Disaster Fund available to those affected by the storm. As Gert <b>came</b> <b>closer</b> to the littoral, the tropical storm warning was extended northwards to La Cruz, and then to La Pesca, but it was canceled shortly after landfall.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 5 May 1794 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought in}} the Indian Ocean during the French Revolutionary Wars. A British squadron had been blockading the French island of Isle de France (now Mauritius) since early in the year, and early on 5 May discovered two ships approaching their position. As the strange vessels <b>came</b> <b>closer,</b> they were recognised as the French frigate Duguay Trouin, which had been captured from the East India Company the year before, and a small brig. Making use of a favourable wind, the British squadron gave chase to the new arrivals, which fled. The chase was short, as Duguay Trouin was a poor sailor {{with many of the}} crew sick and unable to report for duty. The British frigate HMS Orpheus was the first to arrive, and soon completely disabled the French frigate, successfully raking the wallowing ship. After an hour and twenty minutes the French captain surrendered, Captain Henry Newcome of Orpheus taking over the captured ship and bringing his prize back to port in India.|$|E
5|$|The new Italian trend {{combined}} with existing national traditions {{to create a}} particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities <b>came</b> <b>closer</b> to the Florentine humanist center, so a direct connection with Florence evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to Buda, helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them Vitéz János, archbishop of Esztergom, {{one of the founders}} of Hungarian humanism. During the long reign of emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. King Matthias Corvinus (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.|$|E
5|$|Speirs joined {{neighbours}} Leeds City, {{which played}} in the Second Division, for a fee of £1,400 in December 1912, becoming one of Herbert Chapman's first signings. Speirs' debut came on 28 December in a 3–2 defeat to Fulham, and although his first goal did not come until his fifth game against Bradford (Park Avenue), Speirs finished second highest scorer with 10goals, behind Billy McLeod. Their goals helped Leeds finish in sixth position, 10points off the promotion places. The following season, Leeds <b>came</b> <b>closer</b> to promotion, but despite Speirs, as captain, scoring 12goals and McLeod netting 27, they came fourth, two points behind Park Avenue in the second promotion spot. Despite {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in June 1914, league football continued, but Leeds lost their first four games of the season and were unable to recover, finishing a lowly 15th. Speirs scored the only goal of the West Riding Cup final against Hull City on 11 November 1914 to give what was Leeds City's only ever trophy before the club was expelled from the league in 1919 and subsequently dissolved. League football was suspended {{at the end of the}} season, and the last game of Speirs' career was a 2–0 defeat to Barnsley on 24 April 1915. He played 73league games for Leeds, scoring 32goals.|$|E

5|$|The Arabs now {{launched}} repeated {{attacks on}} the breach, but the defenders held firm. At first, according to al-Tabari, catapults manned by four men each were placed on wheeled platforms, and mobile towers with ten men each were constructed and advanced {{to the edge of}} the moat, which they began to fill with sheep skins (from the animals they had brought along as food) filled with earth. However, the work was uneven due to the soldiers' fear of the Byzantine catapults, and Mu'tasim had to order earth to be thrown over the skins to pave the surface up to the wall itself. A tower was pushed over the filled moat, but became stuck midway and it and the other siege engines had to be abandoned and burned. Another attack on the next day, led by Ashinas, failed due to the narrowness of the breach, and Mu'tasim eventually ordered more catapults brought forward to widen it. The next day Afshin with his troops attacked the breach, and Itakh on the day after. The Byzantine defenders were gradually worn down by the constant assaults, and after about two weeks of siege (the date is variously interpreted as 12, 13 or 15 August by modern writers) Aetios sent an embassy under the city's bishop, offering to surrender Amorium in exchange for safe passage of the inhabitants and garrison, but Mu'tasim refused. The Byzantine commander Boiditzes, however, who was in charge of the breach section, decided to conduct direct negotiations with the caliph on his own, probably intending to betray his own post. He went to the Abbasid camp, leaving orders for his men in the breach to stand down until his return. While Boiditzes parleyed with the caliph, the Arabs <b>came</b> <b>closer</b> to the breach, and at a signal charged and broke into the city. Taken by surprise, the Byzantines' resistance was sporadic: some soldiers barricaded themselves in a monastery and were burned to death, while Aetios with his officers sought refuge in a tower before being forced to surrender.|$|E
