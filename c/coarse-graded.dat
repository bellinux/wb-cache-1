50|$|The early pavers used screw conveyers to {{distribute}} the mix {{in front of a}} screed that tamped the mix. This process meant that the asphalt was suitable for <b>coarse-graded</b> mixes, however on dense-graded mixes that were common on city streets the machine experienced problems including surface imperfections. In 1933, Barber's son Ashley (Ash) joined the company and in the same year the independent floating screed was developed. This screed along with the tamper bar that permitted uniform material density of the finished surface were the two key features that allowed the machine to become successful. Early pavers had a hopper which material was dumped into and spread by an auger. The floating screed was supported by runners that traveled on the prepared base material.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} paper deals with the characterisation of the internal structure of hot-mix asphalt (HMA), incorporating both gyratory compacted samples produced in the laboratory and field cores. The primary objective was to determine the optimum trim depth on either end of laboratory-moulded HMA cylindrical samples that would optimise the air void (AV) uniformity in the test specimens. The analysis was based on the X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) scanning tests and subsequent image analyses. Two Texas HMA mixes, namely a <b>coarse-graded</b> (Type B) and a fine-graded (Type D) mix, with gyratory samples compacted in the laboratory to two different heights (110 and 164 mm) were evaluated for their internal structure in terms of the distribution of both the AV content and AV size. Analysis of the results indicated that the <b>coarse-graded</b> HMA mix (Type B) and the taller (164 mm in height) gyratory-moulded samples would be more likely associated with a more heterogeneous distribution of the AV content and AV size, respectively. Supplemented with field cores, the X-ray CT results indicated significantly poor AV content distribution (i. e. higher AV content and weakest area) at the ends, particularly in the top and bottom 20 mm zone of the samples. Thus, for 150 mm diameter samples of height equal to or greater than 110 mm, trimming a minimum of 20 mm {{on either side of the}} gyratory compacted samples should be given due consideration without compromising the specimen aspect ratio and NMAS coverage requirements (NMAS - nominal maximum aggregate size). In general, test specimens should always be cut from the middle zone of the SGC moulded samples where the AV is less heterogeneously distributed...|$|E

Geological mapping coupled with detailed biostratigraphy enable the depositional influence of sea-floor topography, an active Llyn Brianne Fault and eustatic sea-level changes to be tracked. The latter may represent ?far field? effects relating to the retreat and advance of contemporary Gondwanan ice sheets. Slope apron mudstone facies reveal a strong response to high order eustatic events; however, the response of contemporary, easterly sourced, <b>coarse-grade</b> turbidite systems was more complex, with some periods of increased sand and gravel input coinciding with times of rising global sea level. These anomalous relationships are explained by invoking a series of smaller-scale movements in marine base level. It was the interaction of these lower order events with the main eustatic cycles {{that appears to have}} been the primary control on sand and gravel input to the Welsh Basin. An early Telychian expansion of the Nant Brianne turbidite system records a marked increase in tectonically generated sediment at a time of palaeo-plate collision between Baltica/Avalonia and Laurentia before intra- and peri-basinal faulting led to its abandonment as a supply path to the basin centre.

40|$|Historically, asphalt {{mixtures}} in Minnesota {{have been produced}} with fine gradations.

However, when such techniques are used under Mediterranean climatic conditions, the result is high root respiratory activity, which can lead to a rapid drop in oxygen levels and affect root morphology and function, thus having a negative effect on production and final quality. We grew roses to study both the effect of intermittent oxygen supply on the root media by applying the nutrient solution supersaturated with oxygen (technique called oxyfertigation) and the substrate particle size. Root hydraulic conductivity, aerial biomass and leaf of roses for cut-flower production grown in two kinds of perlite (fine-grade and <b>coarse-grade)</b> were assessed. The data indicated a great deal of variability in the parameters of root hydraulic conductivity (Lr) and specific hydraulic conductivity (Lre). Plants grown in fine-grade perlite had a significantly higher Lr and showed greater plant development.

40|$|One of {{the main}} issues that have been {{discussed}} among asphalt technologists is the minimum lift thickness necessary to provide a high probability of adequate compaction under a reasonable compactive effort. In many cases, pavements constructed with thin lifts {{have been difficult to}} compact to the desired density level. Thinner lifts tend to cool faster and prevent particle orientation during compaction. To date, little research has been performed to determine the minimum desired lift thickness needed to facilitate optimum compaction. This research project was undertaken to determine the recommended minimum lift thickness. A total of 36 mixes were designed comprising various gradations and aggregate types. Laboratory samples were prepared using both a Superpave gyratory compactor (SGC) and an automated vibratory compactor (AVC). Seven field sections were also constructed to evaluate the relationship between air voids and thickness to nominal maximum aggregate size (t/NMAS). The results of the study indicated that t/NMAS has {{a significant impact on the}} compactibility of HMA mixtures. For improved compactibility, it is recommended that the t/NMAS be at least 3. 0 for fine-graded mixes and at least 4. 0 for <b>coarse-graded</b> mixes. Layers thinner than that recommended can be constructed but will likely require more compactive effort to achieve adequate density. The cooling rate for mixes less than 38 mm is very high making compaction difficult. Hence for best results, the thickness should be at least 38 mm even during warm weather. Paving in cold weather may require an even greater layer thickness. The work reported in this report was a part of NCHRP 9 - 27...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the use of the Superpave asphalt mix design methodology at the local government level in Minnesota. In the project, researchers combined low-cost natural sand with locally available aggregates from four sources: limestone, quartzite, and partially crushed river gravel, and granite. They evaluated coarse and fine aggregate gradations, along with the use of two asphalt grades. It was difficult to achieve the Superpave volumetric requirements of voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) and voids filled with asphalt (VFA) at 4 percent air voids, regardless of the gradation. A target air void content of 3 percent satisfied the VFA requirement, even though the VMA requirement could not be fulfilled. The fine aggregate gradations produced densities indicating that the mixtures might be tender during construction, but not necessarily be susceptible to rutting. The <b>coarse-graded</b> mixtures did not show the tenderness problem, but did show that they might be susceptible to rutting. Resilient modulus testing showed little or no difference in the mixtures, regardless of aggregate source or gradation. The difference in resilient modulus due to asphalt grade was apparent only at the intermediate temperatures, and not at the highest or lowest test temperatures. Moisture sensitivity testing showed that all the mixtures studied had adequate durability.

40|$|This {{study was}} based on the {{elements}} of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 4 - 19 that focused on the aggregate tests related to the permanent deformation and moisture susceptibility of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavements. Five coarse and six fine aggregates were used in this research program. The effect of these aggregates on the HMA pavement performance was assessed by constructing and testing test sections in the Indiana Department of Transportation/Purdue Accelerated Pavement Testing (INDOT/Purdue APT) facility located in West Lafayette, Indiana. The relationships between the aggregate properties and the HMA pavement performances were analyzed using statistical and regression analyses. The uncompacted voids content of coarse aggregate was found related to the rutting performance of <b>coarse-graded</b> HMA mixtures. The higher the uncompacted voids content value, the higher the resistance of HMA pavements against rutting. The uncompacted voids content of fine aggregates was related to the rutting performance of fine-graded HMA mixtures. The rutting resistance increases with the uncompacted voids content of the fine aggregate. This study also observed that the in-place binder film thickness was related to the rutting performance of fine-graded HMA pavements. The thicker the binder film, the lower the rutting resistance. The methylene blue value (MBV) and the amount of material passing the 0. 075 mm sieve (p 0. 075) of the fine aggregate were related to the stripping potential of fine-graded HMA mixtures. The rutting performance of the fine-graded HMA mixtures under wet conditions was also related to the uncompacted voids content of the fine aggregate. This study also found that the in-place binder film thickness and methylene blue value of p 0. 075 were significantly related to the rutting performance of the fine-graded HMA mixtures tested under wet conditions.

40|$|Authors: Cheng Cui, Brenda Rongish, Charles Little and Rusty Lansford Corresponding author ([rusty@caltech. edu](rusty@caltech. edu)) ### INTRODUCTION The {{transfection}} of GFP-expressing constructs {{into early}} embryos permits key developmental {{events such as}} gastrulation to be dynamically imaged using time-lapse video-microscopy. This protocol describes the ex ovo electroporation of a DNA plasmid into avian embryos as young as stage X, nearly 24 h earlier in development than most electroporation protocols. Compared to in ovo electroporation, the ex ovo method allows easier embryo orientation (the posterior half of the embryo is darker than the anterior half). Thus, positioning of the specimen and consistency of the electroporation site between embryos is improved. Furthermore, nearly all embryos can be electroporated at the same stage using the ex ovo method: If some embryos have not reached a desired stage, {{it is possible to}} temporally stop development of those embryos already at the desired stage by keeping them at room temperature while incubating the rest at 37 °C until they develop. The method described here uses relatively low voltage, and the electroporation chamber can be made easily, with no specialized equipment required. ### RELATED INFORMATION This protocol was adapted from Cui et al. (2006) and incorporates the ex ovo culture method described by New (1955). ### MATERIALS 1. Reagents - Buffered phenol red solution - DNA plasmid of interest (e. g., GFP expression plasmid) - *Store DNA plasmid stocks in endotoxin-free H 2 O. * - DNA purification kit (endotoxin-free) (e. g., Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit, 12362) - Embryonic culture dish - *Prepare by pouring 3 mL of agar substrate into a 35 -mm Petri dish (Fisher Scientific, 0875711 YZ) (Chapman et al. 2001) *. - Embryonic culture insert - *Prepare by pouring 1 mL of agar substrate into a *Millicell insert (Millipore Organotypic culture inserts*, PICMORG- 50) *. - Embryonic phosphate-buffered saline (ePBS) (1 X) - Embryos from Japanese quail eggs (*Coturnix coturnix japonica*) or chicken eggs (unincubated or incubated to desired stage) - *Early embryos in this protocol are staged according to Eyal-Giladi and Kochav (1976) *. - H 2 O, endotoxin-free - Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Mediatech/cellgro, 21 - 020 -CV) - Nail polish (clear) - Clear nail polish acts as an electrical insulator. ### Equipment 1. Coverslips (35 mm, No. 1), glass - Filter paper rings for embryo removal (see Step 8) - Forceps - Incubator at 37 °C - Microcapillaries (1. 0 -mm O. D. with glass filament) (Narishige, GD- 1) - Micromanipulators (2) (Narishige) - Petri dishes (60 mm) (BD Falcon, 353002) - Petri dishes (100 mm) (BD Falcon, 351029) - Picoliter injector (Harvard Instruments, PLI- 100) - Platinum wires (3 × 0. 35 mm and 80 × 0. 3 mm) - Scissors, angled iris (Fine Science Tools, 14063 - 09) - Single-stage glass microelectrode puller (Narishige, PC 10) - Square-pulse electroporator (BEX Co., Ltd., CUY- 21 TM) - Tissues - Transfer pipettes ### METHOD **Construction of Electroporation Chamber** *The use of a glass-bottomed chamber allows the precise placement of the specimen directly over the anode. The chamber is constructed such that the raised segment of the anode is bathed in electrolyte solution (HBSS) during electroporation. When the Millicell insert is centered over the glass window, the insert membrane touches the anode*. 1. Use a 60 -mm polystyrene Petri dish to mark the base of the chamber. - Prepare a cathode (−) consisting of a 3 × 0. 35 -mm platinum wire. Approximately 2 mm from the end, bend the wire at a 45 ° angle (see Fig. 1, top electrode). Using clear nail polish, insulate the wire near the junction where the cathode will be mounted on the micromanipulator. Couple the cathode to a stainless steel rod and mount on a <b>coarse-grade</b> micromanipulator. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. A cross-section of the glass-bottomed electroporation chamber used to electroporate pre-gastrulation stage avian embryos. *The cathode is positioned parallel to the anode during electroporation*. 3. Design an anode (+) that runs along the bottom of the dish using a platinum wire (80 × 0. 3 mm). Bend the wire at the midsection to create a 3 -mm segment that is raised 1 mm above the center of the dish and runs parallel to the dish floor (Fig. 1, bottom electrode). Attach the lengths of wire {{on either side of the}} raised loop to the floor of the dish using clear nail polish. 4. Create a glass-bottomed chamber by boring a 20 -mm hole in the bottoms of both the 60 -mm dish and a 100 -mm Petri dish. Align the holes, and glue the 60 -mm dish inside the 100 -mm dish. Center a 35 -mm No. 1 glass coverslip over the hole, and glue the glass to the underside of the 100 -mm dish. **DNA Plasmid Preparation** 5. Isolate and purify a GFP-expression plasmid (or other DNA plasmid of interest) using an endotoxin-free DNA purification kit, e. g., the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Store the purified stock in endotoxin-free H 2 O. 6. Prepare the plasmid DNA for electroporation by mixing a 5 μg/μL concentrated stock of endotoxin-free plasmid with buffered phenol red solution in a 1 : 1 ratio, such that the final DNA concentration is ~ 2. 5 μg/μL. - *The phenol red allows visualization of the DNA bolus during injection, and serves as an indicator dye during electroporation (see Step 12. vi) *. **Embryo Removal Using Paper Rings** *This technique for isolating and securing chicken embryos on a paper ring is described by Chapman et al. (2001) *. 7. Gently pour the albumen and yolk (with embryo) of a fertile quail or chicken egg into a 100 -mm Petri dish. Use a transfer pipette to remove the thick albumen from the poured contents. Use tissues to remove any albumen remaining on the embryo. 8. Remove the embryo from the yolk: - i. Place a paper ring around the embryo, on the vitelline membrane. - ii. Crimp the paper to the membrane by trimming the ring just inside its outer circumference using angled iris scissors. - iii. Gently grasp the ring at the posterior end of the embryo and remove the specimen. 9. With the ventral side up, gently submerge the specimen in embryo phosphate-buffered saline (ePBS) to remove any adherent yolk. - *Specimens can be stored in embryonic culture dishes at room temperature for several hours if necessary*. **Electroporation of Embryos** *With the use of Millicell inserts (in which the volume of agar substrate and thus the distance between the embryo and anode remain constant) as well as a glass-bottomed chamber (which allows the specimen to be placed directly over the anode), a specimen can be electroporated approximately every 3 min*. 10. Fill the electroporation chamber with HBSS, so that the fluid covers the anode. - *The fluid level must be high enough to be in contact with the underside of the Millicell insert membrane*. 11. Test the electrical continuity of the chamber: - i. Attach the leads to the chamber. Position the cathode parallel to the anode, at a distance of ~ 3 mm. - ii. Program the CUY- 21 TM power supply with the following pulse sequence: 5 V, 40 msec power-on, and 900 msec power-off, for a series of four square wave pulses. - *Bubbles should be visible on the cathode. An amperage value of at least 0. 01 A should be displayed after the completion of the pulse series*. - iii. Decrease the voltage setting to 4 V after conductance has been established. 12. Electroporate the embryo with the DNA plasmid: - i. Place the embryo ventral side down on the center of an embryonic culture (Millicell) insert. Transfer the embryo/insert assembly into the electroporation chamber. Adjust the position of the insert so that the targeted region is centered on the anode. - ii. Break the tip of a previously pulled fine-diameter glass micro-needle with forceps, to obtain a point sharp enough to penetrate the vitelline membrane. Use the technique shown in Figure 2 to push the needle tip through the vitelline membrane at an acute angle (< 45 °), so that the membrane is penetrated without damage to the epiblast. Position the needle tip above the desired region of the epiblast. ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **. A schematic showing the movement of the needle tip used to penetrate the vitelline membrane (V. M.) without damaging the epiblast. The top layer is the vitelline membrane and the lower layer is the epiblast. (A) The needle is lowered to press on the surface of the vitelline membrane. (B) The needle tip is moved to the left until a fold of vitelline membrane is formed over the needle tip. (C) The needle tip is lifted slightly to release the pressure on the epiblast, without losing the vitelline-membrane fold. (D) The needle tip is moved to the left to penetrate through the vitelline membrane. Steps B through D may be repeated until the needle tip penetrates the vitelline membrane. - iii. Set the ballast pressure of the injection apparatus to the P-balance mode. Pump 20 to 100 nL of the DNA/phenol red solution (2. 5 μg/μL plasmid) into the space between the epiblast and the vitelline membrane. - *The P-balance setting allows slow (~ 5 sec), low-pressure delivery (1. 0 psi tend to displace cells and damage the embryo in early stages. Confine the plasmid bolus to a small area in the target region*. - iv. After delivery of the DNA plasmid, remove the glass needle. If necessary, adjust the position of the embryo/insert relative to the anode to correct any displacement caused by the injection. Adjust the cathode to a position parallel to the anode, as close to the specimen as possible without making contact. - v. Apply approximately one to two drops of HBSS to fill the gap between the cathode and the vitelline membrane (Fig. 3 A). Lower the cathode further, until it touches the membrane and a deformation of tissue can be seen (Fig. 3 B). Raise the cathode only until tissue deformation is no longer visible (Fig. 3 C). ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") **Figure 3 **. A schematic showing movement of the cathode for electroporation. Red indicates the injected DNA plasmid solution (with phenol red). Pink indicates the presence of electrolyte solution (HBSS). (A) After the application of one to two drops of HBSS, the cathode is lowered. (B) The cathode is lifted when tissue deformation is seen. (C) The cathode is held in position as soon as tissue deformation is no longer visible. V. M. is vitelline membrane. - vi. Activate the power supply at 4 V. Look for the formation of bubbles at the cathode, as well as a change in the color of the indicator dye from pink to red, to confirm electrical continuity during the pulses. - *To transfect fewer cells within a target area (desired in some cases, such as cell tracking), 3 V may be used for electroporation (see Fig. 4 A,B). If only a small amount of DNA plasmid is pumped to the target region, a small group of cells (~ 100) can be fluorescently labeled (Fig. 4 C) *. ![Figure 4]([URL] "Figure 4 ") **Figure 4 **. Images of GFP-expressing embryos 3. 5 h post-electroporation. (A) Bright-field image of an avian embryo. (B) Enlarged fluorescent image (GFP) of the rectangle box in A, showing that fluorescently labeled cells on the right side of the embryo are sparser than those on the left side when different voltages were used (3 V on right side and 4 V on left side). (C) A small group of cells (~ 100) were fluorescently labeled when a small amount of plasmid DNA was pumped into the region. Scale bars: 250 μm in A, B, and C, and 50 μm in inset picture of C. - vii. Remove the cathode and the embryo/insert assembly from the electroporation chamber. 13. Gently submerge the embryo/insert in an ePBS-filled dish. With the assembly submerged, float the embryo with attached ring away from the agar bed/insert. Transfer to an embryonic culture dish with the ventral side up. - *When it is kept in a 37 °C incubator, the cultured embryo normally can grow up to 40 h after electroporation, or until HH stage 12 *. 14. Culture the specimen for a time sufficient to obtain detectable nuclear fluorescence, according to the vector or fluorescent protein used. - *Using the pH 2 B-cherry expression vector, nuclear fluorescence is detectable ~ 3 h after electroporation. Vectors with less active promoters or fluorescent proteins directed to a large volume will likely require more time to produce an observable fluorescent signal. Using our H 2 B-GFP plasmid the signal can be detected < 2 h after electroporation*. ### DISCUSSION This technique, together with time-lapse imaging methods, allows researchers to study how these fluorescently labeled cells move or change their shapes during gastrulation. The technique can be extended when other reagents are used to study functionality of certain genes. For example, a specific gene can be over-expressed, and/or ectopically expressed, by electroporating a plasmid encoding the gene of interest. Alternatively, the functionality of a specific ligand can be down-regulated with the electroporation of a plasmid encoding the dominant-negative receptor for the ligand. A morpholino can also be used to interfere with a targeted gene pathway. ### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was funded in part by the American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship (0620105 Z) to C.

Self-regular formulations lead to highly effective BEM algorithms that utilize standard conforming boundary elements and low-order Gaussian integrations. Both formulations are discussed and implemented for two-dimensional potential problems, and numerical results are presented. Potential results show that the use of quartic interpolations is requitred for the flux-BIE to show comparable accuracy to the potential-BIE using quadratic interpolations. On the other hand, flux error results in the potential-BIE implementation can be dominated by the numerical integration of the logarithmic kernel of the remaining weakly singular integral. Accuracy of these flux results does not improve beyond a certain level when using standard quadrature together with a special transformation, but when an alternative logarithmic quadrature scheme is used these errors are shown to reduce abruptly, and the flux results converge monotonically to the exact answer. In the flux-BIE implementation, where all integrals are regularized, flux results accuracy improves systematically, even with some oscillations, when refining the mesh or increasing the order of the interpolating function. The flux-BIE approach presents a great numerical sensitivity to the mesh generation scheme and refinement. Accurate results for the potential and the flux were obtained for <b>coarse-graded</b> meshes in which the rate of change of the tangential derivative of the potential was better approximated. This numerical sensitivity and the need for graded meshes were not found in the elasticity problem for which self-regular formulations have also been developed using a similar approach. Logarithmic quadrature to evaluate the weakly singular integral is implemented in the self-regular potential-BIE, showing that the magnitude of the error is dependent only on the standard Gauss integration of the regularized integral, but not on this logarithmic quadrature of the weakly singular integral. The self-regular potential-BIE is compared with the standard (CPV) formulation, showing the equivalence between these formulations. The self-regular BIE formulations and computational algorithms are established as robust alternatives to singular BIE formulations for potential problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work {{is to provide a}} {{description}} of the Troll Field reservoir hydrodynamic model, integrating the depositional and structural model with formation fluid pressure data. First of all, an overall overview of the North Sea Basin inception, with structural and stratigraphy evolution, is given, being followed by a description of facies and paleo-environments of the Sognefjord Formation. The Sognefjord Formation is an important reservoir for oil and its paleo-environment is given by cyclic progradation of spit system, with intervening flooding events and tide-dominate coastal plains eastwards. A typical vertical section of the Sognefjord formation is characterized by offshore fine- to medium-graded bioturbated transition sandstones, passing upward to lower shoreface sandstones, up to shoreface and foreshore <b>coarse-graded</b> sandstone. Intervening thin siltstone intervals mark flooding events. The offlapping geometry of this succession reflects the progradation of spit system, which is flanked eastwards by muddy- tide-dominated coastal plain deposits with ondulatory geometric in seismic section. In tidal facies heterolithic deposits were developed in tidal flats or tidal channel, whereas seawards mouth bars, sandy ridges, muddy shelf and prodelta deposits can be found in some area. A faults swarm within the Troll Field developed during the Kimmeridgian and affected the reservoir units. After describing Troll Field paleoenvironment, a batch of formation fluid pressure data have been collected from seven wellbores and then plotted in a pressure-depth diagram. Fluid pressure gradients have been calculated and then compared with theoretical hydrostatic ones. The quantification of the shift between the formation fluid pressure data and theoretical hydrostatic gradient has allowed to calculate overpressure values. Both gas-oil- and oil-water-contact have also been measured, whose related depths have provided a first clue of poor laterally communication. The presence of this overpressure system is justified by existence of the lateral and overlying, poorly porous-permeable formations. These units do not enable fluids to drain. Once differences of overpressure among wellbores have been defined, a depositional and structural model has been developed. This model takes into account the alternation of sandstone and siltstone that point to a “shale smearing” model, considered to be the main control factor of the seal efficiency and responsible of overpressure differences. ...|$|E
