Ion modulation of its catalytic activity was studied in membranes of CHO-K 1 cells (Chinese-hamster ovary K 1 cells) using L-leucine-p-nitroanilide as substrate. The planar bidentate <b>chelators</b> 1, 10 -phenanthroline and 2, 2 ′-bipyridine inhibited the activity in a concentration-dependent manner with Hill slopes of 3. 32 ± 1. 78 and 2. 10 ± 0. 26 respectively. The acetic acid-containing <b>chelators</b> EDTA, EGTA and DTPA (diethylenetriamine-N,N,N′,N″,N″-penta-acetic acid) weakly affected the activity, but they increased the potency of the planar <b>chelators</b> up to a limit, at which Hill slopes became close to unity. Moreover, competition between 1, 10 -phenanthroline and the substrate only took place in the presence of EDTA. These findings are compatible with a model in which the bidentate <b>chelators</b> inhibit enzyme activity by decreasing the free Zn 2 + concentration.

25|$|Iron {{overload}} is {{an unavoidable}} consequence of chronic transfusion therapy, necessary {{for patients with}} beta thalassemia. Iron chelation is a medical therapy that avoids the complications of iron overload. The iron overload can be removed by Deferasirox, an oral iron <b>chelator,</b> which has a dose- dependent effect on iron burden. Every unit of transfused blood contains 200–250mg of iron and the body has no natural mechanism to remove excess iron Deferasirox is a vital part in the patients health after blood transfusions. During normal iron homeostasis the circulating iron is bound to transferrin, but with an iron overload, the ability for transferrin to bind iron is exceeded and non-transferrin bound iron is formed. It represents a potentially toxic iron form due to its high propensity to induce oxygen species and is responsible for cellular damage. The prevention of iron overload protects patients from morbidity and mortality. The primary aim is to bind to and remove iron from the body and a rate equal to the rate of transfusional iron input or greater than iron input. During clinical trails patients that received Deferasirox experienced no drug-related neutropenia or agranulocytosis, which was present with other iron chelators. Its long half life requires it to be taken once daily and provides constant chelation. Cardiac failure is a main cause of illness from transfusional iron overload but deferasirox demonstrated the ability to remove iron from iron-loaded myocardial cells protecting beta thalassemia patients from effects of required blood transfusions.|$|E

Novel, highly cell permeable iron <b>chelators,</b> pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) and pyridoxal ortho-chlorobenzoyl hydrazone (o- 108) were compared to the present mainstay, desferrioxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (L 1), in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|Purpose of Review Chelation {{therapy is}} used for {{diseases}} causing an imbalance of iron levels (for example haemochromatosis and thalassaemia) or copper levels (for example Menkes’ and Wilson’s diseases). Currently, most pharmaceutical <b>chelators</b> are relatively simple but often have side effects. Some have been taken off the market. This review attempts to find theory and knowledge required to design or find better <b>chelators.</b> Recent Findings Recent research attempting to understand the biological mechanisms of protection against iron and copper toxicity is reviewed. Understanding of molecular mechanisms behind normal iron/copper regulation {{may lead to the}} design of more sophisticated <b>chelators.</b> The theory of metal ion toxicity explains why some <b>chelators,</b> such as EDTA, which chelate metal ions in a way which exposes the ion to the surrounding environment are shown to be unsuitable except as a means of killing cancer cells. The Lewis theory of acids and bases suggests which amino acids favour the attachment of the hard/intermediate ions Fe 2 +, Fe 3 +, Cu 2 + and soft ion Cu+. Non-polar amino acids will chelate the ion in a position not in contact with the surrounding cellular environment. The conclusion is that only the soft ion binding cysteine and methionine appear as suitable <b>chelators.</b> Clearly, nature has developed proteins which are less restricted. Recent research on naturally produced <b>chelators</b> such as siderophores and phytochemicals show some promise as pharmaceuticals.

We have previously shown that the chemically unrelated iron <b>chelators</b> desferrioxamine and deferiprone inhibit the growth and induce the apoptosis of HPV-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines, suggesting that iron <b>chelators</b> may represent a potential therapeutic approach {{for the treatment of}} cervical carcinoma. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of iron deprivation on the growth of human cervical carcinoma xenografts in athymic nude mice. METHODS: Nude mice (nu/nu) of BALB/c background were treated with iron <b>chelators</b> [desferrioxamine (DFO), deferiprone (L 1), or starch-DFO conjugate] or were fed with an iron-poor diet 6 weeks prior to subcutaneous injection of Si-Ha cells. These treatments were continued for 5 weeks after injection of the tumor cells. Treatment with the maximum tolerated doses of DFO, L 1, or starch-DFO conjugate induced no significant iron deprivation in non-iron-overloaded mice, while an iron-poor diet led to a dramatic decrease in serum iron, transferrin iron saturation, and ferritin levels. However, neither iron <b>chelators</b> nor an iron-poor diet could significantly inhibit tumor growth. CONCLUSION: Despite a potent antitumor effect in vitro, iron <b>chelators</b> fail to prevent the growth of cervical carcinoma xenografts in mice.
