Hypospadias, a <b>crippling</b> <b>deformity</b> of the male genitalia that prevents normal urinary and sexual function, occurs in approximately one in every 150 boys. Other urological conditions such as urinary incontinence and bladder and kidney malformations require specialized care, yet {{there are very few}} medical personnel worldwide trained in pediatric urology. In fact, the entire continent of Africa has fewer than five pediatric urologists despite the fact that 50 percent of the region’s 750 million people are under the age of 18 and 17 percent are under the age of 5 (source: UNICEF, 2008). This enormous patient population often has nowhere to turn for the care it needs. Physicians in the developing world lack the resources to travel outside their home countries for training.

40|$|Many of us vividly {{recall the}} devastating effects of point source mercury (Hg) {{pollution}} in Minimata Bay, Japan, documented by poignant photos of mothers {{caring for their}} children afflicted with <b>crippling</b> <b>deformities.</b> From 1952 to 1968, Hg waste from the production of acetalde-hyde and vinyl chloride was discharged (200 – 600 tons) into Minimata Bay.

40|$|Aeromonas hydrophila is an {{uncommon}} and frequently overlooked cause {{of skin and}} soft-tissue infection.

We report a case of severe necrotizing fasciitis due to A. hydrophila infection involving the hand and arm, complicated by septicemia within 30 hours of injury. In addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy and general supportive care, treatment involves early surgical exploration for compartment decompression and aggressive debridement of all necrotic tissue followed by skin grafting for delayed wound closure. There was good functional outcome after more than 1 year of follow-up.

40|$|Background: Primary total elbow {{arthroplasty}} (TEA) is {{a challenging}} procedure for orthopedic surgeons. It is not performed {{as frequently as}} compared to hip or knee arthroplasty. The elbow is a nonweight-bearing joint; however, static loading can create forces up to three times the body weight and dynamic loading up to six times. For elderly patients with deformity and ankylosis of the elbow due to posttraumatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis or comminuted fracture distal humerus, arthroplasty {{is one of the}} option. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the role of primary total elbow arthroplasty in cases of <b>crippling</b> <b>deformity</b> of elbow. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 11 cases of TEA, between December 2002 and September 2012. There were 8 females and 3 males. The average age was 40 years (range 30 - 69 years). The indications for TEA were rheumatoid arthritis, comminuted fracture distal humerus with intraarticular extension, and posttraumatic bony ankylosis of elbow joint. The Baksi sloppy (semi constrained) hinge elbow prosthesis was used. Clinico-radiological followup was done at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly basis. Results: In the present study, average supination was 70 ° (range 60 - 80 °) and average pronation was 70 ° (range 60 - 80 °). Average flexion was 135 ° (range 130 - 135 °). However, in 5 cases, there was loss of 15 to 35 ° (average 25 °) of extension (45 °) out of 11 cases. The mean Mayo elbow performance score was 95. 4 points (range 70 - 100). Arm length discrepancy was only in four patients which was 36 % out of 11 cases. Clinico-radiologically all the elbows were stable except in one case and no immediate postoperative complication was noted. Radiolucency or loosening of ulnar stem was seen in 2 cases (18 %) out of 11 cases, in 1 case it was noted after 5 years and in another after 10 years. In second case, revision arthroplasty was done, in which only ulnar hinge section, hinge screw and lock screw with hexagonal head were replaced. Conclusion: Elbow arthroplasty remains a valuable option for deformed and ankylosed elbows especially in the demanding patients with <b>crippling</b> <b>deformity</b> of the elbow...|$|E
40|$|Gold salts {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of rheumatoid arthritis for nearly 40 years. Their effectiveness, while not consistent, has been well established (Freyberg, 1966) and their use continues. Recently, conflicting results concerning the effective-ness of gold salts on adjuvant arthritis in rats have been reported (Newbould, 1963; Jessop and Currey, 1968). Adjuvant arthritis, a <b>crippling</b> <b>deformity</b> resulting from diffuse connective tissue involvement, is considered by some authorities to be the best available experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis because of its strong clinical and pathological siinilarities to the human disease (Pearson, 1963), and because it can be effectively treated with most antiarthritic drugs it is widely used to evaluate potential therapeutic agents. By employing highly inbred (Lewis) rats as our experimental animals and utilizing a volume-displacement apparatus to measure the arthritic lesions objectively, we have obtained an arthritic model that is highly sensitive in detecting anti-arthritic activity. In light of conflicting reports in the literature, we have re-evaluated the effectiveness of gold salts in adjuvant arthritis in rats under our test conditions. Material and method...|$|E
40|$|Alhough leprosy {{is a very}} ancient disease, it is {{only within}} {{the last few decades}} that it has come into the orbit of the physiotherapist. Yet today, the place of {{physiotherapy}} in the treatment of leprosy is being increasingly recognised. The cry, as in most fields, is that there are not enough physiotherapists to meet the need, and so there are thousands, perhaps more accurately, millions, of leprosy patients who are condemned to a life marred by <b>crippling</b> <b>deformity,</b> which could have been prevented if only … there had been a physiotherapist available to teach others the techniques of re-education, and if only … there was a physiotherapist available to do some research into more effective methods of treating the early signs of nerve damage and muscle weakness. If only … there was a physiotherapist available to give advice and help to those who, with inadequate training, are now doing what they can do to prevent these unnecessary deformities. This is, I feel, the challenge to the physiotherapist—to teach and to research, because economically {{it would be impossible to}} maintain the number of physiotherapists needed to cope adequately with the number of patients. It is estimated that there are about 15 million leprosy patients in the world today, and estimating on the incidence of deformity in a sampling of 2, 000 out-patients in the Republic of Korea, about 40 per cent of these have some motor paralysis, leading, if untreated, to deformity. The incidence of leprosy is highest in the underdeveloped and developing countries of Asia and Africa, where the economic structure is such that the health budget is inadequate to meet all the varied needs. It is in these same countries where tuberculosis and other infectious diseases are rife, and where the economic standing of both people and governments is low...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Deficiency of {{clotting}} factors VIII and IX {{leads to}} haemohphilia A and B both inherited as sex-linked recessive pattern. There are significant variations of genetic make up in ethnic population of India {{as well as}} clinical variants of haemophilia A and B and may form <b>crippling</b> <b>deformities</b> due to bleeding at different sites if not treated early. In view of their rarity {{due to lack of}} awareness and non availability of high cost factor replacement, management of haemophilia is a problem in India. Moreover, the prevention of haemophilic birth is limited due to absence of facilities of detection of carriers of haemophilics and prenatal diagnosis. The use of factor VIII and factor IX prepared from human plasma for treatment leads to tranamissible viral infection (HBV, HCV, HIV) so common in India. The absence of factors from ãDNA technology limits the prophylaxis and curative treatment. The inherited disorders of blood coagulation present providers of health and social care with formidable problems. The disorders are eminently treatable, even in their severest form. Untreated, they result in handicaps in early life, while proper treatment is expensive, inadequate treatment is even more so, both to the individual and to th...|$|R

40|$|Rhinoplasty {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} surgical procedures in plastic surgery. It is not surprising that a significant number of patients end up with unfavourable outcomes. Many of these unfavourable outcomes could be the result of poor judgment and wrong decision making. Most frequently, the unfavourable outcome is the result of errors in surgical technique. In this paper, unfavourable outcomes resulting from errors in surgical technique are discussed under the heading of each operative step. Poor placement of intra-nasal incision can result in internal valve obstruction. Bad columellar scars can result from errors during open rhinoplasty. Unfavourable results associated with skeletonisation are mentioned. Tip plasty, being the most difficult part of rhinoplasty, can result in lack of tip projection, asymmetry and deformities associated with placement of tip grafts. Over-resection of the lower lateral cartilages during tip plasty can also result in pinched nose, alar collapse causing external valve obstruction and other alar rim deformities. Humpectomy can result in open roof deformity, inverted V deformity and over-resection resulting in saddle nose. The so-called poly beak deformity is also a preventable unfavourable outcome when dealing with a large dorsal hump. Complications resulting from osteotomies include narrowing of nasal airway, open roof deformity, inverted V deformity and asymmetry of the bony wall resulting from incomplete or green stick fractures. Judicious use of grafts can be very rewarding. By the same token, grafts also carry with them the risk of complications. Allografts can result in recurrent infection, atrophy of the overlying skin and extrusion resulting in <b>crippling</b> <b>deformities.</b> Autografts are recommended by the author. Unfavourable results from autografts include displacement of graft, visibility of the graft edges, asymmetry, warping, and resorption...|$|R

As in the case of many chronic degenerative diseases, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation has been considered to play an important role, even in the pathogenesis of chronic fluoride toxicity. However, there is inconclusive proof for an altered oxidative stress and antioxidant balance in fluorosis, and the existing data are not only conflicting but also contradictory.

40|$|Genodermatoses {{are one of}} {{the major}} causes of {{long-term}} morbidity including <b>crippling</b> <b>deformities</b> and mortality worldwide. Though, the last twenty years have witnessed incredible advancements in the field of genodermatoses but it mainly remained limited to the western populations. Unfortunately, the human genetic research in developing countries including Pakistan is not up to the mark. Highly conserved and genetically diverse ethnic groups quite different from Caucasians are the major contributors of Pakistani population. Continuous practice of consanguinity in these highly conserved groups has left large numbers of Pakistani families suffering from variety of hereditary disorders including genodermatoses and hence, holds great potential for genetic studies. To address the issue, seventeen families suffering from different types of genodermatoses including xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), lipoid proteinosis (LP) and different form of ichthyosis were clinically and genetically characterized. Traditional linkage analysis and high-throughput next-generation sequencing approaches were utilized to establish molecular basis of these genodermatoses. Several bioinformatics parameters as well as functional studies were also opted to assess impact of functional variants on skin phenotypes. Genetic characterization of a family with typical phenotypes of XP including severe sunburn, blisters, and ulcers on different parts of the body revealed a novel homozygous c. 654 delA deletion in the XPA gene. Deletion not only substituted lysine with asparagine (p. L 218 A) but also resulted in premature termination of XPA protein just 5 residues downstream from the point of deletion (p. K 218 NfsX 5). Comparative protein structure modeling and analysis predicted incomplete synthesis of XPA protein product as a pathogenic cause of XP in this family. Ethnically diverse four LP families with hoarse voice, limited tongue mobility, waxy papules along the margins of both eyelids and thick yellowish skin revealed same homozygous nonsense c. 742 G>T transversion in the ECM 1 gene.

The young man developed lasting relationships with many progressive leaders teaching at Columbia, including John Dewey, Charles Beard, and James Harvey Robinson.

5|$|With Merrick {{admitted}} into the hospital, Treves now {{had time to}} conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over {{the previous two years}} and that he had become quite <b>crippled</b> by his <b>deformities.</b> Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and that he had only a few years left to live. Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him. The problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.|$|R
40|$|Background: Dupuytren’s disease {{encompasses}} {{a spectrum of}} fibroblastic disorders from the presence of 1 – 2 nodules {{in the palm of}} a hand with no joint contracture to grotesque, <b>crippling</b> and disabling <b>deformities</b> of hands. Over the last 50 years, many enlightening studies have been forthcoming, which, through techniques of histopathology, biochemistry, tissue culture, and electron microscopy, have shed pearls of light on various aspects of the disease process. Methods: A comprehensive review of the literature on Dupuytren’s disease was undertaken, stringing together results from numerous studies to establish a table of events and their location {{in the development of the}} disease. Results: What will be seen is a credible scenario of events which will enable the clinician to be more proactive in the earlier treatment of the disease and more aware of factors that increase or decrease recurrence rates postoperatively. Conclusions: The most effective management of Dupuytren’s disease is early recognition and treatment of the nodule, before the development of a joint contracture, particularly of a proximal interphalangeal joint. As there is evidence of a significant inflammatory role in the development of the nodule, the process of fibroplasia can be minimized by altering the macrophage > fibroblast > collagen cascade by the intralesional injection of a potent anti-inflammatory agent such as triamcinolone, which also blocks tissue inhibitors of collagenase, thus enhancing the action of native collagenase, and reduces the size and firmness of nodules and, at least temporarily, arrests their progression...|$|R

There are the same dirty beggars stopping in their muttered prayers to beg; the same miserable <b>cripples</b> exhibiting their <b>deformity</b> at the doors; the same blind men, rattling little pots like kitchen pepper- castors: their depositories for alms; the same preposterous crowns of silver stuck upon the painted heads of single saints and Virgins in crowded pictures, so that a little figure on a mountain has a head-dress bigger than the temple in the foreground, or adjacent miles of landscape; the same favourite shrine or figure, smothered with little silver hearts and crosses, and the like: the staple trade and show of all the jewellers; the same odd mixture of respect and indecorum, faith and phlegm: kneeling on the stones, and spitting on them, loudly; getting up from prayers to beg a little, or to pursue some other worldly matter: and then kneeling down again, to resume the contrite supplication at the point where it was interrupted. In one church, a kneeling lady got up from her prayer, for a moment, to offer us her card, as a teacher of Music; and in another, a sedate gentleman with a very thick walking-staff, arose from his devotions to belabour his dog, who was growling at another dog: and whose yelps and howls resounded through the church, as his master quietly relapsed into his former train of meditation--keeping his eye upon the dog, at the same time, nevertheless.|$|R

Out of the 122, our main subject of inquiry to, 4 were crippled or maimed.

The fact {{that as many as}} 67 of the crippled had never been subjected to treatment astounded and appalled the co-workers. These facts lead to the followingconclusions: 1) That many families are ashamed to wish to conceal their crippled. 2) That superstition, ignorance and indifference obstruct preventive measures and medical treatment. 3) That many though aware of the benifits of orthopaedic treatment cannot afford it. 4) That an alarmingly large number of children are suffering due to inadequate or sometimes harmful misguided non-medical cures. 5) That though as many as 38 % require specialized institutional care, accomodations are almost non-existent.
