Although it is {{possible}} to present XML Schema graphically, such representations do not raise the level of abstraction for XML schemata in the same way traditional <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> raise the level of abstraction for data schemata.

25|$|The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model (ISO/IEC 7498-1) is a <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> {{that characterizes}} and standardizes the {{internal}} functions of a communication system by partitioning it into abstraction layers. The {{model is a}} product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The model groups similar communication functions into one of seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that make up the contents of that path. Two instances at one layer are connected by a horizontal connection on that layer.|$|E
25|$|Various sources can {{contribute}} {{to a range of}} simulation results. The range of the simulation results is defined as model uncertainty. One of the most important sources not possible to quantify is the <b>conceptual</b> <b>model,</b> which is developed and defined by the modeller. Further sources are the parameterization of the model regarding the hydraulic (only when simulating transport) and mineralogical properties. The parameters used for the geochemical simulations can also contribute to model uncertainty. These are the applied thermodynamic database and the parameters for the kinetic minerals dissolution. Differences in the thermodynamic data (i.e. equilibrium constants, parameters for temperature correction, activity equations and coefficients) can result in large uncertainties. Furthermore, the large spans of experimentally derived rate constants for minerals dissolution rate laws can cause large variations in simulation results. Despite this is well-known, uncertainties are not frequently considered when conducting geochemical modelling.|$|E

40|$|<b>Conceptual</b> <b>modelling</b> {{continues}} to be an important means for graphically capturing the requirements of an information system. Observations of modelling practice suggest that modellers often use multiple <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> in combination, because they articulate different aspects of real-world domains. Yet, the available empirical as well as theoretical research in this area has largely studied the use of single models, or single modelling grammars. We develop a theory about the use of multiple <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> in combination, by extending an existing theory of ontological expressiveness of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modelling</b> grammars. Our new theory posits that multiple <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> are used to increase the maximum coverage of the real-world domain being modelled, whilst trying to minimize the ontological overlap between the models. We illustrate how the theory can be applied to analyse sets of <b>conceptual</b> <b>models.</b> We develop several propositions of the theory about evaluations of model combinations in terms of users’ selection, understandability and usefulness of <b>conceptual</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

500|$|A {{particular}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> of {{the motor}} circuit and its alteration with PD has been of great influence since 1980, although some limitations have been pointed out which have led to modifications. In this model, the basal ganglia normally exert a constant inhibitory influence {{on a wide range}} of motor systems, preventing them from becoming active at inappropriate times. When a decision is made to perform a particular action, inhibition is reduced for the required motor system, thereby releasing it for activation. Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition, so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote motor activity, while low levels of dopamine function, such as occur in PD, demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement. Thus, the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce hypokinesia, an overall reduction in motor output. [...] Drugs that are used to treat PD, conversely, may produce excessive dopamine activity, allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing dyskinesias.|$|E

40|$|<b>Conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> is the {{practice}} of formally describing a real-world domain to enable better understanding and communication among stakeholders. It provides a basis for design during the development of information systems. In a sequential approach to system development projects (e. g., via traditional waterfall methodologies), a priori specification of system requirements via complete, clear <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> scripts is deemed essential {{to the success of}} a project. In the current practice of system development, however, non-sequential methodologies such as agile methodologies are gaining increasing prominence. <b>Conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> supposedly does not have a primary role to play in these methodologies. Nonetheless, use of these methodologies seems not to have increased failure rates in system development projects, even though they are deemed to downplay the role of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling.</b> My research uses an ontological perspective on <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> to explore {{the practice}} of system development when agile methodologies are used. I conducted an interpretive field study involving semi-structured interviews with eight highly experienced practitioners to explore the context and methods of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> in agile settings. I provide an explanation of the anomalies that exist in the perceived role of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> when using agile methodologies, compared to waterfall methodologies. Based on the findings of my study, I have concluded that contrary to much current rhetoric, {{the practice of}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> is not becoming obsolete in agile methodologies. Rather, its importance is growing. This outcome is occurring with agile methodologies for two reasons. First, information is increasingly recognised as a concrete asset that brings value to organisations. Therefore, procedures such as <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> that enable information about domain semantics to be extracted more easily are gaining significance. Second, advances in technological infrastructures have enabled practitioners to focus more on a domain’s semantics as many system implementation details are becoming standardised. In spite of growing significance of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling,</b> the findings of my study indicate that fundamental differences exist between <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> practice in agile methodologies and traditional sequential methodologies. The differences are twofold. First, agile methodologies differ from sequential methodologies in terms of the level of granularity of the <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> used to represent domain semantics. In agile methodologies, detailed, a priori specifications of domain semantics are not needed. Instead, domains are often represented only in terms of their main subject matter. In this regard, <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> in agile methodologies are deemed to be coarse-grained representations of domains (compared to their sequential counterparts that attempt to provide complete, finely grained representations of domains). Second, the results of my study show that the practice of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> is influenced by the context and overall objective of the information system for which the <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> are developed. While formalisation of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> in traditional methodologies seems to be unaffected by different types of information systems that exist, a theme of System Taxonomy emerged through the analysis of data in my study. This theme indicates that domain uncertainty and volatility, as well as the overall objectives of different information systems, influence the practice of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> in agile system development. My study makes contributions to the body of knowledge through development of new concepts and provision of rich insights about real-life practices of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling.</b> It also expands the boundaries of current theories about <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> (initially developed in sequential settings) by showing their relevance, at least in part, in non-sequential settings...|$|R
