50|$|Metallisation is {{performed}} using a physical vapour deposition process. Aluminium {{is the most common}} metal used for deposition, but other metals such as nickel or chromium are also used. The metal is heated and evaporated under vacuum. This condenses on the cold polymer film, which is unwound near the metal vapour source. This coating is much thinner than a metal foil could be made, in the range of 0.5 micrometres. This coating will not fade or discolour over time. While oriented polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are the most common films used for metallisation, nylon, polyethylene and <b>cast</b> <b>polypropylene</b> are also used.|$|E

Film temperature and thickness profiles are predicted. The effects of shear-thinning, relaxation time, and die-design on the final film thickness are evaluated. Temperature variations are investigated by means of the pseudo -time concept. The process dependence on the rheological characteristics of the viscoelastic fluid, the die-design through the history effects, the conditions at the take-up end, and the film temperature is discussed.

Four different retort pouch structures were used; namely <b>cast</b> <b>polypropylene</b> (CPP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/silicon oxide-coated nylon/CPP (SIOX), Aluminum oxide-coated PET/nylon/CPP (ALOX), and PET/aluminum foil/CPP (FOIL).|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} bar sealing {{parameters}} on the heat seal strength of oriented polypropylene (OPP) /metallic <b>cast</b> <b>polypropylene</b> (MCPP) laminate film was investigated. Based {{on the results}} obtained from the parametric study, a bar sealing process window was developed. All points drop within the process window are combinations of platen temperature and dwell time that produce acceptable heat seal. Optimum combinations are indicated by the lower border of the window. The plateau initiation temperature, Tpi of OPP/MCPP laminate film {{used in the present}} study occurred before the final melting temperature, Tmf of the sealant material. The highest achievable heat seal strength was at the plateau region, and the corresponding failure modes were delaminating, tearing or combine failure modes (delaminating and tearing). Minimum pressure level of 1. 25 bars is necessary to bring the laminate interface into intimate contact in order to effect sealing...|$|E

These applications require {{a substantial amount of}} energy that can be produced using capacitor technologies. Novel molecular dielectrics are now being incorporated in capacitors to achieve high energies, and high polarizability. In this project, different methods of characterizing the molecular chromophore porphyrin were evaluated. The first approach was to spin <b>cast</b> <b>polypropylene</b> doped with Zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) or zinc diphenylporphyrin (ZnDPP) onto gold sputtered wafers which were to be characterized using a newly constructed capacitance testing device. Analysis of the data produced by this device suggested other potential characterization methods, including the fabrication of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) Sandwich Cells and the use of microfabrication techniques. Multi-layering porphyin thin film layers was also under experimentation.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Improvements in fly ash based {{concrete}} {{strength in}} compression and flexural direction {{are the main}} objectives of this study. The compressive and flexure strength of concrete for various mixture proportions of concrete containing the inclusions of different percentage of polypropylene fibers from 0 % to 0. 3 % and fly ash replacement levels at 25 %, 50 % of fly ash were investigated. The experimental test results showed that PP fibers possess increased extensibility and tensile strength, both at first crack and at ultimate, particular under flexural loading; and the fibers were able to hold the matrix together even after extensive cracking. The net result of all these is to impart to the fiber composite pronounced post – cracking ductility which is absence of ordinary concrete. To {{provide a basis for}} comparison, reference concrete specimens were <b>cast</b> without <b>polypropylene</b> fiber. The experimental test result showed that the addition of polypropylene fibers at 0. 1 % volume fraction (Vf) showed a consistent improvement in the concrete strength of 44. 50 MPa and 55. 50 MPa at 7 and 28 days respectively...|$|R
40|$|A degradable/polar/hydrophobic/ionic (D-PHI) {{polyurethane}} with properties {{intended to}} promote tissue regeneration {{in a small}} diameter peripheral artery vascular graft was evaluated for cell biocompatibility and growth. Films were <b>cast</b> in <b>polypropylene</b> 96 well plates for monocyte/endothelial cell (EC) co-culture in vitro studies and porous scaffold discs were implanted in an in vivo subcutaneous mouse model. After 7 days in culture the co-culture demonstrated cell adhesion and growth, low esterase activity (a measure of degradative potential and cell activation), no detectable release of pro-inflammatory cytokine (tumour necrosis factor -α) but measurable anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL) - 10. The EC and the co-culture expressed the EC biomarker CD 31, whereas the monocyte monoculture did not. Cytokine array analysis of the in vivo characterization of D-PH supported an anti-inflammatory phenotype of cells {{at the site of}} the implant. Levels of IL- 6 significantly decreased over time while IL- 10 was significantly higher at 6 weeks post implant. TNF-α levels did not change significantly from 24 hours onwards, however the trend was towards lesser amounts following the initial time point. Histological analysis of the explanted scaffolds showed excellent tissue ingrowth and vascularization. A live/dead stain showed that the cells infiltrating the scaffolds were viable. Both the in vitro and in vivo results of this thesis indicate that D-PHI is a good candidate material for tissue engineering a peripheral artery vascular graft...|$|R
40|$|A rubber {{modified}} <b>cast</b> <b>polypropylene</b> {{film has}} been tested by the essential work of fracture method to assess the effect of material orientation on the fracture toughness. The tests have been performed under different quasi-static rates, in order to analyze the strain rate effects on the material toughness: impact rates were also considered, but results are still at a preliminary stage. Results indicate a marked anisotropy with higher essential work of fracture values for cracks propagating transversally to the extrusion direction. Fracture toughness in both direction is substantially independent of testing speed up to 500 mm/min and markedly decreases under impact conditions. Furthermore, the specific essential work of fracture was partitioned into two terms, one representing the specific work for yielding up to the onset of fracture, and another term related to the specific work for subsequent necking and tearing. Scanning electron microscopy observations have been conducted to reveal fracture surfaces morphology. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three {{different}} {{plastic packaging}} (CPP, LDPE and HDPE) were researched on preservation of carp in this study, and the indicatiors of color difference and sensory evaluation were tracked. Color difference of carp block muscle was analyzed by CR- 400 chroma meter, {{and the value}} of L*, a* and b * were measured at different stage of storage. At the same time, sensory evaluation was conducted. The results showed that the value of L * a * and b * all increased along with storage days, which indicated that the color of the carp block skin turning lighter, redder and yellower. The material of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) could be better for keeping muscle color of carp during storage. However, the results of sensory evaluation showed that <b>Cast</b> <b>Polypropylene</b> (CPP) was better for keeping shelf quality of carp block. There was negative correlation between color difference and sensory evaluation. The value of b * could better represent sensory score in MAP, for it was correlate significantly with sensory evaluation in all three types of packaging...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Banana blossom is an {{excellent}} source of crude fiber in the human diet. Hot water blanching adopted at cottage level is found ineffective for preserving the banana blossom due to enzymatic browning which reduces market demand of the processed product. Therefore, attempts were made to develop a ready-to-cook dehydrated product from the banana blossoms, while maintaining the quality and minimizing enzymatic browning and use of controversial sulfating agents. Cutting the banana blossoms into slices of 3 mm directly into a 0. 2 % citric acid solution and keeping the slices immersed for 30 minute duration followed by drying at 50 oC for 6 hr gave an acceptable product with respect to appearance, flavor and overall quality. The quality of the product remained almost unchanged when stored in Aluminum foil laminated with high density polyethylene (Al/HDPE) for more than a month. Oriented polypropylene laminated with <b>cast</b> <b>polypropylene</b> (OPP/CPP) was by far inferior for storage of the dehydrated banana blossom, of which moisture content increased by 2. 9 % and L ’ value decreased from 41. 23 to 37. 42...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} functionalize {{the surface of}} blown low-density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) and <b>cast</b> <b>polypropylene</b> (CPP) films, and ultimately to maximize the attachment of active molecules onto them, the optimum treatment parameters of capacitively-coupled radio-frequency (13. 56 [*]MHz) oxygen plasma were investigated by using contact angle, toluidine blue dye assay, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Contact angle values of LDPE and CPP samples decreased significantly after oxygen plasma treatment. They further decreased as the plasma power level increased. The treatment time had no substantial effect on contact angle value. The optimum treatment conditions for LDPE and CPP films for maximizing carboxyl functionality without causing observable surface changes {{were found to be}} 200 [*]W/ 200 [*]mTorr and 250 [*]W/ 50 [*]mTorr, respectively, when treated for 3 [*]min. The maximum carboxyl group concentration obtained with LDPE and CPP films were 0. 46 and 0. 56 [*]nmol/cm 2, respectively. The percent of oxygen atoms on the surface of plasma-treated LDPE and CPP films was determined by XPS analysis to be 22. 6 and 28. 7...|$|E
40|$|Owing to {{remarkable}} features, such as self-cleaning, anti-biofouling {{and drag}} reduction, interest on rendering surfaces water-repellent has significantly grown within this decade. Attempts on making surfaces superhydrophobic, where high water contact angle (above 150 degrees) accompanied with only few degrees of roll-off angle, have been extensively demonstrated through the mimicking {{of the surface}} chemistry and morphology of lotus leaves. This appealing phenomenon also exists on another structure from nature: surfaces comprising soft hairs. Although the role of this piliferous integument has long been recognized for providing life, arthropods in particular, water-repellency, the synthetic superhydrophobic surfaces based on this structure are still very limited. In this study, {{the goal was to}} develop a novel liquid-repellent surface by mimicking the hairy exterior of species. The artificial hairy surfaces were prepared by means of pressurized membrane casting, in which thermoplastic sheets were forced to flow into porous membranes at elevated temperature. The ?-shaped pillars on the membrane <b>cast</b> <b>polypropylene</b> substrate are particularly similar to the conformation of natural hairs. The principle of this fabrication technique is relatively accessible and is expected to be compatible with large-area fabrication of superhydrophobic interfaces. The artificial hairy surface features perfectly hydrophobic response where no contact angle hysteresis was observed from video assessment. Thus the artificial hairy surface of the current work appears to be the first report to have such extreme hydrophobicity with only structural modification from the original substrate. This ultralow adhesion to water droplet is believed to be attributed to the hydrophobic methyl groups and the mechanical response of the artificial hairs. Liquid repellency of the hairy surfaces was further enhanced by coating with fluorocarbon (CF) layers via deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). The contact angle of water-methanol mixture was raised from 60 degrees to around 140 degrees. The surface energy of coated samples, however, was still not low enough to repel non-polar liquids. Moreover, the hairy structure is not favorable for maintaining the low surface tension liquid in Cassie-Baxter state...|$|E
