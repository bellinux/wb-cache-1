30|$|In this section, we {{investigate}} the signalling load at the <b>control</b> <b>entities</b> {{of a traditional}} LTE/EPC architecture, a reference architecture [14, 15], and our full OEPC architecture. These <b>control</b> <b>entities</b> are the MME, the Openflow controller, and a mobile controller, respectively. The signalling loads at these <b>control</b> <b>entities</b> caused by five aforementioned procedures are considered as the evaluation metric. For convenience, we called the proposed architecture described in [14, 15] as a partial OEPC architecture because this architecture was also designed by using Openflow technology but it only separated the control and data plane of the SGWs while keeping the PGW {{the same as that}} in the traditional LTE/EPC architecture. In contrast, our fully OEPC decoupled completely the control and data plane of SGW as well as PGW and put all the control functions of those gateways into the MC.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Firewalls are {{a crucial}} {{building}} block for secur-ing interconnections between networks of different security domains. Newer IP based {{applications such as}} IP telephony require that packet filters are configured dynamically by session-aware entities. Several architectures and protocols were proposed for firewall remote control (e. g., IETF MIDCOM and NSIS). However, on the nodes that could host the <b>control</b> <b>entity</b> no common local interface for managing packet filter rules exists. This forces developers of firewall <b>control</b> <b>entities</b> to use firewall specific interfaces and limits portability across operating systems and firewall implementations. This paper describes the design of an operating system independent interface, which allows the firewall <b>control</b> <b>entity</b> to modify firewall rules from user space. We implemented this interface for Netfilter chains of the Linux operating system kernel taking functional and security requirements into account. Based on measurements, we analyze the performance characteristics and conclude that the approach is feasible for small to medium network setups. I...|$|R

30|$|To {{solve the}} {{challenge}} of consistency, two different models can be adopted to implement the SDRAN architecture: “evolutionary” and “clean slate.” The evolutionary model allows for gradually deployment based in existing networks: legacy <b>control</b> plane <b>entities</b> from operators can connect to the core network without modifying the existing interfaces. SDRAN controller implements backward-compatible interfaces to support the interworking with legacy network entities. There are two modes to couple the legacy architecture and future evolutional architecture: loose couple (fully decouple the legacy <b>control</b> plane <b>entities</b> and evolved <b>control</b> plane <b>entities)</b> and tight couple (reuse the legacy <b>control</b> plane <b>entities</b> with evolved structure as much as possible).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} type of jointly <b>controlled</b> <b>entity</b> influences the management choice to report interests {{in this kind of}} joint venture using the equity method or proportionate consolidation. We address this gap in the accounting choice literature by exploiting the UK setting where, due to the transition to IFRS, firms had to change their reporting method for interests in jointly controlled entities from the gross equity method to a similar approach (equity method) or to proportionate consolidation. We support our analysis on the classification of jointly controlled entities proposed by Hennart (1988). We hypothesize that venturers are more likely to change their reporting method to proportionate consolidation when the majority of their jointly controlled entities are cases of Link instead of Scale cooperation. After controlling for several variables, our results are consistent with the predictions and thus suggest that {{the type of}} jointly <b>controlled</b> <b>entity</b> {{plays an important role in}} the management decision to report interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method or proportionate consolidation. However, the results also provide empirical evidence supporting the importance of debt covenant costs and monitoring costs in the choice between alternative reporting methods. 1...|$|E
