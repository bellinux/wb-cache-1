An overview of FIDIC's and other Organizations', such as the World Bank, standard documents is presented. The difference between standard Contract documents and standard Bidding documents is pointed out. In view of CERN's status as an intergovernmental Organization, the original FIDIC standard documents needed to be adapted. The modifications are identified and explained.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{is to develop a}} new Conditions of Contract suitable for major civil engineering works, appropriate to the local conditions. Works having estimated value of more than Rs. 100 millions have been considered as 'major works'. Although the focus is on major works, the document developed is equally applicable to small and medium scale civil engineering works, with minor modifications. At present the local construction industry, particularly the civil engineering sector is handicapped by the non-availability of an upto date and appropriate Conditions of Contract. The government has made mandatory in the state sector, the use of the document CONDITIONS OF <b>CONTRACT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>WORKS</b> OF BUILDING & CIVIL ENGINEERING -SRI LANKA, produced by the Institute for Construction Training and Development, commonly known as the 'ICTAD Conditions'. The ICTAD Conditions of Contract is a document far from perfect and there is a plenty of scope for improvements. Furthermore the ICTAD Conditions attempt to encompass both building construction and civil engineering sectors into a single document which is not a desirable approach, given the diversity of practices and traditions prevailing in the two sectors. Use of a single document to cover the whole gamut of construction activities has been long abandoned in the international construction scene, in favour of specialised documents to cater for each sector. The Conditions of Contract developed as the outcome of this research, is generally based on the Fourth edition of 'CONDITIONS OF <b>CONTRACT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>WORKS</b> OF CIVIL ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION' (Reprinted in 1992 with editorial amendments) produced by Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs-Conseils (FIDIC). This document has been endorsed by most international development and financial institutions including the World Bank. Recent developments and trends in the international construction scene have been taken cognizance of, {{in the development of the}} new. Conditions of Contract. A literature survey was carried out, and views and suggestions of senior engineers representing Employers, Engineers and Contractors were elicited by means of a questionnaire and interviews. Furthermore Conditions of Contracts drawn up for several major construction projects in Sri Lanka were analysed. Each clause of the FIDIC document was analysed and amendments have been proposed where necessary. The proposed Conditions of Contract would contribute to the successful completion of civil engineering projects by establishing a fair and just contract, in line with modem international practice...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that there exists several {{construction}} forms of contract that aim to standardize the contractual clauses in relation to the construction industry, the adoption of the same has been subject to major modifications and alteration endangering the overall spirit and consistency of the contractual forms. 	Within the construction industry, many parties are involved in projects. Those parties mainly include the Client and the Contractor, in addition to the Project Manager, Project Consultant(s), Subcontractor(s) and Suppliers. Hence, contracts need to be customized, agreed, and signed to formalize parties’ relationships. Knowing that the Middle East region has, and will continue to have, major construction projects during the upcoming years, it is of major importance {{to understand the nature of}} Standard Contractual forms being used and the modifications that are being introduced, noting that well configured contractual clauses play a major role in simplifying part of the complexity associated with the construction environment. 	This research focuses on standard construction contracts in practice between 2005 and 2015, in the Middle East, with their corresponding conditions. The aim of this research is to investigate the major modifications originally introduced to provide additional immunity to a certain project party within the Middle East region to improve construction management performance. This is achieved by first reviewing the various international standard forms of contract, and general contractual issues, and then further investigating the reasons and implications of major modifications introduced to these standard forms of contract. A single case study is examined in this study, within which questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews are used as the data collection techniques. It is found that one of the most commonly used standard contractual forms between 2005 and 2015 in the Middle East is the Conditions of <b>Contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>Works</b> of Civil Engineering Construction 4 th Edition. The key findings highlight the reasons for the introduction of major modifications as being over protecting one of the parties or providing additional flexibility to one of the parties. Furthermore, the implications of introducing such modifications are identified as compounding the issues of project performance in terms of delays and cost escalation. This study recommends measures and modifications that would allow for contextual appropriateness, yet mitigate the impact of the same through the introduction of a proper balanced contract which is fit for purpose...|$|E

The problem is that if the contractual clauses were not drafted responsibly or modifications to Standard forms were introduced without proper reasoning, contracts negotiation and signature would be a time consuming challenge and would take considerable time from the total originally allocated for the project. Furthermore, the project parties would be focusing on the contractual aspects, governing the project, leading to more claims i. e. fertile ground for contractual disputes, rather than technical and execution issues which would eventually flag hindrance in the project original schedule and certainly an escalation to the project original budget notwithstanding the project works atmosphere. The above issues represent a challenge to any responsible project party whose aim is to have his project executed noting the given time frame and allocated budget constraints. This paper focuses on the major modifications introduced to one of the mostly being used standard contractual form for the past 10 years in the Middle East, the Conditions of <b>Contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>Works</b> of Civil Engineering Construction (Red Book 4 th Edition 1987) one of the FIDIC Forms of Contracts, and it shows the impact and effect that the projects are experiencing due to the said major modifications as relayed through major industry practitioners.

The being assessed impact of the major modification to the standard conditions is presented in a quantitative way as they do relate to project duration and project cost...|$|E

Its goal is to answer the following research question: is it possible to use the new Czech trust concept as a payment instrument under the most used FIDIC standard form of contract - Conditions of <b>Contract</b> <b>for</b> Construction First Edition 1999 (better known as "Red Book") ? The thesis is divided into three chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of the new trust concept: from construction projects through construction <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> to payment conditions. The opening part of Chapter One focuses on construction projects. It defines their characteristic features and describes the main types of their management, organization and contractual relationships. Next, the chapter discusses the international character of construction projects and concentrates on situations involving a conflict of laws. Party autonomy and the choice of law rule, that empowers parties to designate the applicable law to their contractual relationship, are assumed to be fundamental principles of contract formation in international construction projects. This part of the chapter is concluded by the proposition that [...] ...|$|R

Fabrication, repair or modification of buildings or parts thereof shall be always covered by <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> The new legislation, given by the Civil Code, Law No. 89 / 2012 Coll. and effective from 1 January 2014, replaced the regulation of the <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> as contained in the abolished Civil Code of 1964, as well as the in the Czech Commercial Code of 1991 that was also cancelled by the new Civil Code of 2012. The paper describes the most important provisions of the new shape the of <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> The basis <b>for</b> the draft new legislation was taken from the former regulation of this contract by the Commercial Code and having taken regard to certain legal regulations by other countries, because the concept of contract work as contained in the former Civil Code was strongly influenced by its original design from 1964 and the by patterns of the Civil Code of 1950. In some respect certain provisions of former Code of International Trade were also take into account, the normative structure of which was “borrowed” by the later Commercial Code. The new Civil Code regulation, however, should be more precise and clearer than the previous arrangements.
