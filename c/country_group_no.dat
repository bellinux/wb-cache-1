Nevertheless, comparing {{each group of}} the three income level countries, {{as the level of}} income declines from high-income <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> to low/middle-income <b>countries</b> (Europe/Asia and Latin America/Caribbean regions the Europe and Asia), a negative relationship between women established business owner-managers and GDI may be observed. An inverse relationship seems to exist between overall entrepreneurial activity and GDI within the countries in the Latin American and Caribbean low/middle-income <b>country</b> <b>group.</b> A decreasing relationship is also observed between the overall entrepreneurial activity and GDI, for all 41 countries under investigation, regardless of their income level. Finally, the results show no relationship between the entrepreneurial activity stages (early-stage entrepreneurial activity, established business ownership, and the overall entrepreneurial activity) and GEMI, across all 41 countries under study.|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR), corporations are starting to include their corporate social responsibilities and performances into their annual report to publish their effort and make their commitment known to stakeholders (Wood, 1991). However, {{there is always a}} question on what the general perceptions on corporate social responsibilities, and how much companies should be held responsible for their activities. The objective of this dissertation is to investigate factors that influence the perceptions on corporate social responsibilities. This study uses data obtained from a questionnaire developed by Globescan. A subset of 15 questions was selected from the wider questionnaire in relation to the perception of responsibilities should be held by companies. The first part of the study shows that companies are expected to be held more responsible in ethical responsibilities compared to economical, legal and philanthropic responsibilities. The second part of the analysis reveals that different <b>countries,</b> <b>countries</b> income <b>groups,</b> legal traditions, and education level have significant differences on the expectation on companies’ responsibilities. However, there is one exception case, that different <b>countries</b> income <b>groups</b> has <b>no</b> significant different on the expectation on companies to ensure all materials they use to make their products have been produced in a socially and environmentally responsible...|$|R

40|$|Using South African census data, we {{show that}} {{immigrants}} with tertiary education from different origin <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> differ in their likelihood of obtaining a skilled job. Immigrants from advanced <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> outperform native internal migrants, while those from many African <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> underperform them. Immigrants with advanced degrees from certain <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> {{are also more likely}} to be employed in unskilled, informal sector jobs.

We further explore characteristics of origin <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> correlated with immigrant outcomes.

40|$|The {{account of}} {{electron}} correlation and its efficient separation into dynamic and nondynamic parts {{plays a key}} role in the development of computational methods. In this paper we suggest a physically-sound matrix formulation to split electron correlation into dynamic and nondynamic parts using the two-particle cumulant matrix and a measure of the deviation from idempotency of the first-order density matrix. These matrices are applied to a two-electron model, giving rise to a simplified electron correlation index that (i) depends only on natural orbitals and their occupancies, (ii) can be straightforwardly decomposed into orbital contributions and (iii) splits into dynamic and nondynamic correlation parts that (iv) admit a local version. These expressions are shown to account for dynamic and nondynamic correlation in a variety of systems containing different electron correlation regimes, thus providing the first separation of dynamic and nondynamic correlation using solely natural orbital occupanciesThis research has been funded by the Spanish MINECO Projects No. CTQ 2014 - 52525 -P and CTQ 2014 - 59212 -P, and the Basque <b>Country</b> Consolidated <b>Group</b> Project <b>No.</b> IT 588 - 13.

40|$|This {{world trade}} model {{examines}} trade flows in 1970 between six <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> and seven {{groups of goods}} and services comprising together the whole world trade in goods and services. Using as division criteria: per capita income, the political regime, the commodity composition of exports and the location of the country on the globe — the following <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> have been distinguished: 1. U. S. A., 2. Industrial Europe, 3 Semi-industrialized countries, 4. Non-industrialized countries, 5. Oil countries, 6. Socialist countries. Within each of the <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> seven sectors have been taken into account, namely: Food, Raw materials, Oils, Chemicals, Equipment, other manafacturers and services. The sum of their products gives the gross domestic product at factor costs of the <b>country</b> <b>group</b> concerned. For each of the first five <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> linearized growth models of the Harrod-Domar type have been drawn up. A condensed version of the models used for the <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> mentioned is one sector model which consists of six equations and nine variables. The purpose of the model is to give a comparative static analysis of the consequences of giving aid to the less developed countries. For each <b>country</b> <b>group</b> a model has been built {{as an extension of the}} condensed model, in the sense that seven sectors instead of one have been taken into account. In turn, the <b>country</b> <b>group</b> models have been linked into a world model by means of definitions of the volumes of world trade. Thus for each <b>country</b> <b>group</b> a definition of world trade of this commodity, as the sum of the imports of the individual groups has been added. Moreover, a definition of world price had to be added which defines it as a weighed average of the individual domestic prices. The author attempts to make some statements from the individual <b>country</b> <b>group</b> models. In each, a model giving aid, a new equilibrium situation arises where the G. D+P, of the giving country is smaller than in the original equilibrium situation. For a country receiving aid the opposite reasoning holds. Furthermore, giving aid means a decrease of a. country's domestic price level, a decrease of its imports and an increase of exports. A detailed survey of the results of the world model can be found in appendix C. Four combinations of giving and receiving aid have been dealt with.

Particulary, greater excretion of cadmium in urine, elevation of serum cadmium and greater accumlation of cadmium in kidneys were observed early in the malnutritional <b>groups</b> (<b>groups</b> <b>No.</b> 6, 7 and 8) {{as compared to the}} basal diet <b>group</b> (<b>group</b> <b>No.</b> 5). One monkey in the low-nutritional and low-vitamin D group fed with Cd (<b>group</b> <b>No.</b> 8) accumulated over 1000 μg of Cd per g wet weight in the kidneys even at 36 months. No remarkable changes in serum β(2) -microglobulin were observed in the Cd-treated <b>groups</b> (<b>group</b> <b>No.</b> 5 to No. 8) nor in the non-Cd treated <b>groups</b> (<b>groups</b> <b>No.</b> 1 to No. 4) during the experimental period. Although no significant leak of urinary β(2) -microglobulin was seen among the basal diet group fed with Cd (<b>group</b> <b>No.</b> 5), the basal diet and low-vitamin D group fed with Cd (<b>group</b> <b>No.</b> 7) and the non-Cd treated <b>group</b> (<b>groups</b> <b>No.</b> 1 to No. 4), much urinary β(2) -microglobulin began to leak at 36 months in the low-nutritional and low-vitamin D group fed with Cd (<b>group</b> <b>No.</b> 8) and at 48 months in the low-nutritional group fed with Cd (<b>group</b> <b>No.</b> 6).
