40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} transboundary animal diseases (TADs) in the southern African region is foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). In this region, a pathway for spread of FMD virus is <b>contacts</b> <b>between</b> cattle and certain species of wildlife. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate <b>contacts</b> <b>between</b> cattle and wildlife in the Kruger National Park (KNP) and the adjacent Limpopo province for the time periods October 2006 to March 2007 and April to September 2007. In this study, 87 livestock owners and 57 KNP field rangers were interviewed. Fifteen (17 %) livestock owners reported <b>contacts</b> <b>between</b> wildlife and cattle. More livestock owners reported observing <b>contacts</b> <b>between</b> cattle and all wildlife species during October-March than April-September (p = 0. 012). However, no difference was found between these periods for <b>contacts</b> <b>between</b> cattle and individual wildlife species. A total of 18 (32 %) field rangers reported <b>contacts</b> <b>between</b> cattle and wildlife. The most common species-specific <b>contacts</b> were <b>between</b> cattle and buffalo (63 /year), cattle and impala (17 /year) and cattle and lion (10 /year). There were no significant differences in rangers reporting observed <b>contacts</b> <b>between</b> cattle and wildlife during October-March versus April-September or between rangers reporting observed contacts outside versus within the KNP. Overall, there was no evidence of higher <b>contact</b> rates <b>between</b> cattle and wildlife in the study area during October-March compared to April-September. Contact data collected in this study can be used to better understand the transmission of FMD virus in this region. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
30|$|In addition, we further {{suppose that}} the individuals’ {{contacts}} can be treated as heterogeneous, but the <b>contacts</b> <b>between</b> individuals and vectors {{can be considered as}} homogeneous. This assumption results from the selective contacts in a human network and non-selective <b>contacts</b> <b>between</b> people and vectors [3, 20].|$|R
5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual <b>contact</b> <b>between</b> servant and master; a prohibition against sexual <b>contact</b> <b>between</b> royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon {{in many parts of the}} world during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration would prevent this. Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order to hold his position.|$|E

5|$|The {{focus of}} this debate often centers on a {{phenomenon}} named by sexologist Pepper Schwartz in 1983. Schwartz found that long-term lesbian couples report having less sexual contact than heterosexual or homosexual male couples, calling this lesbian bed death. However, lesbians dispute the study's definition of sexual contact, and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant, greater sexual fluidity in women causing them to move from heterosexual to bisexual to lesbian numerous times through their lives—or reject the labels entirely. Further arguments attested that the study was flawed and misrepresented accurate sexual <b>contact</b> <b>between</b> women, or sexual <b>contact</b> <b>between</b> women has increased since 1983 as many lesbians find themselves freer to sexually express themselves.|$|E

5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct <b>contact</b> <b>between</b> diseased and healthy plants is not possible.|$|E

5|$|Dental anatomy is a {{field of}} anatomy {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, or <b>contact</b> <b>between</b> teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomic science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E

5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close <b>contact</b> <b>between</b> {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E

5|$|Resistance welding {{involves}} {{the generation of}} heat by passing current through the resistance caused by the <b>contact</b> <b>between</b> two or more metal surfaces.
