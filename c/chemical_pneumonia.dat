Aspiration can lead to a range of diseases such as infectious <b>pneumonia,</b> <b>chemical</b> pneumonitis or respiratory distress syndrome with significant morbidity and mortality. It occurs in approximately 3 - 10 per 10 000 operations with an increased incidence in obstetric and paediatric anaesthesia. Patients are most at risk during induction of anaesthesia and extubation, in particular in emergency situations. The likelihood of significant aspiration can be reduced by fasting, pharmacological intervention and correct anaesthetic management using a rapid sequence induction. Treatment of acid aspiration is by suctioning after witnessed aspiration; antibiotics are indicated in patients with aspiration pneumonia only. Steroids are not proven to improve outcome or reduce mortality.

40|$|Introduction: Community {{acquired}} pneumonia is one {{the frequent}} cause of hospital admissions. Whereas, hyponatremia {{is a common}} electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients and {{has been shown to}} be associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. We aim to studyt the association of hyponatremia with community acquired pneumonia in terms of morbidity and mortality. Methods: A prospective observational hospital based study was conducted in a hospital for a year. All patients with a diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia and admitted in medicine ward, were included. Patients with diarrhea, known Chronic Kidney Disease, Heart Failure, Cirrhosis of Liver, Malignancy, taking diuretics, <b>chemical</b> pneumonitis, interstitial <b>pneumonias</b> and other debilitating disease were excluded. Results: Among the 72 cases of CAP, 61 % were females and 39 % were males. The mean age of patients was 51. 3 years, 22 (30. 55 %) patients had severe CAP. A total of 7 cases expired with an overall mortality of 13. 7 %. The mortality risk increased with increasing CURB- 65 score; CURB- 65 score 0, 0 %; CURB- 65 score 1, 0 %; CURB- 65 score 2, 0 %; CURB- 65 score 3, 10 %; CURB- 65 score 4, 33 %; CURB- 65 score 5, 100 %. i. e higher the CURB- 65 score, higher the death rate of CAP patients (p< 0. 05). Hyponatremia was a common occurrence at hospital admission with an incidence of 36. 11 %. Hyponatremia at hospital admission was also associated with a longer length of hospital stay in cured CAP patients. The mean length of hospital stay was 4. 3 days. Conclusions: High CURB- 65 scores and lower values of serum sodium at admission in patients of CAP are associated with adverse outcomes both in terms of mortality and longer length of hospital stay. CURB- 65 score should be incorporated into assessment of CAP and sodium of the patients during admission. Keywords: CURB- 65 score; hyponatremia; mortality. | PubMe...|$|R

40|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae在生物学及进化方向上与大肠杆菌类似，易于进行基因操作，可以以甘油为唯一碳源和能源进行生长代谢，能够自主合成VB 12 。甘油在K. pneumoniae体内的代谢途径已被探明，可以转化为 3 -羟基丙酸、乳酸等多种重要化学品。 3 -HP可以用来合成多种重要化学品，是最具潜力的化工产品之一。甘油到 3 -HP的转化需要甘油脱水酶和醛脱氢酶的作用。分别克隆了来自Lactobacillus reuteri和Klebsiella pneumoniae的甘油脱水酶dhaBLR和dhaB 123 ，将这两种甘油脱水酶和来自Escherichia coli的醛脱氢酶EaldH在E. coliBL 21 (DE 3) 内进行表达，发现dhaB 123 具有更有利于合成 3 -HP。将EaldH和dhaB 123 在K. pneumoniaeATCC 25955 内过表达后， 3 -HP的产量得到了进一步提高。为了实现甘油通过K. pneumoniae高效转化为 3 -HP，又进行了一系列基因修饰。在引入了EaldH，dhaB 123 及其激活因子gdrAB的基础上，敲除 1, 3 -PDO氧化还原酶基因dhaT和yqhD，得到了一系列K. pneumoniae工程菌株。发酵结果证明，同时敲除基因dhaT和yqhD的工程菌株K. pneumoniaeΔdhaTΔyqhD (pBAD 33 -EaldH-dhaB 123 -gdrAB) （Q 1546 ）具有较好的 3 -HP合成能力。经过对摇瓶类型、pH调节、甘油添加方式、诱导时间等的优化，得到了比较适宜 3 -HP合成的发酵条件。在优化条件下，Q 1546 发酵 48 h， 3 -HP的产量达到 4. 45 ± 0. 11 g/L。同时发现，溶氧对于 3 -HP的合成具有较大影响。分批补料发酵采用微氧条件（通气速率 1. 5 vvm，转速维持 400 rpm），发酵 24 h时 3 -HP产量达到 16. 7 g/L，甘油转化率达 0. 26 mol/mol。 3 -HP可以通过聚合生成聚 3 -羟基丙酸，P 3 HP是一种性质优良的聚羟基脂肪酸酯，可以用于石油基塑料替代品等多种领域。现有的报道主要利用工程大肠杆菌合成P 3 HP，需要加入价格昂贵的VB 12 ，增加了生产成本，限制了工业化应用。本研究在工程菌株Q 1546 的基础上，引入了大肠杆菌的丙酰辅酶A合成酶基因prpE和真氧产碱杆菌的聚羟基脂肪酸合成酶基因phaC，首次实现了在K. pneumoniae体内合成聚 3 -羟基丙酸。通过摇瓶优化比较，在合适的溶氧条件下，P 3 HP的产量为 0. 24 g/L，占细胞干重的 12. 7 %。虽然产量较低，与工程E. coli合成P 3 HP相比，不需要添加VB 12 ，降低了生产成本，具有较好的应用前景。 Q 1546 在合成 3 -HP的过程伴随着大量乳酸的合成，分批发酵 24 h时乳酸积累量达 26. 4 g/L。推测K. pneumoniae在利用甘油合成乳酸上具有较大潜力。通过旋光度测定，发现所产乳酸皆为D-乳酸。D-乳酸广泛应用于食品、皮革、制药以及聚乳酸合成等行业，需求量不断增加。 在K. pneumoniae野生菌株内过表达D-乳酸脱氢酶基因ldhA后，与野生菌株相比，D-乳酸产量由 0. 41 g/L提高到 2. 16 g/L。在 1, 3 -PDO氧化还原酶基因dhaT敲除菌中引入ldhA，D-乳酸的产量达到 4. 11 g/L。将ldhA引入到同时敲除 1, 3 -PDO氧化还原酶基因dhaT和yqhD的缺失菌内，D-乳酸产量进一步提高到 4. 72 g/L。发酵培养基在产物代谢中会产生重要影响，通过在原有基本培养基的基础上添加 3 g/L牛肉膏、蛋白胨和酵母粉，D-乳酸产量分别提高到了 5. 47 、 7. 44 和 8. 33 g/L。 在 5 -L发酵罐基础上，设置了厌氧、微氧（ 0. 5 、 1. 0 、 1. 5 、 2. 0 、 2. 5 vvm）、好氧、两阶段发酵等 8 种不同通气条件进行研究。分批补料发酵结果表明，溶氧对D-乳酸的合成具有较大影响。当通气为 2. 5 vvm时，D-乳酸产量最高，发酵 48 h达 142. 11 g/L，最大生产效率为 2. 96 g/L/h，转化率为 0. 82 g/g甘油。D-乳酸的产量、生产效率及转化率都高于已有的发酵甘油生产D-乳酸的报道。这个结果也证实了之前对于K. pneumoniae可以利用甘油高效合成D-乳酸的推测。 另外，为了验证所构建工程菌株对粗甘油的利用情况，在摇瓶水平进行了发酵实验。发酵 48 h时，甘油消耗、D-乳酸产量以及细胞干重分别为 9. 52 、 0. 97 和 7. 41 g/L，与使用纯甘油时的实验结果（ 10. 51 、 0. 99 和 8. 15 g/L）基本一致。证明本研究构建的工程菌株在利用粗甘油生产相关产物时具有巨大潜力。Primarily {{evolution}} and consequently biochemical proximity of Klebsiella pneumoniae to Escherichia coli enables gene manipulation carried easily in it. K. pneumoniae can grow on glycerol {{as the sole}} carbon and energy source and has a high assimilation efficiency. In particular, it can produce vitamin B 12 naturally which is necessary to synthesize 3 -hydroxypropionate. The pathway of glycerol metabolism is clearly and glycerol can be converted into 3 -HP, lactate and many other important <b>chemicals</b> in K. <b>pneumoniae.</b> 3 -HP can be converted into several commercially valuable chemicals. The production of 3 -HP from glycerol requires glycerol dehydratase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Glycerol dehydratase dhaBLR (from Lactobacillus reuteri) and dhaB 123 (from Klebsiella pneumoniae) were cloned and overexpressed with aldehyde dehydrogenase aldH (from Escherichia coli) in E. coliBL 21 (DE 3). The fermentation results showed that dhaB 123 is better than dhaBLR for 3 -HP production from glycerol. When aldH and dhaB 123 were overexpressed in K. pneumoniaeATCC 25955, the 3 -HP production was further improved. In order to produce 3 -HP effectively from glycerol by K. pneumoniae, gene modification was carried out to construct recombinant strains. Along with dhaB 123, and its reactivation factor gdrA and gdrB, and aldH were overexpressed in K. pneumoniae, two genes dhaT and yqhD for biosynthesis of 1, 3 -propanediol were deleted, engineered K. pneumoniae strains were obtained and compared by fermentation using flasks. The resulting strain Q 1546 (K. pneumoniaeΔdhaTΔyqhD (pBAD 33 -EaldH-dhaB 123 -gdrAB)) was proved to have higher efficiency for 3 -HP production. By optimizing the types of flask, adjust pH, methods of adding glycerol, and induce time, better fermentation condition for 3 -HP syhthesis was obtained. Under non-baffled flask condition, 4. 45 ± 0. 11 g/L 3 -HP was accumulated by Q 1546 after 48 h fermentation with optimized conditions. The results also showed that dissolved oxygen {{play an important role}} on the production of 3 -HP. Meanwhile, 16. 7 g/L 3 -HP with a yield of 0. 26 mol/mol glycerol were obtained after 24 -h with aeration of 1. 5 vvm and speed of 400 rpm in fed-batch fermentation. 3 -HP can be polymerized into poly (3 -hydroxypropionate) which is one kind of polyhydroxyalkanoates with good properties and can be used as alternative of petroleum-based plastics. P 3 HP is mainly produced by recombinant E. coli, the cost is higher with vitamin B 12 addition which limited its industrialization. To obtain P 3 HP production in K. pneumoniae, propionyl-CoA synthetase prpE from E. coli and PHA synthase phaC from Ralstonia eutropha were introduced into Q 1546. At a speed of 100 rpm in non-baffled flask, the cell yield and P 3 HP content were 0. 24 g/L and 12. 7 % (wt/wt [cell dry weight]) respectively after 48 -h cultivation. Although the yield is relatively low, this study shows the feasibility of producing P 3 HP in K. pneumoniae from glycerol without vitamin B 12 for the first time. There were a large amount of lactate in the fermentation process of 3 -HP by Q 1546. The production of lactate achieved at 26. 4 g/L after 24 -h cultivation. It was speculated that K. pneumoniae has a great potential to produce lactate using glycerol as carbon source. The lactate production was detected as optically pure D- lactate, and no L- lactate was detected. D- lactate is widely used in the field of pharmaceutical, herbicides and cosmetics, and is also a monomer for the production of polylactate. The demand of optically D- lactate increased gradually. The production of D- lactate was verified in non- baffled flask conditions. When LdhA was overexpressed in K. pneumoniae, D- lactate production increased significantly to 2. 16 g/L from 0. 41 g/L produced by the control strain. After LdhA was introduced into the dhaT deleted strain, 4. 11 g/L D-lactate was obtained. When LdhA was overexpressed in dhaT and yqhD double mutant, 4. 72 g/L 3 -HP was accumulated in the fermentation broth. The composition of the medium is important for the metabolites production. After 3 g/L beef extract, peptone and yeast extract was added into the minimal medium, D- lactate production was increased to 5. 47, 7. 44 and 8. 33 g/L respectively. To investigate the effect of aeration on the production of D- lactate, fed-batch fermentations were conducted at different conditions including anaerobic, microaerobic (with various aeration rates of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 vvm), fully aerobic conditions, and two- phase fermentation. The results showed that aeration rate play an essential role in D- lactate production. Under microaerobic conditions with 2. 5 vvm, the recombinant strain produced 142. 1 g/L D -lactate with a yield of 0. 82 g/g glycerol, representing the highest D -lactate production and yield from glycerol so far. This also proved the previous speculation. Furthermore, to evaluate the feasibility of the engineered strain to synthesize D- lactate from crude glycerol, the D- lactate production experiment in shake flasks was performed using crude glycerol. When crude glycerol was used, the glycerol consumption, biomass, and D- lactate production were 9. 52, 0. 97, and 7. 41 g/L, respectively after 48 -h cultivation. The results were basically in line with the experiments using pure glycerol (10. 51, 0. 99, and 8. 15 g/L), which suggested that the constructed strain has high potentiality in utilization of crude glycerol from biodiesel industry...|$|R
