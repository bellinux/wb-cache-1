5|$|Enzymes {{are known}} to {{catalyze}} more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types. Most enzymes are proteins, although a few are <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNA</b> molecules. The latter are called ribozymes. Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of RNA-based {{biological}} catalysts called ribozymes exist, which again can act alone or in complex with proteins. The most common {{of these is the}} ribosome which is a complex of protein and <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNA</b> components.|$|E
5|$|<b>Catalytic</b> <b>RNA</b> {{molecules}} (ribozymes) {{were discovered}} in the early 1980s, leading to a 1989 Nobel award to Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman. In 1990, it was found in Petunia that introduced genes can silence similar genes of the plant's own, now {{known to be a}} result of RNA interference.|$|E
40|$|Neurospora VS RNA is a {{mitochondrial}} single-stranded RNA {{that combines}} certain features of <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> and group I introns. We report here that monomeric VS RNA synthesized in vitro by self-cleavage of a multimeric transcript can perform an RNA-mediated self-ligation reaction producing circular RNAs indistinguishable from those isolated from mitochondria. We {{conclude that the}} active site for the ligation reaction {{is present in the}} RNA itself. Also, the mechanism for aligning the termini to be ligated may be different from mechanisms previously described. The lack of sequence similarity between VS RNA and previously characterized <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> suggests that VS RNA is an independently evolved ribozyme capable of both cleavage and ligation...|$|R
50|$|In another {{scientific}} context, <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> {{have been}} deemed Cheshire cats. This metaphor {{is used to}} describe the fading of the ribonucleotide construct, which leaves behind a smile of only the mineral components of the RNA catalyst.|$|R

25|$|As {{amino acids}} {{gradually}} {{appeared in the}} RNA world under prebiotic conditions, their interactions with <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNA</b> would increase both the range and efficiency of function of <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNA</b> molecules. Thus, the driving force {{for the evolution of}} the ribosome from an ancient self-replicating machine into its current form as a translational machine may have been the selective pressure to incorporate proteins into the ribosome’s self-replicating mechanisms, so as to increase its capacity for self-replication.|$|E
25|$|Cells emerged {{at least}} 3.5 billion years ago. The current {{belief is that}} these cells were heterotrophs. The early cell {{membranes}} were probably more simple and permeable than modern ones, with only a single fatty acid chain per lipid. Lipids are known to spontaneously form bilayered vesicles in water, and could have preceded RNA, but the first cell membranes could also have been produced by <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNA,</b> or even have required structural proteins before they could form.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{mediated}} cleavage and ligation {{is found}} in group 1 and group 2 self-splicing RNAs. VS RNA contains many conserved sequence characteristics to group 1 introns. However VS ribozyme splice site is different from group 1 intron splice site and VR ribozyme self-cleaving site is outside of {{the core of the}} group 1 intron. In the cleavage reaction VS ribozyme produce 2’,3’ -cyclic phosphate and the group 1 introns produce 3’-hydroxyl. Functional similarity with group 1 introns and then mechanistically being different from the introns support this hypothesis that VS ribozyme is a chimera formed by insertion of a novel <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNA</b> into group 1 introns.|$|E
50|$|RNA {{in vitro}} {{evolution}} or SELEX enables the artificial evolution and selection of RNA molecules that possess a desired property, such as binding affinity {{for a particular}} ligand or an activity {{such as that of}} an enzyme or catalyst. The first such selections involved isolation of various aptamers that bind to small molecules. The first <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> produced by in vitro evolution were <b>RNA</b> ligases, <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> that join two RNA fragments to produce a single adduct. The most active ligase known to date is the Class I ligase, isolated from random sequence (work of David Bartel, while in the Szostak lab). Other examples of RNA ligases include the L1 ligase (Robertson and Ellington), the R3C ligase (Joyce), the DSL ligase (Inoue). All these ligases catalyze the formation of a 3'-5' phosphodiester bond between two RNA fragments.|$|R
30|$|These {{simulations}} {{provide a}} more realistic emulation of wet lab conditions using self-assembling <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> that form interaction networks. In doing so, they highlight the potential evolutionary advantage to a prebiotic scenario that involves cyclic dehydration/rehydration events. We posit that such cyclicity is a plausible means to promote evolution in primordial autocatalytic sets, which could later lead {{to the establishment of}} individual-based biology.|$|R
40|$|RNA {{molecules}} play critical {{roles in}} cell biology, and novel findings continuously broaden their functional repertoires. Apart from their well-documented participation in protein synthesis, {{it is now}} apparent that several noncoding RNAs (i. e. micro-RNAs and riboswitches) also participate in the regulation of gene expression. The discovery of <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> had profound implications on our views concerning the evolution of life on our planet at a molecular level. A characteristic attribute of RNA, probably traced back to its ancestral origin, {{is the ability to}} interact with and be modulated by several ions and molecules of different sizes. The inhibition of ribosome activity by antibiotics has been extensively used as a therapeutical approach, while activation and substrate-specificity alteration have the potential to enhance the versatility of ribozyme-based tools in translational research. In this review, we will describe some representative examples of such modulators to illustrate the potential of <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> as tools and targets in research and clinical approaches.

25|$|A {{workshop}} on {{the limitations of}} size of microbes in 1999 found that though modern nanobacteria can't be smaller in volume than {{the interior of a}} sphere of diameter 250 ± 50nm, primitive microorganisms based on a single-polymer system could be. They cite the example of RNA based life, with ribozymes (<b>catalytic</b> <b>RNA)</b> taking the place of the much larger ribosomes as enzymes for cell replication. The cells also wouldn't have proteins and would have no need to translate DNA to mRNA. The result could be cells as small as a sphere 50nm in diameter. These RNA World cells are one of the suggestions made {{to bridge the gap between}} abiotic chemistry and modern cells.|$|E
25|$|Doudna entered Pomona College in Claremont, California {{to study}} biochemistry. During her sophomore year, while taking {{a course in}} general chemistry, she {{questioned}} her own ability {{to pursue a career}} in science, and considered switching her major to French. However, her French teacher suggested her to stick with science. Fred Grieman and Corwin Hansch, both professors of chemistry at Pomona, had a major impact on her. She started her first scientific research in the lab of Sharon Panasenko. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biochemistry from Pomona College in 1985. She went to Harvard Medical School for her doctoral study and earned a Ph.D. in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in 1989. Her Ph.D. thesis was on engineering a self-replicating <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNA</b> and was supervised by Jack W. Szostak. From 1989 to 1991, she held research fellowships in molecular biology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and in genetics at Harvard Medical School. From 1991 to 1994, she was Lucille P. Markey Postdoctoral Scholar in Biomedical Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she worked with Thomas Cech.|$|E
2500|$|RNAP {{produces}} RNA that functionally {{is either}} coding (for protein) (messenger RNA) (mRNA); or non-coding: so-called [...] "RNA genes". At least four functional types of RNA genes exist: Transfer RNA (tRNA) - transfers specific amino acids to growing polypeptide chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation; Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) - is {{a component of}} ribosomes; micro RNA (miRNA) - regulates gene activity; and <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNA</b> (Ribozyme)) - an enzymatically active RNA molecule.|$|E
40|$|<b>Catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> {{are often}} {{regarded}} as molecular fossils from the RNA World, {{yet it is}} usually difficult to get more specific information about their evolution. Here we have investigated the coevolution of group II intron RNA structures with their intron-encoded reverse transcriptases (RTs). Unlike group I introns, {{there has been no}} obvious reshuffling between intron RNA structures and ORFs. Of the six classes of intron structures that encode ORFs, three are conventional forms of group II A 1, B 1, and B 2 secondary structures, whereas the remaining classes are bacterial, are possibly associated with the most primitive ORFs, and have unusual features and hybrid features of group IIA and group IIB intron structures. Based on these data, we propose a new model for the evolution of group II introns, designated the retroelement ancestor hypothesis, which predicts that the major RNA structural forms of group II introns developed through coevolution with the intron-encoded protein rather than as independent <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs,</b> and that most ORF-less introns are derivatives of ORF-containing introns. The model is supported by the distribution of ORF-containing and ORF-less introns, and by numerous examples of ORF-less introns that contain ORF remnants...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{domain of}} a hammerhead ribozyme {{was incorporated into}} a 413 nucleotides long antisense RNA directed against the 5 '-leader/gag region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) (pos. + 222 to + 634). The resulting <b>catalytic</b> antisense <b>RNA</b> was shown to cleave its target RNA in vitro specifically at physiological ion strength and temperature. We compared the antiviral effectiveness of this <b>catalytic</b> antisense <b>RNA</b> {{with that of the}} corresponding unmodified antisense RNA and with a mutated <b>catalytic</b> antisense <b>RNA,</b> which did not cleave the substrate RNA in vitro. Each of these RNAs was co-transfected into human SW 480 cells together with infectious complete proviral HIV- 1 DNA, followed by analysis of HIV- 1 replication. The presence of the catalytically active domain resulted in 4 to 7 fold stronger inhibition of HIV- 1 replication as compared to the parental antisense RNA and the inactive mutant. Kinetic and structural studies performed in vitro indicated that the ability for double strand formation was not changed in <b>catalytic</b> antisense <b>RNA</b> versus parental antisense RNA. Together, these data suggest that the ability to cleave target RNA is a crucial prerequisite for the observed increase of inhibition of the replication of HIV- 1...|$|R
40|$|RNA is a {{ubiquitous}} biopolymer that {{performs a}} multitude of essential cellular functions involving the maintenance, transfer, and processing of genetic information. RNA is unique in that it can carry both genetic information and catalytic function. Its secondary structure domains, which fold stably and independently, assemble hierarchically into modular tertiary structures. Studies of these folding events are key to understanding how <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> (ribozymes) are able to position reaction components for site-specific chemistry. We have made use of fluorescence techniques to monitor the rates and free energies of folding of the small hairpin and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozymes, found in satellite RNAs of plant and the human hepatitis B viruses, respectively. In particular, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been employed to monitor global conformational changes, and 2 -aminopurine fluorescence quenching to probe for local structural rearrangements. In this review we illuminate {{what we have learned}} about the reaction pathways of the hairpin and HDV ribozymes, and how our results have complemented other biochemical and biophysical investigations.

This conclusion is drawn from many independent lines of evidence, such as the observations that RNA is central to the translation process and that small RNAs can catalyze all of the chemical groups and information transfers required for life. The structure of the ribosome has been called the [...] "smoking gun," [...] as it showed that the ribosome is a ribozyme, with a central core of RNA and no amino acid side chains within 18 angstroms of the active site where peptide bond formation is catalyzed.

5000|$|Ribozymes are <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNA</b> {{molecules}} used {{to inhibit}} gene expression. These molecules work by cleaving mRNA molecules, essentially silencing {{the genes that}} produced them. Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech first discovered <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNA</b> molecules, RNase P and group II intron ribozymes, in 1989 and won the Nobel Prize for their discovery. Several types of ribozyme motifs exist, including hammerhead, hairpin, hepatitis delta virus, group I, group II, and RNase P ribozymes. Hammerhead, hairpin, and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme motifs are generally found in viruses or viroid RNAs. These motifs are able to self-cleave a specific phosphodiester bond on an mRNA molecule. Lower eukaryotes and a few bacteria contain group I and group II ribozymes. These motifs can self-splice by cleaving and joining together phosphodiester bonds. [...] The last ribozyme motif, the RNase P ribozyme, is found in Escherichia coli and {{is known for its}} ability to cleave the phosphodiester bonds of several tRNA precursors when joined to a protein cofactor.|$|E
40|$|Subsequent to the {{discovery}} that RNA can have site specific cleavage activity, {{there has been a}} great deal of interest in the design and testing of trans-acting <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> as both surrogate genetic tools and as therapeutic agents. We have been developing <b>catalytic</b> <b>RNAs</b> or ribozymes with target specificity for HIV- 1 RNA and have been exploring chemical synthesis as one method for their production. To this end, we have chemically synthesized and experimentally analyzed chimeric catalysts consisting of DNA in the non-enzymatic portions, and RNA in the enzymatic core of hammerhead type ribozymes. Substitutions of DNA for RNA in the various stems of a hammerhead ribozyme have been analyzed in vitro for kinetic efficiency. One of the chimeric ribozymes used in this study, which harbors 24 bases of DNA capable of base-pairing interactions with an HIV- 1 gag target, but maintains <b>RNA</b> in the <b>catalytic</b> center and in stem-loop II, has a sixfold greater kcat value than the all RNA counterpart. This increased activity appears to be the direct result of enhanced product dissociation. Interestingly, a chimeric ribozyme in which stem-loop II (which divides the catalytic core) is comprised of DNA, exhibited a marked reduction in cleavage activity, suggesting that DNA in this region of the ribozyme can impart a negative effect on the catalytic function of the ribozyme. DNA-RNA chimeric ribozymes transfected by cationic liposomes into human T-lymphocytes are more stable than their all-RNA counterparts. Enhanced catalytic turnover and stability in the absence of a significant effect on Km make chimeric ribozymes favorable candidates for therapeutic agents...|$|R
