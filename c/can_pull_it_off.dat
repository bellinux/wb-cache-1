500|$|Television {{critics have}} commended the {{development}} of Cheryl, as well as Greer's portrayal of the character. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall declared that Cheryl was his favorite character on the show. In his review for [...] "El Secuestro", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club felt that Greer's vocals were {{the highlight of the}} episode, and affirmed that she effectively portrayed the unstable characteristics of Cheryl. [...] "Greer is mostly just asked to say crazy things as Cheryl, and that’s fun, but she steps it up here, playing both Cheryl’s insanity and the part of her that’s a spoiled trust-fund kid who’s found a day job and has to ride the subway with a dwarf that freaks her out." [...] Likewise, Ian MacDonald of TV Overmind proclaimed that the writers [...] "found a great way to expand on ISIS' most emotionally unstable employees"; [...] "Cheryl, whose crazy has been escalated to an almost extreme," [...] MacDonald stated, [...] "seems almost justified in her maladjusted-ness. She's a billionaire heiress who owns an ocelot and drinks glue [...] Humor involving insane rich people just no getting it is usually pretty funny, and if anyone <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> it's Adam Reed and [...] Greer." [...] Alongside fellow cast members Jessica Walter and H. Jon Benjamin, Greer was a candidate for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in a Television Production—the award was given to Jeff Bennett for his work in the Nickelodeon television series The Penguins of Madagascar.|$|E

2500|$|Reviews of Brothers in Arms {{from the}} UK music press were {{generally}} negative. In a scathing review for NME, Mat Snow said, [...] "Dire Straits are so tasteful {{as to be}} entirely flavourless, so laid back as to bore me horizontal". He continued, [...] "So do you seriously {{want to hear about}} the further adventures of Mark Knopfler's mawkish self-pity, his lugubriously mannered appropriation of rockin' Americana, his thumpingly crass attempts at wit? Can anybody really be moved, stimulated or entertained by the tritest would-be melodies in history, the last word in tranquilising chord changes, the most cloying lonesome playing and ultimate in transparently fake troubador sentiment ever to ooze out of a million-dollar recording studio?" [...] Eleanor Levy of Record Mirror was similarly dismissive, succinctly stating, [...] "West Coast guitars reeking of mega bucks and sell out stadium concerts throughout the globe. Laid back melodies. Dire Straits – summed up... This is like any other Dire Straits album quarried out of the tottering edifice of MOR rock." [...] The reviews from the UK's other two music papers were less harsh, with Jack Barron of Sounds feeling that [...] "it's only a halfway decent album because it has only halfway decent songs... Knopfler has distilled his sonic essence, via blues, to appeal to billboard romantics with cinemascope insecurities. And he <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> well... but not often enough here." [...] Melody Makers Barry McIlheney observed that Knopfler had recently explored different creative directions with his work on movie soundtracks and on Bob Dylan's Infidels, and bemoaned that [...] "unfortunately for the rest of us, this admirable spirit of adventure fails to materialise when it comes to Brothers in Arms. Instead it sounds just a bit too like the last Dire Straits album, which sounded not unlike the last one before that, which sounded suspiciously like the beginning of a hugely successful and very lucrative plan to take over the world known as AOR... the old rockschool restraints and the undeniably attractive smell of the winning formula seem to block out any such experimental work and what you end up with is something very like the same old story." ...|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - I am {{beginning}} {{to be ashamed of}} writing on to you without the least acknowledgment, like a tramp; but I do not care - I am hardened; and whatever be the cause of your silence, I mean to write till all is blue. I am outright ashamed of my news, which is that we are not coming home for another year. I cannot but hope it may continue the vast improvement of my health: I think it good for Fanny and Lloyd; and we have all a taste for this wandering and dangerous life. My mother I send home, to my relief, as this part of our cruise will be (if we can carry it out) rather difficult in places. Here is the idea: about the middle of June (unless the Boston Board objects) we sail from Honolulu in the missionary ship (barquentine auxiliary steamer) MORNING STAR: she takes us through the Gilberts and Marshalls, and drops us (this is my great idea) on Ponape, one of the volcanic islands of the Carolines. Here we stay marooned among a doubtful population, with a Spanish vice-governor and five native kings, and a sprinkling of missionaries all at loggerheads, on the chance of fetching a passage to Sydney in a trader, a labour ship, or (maybe, but this appears too bright) a ship of war. If we can't get the MORNING STAR (and the Board has many reasons that I can see for refusing its permission) I mean to try to fetch Fiji, hire a schooner there, do the Fijis and Friendlies, hit the course of the RICHMOND at Tonga Tabu, make back by Tahiti, and so to S. F., and home: perhaps in June 1890. For {{the latter part of the}} cruise will likely be the same in either case. You can see for yourself how much variety and adventure this promises, and that it is not devoid of danger at the best; but if we <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> in safety, gives me a fine book of travel, and Lloyd a fine lecture and diorama, which should vastly better our finances.|$|E

Dhruva's belt has evolved over the years from a simple leather belt to a leather utility belt with pouches to a metallic utility belt. In its current version, Dhruva's utility belt is a metallic belt with inbuilt locking system to make sure that no one <b>can</b> easily <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> or cut <b>it</b> as against his older leather belt. The star shaped buckle has an inbuilt transmitter which enables Dhruva to stay in contact with commando headquarters, police force and even some of his allies including Chandika. Dhruva is known to carry a lot of utility items in his belt pockets. The various items that he has been shown to carry in his utility belt at various times include, but are not limited to, spare cartridges for star-blades and star-lines, acid capsules, signal flares, star cuffs (star shaped handcuffs), a make-up kit and many more items. Dhruva also carries a special transmitter fixed at 'Brahmand Rakshak' frequency which enables him to stay in contact with the Brahmand Rakshak headquarters as well as the other members of Brahmand Rakshak team. On some occasions he has been shown to carry a separate Brahmand Rakshak transmitter while on the other occasions it has been shown to be integrated with Dhruva's personal star-transmitter. Dhruva also carries a radiation sensor which is either fitted in his collar button or sometimes in his belt and blinks whenever there is threat of hazardous level of radiation exposure.|$|R
5000|$|Change Giver {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews upon release, with some critics finding {{it to be}} a respectable debut album for a young, upcoming band, but that it mainly served as an indication that the group were capable of bettering it in future releases. [...] Angela Lewis, writing for The Independent in October 1994, described the group as [...] "roguishly disarming youth popsters" [...] who, despite having [...] "a bravado whiff of ridiculous self assurance that's straight out of Blur's 1992 patent", had something worthwhile to offer with the release of their debut album. [...] She went on to note the band's Britishness, and found similarities with The Smiths in their music: [...] "At the heart of Shed Seven's appeal is their memorable way with a glucose-centred pop tune (many sweat at it but few <b>can</b> actually <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off)</b> in songs like 'Mark' and 'Dolphin'. Plus, there's the ghost of The Smiths in the Sheddoes chiming chords, putting in a friendly, but not too overwhelming, appearance." [...] Ian Gittins of Melody Maker also noted a similarity with The Smiths, via a [...] "tenuous link" [...] found in the lyrics written by Shed Seven's frontman, Rick Witter, who he thought had [...] "an ear for Morrissey-esque homely homilies". [...] He described the album as [...] "spasmodically exciting and uplifting", but found it to be too orthodox a record overall to be able to [...] "term it a 'classic'". He also drew comparisons with both Radiohead and Oasis, and highlighted [...] "Dirty Soul" [...] and [...] "Long Time Dead" [...] as the album's standout tracks: [...] "Viewed as a chipper, cocky collection of brassy northern pop songs, Change Giver scores a resounding... seven out of 10. 'Dirty Soul', the opener, is the kind of choppy, fuzzy rollercoaster ride Shed Seven are good at and 'Long Time Dead' is a supremely catchy angst fest à la 'Creep'".|$|R
