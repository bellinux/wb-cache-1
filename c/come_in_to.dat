The next day the women are {{reported}} missing by their husbands, and their bodies are found posed in a park. Nesbitt is next seen working in his pharmacy, when another young couple <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> purchase medication in preparation for an exotic honeymoon. Nesbitt instead surreptitiously gives them an MDMA-like drug, suggesting they take it immediately.|$|E
5|$|Loup {{took the}} {{loss in the}} Blue Jays' second game of the 2015 season. Entering with a 3–1 lead against the New York Yankees in the eighth inning, he loaded the bases without {{recording}} an out. All three runners would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> score and Toronto would lose, 4–3. On April 12, Loup pitched 1 perfect innings against the Orioles, taking the win by a score of 10–7. Loup experienced ineffectiveness throughout the season, posting an ERA over 5.00 into August. Following a 3–1 win over the Yankees on August 16, Loup was optioned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. He was recalled on September 1.|$|E
5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> {{speak to}} Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community {{to bring in a}} suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease the black community. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E

25|$|The Bangladeshi bowlers bowled patiently, but {{the poor}} start had cost them badly, {{and it went}} {{from bad to worse}} when Nazmul limped off in his seventh over. He was {{eventually}} substituted for Tushar Imran, while Aftab Ahmed took over his bowling duties. Neither could contain the Sri Lankans, though, as the captain Marvan Atapattu and wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara took Sri Lanka past 200 with 11 overs to go. Sangakkara eventually fell to Rafique, and in the next over Syed Rasel got rid of pinch hitter Dilhara Lokuhettige for 2, only to see Mahela Jayawardene, the man of the last match, <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> partner Atapattu. The pair added 43 from the last 26 balls, Atapattu recording a whirlwind 53 while Jayawardene closed on 23.|$|E
25|$|On {{the road}} against the Toronto Blue Jays on July 25, the Rays were down 8–0 after four innings, and losing 9–1 {{entering}} the 7th inning. However the Rays would score eight runs {{over the next}} 3 innings to tie the game, including two solo home runs in the 9th inning. The game would enter extra innings, where the Rays would take a one-run lead {{into the bottom of}} the 12th inning. Joe Nelson would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> pitch as the Rays' last remaining relief pitcher available. The Blue Jays would load the bases with one out, but could not capitalize. This became the largest come from behind win in franchise history for the Rays, a record previously set earlier in the season.|$|E

500|$|In a September 2008 interview, Jean {{said that}} Kenneth Branagh would guest star as the pub owner {{and that he}} had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> record the part. However, Branagh was {{replaced}} by Meaney and did not appear in the episode. According to Fox's official press release, Kathy Ireland was to have a cameo as herself. However, although she appeared in animated form in the episode, a caption stated that the producers asked her to guest voice and that [...] she had declined. The voice of her character was performed by Tress MacNeille.|$|E
500|$|As {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy, who plays William Bell, was {{unavailable}} {{to shoot the}} brief conversation with Blair Brown's Nina Sharp, the producers knew {{they wanted to do}} something a little more creative for the scene. They talked to cartoonist Frank Miller and hired a special effects school to do all the modeling, which they accomplished based on photos of Nimoy, because the actor could not <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> have his head scanned; he did some voicework however. The finished scene included an animated version of Nimoy's head, shown through the same window as the one used in [...] "Peter".|$|E

Mitchell did some research for the role, talking with female law enforcement officers to gain an understanding of how they evaluate situations. Mitchell views her character as a [...] "down-to-earth sheriff" [...] that carries with her a [...] "farmer's common sense". The actress believes a character like Nancy Adams lends to the realism the show tries to portray within its comic book environment. Gough describes Sheriff Adams as [...] "a cross between Holly Hunter and the sheriff in Fargo".|$|E
500|$|The {{ice cream}} sparked {{debate in the}} Los Angeles Times, when food writer Noelle Carter {{described}} bacon ice cream as perfection but the health section put up {{a photograph of a}} heart bypass and the headline [...] "Bacon ice cream. No good can come of it". The Delaware [...] "Udder Delight" [...] ice cream maker, Chip Hearn, who made bacon ice cream appears to have done so partly as a gimmick to get people into his shop, since he allows customers to taste any flavour in the store. He felt that his flavours differentiated him from the many other parlours on the shore and many people <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> try bacon ice cream only to buy something else.|$|E
500|$|In late March, VIII Corps {{advanced}} eastward through Eisenach {{and then}} across the Fulda River. Here some of Middleton's infantrymen {{came across the}} concentration camp at Ohrdruf, discovering the sickening evidence of what had transpired there. Middleton called Patton to come take a look, and Patton was joined by Bradley and Eisenhower. [...] In his diary, Patton described the place as [...] "one of the most appalling sights that I have ever seen." [...] This was the first Nazi concentration camp to be discovered by the United States Army, and Eisenhower cabled Marshall to get a delegation from congress over to witness and communicate what took place there. Middleton later had officials from the town <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> witness {{what was going on}} in their midst.

After Michael rejects an initial offer of $12,000 to buy the company, David {{suggests}} that he is bluffing, saying he knows that his company's prices are too low to be sustainable. Michael keeps his cool and rebuts that Dunder Mifflin's best branch is [...] "bleeding" [...] and David could be replaced during an upcoming major stockholder meeting as a result. David gives a second offer of $60,000, which is strongly considered, but Michael rejects this offer at the last second and demands the company give him his old job back and hire Ryan and Pam as salespeople. David is reluctant to hire three people with full benefits, especially given Ryan's disastrous history with the company, and likens it to [...] "a multimillion dollar buyout". Michael refuses to back down, and David reluctantly agrees to his demands.|$|E
500|$|... "Not Pictured" [...] {{would mark}} the final {{appearance}} by series regular Jackie Cook (Tessa Thompson). When asked whether Jackie {{was done with}} the show, Thomas replied, [...] "She is. I would not hesitate for a second to have her <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> do an arc, but she will not be a series regular." [...] One notable recurring character absence in the finale is that of Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Ritter wanted to appear in the episode, but she was unable to do so because of scheduling conflicts. [...] "It was unfortunate for me that I couldn't be in the finale episode (I booked a pilot) because I was looking forward to showing how everything that went down affected her. On a side note, I did start to think that I was responsible for the crash. I really wanted her to be a bad guy." [...] She would later appear in the Veronica Mars movie.|$|E

He had made the allegation a number of times in public and media appearances in 2006 and 2007. The book also described a conversation Clark had with Paul Wolfowitz in May 1991 after the Gulf War, quoting Wolfowitz as lamenting the non-removal of Saddam Hussein, but also telling him that [...] "...we did learn one thing that’s very important. With the end of the Cold War, we can now use our military with impunity. The Soviets won’t <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> block us.
