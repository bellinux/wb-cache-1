Unlike laksan {{that uses}} slices of pempek fishcake, lakso uses noodle-like steamed sago paste served in coconut milk soup with mixture spices: of palm sugar, black pepper, turmeric, {{coriander}} and <b>candlenut,</b> sprinkled with fried shallots. Palembang Lakso usually uses freshwater fish such as patin and gabus (snakehead) as stock-base and its flesh is also served, the simpler and cheaper recipe however, might just use instant chicken broth.|$|E

25|$|In Indonesia, most of laksa {{variants}} are coconut milk-based soup, {{thus can}} be categorized into curry laksa. Common spices include turmeric, coriander, <b>candlenut,</b> lemongrass, garlic, shallot and pepper cooked in coconut milk. Widely available daun kemangi (Indonesian lemon basil leaf) is commonly used instead of daun kesum. Bihun or thin rice vermicelli is most commonly used noodle instead of thick rice noodle, and some recipe might add slices of ketupat or lontong rice cake. Bogor laksa uses ground oncom into its soup.|$|E
25|$|Bogor Laksa (Indonesian: Laksa Bogor) {{perhaps is}} the most famous Laksa variant in Indonesia from Bogor city, West Java. The thick {{yellowish}} coconut milk based soup {{is a mixture of}} shallot, garlic, kemiri (<b>candlenut),</b> kunyit (turmeric), ketumbar (coriander), sereh (lemongrass), and salt. Laksa Bogor has a distinct earthy and nutty flavour acquired from oncom (orange-colored fermented beans cake, similar to tempe but different fungi). The hot soup runs, drained, and filled several times into the bowl contains bihun (rice vermicelli), ketupat (glutinous rice cake), smashed oncom, tauge (bean sprout), kemangi (basil leaves), yellow tofu (colored with turmeric) and boiled egg, until all the ingredients is soft and cooked. The authentic and complete Bogor laksa would include cooked shredded chicken and ground dried prawn, the cheaper street-side version however is entirely vegetarian, without any chicken or prawn, since oncom is traditionally regarded as a meat-substitute. Usually Laksa Bogor is served with sambal cuka (ground chilli in vinegar).|$|E
500|$|In {{his second}} year of school, Sidik fell from a <b>candlenut</b> tree and lost consciousness. After he awoke, his mother {{sent a letter to}} Widjojokoesoemo, who decided that Sidik's name was the cause of his misbehaviour. In reply, Widjojokoesoemo wrote that Sidik should be renamed Oerip, which means [...] "alive". When he {{recovered}} fully, his family decided that the newly renamed Oerip– who continued to misbehave– should study at the local Dutch School for Girls (...) the schools for boys were full and they hoped that the girls' school would improve Oerip's skill in Dutch, the language of the regime, as well as his temperament. After a year in the girls' school, in which Oerip became calmer, he was sent to a Dutch-run school for boys. However, his academic results continued to be poor. Beginning in his final year of elementary school, he often visited his friend's father, an ex-soldier who had served in Aceh for twenty years, to listen to the old man's stories, which inspired Oerip to join the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army ( [...] , or KNIL).|$|E
50|$|Sambal bajak (badjak): Banten sambal. Chili (or {{another kind}} of red pepper) fried with oil, shallot, garlic, terasi, <b>candlenuts,</b> palm sugar and other condiments. This is darker and richer in flavor than sambal asam.|$|R
50|$|Other {{essential}} seasoning and garnishes include tamarind (asam jawa), {{specifically the}} paste-like pulp {{extracted from the}} fruit pod which contributes a tart flavour to many dishes. <b>Candlenuts</b> (buah keras) are similar in appearance to macadamia nuts, being round, cream coloured and have a high oil content. <b>Candlenuts</b> are normally ground to thicken sauces. Lup cheong {{is a type of}} dried Chinese sausage made from pork meat and spices. Mainly used by the Malaysian Chinese community, these sweet sausages are usually sliced very thinly and added for additional flavour and texture. Recent studied have shown that there are 62 commonly consumed Malaysian foods that include biogenic amines.|$|R

500|$|A plant of the Wet Tropics bioregion, Alloxylon flammeum {{is found}} on the Atherton Tablelands in Far North Queensland at altitudes of [...] above sea level. Its range is from Danbulla to the upper Barron River, though most of its {{rainforest}} habitat has been cleared for agriculture, and it is found in protected remnants such as Mount Hypipamee National Park, Danbulla National Park, Crater Lakes National Park, Curtain Fig Tree National Park, and Hallorans Hill Conservation Park. Found on basalt- or granite-based soil, it is a component of complex notophyll vine forest or rainforest, where it is a canopy or emergent tree. This forest, also known as Mabi forest, has an uneven canopy layer to around 45m (100ft) and significant scrub understory. Here Alloxylon flammeum is found with such species as <b>candlenut</b> (Aleurites rockinghamensis), Argyrodendron spp., fishtail lawyer cane (Calamus caryotoides), rose maple (Cryptocarya onoprienkoana), shining-leaved stinging tree (Dendrocnide photinophylla), fig trees (Ficus spp.), Queensland maple (Flindersia brayleyana), cabbage crowsfoot (Franciscodendron laurifolium), northern brush mahogany (Geissois biagiana), Atherton turkey bush (Hodgkinsonia frutescens), and red cedar (Toona ciliata).|$|E

60|$|And such a ride! Falling {{water was}} everywhere. We rode above the clouds, under the clouds, {{and through the}} clouds! {{and every now and}} then a shaft of {{sunshine}} penetrated like a search-light to the depths yawning beneath us, or flashed upon some pinnacle of the crater-rim thousands of feet above. At every turn of the trail a waterfall or a dozen waterfalls, leaping hundreds of feet through the air, burst upon our vision. At our first night's camp, in the Keanae Gulch, we counted thirty-two waterfalls from a single viewpoint. The vegetation ran riot over that wild land. There were forests of koa and kolea trees, and <b>candlenut</b> trees; and then there were the trees called ohia-ai, which bore red mountain apples, mellow and juicy and most excellent to eat. Wild bananas grew everywhere, clinging to the sides of the gorges, and, overborne by their great bunches of ripe fruit, falling across the trail and blocking the way. And over the forest surged a sea of green life, the climbers of a thousand varieties, some that floated airily, in lacelike filaments, from the tallest branches others that coiled and wound about the trees like huge serpents; and one, the ei-ei, that was for all the world like a climbing palm, swinging on a thick stem from branch to branch and tree to tree and throttling the supports whereby it climbed. Through the sea of green, lofty tree-ferns thrust their great delicate fronds, and the lehua flaunted its scarlet blossoms. Underneath the climbers, in no less profusion, grew the warm-coloured, strangely-marked plants that in the United States one is accustomed to seeing preciously conserved in hot- houses. In fact, the ditch country of Maui is nothing more nor less than a huge conservatory. Every familiar variety of fern flourishes, and more varieties that are unfamiliar, from the tiniest maidenhair to the gross and voracious staghorn, the latter the terror of the woodsmen, interlacing with itself in tangled masses five or six feet deep and covering acres.|$|E

It is often served during Christmas and also on other special occasions.|$|R
50|$|In Tonga, even today, ripe nuts, named tuitui, are pounded into a paste, tukilamulamu, {{and used}} as soap or shampoo. As {{recently}} as 1993, <b>candlenuts</b> were chewed into sweet-scented emollient used during a traditional funerary ritual in the outlying islands of the Kingdom of Tonga. Their scent was also used for making various sweet-smelling oils for the skin. In Australia, aborigines also used them {{for a variety of}} similar purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Nonya {{cooking is}} the result of {{blending}} Chinese ingredients with various distinct spices and cooking techniques used by the Malay/Indonesian community. This gives rise to Peranakan interpretations of Malay/Indonesian food that is similarly tangy, aromatic, spicy and herbal. In other instances, the Peranakans have adopted Malay cuisine as part of their taste palate, such as assam fish and beef rendang. Key ingredients include coconut milk, galangal (a subtle, mustard-scented rhizome similar to ginger), <b>candlenuts</b> as both a flavoring and thickening agent, laksa leaf, pandan leaves (Pandanus amaryllifolius), belachan, tamarind juice, lemongrass, torch ginger bud, jicama, fragrant kaffir lime leaf, rice or egg noodles and cincaluk - a powerfully flavored, sour and salty shrimp-based condiment that is typically mixed with lime juice, chillies and shallots and eaten with rice, fried fish and other side dishes.|$|R

50|$|Abui {{speakers}} {{are mainly}} farmers, just like other inhabitants of Alor. However, in mountainous areas {{hunting and gathering}} {{is also an important}} supplement to the staple diet of corn, cassava, and rice. In the coastal areas, which are less favourable for agriculture, many farmers have switched to fishing, the traditional activity of the Austronesian population. Traditional livestock are pigs and chicken. However, livestock seldom supplement the diet due to frequent swine fever and poultry diseases. Thus, the diet is not well balanced, often resulting in poor health conditions and anaemia, especially among children and women. In the mountainous areas the situation is better as traditional hunting provides a more balanced diet. The mountains also favour a number of important cash crops such as tamarind, coconuts, coffee, cloves, cocoa, cashew nuts, <b>candlenuts</b> (Aleurites moluccana), vanilla, almonds and tobacco. These provide the farmers with additional income, which results in generally better living standards than for people in the coastal areas.|$|R
5000|$|In Indonesia curry {{is called}} kari or kare. The {{most common type}} of kari {{consumed}} in Indonesia is kari ayam (chicken curry) and kari kambing (goat meat curry). In Aceh and North Sumatra roti cane is often eaten with kari kambing. Other dishes such as gulai and opor are dishes based on curry. They are often highly localised and reflect the meat and vegetables available. They can therefore employ a variety of meats (chicken, beef, water buffalo and goat as in the flavoursome gulai kambing), seafood (such as prawn, crab, mussel, clam, and squid), fish (tuna, mackerel, carp, pangasius, catfish), or vegetables (young jackfruit, common beans, cassava leaf) dishes in a spiced sauce. They use local ingredients such as chili peppers, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, galangal, Indonesian bay leaves (salam leaf), <b>candlenuts,</b> turmeric, turmeric leaves, asam gelugur and asam kandis (sour mangosteens similar to tamarind), shrimp paste (terasi), cumin, coriander seed and coconut milk. In Aceh, curries use daun salam koja or daun kari (Murraya koenigii) translated as [...] "curry leaves".|$|R
2500|$|When Polynesian {{seafarers}} {{arrived on}} the Hawaiian Islands in 300–500 AD, few edible plants existed in the new land, aside from ferns (Hāpuʻu ʻiʻi, whose uncoiled fronds are eaten boiled) and fruits that grew at higher elevations. Botanists and archaeologists believe that the Polynesian voyagers introduced anywhere between 27 and more than 30 plants to the islands, known as canoe plants, mainly for food. The most important of them was taro. [...] For centuries taro, and the poi made from it, was the main staple of their diet, {{and it is still}} much loved today. In addition to taro the Polynesians brought yams and sweet potatoes. The latter are believed to have come from Polynesian contact with the New World. The Marquesans, the first settlers from Polynesia, brought breadfruit and the Tahitians later introduced the baking banana. These settlers from Polynesia also brought coconuts, <b>candlenuts</b> (known in Hawaiian as kukui nuts), and sugarcane. They found plenty of fish, shellfish, and limu in the new land. Flightless birds were easy to catch and nests were full of eggs for the taking. Most Pacific islands had no meat animals except bats and lizards, so ancient Polynesians sailed the Pacific with pigs, chickens and dogs as cargo. Pigs were raised for religious sacrifice, and the meat was offered at altars, some of which was consumed by priests and the rest eaten in a mass celebration. The early Hawaiian diet was diverse, and may have included as many as 130 different types of seafood and 230 types of sweet potatoes. [...] Some species of land and sea birds were consumed into extinction.|$|R
