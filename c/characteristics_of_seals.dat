40|$|Objectives] In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of working medium parameters on the static and dynamic <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> in turbomachinery, [Methods] a three-dimensional model of a labyrinth seal was created, and air and steam were applied in the numerical simulation. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method and a rotating frame were applied to analyze the influence of different steam parameters on the leakage characteristics and dynamic characteristic coefficients. [Results] The results show that great differences in leakage flow rate are apparent under different air and steam conditions, and the fluid-induced force shows linear and nonlinear variation with the increasing whirl speed. When the steam temperature increases, the system stability decreases as the dynamic characteristic coefficients change. [Conclusions] In consequence, working medium parameters are of great significance for turbine stability, {{and the influence of}} working medium parameters on the static and dynamic <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> should be given great attention in practical application...|$|E
40|$|One {{dominant}} “wind noise” generating {{mechanism in}} road vehicles is {{the interaction between}} turbulent flows and flexible structures: specifically door seals and side glass windows. In this study, the effects of seal mechanical properties on interior aerodynamic noise were investigated. ^ The sound transmission <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> were first investigated. The vibration response together with the radiated sound power was computed using FE-analysis. Experimental data obtained for several seal specimens using reverberation room test methods {{was used in the}} validation of numerical models. The developed tools were used to compare sound transmission <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> made of EPDM and TPE. The validated numerical model was then utilized to investigate the influence of various design parameters on the sound transmission <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals.</b> It was found that any unconstrained structural coupling between seal walls should be avoided to minimize sound transmission. ^ The sound radiated by a seal-supported, rectangular plate excited by turbulent flows was then investigated. The primary goal was to assess the influence of support properties on the noise generated from the plate. The flow-induced vibration of the plate was calculated using the Corcos model for the surface pressure loading and an assumed-modes method. The results showed that support tuning can yield significant reduction in vibration amplitudes for a fixed excitation amplitude. Two different methods to calculate the optimal support stiffness were developed. The first model, based on a one-dimensional transverse wave assumption, yielded a good first cut approximation of the optimal properties. The second model, based on the assumed-modes method, yielded more accurate estimations. The optimal support stiffnesses calculated from the two different methods were in close agreement. ^ Finally, experimental techniques to measure viscoelastic properties of foamed elastomers at high frequencies were developed and applied to measure mechanical properties of seal materials. The measurements were performed for foams with various void fractions, from which the relationship between the void fraction and the dynamic moduli was measured. The measurement results were compared to the predictions from several different micromechanics models. The results can be used to determine optimal seal mechanical properties that minimize the aerodynamic noise. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{dust explosion}} research conducted in an experimental mine {{and in a}} 20 -L laboratory chamber at the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The primary purpose {{of this research is}} to improve safety in mining, but the data are also useful to other industries that manufacture, process, or use combustible dusts. Explosion characteristics such as the minimum explosible concentration and the rock dust inerting requirements were measured for various combustible dusts from the mining industries. These dusts included bituminous coats, gilsonite, oil shales, and sulfide ores. The full-scale tests were conducted in the Lake Lynn experimental mine of NIOSH. The mine tests were initiated by a methane-air explosion at the face (closed end) that both entrained and ignited the dust. The laboratory-scale tests were conducted in the 20 -L chamber using ignitors of various energies. One purpose of the laboratory and mine comparison is to determine the conditions under which the laboratory tests best simulate the full-scale tests. The results of this research showed relatively good agreement between the laboratory and the large-scale tests in determining explosion limits. Full-scale experiments in the experimental mine were also conducted to evaluate the explosion resistance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> that are used to separate non-ventilated, inactive workings from active workings of a mine. Results of these explosion tests show significant increases in explosion overpressure due to added coal dust and indications of pressure piling...|$|E

The flow field <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> brush <b>seal</b> was discussed based on three-dimensional (3 -D) computational model <b>of</b> brush <b>seal,</b> two-way fluid–structure interaction and moving grid technique. Then the effect of structural parameters on the leakage <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> brush <b>seals</b> was investigated from theoretical and numerical simulation perspectives with the emphasis on an improved prediction formula of leakage flow rate <b>of</b> brush <b>seals.</b> As illustrated in the analysis <b>of</b> the leakage <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> brush <b>seals,</b> (1) the leakage with the influence of bristle deflection is closer to the results of experiment relative to that without bristle deflection, and increases with the increasing inlet/outlet pressure ratios, which validate the developed 3 -D computational model with bristle deflection to be more reasonable; (2) the flow field characteristics (pressure and velocity) <b>of</b> brush <b>seal</b> are revealed reasonably; (3) with the increasing of the height of backing plate fence, the clearance of brush wire and the axial clearance between brush bristle and back plate, the leakage factor rises and then reaches a stable value when the clearance of brush is larger than 0. 3 mm; moreover, (4) with the increase of brush wire diameter, the leakage factor decreases firstly and then tends to stabilization, while rapidly decreases at first, then slowly decreases, and lastly tends to a value when the bristle row number increases; (5) the reliability and accuracy of the proposed prediction equation for brush seals is validated to be high by the CFD computational results.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a comparison of}} experimental rotordynamic coefficients for laminar, smooth bushing oil seals to theoretical predictions from XLLubeGT and XLAnSeal. The experimental results come from a new test rig developed at the Turbomachinery Laboratory at Texas A&M University. The two software programs were developed to predict the static and dynamic <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals.</b> XLLubeGT is a Reynolds equation based program while XLAnSeal {{is based on a}} bulk-flow Navier- Stokes model that includes temporal and convective acceleration terms. XLAnSeal was used to predict the added-mass terms of the seals since XLLubeGT assumes those terms to be zero or negligible. The data used for input into the two seals code was the actual measured conditions from the test rig. As part of the input parameters, inlet inertia effects and thermal gradients along the seal were included. Both XLLubeGT and XLAnSeal have the capability to analyze straight bore seals with different inlet and outlet clearances ? essentially a tapered seal ? but seal expansion caused by the radial differential pressure across the seal bushing was not included. Theoretical and experimentally determined dynamic characteristics include stiffness, damping, inertia terms and Whirl Frequency Ratio (WFR). Seal static characteristics are also reported. They include: leakage, shaft center line loci and Reynolds numbers. Test conditions include three shaft speeds: 4000, 7000 and 10, 000 rpm, three test pressures: 21, 45 and 69 bar [300, 650, and 1000 psi] and multiple eccentricities from 0. 0 to 0. 7. The results for the dynamic characteristics show good correlation of the experimental data to the theoretical values up to an eccentricity of about 0. 5. At higher eccentricities, the theory generally under-predicts the dynamic characteristics. Inertia terms are greatly under-predicted. The results for the static characteristics also show good correlation to the experimental data, but they also have a tendency to be under-predicted at higher eccentricities...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of diet is {{fundamental}} to studies of seal ecology and especially to any understanding of their role as predators in the northwest Atlantic marine ecosystem. Hooded seals (Cyostophora cristata) {{are one of the}} largest of the northern phocids and are abundant in the north Atlantic and Arctic seas, but very little quantitative data is available on their feeding behaviour and dietary preferences. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the diet of hooded seals in Newfoundland waters. [...] Otoliths of six common prey species, determined from a previous study on diet of hooded seals, were used to determine fish length / weight - otolith length / height regressions. For all species except Greenland halibut, the strongest correlations between otolith size and fish length / weight were established using maximum otolith length. For Greenland halibut, maximum otolith height gave a better correlation with fish length and weight. Least squares linear equations were used to derive fish length for Arctic cod, Atlantic herring and capelin, while second order polynomial models were used for Greenland halibut, redfish spp., and Atlantic cod. Fish weight estimates were derived using power (log - log) models for all six fish species. [...] Stomach contents of 67 hooded seals collected from inshore and offshore waters off Newfoundland were examined to determine the types of prey eaten by hooded seals. The majority of stomachs (73 %) came from the nearshore region along the northeast coast of Newfoundland and were taken in April. Over half of the samples collected were female (64. 2 %). [...] Fourteen prey groups were identified in stomachs (10 fish, 4 invertebrate). The relative importance of prey, expressed as the percent total wet weight of prey recovered, indicated that Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) was the most important species, followed in order of importance by redfish (Sebastes spp.), Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), squid (Gonatus spp.), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). [...] Using otoliths from a previous study and from this study, lengths and weights of fish were estimated from a total of 72 stomachs. Hooded seals fed mainly on fish of 25 - 35 cm length for the larger species, and 15 - 25 cm for the smaller ones. Fish consumed by seals caught incidentally from offshore trawlers were larger than those taken elsewhere. The estimated lengths, and proportions (% weight) of fish found per stomach did not differ significantly between male and female hooded seals. [...] The proportions (percent weight) of redfish and Atlantic herring consumed by hooded seals were significantly larger in the summer months, whereas a higher proportion of Arctic cod was consumed in the winter months. No seasonal differences were found in actual lengths of fish eaten. [...] Total energetic values for fish eaten were calculated from estimated wet weights and energy densitites (kJ/g). Greenland halibut, Atlantic herring and Atlantic cod had the highest average energetic values (kJ), followed by redfish, Arctic cod, capelin and squid. Relative contributions of prey, expressed as the percent total energy of prey recovered, showed that Greenland halibut contributed approximately 53 % of the total energy consumed, followed by redfish, Atlantic herring, Arctic cod, squid, Atlantic cod and capelin. These proportions corresponded with those obtained from percent total wet weight of prey recovered. [...] The relative abundance of the fish species has a strong influence on the composition of the food in the diet of seals. Hooded seals spend some time in areas that are exploited by commercial fisheries, and consume commercial fish species of commercial size. However, in order to evaluate the impact of local predation on individual fish stocks, more information on behavioural and physiological <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> and fish are needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a passive, inexpensive technique for monitoring explosion overpressures within sealed areas in underground coal mines. From 1994 to 2000, seven explosions of methane and/or coal dust occurred within the worked-out, sealed areas (gobs) of underground U. S. coal mines. These explosions, believed to have been started by lightning, destroyed many seals and caused much damage external to the sealed area. One gob explosion went undetected until the mine operator reopened the sealed area and discovered the damage. Fortunately, these gob explosions did not cause any fatalities or injuries. Because lightning occurs in just about all mining areas, several questions arise. Could gob gas explosions be occurring in other sealed areas and going undetected? If so, what is the magnitude of the resulting explosion overpressures? The Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) undertook a study to identify and evaluate passive measuring devices to monitor and quantify the overpressures associated with such explosions. This work was done in parallel with full-scale explosion experiments for evaluating the strength <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> used for isolating areas in underground coal mines. Evaluation studies were done in PRL's 20 -liter explosion test chamber and in the full-scale Experimental Mine at Lake Lynn Laboratory to evaluate the response and accuracy of various commercially available automobile tire pressure gauges to overpressures generated from gas and dust explosions. The first series of tests was done in the 20 -liter chamber, which is used to study the explosibility and inerting of fuel dusts and gases. Data from the tire pressure gauge tests were compared to the pressure-time data obtained from the 20 -liter chamber 's traditional electronic strain gauge pressure transducer recorded on a high-speed data acquisition system. To evaluate the tire pressure gauges, the valved inlet (tip) of the candidate pressure gauge was removed and the body of the gauge was cemented with epoxy into a 0. 25 -in pipe elbow and attached to the outside of the test chamber. A second series of tire gauge evaluation tests was done at Lake Lynn during explosion-resistance testing of seals used in underground coal mines. Full-scale seals (20 ft wide by 8 ft high) were constructed as one wall of a 2, 000 -ft 3 chamber and exposed to a series of methane explosions. Average overpressures ranged from 20 to 80 psi. The seals were built with various strength materials ranging from 7 to 48 in thick. The modified tire gauges are attached on the outside of the chamber to a 0. 25 -in NPT pipe that extends into the chamber (figure 1). The axis of the gauge is mounted at a right angle to the plane of the seal to minimize the coupling of any seal movement to the stem of the gauge that may cause inaccurate readings. The internal explosion pressure history is recorded with a strain gauge pressure transducer mounted inside the chamber. Methane is injected into the chamber, mixed with air, and ignited with an electric spark located at the geometric center of the chamber. Maximum explosion overpressures are recorded and compared with the tire gauge pressure. Several constant volume explosions were conducted in the 20 -liter chamber in order to vary the maximum pressure and the time-to-peak pressure. The comparison between the maximum pressure measured by the strain gauge and that determined by the tire pressure gauge is shown in figure 2. There is fairly good agreement over the pressure range from 5. 9 to 18. 7 psi. Maximum pressure comparisons from large-scale chamber tests are also very encouraging. Maximum pressures recorded with internal electronic strain pressure gauge agreed within 1 psi of the tire gauge reading for all tests without seal failure. Results show that this simple, in- expensive, passive device can be used to monitor overpressures contained within sealed areas of underground mines or to record the gob explosion overpressures if one or more seals fail during the explosion. For in-mine use, a single pressure gauge could be installed on one seal in a set of two to six seals. If desired, two gauges covering different ranges could be attached to the same seal. Existing sampling tubes could be used to attach the gauge where seals are already built. During the construction of a new seal, a dedicated or additional 0. 25 -in-diam pass-through tube could be installed. Any pressure rise can be identified during routine weekly examinations of the seals or shortly after a lightning strike in the area. Such an inexpensive device is useful as part of a surveillance study on the number and magnitude of undetected explosion events that occur in sealed areas of underground coal mines.

Design/methodology/approach: Many studies including SEM, XRD, FTIR, EDS, ICP and XRF have been made to examine the halloysite and halloysite – bentonite mixture properties. Findings: Influence of the halloysite additive on <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> GCL properties. Research limitations/implications: Studies described in this work should help to improve composition and optimize parameters <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> clay mixtures improving activities and functioning of GCL during a long period of time. Comparison {{of the effects of the}} halloysite additive on <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> clay layers properties and the possibility of its application in this area. Practical implications: Knowledge about changing of GCL properties during long time exploitation in landfills allows for selection <b>of</b> theirs main <b>sealing</b> parameters. The wrong choice of GCL parameters leads to multiplication of environmental costs and pollution of the area around storage place. Originality/value: Halloysite shows high sorption properties in relation to toxic heavy metals (eg cadmium, lead) and solutions containing harmful hydrocarbons, eg benzene, as well as toxic gases (ammonia, hydrogen sulfide).

40|$|Swirl brake {{influences}} the static and rotordynamic <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> labyrinth <b>seal</b> which {{are important in}} the prediction of turbomachine stability. To study {{the influence of the}} swirl brakes on improving seal stability, the effects of swirl brakes on the static and rotordynamic <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> labyrinth <b>seals</b> were investigated by the combination of numerical simulation and experiment. First, it was performed to the effects of swirl brake on the static flow <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> labyrinth <b>seal</b> with swirl ratio and pressure distribution based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). And then a comparison between leakage predicted by the CFD model and measurement was presented to verify the accuracy of the simulation. Moreover, an experiment was implemented to analyze the rotordynamic <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> labyrinth <b>seal</b> using an improved impedance method based on an unbalanced synchronous excitation method on a rotor test rig. The influences of swirl brake density, length, inlet/outlet pressure ratio, and rotating speed were measured and discussed, respectively. The CFD numerical results show that the swirl brake effectively reduces the seal swirl ratio (∼ 60 - 75 % less), circumferential pressure difference (∼ 25 - 85 % less) so that the seal destabilizing forces decrease. With the increasing of the swirl vanes density and length, the seal leakage drops (∼ 8 - 20 % less). The experimental rotordynamic characteristics results show that it is more obvious to reduce the crosscouple stiffness (∼ 50 - 300 % less) and increase the direct damping (∼ 50 - 60 % larger) with the increasing in the number and length of the swirl vanes, and thus the swirl brake improves the seal rotordynamic stability. The efforts of this paper provide a useful insight to clearly understand the effects of swirl brakes on the labyrinth seal static and rotordynamic characteristics, which is beneficial to improve the design <b>of</b> annular <b>seals.</b> Department <b>of</b> Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

Unsealed film and sealed film were loaded through a range of nominal loads and the resulting stains were analysed by use of custom-made macros for the ImageJ image-processing program. The coefficient of variation did not exceed 5. 7 per cent (sealed film), and the standardized coefficient of variation did not exceed 1. 8 per cent (unsealed and sealed film).

40|$|Abstract. The {{issue of}} this work is how to type mobility, {{in the sense that}} we tackle the problem of typing not only mobile agents but also their movement. This yields higher-order types for agents. To that end we first provide a new {{definition}} <b>of</b> the <b>Seal</b> Calculus that gets rid of existing inessential features while preserving the distinctive <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Seal</b> model. Then we discuss the use of interfaces to type agents and define the type system. The interpretation induced by this type system is that interfaces describe interaction effects rather than, as it is customary, provided services. We discuss at length the difference of the two interpretations and justify our choice of the former. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} food safety is {{increasingly}} becoming the focus of social concerns, and breakage of packaging film is the main threat to the safety <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> packaging food. For the small damage {{that is difficult to}} see with the naked eyes, according to that the impedance of damaged position is different from that of other position, the discharge signals <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> packaging food in different damaged conditions are different in high voltage dielectric barrier discharge circuit, and then they are collected and analyzed. In order to solve the problem that different discharge signals are similar and characteristics are confused, wavelet packet and the EEMD method are novelly used to analyze discharge signals and the <b>characteristic</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> packaging food that is intact or has pinholes are successfully extracted.

40|$|A fluidtight seal for a {{container}} is formed by abutting a metal ring with a step machined in a convexo-concave container closure device and inserting this assembly {{into an open}} end of the container. Under compressive force, the closure device deforms causing the metal ring to pivot about the step on the closure device and interact with symmetrically tapered inner walls of the container to form a fluidtight seal between the container and the closure device. The compressive force is then withdrawn without affecting the fluidtight <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seal.</b> A destructive force against the container closure device is necessary to destroy the fluidtight seal...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{mechanism}} of formation of self-sealing/healing isolation and immobilization in layered materials is investigated, with particular emphasis {{on the impact of}} such self-forming layer on the transport and mobility of chemical constituents. As principal example the layered acidic jarosite/alkaline coal fly ash system is considered. The approach to this program starts with investigating the formation potential of self-sealing layer in the layered jarosite/fly ash system. Next, <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sealing</b> layer and its impact on transport and mobility of chemical constituents are examined experimentally, followed by a mathematical description <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> layer development. Finally, chemically reactivity of self-sealing layer in the jarosite/fly ash is explored. For application purposes self-sealing isolation and immobilization, rather than neutralization, is recommended. Placing a layer of acidic jarosite adjacent to a layer of alkaline coal fly ash offers the optimal solution to the waste acidic jarosite environmental problem...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, {{more than}} 20, 000 mine seals have been erected in {{underground}} coal mines in the United States. Seals are used extensively in underground mines to isolate worked-out areas, active mine fire zones, and to control water inundations. Seals {{are most often}} built directly in the mine and can be fabricated from blocks made of wood or cementitious material. Recently, several explosions occurred within <b>sealed</b> areas <b>of</b> underground U. S. coal mines. These explosions, believed to be initiated by lightning strikes on the surface, destroyed numerous seals and caused considerable damage external to the sealed area. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is conducting research to develop design guidelines, to investigate noninvasive techniques to characterize seal strength properties, and to evaluate seal test methods. As part of this work, a 30 -ft wide, 16. 1 -ft tall and 4 -ft thick seal was built in an underground experimental mine using cement and foamed water. Two types of noninvasive techniques are currently being investigated, namely the Schmidt Hammer for measuring compressive strength and ground penetrating radar (GPR) for detecting the presence of anomalies (e. g., voids, discontinuities) within the seal. Once these noninvasive tests were completed, the seal was subjected to destructive explosion testing. This study {{presents the results of}} the Schmidt Hammer tests, GPR scans, and the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> failure during explosion testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{lubrication}} condition between seal faces directly affects the reliability, operating life and <b>sealing</b> performance <b>of</b> mechanical <b>seals.</b> Thus, {{the identification of}} lubrication regimes in face seals i. e. boundary lubrication (BL), mixed lubrication (ML) and hydrodynamic lubrication (HL) is of high importance for developing effective online condition monitoring approaches. This paper investigates the tribological behaviour and frictional <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> mechanical <b>seals</b> based on nonintrusive acoustic emission (AE) measurements. Mathematical models for AE generation mechanisms are derived based on the tribological behaviour and operating parameters <b>of</b> mechanical <b>seals.</b> They produce agreeable results with experimental data in explaining the types of AE signals observed in monitoring the face lubrication conditions. Frequency domain analysis of data shows that the viscous friction process generates more low frequency AE signals, whereas the asperity interactions show more high frequency AE. Moreover, the feasibility of using statistical parameters of the time domain data is shown to identify the lubrication regimes in face seals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{have been}} {{developing}} gaseous photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with a bialkali photocathode combined with micropattern gas detectors (MPGDs). The sensitivity of a PMT {{is described in}} terms of its quantum efficiency (QE). The QE is very important in many experiments, particularly when dealing with low photon statistics. A concise QE measurement system has been developed to evaluate the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sealed</b> gaseous PMT with a bialkali photocathode. This QE measurement system consists of a Xe arc lamp source, reflective optics and filters, a monochromator, and a reference Si photodiode detector. Using the system, we evaluated the QE, gain, and long-term stability of the gaseous PMT. Here, we report the results of our evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Sophisticated methods (CFD analyses) {{are used}} {{more and more}} for the {{analysis}} <b>of</b> gas <b>seal</b> forces. However, for some types <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> such as honeycomb or hole pattern seals bulk-flow models are still the only feasible way. Ha and Childs introduced such a model in their paper [4]. The entrance loss factor in their model is constant, what apparently leads to an incomplete consideration of the Lomakin effect. Comparison to measured results shows considerable deviation for the radial forces in annular gas seal. The present paper is dedicated to investigation of {{the cause of this}} deviation. For this purpose an extended model for entry conditions is proposed. The entrance loss factor is considered as a function <b>of</b> the <b>seal</b> clearance. Numerical computations of the pressure loss at the entrance <b>of</b> the gas <b>seal</b> using the FLUENT code are performed. The seal gap and the surrounding zones are considered in the solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes system with k-ω turbulence model. The obtained results are used as the boundary conditions for the bulk-flow seal model. This technique improves the algorithm for finding the basic <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seal,</b> leading to better coincidence of calculated and experimental results. In particular it improves such important parameter as the direct stiffness...|$|R
