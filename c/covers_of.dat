40|$|AbstractLet V be {{a finite}} {{dimensional}} real vector space and let A be {{an arrangement of}} hyperplanes in V. We denote by VC the complexification of V, by AC={HC=C⊗H|HϵA} the complexification of A, and by M(A) the complement in VC of the union of all elements of AC. We associate with A an oriented graph Γ(A) and some equivalonce relation ∽ in the set of (nonoriented) paths of Γ(A). The pair (Γ(A),∽) is called the oriented system associated with A. We introduce the notion <b>of</b> a <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> (Γ(A),∽), from any <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> (Γ(A),∽) we explicity construct a <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> M(A), we prove that every <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> M(A) can be obtained in {{this way and that}} a <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> (Γ(A),∽) is completely determined by the associated <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> M(A).
