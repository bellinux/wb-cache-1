5|$|The {{anatomy of}} 'Pachycephalosaurus' is poorly known, as only skull remains have been described. Pachycephalosaurus {{is famous for}} having a large, bony dome atop its skull, up to 25cm (10in) thick, which safely <b>cushioned</b> its tiny brain. The dome's rear aspect was edged with bony knobs and short bony spikes {{projected}} upwards from the snout. The spikes were probably blunt, not sharp.|$|E
5|$|Horse collar: A {{significant}} {{improvement of the}} ancient breast harness was the horse collar. The horse collar was depicted in a Northern Wei (386–534) mural at Dunhuang, China, dated 477–499; the latter artwork does not feature the essential collar cushion behind the cross bar, though, while a later Tang Dynasty (618–907) mural of about 851 accurately displays the <b>cushioned</b> collar behind the cross bar. An earlier painting of the Sui Dynasty (581–618) accurately depicted the horse collar as it is seen today, yet the illustration shows its use on a camel instead of a horse.|$|E
5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly {{during the day}} and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet {{consists}} of invertebrates (such as beetle grubs, earthworms, and caterpillars), fruits, and berries. It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. Its nest consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared with mud and often <b>cushioned</b> with grass or other soft materials. It {{is one of the first}} birds to sing at dawn, and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} seated buttock {{pressure}} distribution in six paraplegic patients {{by means of}} computerized pressure mapping. They were all male and their age ranged from 18 to 48 years old. Their level of paralysis varied from Th 5 to L 1. Five kinds of wheelchair <b>cushions</b> were studied: an air <b>cushion,</b> a contour <b>cushion,</b> a polyurethane foam <b>cushion,</b> a Cubicushion (which is made of polyurethane foams) and a silicone gel <b>cushion.</b> A tactile sensor consisting of 2064 matrices was used for measuring the buttock pressure distribution and the data was analyzed on a personal computer. Peak pressures measured for each <b>cushion</b> were as follows (in descending order) : the Cubicushion, the polyurethane foam <b>cushion,</b> the contour <b>cushion,</b> the silicone gel <b>cushion,</b> and the air <b>cushion.</b> The areas of total contact measured for each <b>cushion</b> were as follows (in descending order) : the air <b>cushion,</b> the silicone gel <b>cushion,</b> the polyurethane foam <b>cushion,</b> the contour <b>cushion</b> and the Cubicushion.

5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off {{from one foot to}} jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a <b>cushioned</b> landing area.

5|$|During the 1920s, the American Budd Company, at {{the time}} a {{relatively}} obscure auto-frame supplier, developed an extensive working relationship with the French firm Michelin, which was best known for its tires. In 1929, Michelin built its first rail car, and by 1932 nine of its cars were in operating service, all of which featured innovative and distinctive pneumatic tires. The company claimed that its application of tires on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more <b>cushioned</b> ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's tired wheels included an aluminum safety ring and a flange that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during normal operation, only the rubber tire made contact with the rail.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto <b>cushioned</b> landing mats. The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: Pressure-relieving {{wheelchair}} <b>cushions</b> are {{key factors}} {{in the prevention of}} pressure ulcers. Studies have compared wheelchair cushions; however few have used realistic testing periods. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare a newly developed <b>cushion</b> from Keen Mobility to a <b>cushion</b> from The Roho Group, a 2 ̆ 2 gold standard 2 ̆ 2 in pressure-relieving wheelchair <b>cushions.</b> A further goal was to examine changes in <b>cushion</b> performance over a prolonged period. Methods: Four subjects were asked to sit for three hours on two different pressure-relieving wheelchair <b>cushions.</b> Pressure mapping was used to gather data on mean pressure, peak pressure, and number of sensors activated. Subjects also rated the <b>cushions</b> on comfort. Results: There were significant increases in mean pressure with time for both <b>cushions.</b> The Keen <b>cushion</b> activated a significantly greater number of sensors than did the Roho <b>cushion.</b> Comfort tended to decrease with time for both <b>cushions.</b> Conclusion and Discussion: The two <b>cushions</b> have a similar ability to relieve pressure; however, the Keen <b>cushion</b> provides better envelopment. Also, long periods of sitting correlate with increases in interface pressure...|$|R
40|$|Alpine {{ecosystems}} {{are among those}} biomes that are most vulnerable to climate change. <b>Cushion</b> plants are an important life form of alpine ecosystems and will likely {{play a critical role}} for the resilience of these habitats to climate change.

At the driest site at low elevation we found the lowest total <b>cushion</b> cover, a particularly high proportion of very small <b>cushions,</b> and the most compact <b>cushions</b> (highest rosette and biomass densities, and leaf area index (LAI) per <b>cushion).</b> Our results indicate that in the semi-arid Tibetan Plateau water availability is the more important climate factor than temperature affecting <b>cushion</b> plant traits and morphology...|$|R
5|$|The {{worship of}} Shiva became popular in Central Asia through the Hephthalite Empire, and Kushan Empire. Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found {{from the wall}} {{painting}} from Penjikent on the river Zervashan. In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread ("Yajnopavita"). He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress. A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti kneeling on her right thigh. Another site in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated cross-legged on a <b>cushioned</b> seat supported by two bulls. It is also noted that Zoroastrian wind god Vayu-Vata took on the iconographic appearance of Shiva.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was {{commonly}} {{described as}} having good handling and excellent performance, along with favourable low speed flight characteristics. During the flight tests of the first prototype, the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance, flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft. Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers. At low altitude, the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner, {{in part due to}} its narrowness and flexibility of the crescent wing. One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability; once lined up with the runway, the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink, giving a <b>cushioned</b> landing without any command or intervention by the pilot.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{began to}} test a new tie-less roadbed on Track 1, which had been {{installed}} since the previous Thursday. The experiment was intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable ride for commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, {{the rest of the}} tracks in the subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The set-up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the roadbed. Between them, flat-bottomed steel troughs were installed, <b>cushioned</b> by rubber. Inside the troughs, there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted on concrete. This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto's subway system. In order to construct the new roadbed, Track 1 had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, Track 4 was closed for the installation of the same roadbed as was tested on Track 1.|$|E

5|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} {{contains}} over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting {{the majority of the}} weight. Under the coffin bone is the navicular bone, itself <b>cushioned</b> by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located {{in the middle of the}} hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the hoof wall is the corium, tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out. The wall is connected to the coffin bone by sensitive laminae, a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the coffin bone. The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of the coffin bone. The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer, and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper coffin bone, which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{evaluate}} quantitatively {{the performance}} of <b>cushioning</b> materials, a <b>cushion</b> curve is indispensable. However, the desired <b>cushioning</b> effect may sometimes be absent when we use the <b>cushion</b> curve to design a transport package. In addition, to plot the <b>cushion</b> curve, massive dynamic compression tests are traditionally necessary. Thus, large amounts of labor and material resources are required. Therefore, we used expanded polyethylene and laminated-board <b>cushion</b> as test materials to represent typical <b>cushioning</b> materials, and proposed simplified performance evaluation methods based on certain dynamic compression tests. An analysis of the experimental results showed that to obtain a more accurate packaging design, the shearing effect {{must be taken into}} account when using the <b>cushion</b> curve; For both plastic and paper <b>cushions,</b> new proposed performance evaluation methods significantly reduce the number of dynamic compression tests needed to accurately evaluate an actual packaging design...|$|R

25|$|Saddles also {{vary with}} rider preference, from the <b>cushioned</b> ones favored by short-distance riders to {{narrower}} saddles which allow {{more room for}} leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more <b>cushioned</b> saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist {{for male and female}} cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.|$|E
