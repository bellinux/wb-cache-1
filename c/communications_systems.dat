5|$|Electricity is used within telecommunications, {{and indeed}} the {{electrical}} telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first intercontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe.

5|$|The bunker complex was self-contained. However, as the Führerbunker {{was below}} the water table, {{conditions}} were unpleasantly damp, with pumps running continuously to remove groundwater.

5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} pace of operations, deployment, and redeployment, {{coordination}} of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the operations. This was made even more problematic by the confusion generated {{by the lack of}} adequate <b>communications</b> <b>systems</b> between the rapidly advancing units. The joint nature of the operation added another level of complexity to the already overstretched communications network. Regardless, due to the ability of U.S. logisticians to innovate and improvise, supplies of food, water, ammunition, and spare parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat operations and the communications system, although complicated, functioned well enough during the short duration of U.S. operations.|$|E
5|$|Gotō's {{force was}} taken almost {{completely}} by surprise. At 23:43, Aobas lookouts sighted Scott's force, but Gotō assumed {{that they were}} Jojima's ships. Two minutes later, Aobas lookouts identified the ships as American, but Gotō remained skeptical and directed his ships to flash identification signals. As Aobas crew executed Gotō's order, the first American salvo smashed into Aobas superstructure. Aoba was quickly hit by up to 40 shells from Helena, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Farenholt, and Laffey. The shell hits heavily damaged Aobas <b>communications</b> <b>systems</b> and demolished two of her main gun turrets {{as well as her}} main gun director. Several large-caliber projectiles passed through Aobas flag bridge without exploding, but the force of their passage killed many men and mortally wounded Gotō.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 2007, Norway {{signed a}} NOK150 million joint-development {{agreement}} with Saab {{to cooperate in}} the development programme of the Gripen, including the integration of Norwegian industries {{in the development of}} future versions of the aircraft.

This order was the first awarded under the provisions of the Letter of Agreement signed by the Norwegian Ministry of Defence and Gripen International in April 2007. As a result of the United States diplomatic cables leak in 2010, it was revealed that US diplomats had become concerned with cooperation between Norway and Sweden on the topic of the Gripen, and had sought to exert pressure against a Norwegian purchase of the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The Calhoun-Talladega 800 MHz <b>communications</b> <b>system</b> was {{originally}} developed and installed to enhance interoperability {{and to provide}} alert and notification for the community during the destruction of chemical weapons at the Anniston Army Depot (ANAD). The <b>communications</b> <b>system</b> was funded and maintained through a federal grant known as the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), a joint United States Army and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) program designed to provide community education and emergency preparedness resources {{in the event of}} a chemical agent emergency. [...] The original <b>communications</b> <b>system,</b> a Legacy system with analog trunking, went on-the-air in 1998 and quickly became the primary means of two-way communications for most public safety agencies in Calhoun and Talladega Counties, replacing their standalone conventional radio repeaters. In 2006, the CSEPP <b>communications</b> <b>system</b> was upgraded to a digital Project 25 Motorola Type II SmartZone version 7.4 linear simulcast/multicast trunked 800 MHz <b>communications</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

5|$|Domestic defence is the {{responsibility}} of the all-volunteer military of Bulgaria, consisting of land forces, navy and air force. The land forces consist of two mechanised brigades and eight independent regiments and battalions; the air force operates 106 aircraft and air defence systems in six air bases, and the navy operates a variety of ships, helicopters and coastal defence measures. Following a series of reductions beginning in 1990, the number of active troops contracted from 152,000 in 1988 to about 32,000 in the 2000s, supplemented in 2010 by a reserve force of 302,500 soldiers and officers and 34,000 paramilitary servicemen. The inventory is mostly of Soviet origin, such as MiG-29 fighters, SA-10 Grumble SAMs and SS-21 Scarab short-range ballistic missiles. , the government planned to spend $1.4 billion for the deployment of new fighter jets, <b>communications</b> <b>systems</b> and cyber warfare capabilities. Total military spending for 2016 was BGN 1.3 billion (USD 560m).|$|E
5|$|The C-130Js {{have been}} updated since {{entering}} service. All {{of the aircraft}} were fitted with radar warning receivers {{by the end of}} 2012, and it is planned to equip the Hercules with Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures systems by 2016. As of 2015, the Hercules' communications capabilities were also to be updated by fitting the aircraft with satellite communications equipment and the equipment necessary to allow them to use the Link 16 data exchange network. At this time the C-130s were also to be fitted with new high-speed airdrop ramps at the rear of their cabin, and will be cleared to drop larger loads. The C-130J's operating software has also been upgraded over time, leading to improved performance. The RAAF is participating in the development of further software enhancements. During 2016 all of the C-130Js were fitted with advanced satellite <b>communications</b> <b>systems</b> that allowed the aircraft, and embarked troops, to be retasked while in flight. As part of this modification the aircraft were fitted with an additional crew station, and they carry a fourth crew member when necessary to handle complex communications tasks.|$|E
5|$|When Typhoon Sudal {{struck the}} island, {{there were about}} 8,000people living on Yap, with about 1,700houses. The typhoon {{destroyed}} 700homes, and left another 900damaged; many of the destroyed homes were wooden. Damage was heaviest in the southeastern portion of the island, including in and around Colonia, the capital city. The strong winds downed trees across the island. Over 90% of the structures on the island were damaged or destroyed, including the hospital, airport, most government facilities, and the water, power and <b>communications</b> <b>systems.</b> One of the five hotels on the island was also destroyed. About 80% of the residents lost power or water after the storm. In the southeastern portion of the island, high waves wrecked most of the coastal homes, and also severely damaged the seawall. The intrusion of salt water destroyed {{almost all of the}} food crops on the island. Following the typhoon's passage, about 1,000people were left homeless, and another 500 were forced to stay in shelters.|$|E

5|$|During 2005 the Australian Government {{decided to}} deploy Chinooks to Afghanistan {{as part of}} the Australian forces in the country. The need to prepare for this task contributed to a {{decision}} in October that year to dispatch Black Hawks rather than Chinooks to Pakistan as part of Australia's contribution to the international relief efforts which followed the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, despite the Chinooks being better suited for operations at the high altitudes affected by the disaster. In November 2005 the Government authorised a program of urgent upgrades to the CH-47Ds to improve their combat readiness ahead of being deployed to Afghanistan. The upgrades included fitting the helicopters with extra armour as well as new electronic warfare and <b>communications</b> <b>systems.</b> The helicopters' machine guns were also replaced with miniguns. A longer-term plan to upgrade the helicopters, designated Phase 5 of project AIR 9000, was also in place at this time. This was to involve two sub-phases: under Phase 5A new engines were purchased in December 2004, and were scheduled to be fitted in late 2006. It was also planned to put the helicopters through a mid-life update as part of Phase 5B, enabling them to remain in service until around 2025.|$|E
