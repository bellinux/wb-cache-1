30|$|Crimp% of warp and {{weft yarn}} for both grey and {{finished}} fabric was measured according to test method ASTM D 3883 by using Digital <b>Crimp</b> <b>Tester.</b>|$|E
30|$|As per the {{stitches}} selected; lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401, recommended thread {{types of}} poly/poly core-spun threads (with polyester continuous filament core and polyester staple wrap) were used. Yarn {{count of the}} thread was taken instead of the thread ticket number value to minimize the approximation errors occurring in ticket number calculations. Fabric thickness was measured following the test standard of BS 2544, methods for determination of thickness of textile materials (British standards institution 1987). Yarn counts of threads were measured using ASTM D 1907, standard method of test for yarn number by the skein method (ASTM International 1997). Thread consumption and average thread tension were measured using MLT Wesco tension and length meter with the accuracy up to 1 Â mm and 0.1 cN respectively. Consumption values measured using length meter were verified through stitch unraveling method. Actual thread lengths were measured using <b>crimp</b> <b>tester</b> adhering to the procedures in the test standard ASTM D 3883, standard test method for yarn crimp and yarn take-up in woven fabrics (ASTM International 2012). All the tension values were measured at the positions closer the needle as specified in the tension meter manual.|$|E
40|$|Shedding is {{the first}} primary motions of loom. It is done by raising and {{lowering}} the Heald frames. The heald frames on a loom are positioned {{side by side with}} a little distance as possible. The different positions of heald frame causes the variation in distance from cloth fell to peek of shed. In the present paper, the effect ofthis positional variation upon warp yarns, fabric properties and most importantly the whole weaving procedure have been concentrated. To find out the significance of this effect, two categories of fabric was produced using same weave (combination of plain and twill) but changing drafting plan. In the first category, the warp yarnshaving plain weave were threaded to heald frames nearest to the cloth fell and the other portion of warp yarns having twill weave were threaded farthest to the cloth fell. The drafting plan of second category was reverse the first category. All the other parameters were same in both cases. During weaving, weaving performances wasobserved and recorded in both cases. Later, crimp% of plain and twill portion of both fabrics were measured by Tautex Digital <b>Crimp</b> <b>Tester</b> and yarn strength of plain and twill portion of both samples were measured by Titan universal strength tester. It was observed that selecting heald frame position have substantial effect on crimp%,yarn strength and fabric performance. It is expected that this study will be help full to increase weaving performance and ensure better fabric quality in case of producing fancy weave...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{shape memory}} polymer {{neurovascular}} stent prototypes {{based on a}} previously proposed design were thermo-mechanically characterized to expand on the clinical efficacy of the device. The stents were made by dip-coating pins in a thermoplastic polymer solution and subsequently covalently crosslinking the polymer using UV irradiation to yield thermoset tubes. These crosslinked tubes were CO 2 laser engraved to produce the complex stent geometry. Experiments were conducted to determine the physiologically relevant mechanical behavior of these devices. Three point bend tests were performed to determine the longitudinal flexibility of deployed stents at room temperature and body temperature. The resulting longitudinal flexibility data was compared to currently available stent systems. Radial behavior tests were conducted on stent prototypes and polymer tubes using a radial compression system that interfaces with a tensile <b>tester.</b> <b>Crimping</b> and radial recovery behavior experiments measured the pressure exerted by the device {{as a function of}} strain recovery at discrete temperatures. Crimped polymer tubes, representing idealized polymer stents, were deployed in the compression station at fixed diameters. These tests represented the constrained recovery environment of an occluded vessel and quantified recovery pressures as a function of temperature. Material characterization techniques such as dynamic mechanical analysis, tensile testing, and gel fraction studies were employed to further quantify the clinical relevance of this device. These devices proved to have longitudinal flexibility values comparable to or better than many stents currently available on the market, which makes them attractive for neurovascular applications requiring navigation of tortuous vessels. Additionally, Shape memory tests demonstrated a one second device deployment, which minimizes the amount of heat introduced into the body. This study also provides a body of data useful for further optimization of this medical device, such as desirable crimping pressures, optimal crimping temperatures, and device deployment pressures...|$|R
