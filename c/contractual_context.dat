5000|$|The {{court found}} that the Afrikaans term nalatige wanvoorstelling, a {{translation}} of [...] "negligent misrepresentation," [...] does not reflect, in connection with negligent misrepresentation as a delictual ground of action, the essential problem in South African law; it created instead {{the impression of a}} representation in a <b>contractual</b> <b>context.</b> In a <b>contractual</b> <b>context,</b> [...] "misrepresentation" [...] has a somewhat legal-technical meaning. It must be, for example, a representation of an existing fact; therefore, it does not normally embrace the expression of an opinion or the giving of advice, which requirement is not necessarily applicable to a [...] "negligent misrepresentation." [...] The court suggested that perhaps the expression nalatige wanbewering ("negligent misstatement") should rather be used, but that, if [...] "negligent misrepresentation" [...] was retained, this caveat ought to be borne in mind.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It {{is quite}} rare the {{assessment}} of public service broadcasting as an asset of cultural policy. However, there is {{a reasonable amount of}} elements that could feed a debate on this issue, be it political or academic. Considering the Portuguese experience between the years of 2002 and 2012, this paper examines the role of public service broadcasting as a cultural resource, and, specifically, its relevance for cultural public policy. This is an important area for empirical research, according to the standards of economics, sociology and communication sciences. And it implies the analysis of objective conditions, restrictions and possibilities of financial, legal and <b>contractual</b> <b>contexts,</b> and the consideration of the outputs and the impact of concrete broadcasting...|$|R

40|$|Contract law {{has neither}} a {{complete}} descriptive theory, explaining {{what the law}} is, nor a complete normative theory, explaining what the law should be. These gaps are unsurprising given the traditional definition of contract as embracing all promises that the law will enforce. Even a theory of contract law that focuses only on the enforcement of bargains must still consider the entire continuum from standard form contracts between firms and consumers to commercial contracts between business firms. No descriptive theory has yet explained a law of contract that comprehends such a broad domain. Normative theories that are grounded in a single norm [...] such as autonomy or efficiency [...] also have foundered over the heterogeneity of <b>contractual</b> <b>contexts</b> to which the theory is to apply.

40|$|Many {{firms in}} the {{construction}} industry claim to be working in a ‘partnering’ or even in an ‘integrated’ way. It is, however, very difficult to verify these claims with the tools currently available. The {{purpose of this study was}} to collect and refine existing work on integrative and collaborative working, so as to develop a quick and simple tool that measures the degree of integration with which firms are working. First, the concepts of ‘Partnering’ and ‘Integrated Working’ are discussed and, for the purposes of the work a major supposition is adopted: that the difference between these concepts is that companies that are partnering only share project-related information, while companies working in an integrated way share much more of their available information, knowledge and experience. Secondly, the development of the Partnering Assessment Tool is explained and its application to four cases is recounted. The companies’ overall scores are presented and discussed as to whether these scores might reflect their actual levels of integration and cooperative working. These scores are presented on a scale that contains the categories ‘Cooperative Working’, ‘Partnering’ and ‘Integrated Working’. It is concluded that the application of the tool can provide a useful insight in the nature of the relationships between companies that work together in construction projects. Finally, it is recommended that the tool be tested in more cases and companies, and in a variety of different <b>contractual</b> <b>contexts.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The annual Business Law Symposium of the Wake Forest Law Review has a {{distinguished}} legacy of noteworthy programs that {{shed light on}} seminal issues affecting contemporary business in the United States. This edition builds on that tradition of excellence {{with a focus on}} the ubiquitous phenomenon of contracts and bargaining behavior. Contract law appears as a set of policies and rules that provide order for those who transact bargains. Indeed, contract law and the rules that it engenders seemingly facilitate an efficient system of transactional conduct that, on its face, appears objective. Part II of this introductory Article briefly examines the most popular, unitary theories of law. It questions any one theory 2 ̆ 7 s explanatory power over the breadth of contract issues and types of contracts. It supports the idea that each theory of contract can be used to explain certain contract rules, but not contract law as a whole. This Symposium buttresses this idea with the collective view that contract law can best be described and guided through a context-driven inquiry. A contextual theory of contract law recognizes the need for flexible rules for different <b>contractual</b> <b>contexts</b> and the elastic application of those rules across contexts. A contextual theory of contract law also recognizes a number of phenomena. First, contract interpretation, through the lens of context, should be used to regulate influences that question the purity of the freedom of contract upon which most agreements are based. Second, the construct of contract has been creatively applied to areas that are not immediately envisioned within the body of contract law. Part III then examines the different uses of context that illustrate the relationship between contract law and society. It notes that “contract in context,” {{for the purposes of the}} Symposium, is broadly defined. This Part provides a taxonomy of contract law in context that includes internal and external perspectives. Part III recognizes that societal context frames contract law, but also observes that contract law can frame the private ordering of society. This two-way flow of context, between the greater socioeconomic-cultural sphere and contract as context, analyzes the relationship of contract types and the contextual interpretation of contracts. It concludes by examining the relationship of context to paternalism and consent. Part IV then notes the role of power and identity in the formation and interpretation of contracts, and contract law 2 ̆ 7 s shortcomings in recognizing such influences in the search for contractual justice. Finally, Part V introduces the works presented at the Symposium...|$|R
40|$|Building Information Modelling (BIM) can {{be defined}} as a process of {{generating}} and managing information of a building or infrastructure during its life cycle. Whilst the 3 D visualisation or dimensional functions of BIM are not necessarily new, it is the usage and integration of this information related to project delivery, management and performance analysis that are challenging current construction industry practices.   Industry has called for the development of more collaborative and integrated contractual arrangements to facilitate the use of BIM. Such recommendations appeal to the ideal use of BIM, but also provide a potential opportunity to seek improvement within the construction industry.

40|$|The article {{develops}} {{an understanding}} of the disgorgement remedy in private law by moving between the proprietary context, where the remedy has long been awarded and is fairly uncontroversial, and the <b>contractual</b> <b>context,</b> where the remedy is relatively new and still poorly understood. The resulting account can explain the emerging common law on disgorgement for breach of contract, which has so far eluded explanation. The account also has broader implications for private law theory. First, it suggests that asking whether the plaintiff has a right ‘to a thing’ (the paradigmatic sort of property right) may obscure the remedial analysis. Instead, the analysis should attend to another, hitherto overlooked aspect of the plaintiff’s rights: their ‘logical scope. ’ Second, the account suggests that a purely ‘rights-based’ understanding of private law remedies cannot adequately explain disgorgement, because it elides the crucial role that the defendant’s wrongful action plays in the explanation for the remedy...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{recognition}} by the House of Lords in AG v Blake of the gain-based remedy of {{an account of}} profits in a <b>contractual</b> <b>context,</b> {{an increasing number of}} commentators have argued that the English remedial regime for breach of contract should be further reinforced by the introduction of punitive damages. This article considers whether there may be a role for punitive awards in contract law. It seeks to demonstrate that the adoption of punitive damages, without wider reform of the existing remedial regime, may lead to inconsistencies. The reason is that English contract law has generally shown reluctance to view contractual default as being reprehensible or the motive for breach as materially relevant. Legal intervention in particular defined circumstances by way of regulation may be more appropriate than punitive awards. Support for the conclusion that caution should be exercised before reform is undertaken is also drawn from recent developments in France, where the introduction of punitive damages has been proposed as part of a project to reform the Civil Code...|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the success}} of Curse of Frankenstein, the {{financing}} of Dracula proved awkward.

Although an agreement was drawn up, it is alleged that the deal was never realised and funding for Dracula eventually came from the National Film Finance Council (£33,000) and the rest from Universal in return for worldwide distribution rights. However, recent research suggests that the issue of who exactly funded Dracula is still not entirely clear (see Barnett, ‘Hammering out a Deal: The <b>Contractual</b> and Commercial <b>Contexts</b> of The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and Dracula (1958)’, Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, published online 19 November 2013).|$|R
40|$|Quite {{apart from}} the {{question}} of the justifiability – based on prior normative commitments – of legal rules controlling the substance of contractual exchange, such as a fair price rule, a common complaint against such rules is based on the difficulties of implementing and enforcing them. Rather than proceeding from first principles, it is also possible to examine the consequences of ex ante and ex post controls on the fairness of <b>contractual</b> exchange in <b>contexts</b> where they have been imposed before testing such consequences against any normative commitments. Such an approach allows both to examine whether practical constraints on enforcing rules over the fairness of exchange are truly binding and, even if they are, whether such rules can have other either beneficial or negative effects on parties and on contract law more broadly. We present a case study of credit markets in a rural community in early modern France marked by the relative absence of the State as a regulatory agent.

40|$|Classic {{analyses}} of sovereign debt make no predictions concerning {{the allocation of}} risk between {{the market and the}} official sector or among official sector creditors. To open the black box of the composition of a sovereign's foreign liabilities, this paper develops a new framework and distinguishes between "ex-post solidarity", aimed at avoiding collateral damages inflicted by a distressed country's default, and "contractual solidarity", illustrated by joint-and-several liability or lines of credit, that creates formal modes of insurance. When countries differ substantially in their probability of distress, the optimal mechanism {{takes the form of a}} debt brake together with mixed public-private financing for the weaker country; no joint liability emerges. By contrast, in a more symmetrical, mutual-insurance <b>context,</b> <b>contractual</b> solidarity in the form of joint liability is optimal provided that country shocks are sufficiently independent and spillovers costs sufficiently large relative to default costs. Joint liability increases both borrowing capability and the risk of contagion. Spillovers, when endogenized, are larger under mutual insurance than under one-way insurance. Finally, the paper considers the possibility of debt monetization, comparing the outcomes under a currency union and an own currency. It studies whether a currency area is more conducive to bailouts and whether bailouts are optimally denominated in domestic or foreign currency...|$|R

40|$|A {{common law}} {{obligation}} of good faith in contractual performance and enforcement is arising {{in the form}} of an implied contractual term, with judicial suggestion (both at Supreme Court and Federal Court level) that the implication should be an incident of all commercial contracts. This article examines the potential implications of this broad approach to good faith by the use of two case studies involving contractual opportunism (and a consequent consideration of motive). The case studies raise a number of questions. Assuming good faith is an implied incident of a certain class of contract, is the class of ‘commercial contracts’ an appropriate good faith filter or does the filter need refinement? Are commercial contracts sufficiently homogenous that a good faith obligation should be implied, as a matter of law, in all contracts falling within this class? Is a cooperative contractual model (such as good faith) appropriate in all commercial contract transactions or is there still scope for the operation of the traditional adversarial contractual model? The article proffers a solution whereby the commercial <b>contractual</b> <b>context</b> may be relevant, rather than according all commercial contracts the same contractual treatment regardless of context...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of a {{legislative}} framework for petroleum development is to provide the basic context for, and the rules governing, petroleum operations in the host country; to regulate them, as they are carried out by domestic foreign, and international enterprises; and to define the principal administrative, economic and fiscal guidelines for investment activity in the sector. Experience shows that the cornerstone of effective petroleum legislative frameworks for exploration and production operations is a broad, generic, short but thorough petroleum law (not overdetailed), complemented by enabling regulations and one or several variants of a model contract. Such frameworks give both the host country and international oil company investors a clear legal and <b>contractual</b> <b>context</b> in which to negotiate mutually advantageous exploration and production arrangements that develop the host state's petroleum resources.

While the 2004 university reform for general medicine was being put in place, this study sought to assess the contents of this teaching so as to recommend what changes should be made to bring it more into line with students’ expectations. Methods: This optional module in the third year of general medicine at university, part of a vocational training initiative, was taken by a total of 173 students, who filled in a compulsory, anonymous assessment of the teaching content {{at the end of each}} session. Results: The assessment of this teaching revealed that the students prefer themes that are perceived as being immediately useful upon setting up, to themes that are more closely linked with medical or regulatory knowledge. Workshop-style teaching was considered mostsuited to educational needs. Conclusion: This teaching offered tools to help students grasp the <b>contractual</b> and regulatory <b>context</b> of setting up practice as clearly as possible. The experience of these three years of training should enable its contents to be adapted and enriched for the next classesof house physicians. In view of the problem of medical demography, this now compulsory medico-social training is also an opportunity to raise the awareness of future doctors about choosing environments and disciplines that are facing shortages.

40|$|Customer loyalty has {{received}} enormous attention from both academics and practitioners alike. There is growing evidence that keeping existing customers {{costs less than}} attracting new ones. Furthermore, loyal customers are expected to pay more, spend more and act as advocates for a particular service organisation. However, despite the universal agreement {{on the benefits of}} customer loyalty, no consensus has been yet reached on how or why this phenomena occurs. This lack of clarity in conceptualising and in turn operationalising, the concept has lead to an incomplete understanding of the phenomena and an inability to answer the question why satisfied customers switch. Therefore, research is needed to shed more light upon service loyalty development. This study will assist service managers and marketeers in focusing on effective marketing strategies for building and sustaining service loyalty to maximise the return on their investment. Particularly in this time of recession, service managers need to take greater care with regards to decision making and expenditure. To achieve the aim of this study, an embedded three-sequential mixed method research design was adopted. First, in-depth interviews were used to understand UK service loyalty in the retail service industry and to justify the inclusion or exclusion of loyalty variables. Second, two factorial experiments were conducted to test the cause and effect of the links between cognitive and affective loyalty and between affective and conative loyalty. Then the moderating effect of switching costs on these two links was examined. Third, two surveys were distributed to a random sample of retail customers to test the full conceptual model and to assess the generalisability of the results across high versus low-employee contact, customisation and personalisation service types. Multigroup analysis was also used to test the moderating effect of customer (e. g. age, gender and education) and market characteristics (e. g. switching costs) on the links between the loyalty stages. The main findings of the study are: first, service loyalty develops in a sequential manner; cognitive loyalty → trust → affective loyalty → commitment → conative loyalty → action loyalty. Second, trust partially mediates the links between cognitive and affective loyalty. Third, unexpectedly, a significant mediating effect of calculative commitment on the link between affective and conative loyalty is found only when the moderating effect of education is examined. Fourth, the links between loyalty stages are equally strong between high and low service customers as well as between younger and older customers. Fifth, education, gender and switching costs have a significant moderating effect on the early, but not the later stages of loyalty. This study offers a rare test of the Theory of Planned Behaviour within a non- <b>contractual</b> customer-service <b>context.</b> It augments existing research on validating Oliver’s (1997) loyalty model by proposing a mediating effect of trust and commitment and a moderating effect of service type, switching costs, gender, age and education. The main conclusions of this study are: first, building and sustaining service loyalty is a complex strategic management objective. Second, understanding the key factors that drive service loyalty and the conditions that either enhance or hinder its development is essential for a complete understanding of the phenomena. Therefore, the overarching managerial implication {{of this study is to}} provide service managers with a segmentation tool and a framework to build attitudinal loyalty and to reach behavioural loyalty goals. Guided by the results of this study, services managers will be better informed in selecting the most effective marketing strategy to a particular group of customers and in identifying and moving customers with varying degree(s) of loyalty along the loyalty ladder. Fruitful areas for future research would include examining the conceptual model across different service, culture and industry contexts. Moreover, although this study strives to capture the dynamic nature of the construct, future research that uses longitudinal design would be needed to test the relationships in the full conceptual model over time. Finally, collecting objective data or data from different sources would also be useful to control for the possible effect of common method variance on coefficient estimates in survey research...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of megaprojects fail {{to achieve their}} objectives. Studies suggest up to two thirds {{of them do not}} meet time, cost or performance targets; a much higher proportion than for conventional projects. Failures are attributed to various causes: stakeholder biases, lack of investment in front-end planning and optimistic estimates and/or schedules amongst other factors. Further it is evident that increasingly owners require larger, more complex projects within compressed timescales. However even if experience shows the objectives are unrealistic there is almost invariably a contractor that is willing to provide a competitive tender for the work. Despite recent improvements to management capability, enhancements to procurement and contracting practices, risk assessment, project planning and control, there has been little noticeable improvement in the outcomes of most megaprojects. This paper, based on both authors’ academic and industrial experience of megaprojects, focuses on another factor, the contract, and provides an alternative view of the <b>contractual</b> <b>context</b> in which megaprojects are be delivered and how this affects the current practice of scaling up contracts and procedures in an attempt to offer megaprojects similar levels of certainty to traditional projects.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{different}} categories of building project procurement routes based on organisational, contractual, financial and technical issues. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on review of literature and conditions of contracts. The UK construction industry serves as a general frame of reference. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors survey of Contracts in Use from 1985 to 2004 is used to probe the share and value of contracts along different procurement routes and across different conditions of contracts in the UK. The logic is that the value and the share of contracts will indicate the behaviour of different procurement routes in the UK construction market while the in-depth analysis of conditions of contracts will show the gaps and relationships between the general definition/categorisation and <b>contractual</b> <b>context</b> (conditions of contracts) of each of the procurement routes. Findings – The preliminary result of the analysis shows that traditional routes remain the main type of procurement route for the construction project industry sector, within which different management and incentivisation systems are applied for greater efficiency. The conditions of contracts in the UK support this assertion by aligning different procurement routes to different conditions of contracts and additionally specifying different forms of agreements, special provisions and incentivisation in order to increase performance, reduce risks and improve compensation methods. Research limitations/implications – The study can serve as a learning opportunity for construction project stakeholders internationally, and clients in particular, to differentiate between procurement routes, management-oriented systems, relational contracting and incentivisation. Originality/value – The research provides an original assessment of construction procurement which can be used as intervening tool in different levels of private and public procurement strategies...|$|E
40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} {{in our understanding of}} contracting behavior, economic contract theory has yet to identify the principal causes and effects of contract breach. In this Article, I argue that opportunism is a primary explanation for why commercial parties deliberately breach their contracts. I develop a novel variation on opportunism that I identify as “shading,” a behavior that more accurately describes the vexing problems courts face in rooting out strategic behavior in contract litigation. I provide some empirical support for the claim that shading behavior is both pervasive in litigation over contract breach and extremely difficult for generalist courts to detect, and I offer an explanation for why this is so. In contrast to courts of equity in pre-industrial England, generalist courts today are tasked with the challenge of interpreting contracts in a heterogeneous global economy. This has left generalist courts incapable of identifying with any degree of accuracy which of the litigants is behaving strategically. I advance the claim that ex ante design by commercial parties is more effective in deterring opportunism in litigation than ex post evaluation of the <b>contractual</b> <b>context</b> by generalist courts. I illustrate this claim by focusing on the critical roles of uncertainty and scale in determining how legally sophisticated parties, both individually and collectively, design their contracts. By deploying sophisticated design strategies tailored to particular environments, parties are able both {{to reduce the risk of}} shading and to cabin the role of the decision maker tasked with policing this difficult-to-verify behavior. I conclude that judges and contract theorists must attend to the unique characteristics of the contracts currently being designed by sophisticated parties because it is the parties, not the courts, that reduce the risks of opportunistic shading in contract adjudication...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} of productivity, predictability and quality {{in design and}} delivery of the building product are well documented. Prefabrication, process reengineering and digitalization are proposed as potential solutions to address these issues. One issue that is rarely addressed, however, is {{the management of the}} changes required to move from existing to a new paradigm of practices. Organization of work in construction, as opposed to other industries, has barely evolved in the last centuries. The research project studies the impact of the introduction of a new high-rise building construction system and BIM related technologies on the organization of work within a multi- residential project. The aim is to develop a concept of operation on how to reorganize work process within and between practices and trades. Ethnographic methods were used to identify issues regarding the management of information, the organization of work and the perceptions regarding BIM associated technologies and tools such as electronic tablets. Benchmarking and lean production tools such as value stream mapping were also utilized to identify {{problems of}} productivity and waste. Waste related to poor management of workflows and information flow was a major issue and had a strong impact on productivity. <b>Contractual</b> <b>context</b> in which there are no incentives for professionals and trades to improve their overall performance (no share responsibilities and fragmented obligations) was identified as the principal obstacle to changes in existing practices. Traditional project management practices proved to be inefficient to compensate the lack of coordination and collaboration between the project stakeholders. However, even if the use of BIM proved to be impractical in this context, tablets were well received as a way to improve collaboration and coordination of the work. A concept of operation was derived from the lessons learned that will be validated in the next pilot project. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{governance}} and transparency in firms constitute the major concerns in today’s business. Contracts are fundamental aspects of corporations {{and in order}} to be efficient they should be designed and monitored using high quality information and well-functioning corporate governance. This thesis covers the role of accounting in the <b>contractual</b> <b>context</b> and the effects of monitoring mechanisms in firms in enhancing the quality of financial reports. The need for accounting information in contractual relationships comes from the limitations of relevant information for monitoring managerial behavior, which is fundamental for efficiency of contracts. In this respect, this study concerns two important issues: first, the role that accounting plays in increasing the effectiveness of contracts for resolving agency problems in firms; and second, the effect of a firm’s governance mechanisms as well as a country’s legal environment for ensuring high quality financial reports. Regarding the first issue, the essays examine the use of accounting performance in CEO compensation contracts. The general conclusion is that compensation contracts are used as an alternative monitoring mechanism in firms with greater agency problems. The evidence for the use of accounting performance-based compensation in family firms with dual-class shares indicates that, due to the excess voting rights by controlling shareholders in these firms, agency problems arise and CEOs receive higher performance-based compensation. Furthermore, findings show that with an improved transparency due to the changes in accounting standards, the link between accounting performance and CEO compensation becomes stronger. With respect to the second research issue, the essays examine the role that governance mechanisms play in enhancing the quality of financial reports and the contracting role of accounting in designing an efficient compensation contract. The results indicate that governance regulations and the mandatory compensation disclosures enhance the efficiency of compensation contracts and the pay-performance relation. Furthermore, the monitoring performance {{of the board of directors}} and specifically the role of employee representatives is found to be important in improving the earnings quality of firms. Overall, the results from the essays conclude that financial accounting information plays an important role in CEO compensation, as reflected in the pay-performance relation. However, for playing this role, both the firm’s governance mechanisms and the country’s legal environment must be effective...|$|E
