50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} uses of the conical pendulum was in the flyball governor (centrifugal governor) invented by James Watt in 1788 which regulated the speed of steam engines during the Steam Age in the 1800s. The playground game tetherball uses a ball attached to a pole by a cord which functions as a conical pendulum, although the pendulum gets shorter as the <b>cord</b> <b>wraps</b> around the pole. Some amusement park rides act as conical pendulums.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} ways to create the ends of a stack. In some areas, a crib end is created by {{alternating}} pairs of logs to help stabilize the end. A stake or pole placed in the ground is another way to end the pile. A series of stacked logs at the end, each with a cord tied to it and the free end of the <b>cord</b> <b>wrapped</b> to log {{in the middle of the}} pile, is another way.|$|R

50|$|Jars {{are broken}} down into two main categories, those whose rims flare out from the {{constriction}} point, {{and those that are}} more globular in shape. Much of the decoration is found on the rims of the vessels, and they are either surface treated with <b>cord</b> <b>wrapped</b> roulette or mat impressions which are then offset by grooved lines and motifs. Various tempering agents were used as well, with some vessels even having evidence of metal slag being used as a temper.|$|R
50|$|Walker {{was sent}} to death row in San Quentin to await {{execution}} of his sentence. While at San Quentin, he was diagnosed by a prison psychiatrist as having paranoid schizophrenia.

He was successfully revived, and the execution was postponed indefinitely while a psychiatric examination was performed.|$|R
50|$|In 1832, the Neptune Mill was {{constructed}} beside a dam just North of the Salmon River Cove. The Card Company, {{as it was}} then known also made stocking yarn and carpet warp. New <b>cord</b> <b>wrapping</b> machines filled these mills and twine was produced on a massive scale. Over the years, the Neptune Mill expanded until it reached its 100x100 ft dimensions. Three stories tall, it was a massive edifice, architecturally resembling a church with its steeple and bell that would call workers into the factory each morning.|$|R

A former athlete and youth coach, his father had difficulty accepting Kevin’s disability. The will to carry on for his family and make his father proud drove Kevin to follow his own path of success by playing extraordinary basketball.|$|R
50|$|In case {{of birth}} complications, the {{traditional}} birth assistant {{would give the}} woman some holy water or press on her belly. There were no specific foods mentioned to eat during labor. To promote an easy delivery, all windows and doors must be open and the woman must be facing east to symbolize {{the emergence of new}} life. The husband should also pile logs outside facing east. Any fastened nails must be undone, and no one should be nailing nails to avoid stalled birth. To be born with an umbilical (holy) <b>cord</b> <b>wrapped</b> abound neck was considered a sign of fortune.|$|R

50|$|The ropes may {{be wrapped}} tightly around waist and tied off in front, fed {{down across the}} genitals, then pulled back up behind and tied to other <b>cords</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the wrists, {{doubling}} as a cinch to tighten them further. This allows the rope bound person some ability to vary pressure on the genitals (often causing sexual stimulation) {{at the cost of}} reduced freedom of movement. If such a cord is pulled extremely tight the wrists and arms will have very little freedom of movement and the hands will be firmly forced in contact with the butt, particularly when combined with Elbow Bondage.|$|R
50|$|A nuchal cord {{occurs when}} the {{umbilical}} <b>cord</b> becomes <b>wrapped</b> around the fetal neck 360 degrees. Nuchal cords are common, with prevalence rates of 6% to 37%. Up to half of nuchal cords resolve before delivery.|$|R

Arkell had been mentioned in the Wood Royal Commission's report; he had been embroiled in child pornography and paedophilia scandals in the years leading up to his death, and he had been acquitted of child sex offences six months before his murder, but investigations were continuing, with further charges to be laid.|$|R
50|$|Little written {{evidence}} exists {{to explain why}} its external form is the shape that it is. The glass bulbs used, however, have changed in style and design over time. While the main designs have always been ampoule in shape, the bulbs were not always connected. The first hourglasses were two separate bulbs with a <b>cord</b> <b>wrapped</b> at their union that was then coated in wax to hold the piece together and let sand flow in between. It was not until 1760 that both bulbs were blown together to keep moisture out of the bulbs and regulate the pressure within the bulb that varied the flow.|$|R

40|$|Precise {{positioning}} {{and movement}} of heavy loads {{are two basic}} jobs for all-mechanical power amplifier. A capstan is simply a cylinder with a flexible body such as a string or cable wrapped around it. Capstans are generally used {{to assist in the}} lifting or pulling of heavy objects. By controlling the input tension on the cord, a capstan can dynamically amplify the input. It is hypothesized that a single capstan with multiple <b>cords</b> <b>wrapped</b> about it can act as numerous mechanical amplifiers. Present invention offers a new type of power amplifier which is structurally much simpler than previous amplifier.
