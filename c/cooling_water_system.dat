When the second engineer closed the clutch at the normal coupling speed of 400 rpm, the engine stalled. After restarting he attempted coupling the engine again at 1,000 rpm, but it still would not run faster than 270 rpm when connected to the shaft. When the captain received a report that the starboard main engine was no longer usable he decided to abandon the ship and ordered the evacuation of the remaining crew at 22:16.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} the effective and efficient use of ozone in <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment <b>systems.</b> The study focuses on proving that ozone treated systems will: (1) Improve compressor energy consumption; (2) Improve the heat exchangers efficiency through limited scale deposition and fouling; (3) Reduce water consumption; and (4) Encourage or support corrosion at high concentrations compared to when <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> is chemically treated. For this study, data log readings from compressor heat exchanger approach temperatures were used for energy saving calculations and equipment efficiency (scaling). Using conservation of energy principles and municipal power costs, {{it was found that}} over four years, R 425 991 was saved. Conventional chemical <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment <b>systems</b> showed high approach temperatures, resulting in high scaling rates and high energy consumption in the compressors. In contrast, ozone <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment <b>systems</b> showed a lower approach temperatures which resulted in lower scaling rates and lower energy consumption in the compressors. Also, for this study data log readings from <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> flow rates and weekly water quality analyses were used for water saving calculation and corrosion predictions. In ozone <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment <b>systems,</b> there was a reduction in makeup water use confirming water savings. According to Mosugelo (2010) water quality is a bigger contributor to corrosion than ozone is. In <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment <b>systems</b> with good quality makeup <b>water,</b> ozone treated <b>systems</b> were found to have lower corrosion rates in the heat exchangers than conventional chemicals systems. It can be concluded that effective and efficient use of ozone in <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment provides triple bottom line benefits (economic, social and environmental). Environmental benefits include effluent disposal reduction, water and energy conservation. Social benefits include safety and health impacts. Ozone treated <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> are a technically practical, cost-effective and sensible alternative when compared to conventional <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. <b>Cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> are generally designed {{with a set of}} heat exchangers arranged in parallel. This arrangement results in higher <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> flowrate and low <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> return temperature thus reducing cooling tower efficiency. Previous research on <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> has focused mainly on heat exchanger network thus excluding the interaction between heat exchanger network and the cooling towers. This paper presents a technique for synthesis and optimization of <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> which incorporates the performances of the cooling towers involved. The study focuses mainly on cooling systems consisting of multiple cooling towers that supply a common set of heat exchangers. The heat exchanger network is synthesized using the mathematical optimization technique. This technique is based on superstructure in which all opportunities for <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> reuse are explored. The cooling tower model is used to predict the thermal performance of the cooling towers. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed technique. The first case results in nonlinear programming (NLP) formulation and the second case yields mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. In both cases the cooling towers operating capacity is debottlenecked without compromising the heat duties of the associated heat exchangers [1]. mp 201...|$|R

50|$|The 500 MW {{single shaft}} {{machines}} manufactured by English Electric, are arranged lengthwise along the turbine hall, which is 259.08 m (850 ft) long by 39.624 m (130 ft) wide by 26.060 m (85.5 ft) high. The overall length of each machine is 49.53 m (162.5 ft). The generators are rated at 500 MW, 22 kV at 0.85 power factor. Steam {{conditions at the}} H.P. turbine stop valve are 2,300 psig (158.6 bar). at 566 °C with a single reheat stage to the I.P. cylinder of 565 psia (38.96 bar) at 566 °C. The turbine has a design steam consumption of 6.3932 lb/kWh, including reheating, feed heating, and boiler feed pump drive and an overall heat input of 7,543 Btu/kWh. A novel mounting arrangement was adopted for the turbo-generators. The L.P. cylinders are supported on two steel beams about 22.098 m (72.5 ft) long, which bridge between the concrete blocks at the H.P. steam and generator ends of the sets. The fabricated condenser structure was welded directly to {{the underside of the}} L.P. frame using a pre-heated welding technique. This provides a compact arrangement of the condenser and the main set and is {{a major factor in the}} reduction of size related to the output of the machines, which is a striking feature of the turbine hall. The L.P. frame is supported at its corners, each of the supports taking about 203.2 tonnes (200 tons) in weight. The overall weight of the frame and condenser structure is some 2,235 tonnes (2,200 tons) of which 1,422 tonnes (1,400 tons) is supported on the bottom of the condenser by the mounting springs. The condensers were fabricated on site by English Electric from sub assemblies and welded to the bridge beams supporting the L.P. cylinder. There are over 40,000 9.144 m (30 ft) long, 25.4 mm (1 in) diameter aluminium/brass tubes in each condenser, giving an effective surface area of 27,870 m² (300,000 sq ft) the equivalent of 3.9 football pitches. Operation is at 1.3 inHg with 1,023 m³/min (225,000 gal of cooling water at 15.5 °C. Steam is passed to the condenser at over 963.9 t/h (2,125,000 lb/h). Since contamination of the condensate by the cooling water must be avoided, a double tube plate construction has been adopted in which the condenser tubes are expanded into an extra tubeplate in addition to the one forming the side of the water box. The narrow space between the plates is filled with demineralised water, supplied from a header tank from 48.768 m (160 ft). This provides a pressure considerably higher than the 20 psig developed in the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>system,</b> so that any leaks on the tube end plates will be supplied from the header tank.|$|E
