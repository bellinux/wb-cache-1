5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly known as rock and roll, a reasonably discrete style of music, had evolved into a <b>catchall</b> category called simply rock music, an umbrella term which would eventually include diverse styles like heavy metal music, punk rock and, sometimes even hip hop music. During the 1970s, however, most of these styles {{were not part of}} mainstream music, and were evolving in the underground music scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{due process}} clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply {{generally}} to {{all stages of}} criminal proceedings. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was the vehicle for the incorporation {{of all of the}} foregoing rights (with the exception of the Grand Jury Clause, the Vicinage Clause, and maybe the Excessive Bail Clause) to apply in state criminal proceedings. Due process is also the <b>catchall</b> vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness, even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another enumerated provision.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly a discrete genre known as rock and roll evolved into a <b>catchall</b> category called simply rock music, which came to include diverse styles like heavy metal and punk rock. During the 1970s most of these styles were evolving in the underground music scene, while mainstream audiences began the decade {{with a wave of}} singer-songwriters who drew on the deeply emotional and personal lyrics of 1960s folk rock. The same period saw the rise of bombastic arena rock bands, bluesy Southern rock groups and mellow soft rock stars. Beginning in the later 1970s, the rock singer and songwriter Bruce Springsteen became a major star, with anthemic songs and dense, inscrutable lyrics that celebrated the poor and working class.|$|E
25|$|Lipids {{comprises}} {{a diverse}} range of molecules {{and to some extent}} is a <b>catchall</b> for relatively water-insoluble or nonpolar compounds of biological origin, including waxes, fatty acids, fatty-acid derived phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids, and terpenoids (e.g., retinoids and steroids). Some lipids are linear aliphatic molecules, while others have ring structures. Some are aromatic, while others are not. Some are flexible, while others are rigid.|$|E
25|$|With so many {{possible}} symptoms, hysteria was often considered a <b>catchall</b> diagnosis where any unidentifiable ailment could be assigned. As diagnostic techniques improved, {{the number of}} ambiguous cases {{that might have been}} attributed to hysteria declined. For instance, before the introduction of electroencephalography, epilepsy was frequently confused with hysteria. Many cases that had previously been labeled hysteria were reclassified by Sigmund Freud as anxiety neuroses. As a result, theories relating to hysteria came from pure speculation. Doctors and physicians could not connect symptoms to the disorder, causing it to decline rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Southern Māori oral {{tradition}} tells of five successively arriving peoples {{and while the}} earliest, Kahui Tipua, appear to be fairy folk modern anthropological opinion is that nevertheless they represent historical people who have become encrusted with legend. Te Rapuwai were next {{and seemed to be}} succeeded by two Waitaha tribes but it has been suggested this was really one with 'Waitaha' also being used as a <b>catchall</b> name for all earlier peoples by some later arrivals. 'Te Rapuwai' may perhaps also have been used like this. Nevertheless, some middens, such as those on the peninsula, have been identified traditionally with Te Rapuwai. Anderson's later, or tribal Waitaha, arrived in the south in the 15th century.|$|E
500|$|The 1950s American {{television}} programme I Love Lucy broadcast multiple instances of real-life {{husband and wife}} Desi Arnaz, a Hispanic male, and Lucille Ball, a woman of North European ancestry, kissing. However, despite Arnaz and Ball being frequently described as an [...] "interracial couple", [...] "Hispanic" [...] is generally understood to be a <b>catchall</b> indicating persons of a Latin American, Iberian, or Filipino cultural background, {{as opposed to a}} race. Arnaz was usually considered to be a white male of Cuban ancestry.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} this fungus have brown to {{yellow-brown}} caps that fade in color when drying. The gills are brownish {{and give a}} rusty spore print. A well-defined membranous ring is typically seen on the stems of young specimens but often disappears with age. In older fruit bodies, the caps are flatter and the gills and stems browner. The species is a classic [...] "little brown mushroom"—a <b>catchall</b> category that includes all small to medium-sized, hard-to-identify brownish mushrooms, and may be easily confused with several edible species.|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "alternative" [...] {{had been}} used as a <b>catchall</b> term for rock bands outside the mainstream, Spin Alternative Record Guide covers {{approximately}} 500 artists from a variety of genres considered relevant to alternative music's development. These include 1970s punk rock, 1980s college rock, 1990s indie rock, noise music, reggae, electronic, new wave, heavy metal, krautrock, synthpop, disco, alternative country, hip hop, grunge, worldbeat, and avant-garde jazz. Most artists associated with classic rock are not covered, while some mainstream pop artists are given entries, including Madonna and ABBA. Other non-rock artists reviewed in the book include jazz composer Sun Ra, country singer-songwriter Lyle Lovett, and Qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Weisbard and Marks have said the book was meant to be [...] "suggestive", rather than [...] "comprehensive", of alternative music.|$|E
500|$|The International Phonetic Alphabet is {{occasionally}} {{modified by}} the Association. [...] After each modification, the Association provides an updated simplified {{presentation of the}} alphabet {{in the form of}} a chart. (See History of the IPA.) [...] Not all aspects of the alphabet can be accommodated in a chart of the size published by the IPA. [...] The alveolo-palatal and epiglottal consonants, for example, are not included in the consonant chart for reasons of space rather than of theory (two additional columns would be required, one between the retroflex and palatal columns and the other between the pharyngeal and glottal columns), and the lateral flap would require an additional row for that single consonant, so they are listed instead under the <b>catchall</b> block of [...] "other symbols". [...] The indefinitely large number of tone letters would make a full accounting impractical even on a larger page, and only a few examples are shown.|$|E
500|$|A cult film is any {{film that}} has a cult following, {{although}} the term is not easily defined and {{can be applied to}} a wide variety of films. The definition is occasionally expanded to exclude films that have been released by major studios or have big budgets, try specifically to become cult films, or become accepted by mainstream audiences and critics. Cult films are defined by audience reaction as much as by their content. This may take the form of elaborate and ritualized audience participation, film festivals, or cosplay. Over time, the definition has become more vague and inclusive as it drifts away from earlier, stricter views. [...] Increasing use of the term by mainstream publications has resulted in controversy, as cinephiles argue that the term has become meaningless or [...] "elastic, a <b>catchall</b> for anything slightly maverick or strange". [...] Academic Mark Shiel has criticized the term itself as being a weak concept, reliant on subjectivity; different groups can interpret films in their own terms. [...] According to feminist scholar Joanne Hollows, this subjectivity causes films with large female cult followings to be perceived as too mainstream and not transgressive enough to qualify as a cult film. Academic Mike Chopra‑Gant says that cult films become decontextualized when studied as a group, and Shiel criticizes this recontextualization as cultural commodification.|$|E
500|$|Idolator reviewers {{were divided}} in their {{opinion of the}} song. Christina Lee deemed it [...] "a {{surprisingly}} thrilling, high-stakes moment" [...] on the album, while Carl Williot felt Ora's hook overshadowed Azalea's verses on the song. Exclaim! journalist Erin Lowers wrote, [...] "'Black Widow' should pass the threshold between mediocrity and superstardom, but falls by the wayside with little personality." [...] Drowned in Sound's Giuseppe Zevolli negatively reviewed the song, writing, [...] "'Black Widow' is so preoccupied with its overfilled, <b>catchall</b> crescendo that it oozes away before you even notice". Kellan Miller of XXL felt that the song intended to be [...] "a hit-to-oliberate-all-other-hits-forever-and-ever-amen", but ultimately was [...] "a fourth quarter Hail Mary pass at best." [...] In his review, Miller added, [...] "Instead of remaining steadfast to the shimmer that made the early offerings bright spots, Iggy veers off course in an all too contrived effort to meet the quota of her colossal ambition." [...] Gigwise's Alexandra Pollard criticized the track's similarities with [...] "Dark Horse" [...] and dismissed Perry for repeating her [...] "tried-and-tested-formula". StarGate's involvement was panned by Alfred Soto of Spin, who said the song's hook was borrowed from the duo's previous production for Barbadian recording artist Rihanna's [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] (2007). Additionally, Soto dismissed the track's synth line as being [...] "nicked" [...] from StarGate's production on American singer-songwriter Ne-Yo's Libra Scale (2010). The song was named the eighth worst song of 2014 by Time magazine.|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} change, insisted on by Rutledge, {{was meant to}} sharply curtail the {{essentially}} unlimited powers to legislate [...] "in all cases for the general interests of the Union" [...] that the Convention only two weeks earlier had agreed to grant the Congress. Rutledge and Randolph worried that the broad powers implied in the language agreed on by the Convention {{would have given the}} national government too much power {{at the expense of the}} states. In Randolph's outline the committee replaced that language with a list of 18 specific [...] "enumerated" [...] powers, many adopted from the Articles of Confederation, that would strictly limit the Congress' authority to measures such as imposing taxes, making treaties, going to war, and establishing post offices. Rutledge, however, was not able to completely convince all of the members of the committee to accept the change. Over the course of a series of drafts, a <b>catchall</b> provision (the [...] "Necessary and Proper Clause") was eventually added, most likely by Wilson, a nationalist little concerned with the sovereignty of individual states, giving the Congress the broad power [...] "to make all Laws that shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof." [...] Another revision of Wilson's draft also placed eight specific limits on the states, such as barring them from independently entering into treaties and from printing their own money, providing a certain degree of balance to the limits on the national government intended by Rutledge's list of enumerated powers. In addition, Wilson's draft modified the language of the Supremacy Clause adopted by the Convention, to ensure that national law would take precedence over inconsistent state laws.|$|E

2500|$|James first {{argued that}} no attempt crime at all could qualify as posing a serious {{potential}} risk of injury. [...] Because the first prong {{of the definition}} included the word [...] "attempt", if Congress had meant for the catch-all provision in the second prong to include attempts it would have said so expressly. [...] But the Court {{pointed out that the}} second prong had a <b>catchall</b> prong, whereas the first did not, and thus it was necessary to determine which crimes fit inside that <b>catchall</b> group. [...] An expansive phrasing could not be specific and limited.|$|E
2500|$|Aperture {{efficiency}} [...] eA [...] is a <b>catchall</b> variable {{which accounts}} for various losses that reduce the gain of the antenna from the maximum that could be achieved with the given aperture. [...] The major factors reducing the aperture efficiency in parabolic antennas are:.|$|E
2500|$|Wired {{described}} Singapore as a [...] "living {{laboratory for}} Intelligent Transport Systems, a <b>catchall</b> phrase for high-tech strategies to gather data, manage flow, and inform drivers of congestion ahead", noting that traffic [...] "does indeed move noticeably smoother {{here than in}} American metropolitan areas of comparable size—Atlanta, for instance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Ommaya’s work, CSF {{rhinorrhea}} {{was classified}} as either traumatic or spontaneous. The second category was essentially a <b>catchall</b> category which did not assist in guiding treatment approaches. Ommaya classified non-traumatic rhinorrhea as resulting from either high pressure leaks (tumors and hydrocephalus) or [...] "normal" [...] leaks (congenital abnormalities, focal atrophy, oysteomyelitis). Non-traumatic rhinorrhea is a challenge in diagnosis and choice of surgical approach. Of importance to successful surgical outcome is the demonstration of fistula. Within the non-traumatic category, CSF rhinorrhea occurring with primary empty sella (PES) was first reported by Ommaya.|$|E
2500|$|... "Acid rock" [...] is loosely defined. Rock {{journalist}} Nik Cohn {{called it}} a [...] "fairly meaningless phrase that got applied to any group, no matter what its style". It was originally {{used to describe the}} background music for acid trips in underground parties in the 1960s (e.g. the Merry Pranksters' [...] "Acid Tests") and as a <b>catchall</b> term for the more eclectic Haight-Ashbury bands in San Francisco. The Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia believed that acid rock is music you listen to while under the influence of acid, further stating that there is no real [...] "psychedelic rock" [...] and that it is Indian classical music and some Tibetan music [...] "designed to expand consciousness".|$|E
2500|$|These {{practices}} were increasingly more controversial after 1971. [...] The 1971 Citizenship Decree by President Mobutu Sese Seko granted citizenship to Banyarwanda {{who had arrived}} as refugees from 1959 to 1963. [...] However, many saw this as an alarming sign of the growing influence of Banyarwanda in the administration, specifically Chief of Staff Barthélémy Bisengimana. In 1976, the word [...] "Banyamulenge" [...] first came into wide usage after Gisaro Muhazo, a South Kivutian minister of parliament, began an initiative to regroup the Banyamulenge of Mwenga, Fizi and Uvira into a single administrative entity. [...] Muhazo's attempt failed, but the term he introduced remained and, over decades, became a <b>catchall</b> label for Kivutian Tutsis.|$|E
2500|$|... "Twinkie defense" [...] is a derisive {{label for}} an {{improbable}} legal defense. It {{is not a}} recognized legal defense in jurisprudence, but a <b>catchall</b> term coined by reporters during their coverage of the trial of defendant Dan White for the murders of San Francisco city Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone. White's defense was that he suffered diminished capacity {{as a result of}} his depression. His change in diet from healthful food to Twinkies and other sugary foods was said to be a symptom of depression. Contrary to common belief, White's attorneys did not argue that the Twinkies were the cause of White's actions, but that their consumption was symptomatic of his underlying depression. White was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.|$|E
2500|$|The dime {{novel is}} a form of late 19th-century and early 20th-century U.S. popular fiction issued in series of {{inexpensive}} paperbound editions. The term dime novel {{has been used as a}} <b>catchall</b> term for several different but related forms, referring to dime novels, story papers, five- and ten-cent weeklies, [...] "thick book" [...] reprints, and sometimes early pulp magazines. The term was used as a title as late as 1940, in the short-lived pulp magazine Western Dime Novels. Dime novels are the antecedent of today's mass-market paperbacks, comic books, television shows and movies based on dime-novel genres. In the modern age, the term dime novel has been used to refer to quickly written, lurid potboilers, usually as a pejorative to describe a sensationalized but superficial literary work.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{organizations}} in the United States use the term as a broad <b>catchall</b> to refer to persons with a historical and cultural relationship with Spain, regardless of race and ethnicity. The U.S. Census Bureau defines the ethnonym Hispanic or Latino to refer to [...] "a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race" [...] and states that Hispanics or Latinos can be of any race, any ancestry, any ethnicity. Generically, this limits the definition of Hispanic or Latino to people from the Caribbean, Central and South America, or other Hispanic (Spanish or Portuguese) culture or origin, regardless of race. Latino can refer to males or females, while Latina refers to only females.|$|E
2500|$|James {{also argued}} that, by the {{statutory}} canon of ejusdem generis, the <b>catchall</b> phrase {{should be read}} to include only completed crimes because the other crimes listed were completed crimes. [...] This was not so, the Court reasoned, because the category of crimes involving explosives {{was not limited to}} completed crimes. [...] "In any event, the most relevant common attribute of the enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives is not 'completion'. [...] Rather, it is that all of these offenses, while not technically crimes against the person, nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury". [...] The broad residual provision was meant to sweep up other crimes that, like burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives offenses, posed a serious risk of physical injury to others.|$|E
2500|$|Writer and {{producer}} Robert Palmer defined rhythm & blues as [...] "a <b>catchall</b> term referring to any music {{that was made}} by and for black Americans". He has used the term [...] "R" [...] as a synonym for jump blues. However, AllMusic separates it from jump blues because of its stronger, gospel-esque backbeat. Lawrence Cohn, author of Nothing but the Blues, writes that [...] "rhythm and blues" [...] was an umbrella term invented for industry convenience. According to him, the term embraced all black music except classical music and religious music, unless a gospel song sold enough {{to break into the}} charts. [...] Well into the 21st century, the term R continues in use (in some contexts) to categorize music made by black musicians, as distinct from styles of music made by other musicians.|$|E
2500|$|Death's Head is {{a fictional}} {{character}} appearing in British comics and American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character {{is depicted as}} a robotic bounty hunter (or rather, as he calls himself, a [...] "freelance peace-keeping agent"). The character was created by writer Simon Furman and artist Geoff Senior for the company's Marvel UK imprint. Furman decided to use Death's Head in his Transformers stories, but believed that characters appearing in Transformers [...] "were prone to be absorbed into that title's <b>catchall</b> copyright" [...] (allowing Hasbro to contest their ownership) {{and led to a}} one-page strip titled [...] "High Noon Tex" [...] (which was subsequently published in various Marvel UK titles) being hastily created to establish Marvel's ownership of the character. [...] Furman has stated that he chose the name Death's Head for the character while unaware of the [...] "Nazi-connotations of the name".|$|E
2500|$|Peddlers {{pass through}} the {{barriers}} and enter the city. Mimì appears, coughing violently. She tries to find Marcello, who is currently living in a little tavern where he paints signs for the innkeeper. She tells him of her hard life with Rodolfo, who abandoned her the night before, and of Rodolfo's terrible jealousy (O buon Marcello, aiuto!—"Oh, good Marcello, help me!"). Marcello tells her that Rodolfo is asleep inside, and expresses concern about Mimì's cough. Rodolfo wakes up and comes out looking for Marcello. Mimì hides and overhears Rodolfo first telling Marcello that he left Mimì because of her coquettishness, but finally confessing that his jealousy is a sham: he fears she is slowly being consumed by a deadly illness (most likely tuberculosis, known by the <b>catchall</b> name [...] "consumption" [...] in the nineteenth century). Rodolfo, in his poverty, can do little to help Mimì and hopes that his pretended unkindness will inspire her to seek another, wealthier suitor (Marcello, finalmente—"Marcello, finally").|$|E
2500|$|Saves the Day toured with Green Day, Blink-182 and Weezer, {{playing in}} large arenas such as Madison Square Garden. By {{the end of}} the year they had {{performed}} on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, appeared on the cover of Alternative Press and had music videos for [...] "At Your Funeral" [...] and [...] "Freakish" [...] in rotation on MTV2. Taking Back Sunday released their debut album, Tell All Your Friends, on Victory Records in 2002. The album gave the band a taste of success in the emo scene with singles such as [...] "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)" [...] and [...] "You're So Last Summer". Initially charting at number 183 on the Billboard 200, Tell All Your Friends was eventually certified gold by the RIAA and is considered one of emo's most-influential albums. Articles on Vagrant Records appeared in Time and Newsweek, and the word [...] "emo" [...] became a <b>catchall</b> term for non-mainstream pop music. Andy Greenwald attributes emo's explosion into the mainstream to a media search for the [...] "next big thing" [...] in the wake of the September 11 attacks: ...|$|E
