Many of these units have been restructured, however, {{as part of the}} 2007 Force Plan.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, the {{division}} was reorganized. As {{part of an}} army wide initiative known as the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan, {{the division}}'s regiments were disbanded and replaced with larger and more versatile brigades. The 1st Brigade, 104th Division, activated at Vancouver Barracks, and the 2nd Brigade, 104th Division activated at Pasco, Washington. Meanwhile, the 3rd Brigade, 104th Division, {{as well as the}} 4th Brigade, 104th Division both activated at Fort Lawton, Washington. Each of these brigades carried the history of other historic units which fought under the 104th Infantry Division in World War II. The 104th Division was then assigned the mission of conducting One Station Unit Training, Basic Combat Training, Advanced Individual Training, and <b>Combat</b> <b>Support</b> training. 1st Brigade took on basic combat training, while 3rd Brigade undertook <b>combat</b> <b>support</b> training, 4th Brigade conducted combat service support training.|$|E
5|$|The CASG is not {{responsible}} for directly supplying deployed ADF units; this {{is the responsibility of}} the Joint Logistics Command and the single service logistic units. These units include the Navy's Strategic Command and replenishment ships, the Army's 17th Combat Service Support Brigade and Combat Service Support Battalions, and the <b>Combat</b> <b>Support</b> Group RAAF.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF has {{a single}} {{operational}} command, Air Command.

5|$|The {{beginning}} of 1970 saw {{the initiation of}} the 18th Engineers Brigade's Operation Last Chance, a program of command emphasis and organization for motivation and success of that year's engineer operations. The goals of the program were to maintain primary missions of the <b>combat</b> <b>support</b> as well as insure {{the completion of the}} many projects planned for the 1970 construction operations.|$|E
5|$|With {{the events}} of 11 September 2001, I Corps began {{providing}} support for Army units deploying {{in support of the}} War on Terrorism. Its assets were active in providing <b>combat</b> <b>support</b> and combat service support missions, including Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and the domestic Operation Noble Eagle.|$|E
5|$|As U.S. troop {{withdrawals}} continued, conscription {{was reduced}} and in 1973 ended; {{the armed forces}} became all-volunteer. After years of fighting, the Paris Peace Accords were signed {{at the beginning of}} 1973. The agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining American troops without requiring the 160,000 North Vietnam Army regulars located in the South to withdraw. Once American <b>combat</b> <b>support</b> ended, there was a brief truce, before fighting broke out again. North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975.|$|E

5000|$|Within the Australian Army, <b>combat</b> service <b>support</b> is {{provided}} to combat elements at various levels: first line (organic to battalion or regimental level), second line (at brigade level), and third line (at formation or higher). Thus, for example an infantry unit {{such as the}} 5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment will include a logistics company which fills supply, transportation and maintenance functions, while a combat brigade, such as the 7th Brigade, will be <b>supported</b> by a <b>combat</b> service <b>support</b> battalion such as the 7th <b>Combat</b> Service <b>Support</b> Battalion. At formation level, a CSS brigade [...] - [...] the 17th <b>Combat</b> Service <b>Support</b> Brigade [...] - [...] will provide health, signals, catering, transport, policing and other service support requirements.|$|R

A new building was constructed on Fort Stewart, Georgia for the Brigade and was occupied in August 1997. The First United States Army, the Brigade's higher headquarters, also purchased new furniture and computers for the Brigade's use. In 1999, the brigade was again reflagged as the 4th Brigade, 87th Division.|$|E
5|$|The DDL project's {{problems}} harmed the Australian shipbuilding industry. The {{cancellation of}} both the DDLs and another project to develop an Australian fast <b>combat</b> <b>support</b> ship design led to a perception that technical risks needed to be minimised when selecting new warships, and it was preferable to rely on proven foreign designs. Australian industry was also left with a bad impression as companies {{involved in the project}} had devoted considerable resources to preparing tenders for the DDL.|$|E

5|$|The RNLAF Apaches' first {{deployment}} was in 2001 to Djibouti, Africa. They {{were also}} deployed alongside U.S. AH-64s {{in support of}} NATO peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2004, six Dutch AH-64s were deployed {{as part of the}} Netherlands contribution to Multinational force in Iraq to support the Dutch ground forces. The Apaches performed close <b>combat</b> <b>support</b> and display of force missions, along with providing reconnaissance information to ground forces. In February 2006, the Netherlands contribution to NATO forces in Afghanistan was increased from 600 to 1,400 troops and 6 AH-64s were sent in support.|$|E
5|$|No. 20 Squadron was {{reactivated}} on 1 April 2015 {{to support}} airfield operations at RAAF Base Woomera, South Australia. Consisting of nine uniformed personnel and one Australian Public Service member {{under the command}} of Squadron Leader Simon Bartlett, the squadron formed part of No. 96 Wing, a component of <b>Combat</b> <b>Support</b> Group (CSG). The airfield had previously been managed under the auspices of Aerospace Operational Support Group, but a command-and-control review commissioned by the Chief of Air Force recommended that, in common with other RAAF airfields, it should be administered by CSG. RAAF Base Woomera, incorporating Woomera Village, was one of two Air Force units formally established on 12 January 2015 as part of a reorganisation of the Woomera Range Complex, the other unit being RAAF Woomera Test Range.|$|E

5|$|On 1 April 1958 the 95th Infantry Division was redesignated as the 95th Division (Training) {{and a major}} {{reorganization}} of mission assignments was underway. Personnel trained for infantry combat, field artillery, military police and <b>combat</b> <b>support</b> roles were now to undergo re-training {{to enable them to}} train others. The division had a new role as one of the 13 Training Divisions in the Army Reserve. The same year the division's size increased as the 291st Regiment was reassigned again from the 75th and was redesignated as 291st Regiment (Advanced Individual Training). With the {{reorganization of}} the division all of the regiments were redesignated. The 95th Divisional Artillery became the 95th Regiment (Common Specialist Training) with headquarters at Shreveport, Louisiana. The 377th became the 377th Regiment (Basic Combat Training), as did the 378th and 379th, and all were reassigned new training sites. In 1966, the division received a distinctive unit insignia.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 1965, {{following}} on {{from the}} cancellation of the BAC TSR-2 supersonic bomber, the British and French governments announced the signing {{of a pair of}} agreements to cover the two joint projects; one based on the Breguet Aviation Br.121 ECAT ("Tactical <b>Combat</b> <b>Support</b> Trainer") proposal; this would later evolve, after the cancellation of the AFVG, to become the SEPECAT Jaguar. The other was the AFVG, a larger, variable geometry carrier-capable fighter aircraft for the French Navy (Aéronavale) as well as fulfilling interceptor, tactical strike and reconnaissance roles for the RAF. The AFVG was to be jointly developed by BAC and Dassault Aviation, the proposed M45G turbofan engine to power the aircraft was to also be jointly developed by SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{consists}} of seven primary elements. The brigade's Headquarters and Headquarters Company, {{along with its}} Special Troops Battalion, provides support and oversight to the other six battalions in the brigade. The 1st Battalion, 306th Regiment trains primarily infantry units, while the 2nd Battalion, 306th Regiment trains field artillery units. The 1st Battalion, 347th Regiment provides training for <b>combat</b> <b>support</b> units, while the 3rd Battalion, 345th Regiment oversees combat service support units. The 2nd Battalion, 349th Regiment provides support training for the other battalions and large-scale training operations. The 3rd Battalion, 395th Regiment (recently realigned from First Army Division West) trains primarily armor/cavalry units.|$|E
