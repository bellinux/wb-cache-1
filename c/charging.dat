5|$|USB Battery <b>Charging</b> {{defines a}} new port type, the <b>charging</b> port, {{as opposed to}} the {{standard}} downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. <b>Charging</b> ports are divided into 2 further types: the <b>charging</b> downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated <b>charging</b> port (DCP), which does not. Dedicated <b>charging</b> ports can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard and <b>charging</b> USB ports, the <b>charging</b> ports should be labeled as such.|$|E
5|$|MagSafe, a {{magnetic}} <b>charging</b> connector, {{has been replaced}} with USB-C <b>charging.</b> Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the user’s field of view to indicate the device's <b>charging</b> status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a chime when connected to power. The Macintosh startup chime {{that has been used}} since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.|$|E
5|$|Sleep-and-charge USB ports {{can be used}} {{to charge}} {{electronic}} devices even when the computer is switched off. Normally, when a computer is powered off the USB ports are powered down, preventing phones and other devices from <b>charging.</b> Sleep-and-charge USB ports remain powered even when the computer is off. On laptops, <b>charging</b> devices from the USB port when it is not being powered from AC drains the laptop battery faster; most laptops have a facility to stop <b>charging</b> if their own battery charge level gets too low. This feature has also been implemented on some laptop docking stations allowing device <b>charging</b> even when no laptop is present.|$|E

The <b>charge</b> storage in the soliton-bearing systems is explored in detail, including <b>charge</b> magnitude, <b>charge</b> separation, <b>charge</b> alternation, and chain length effects. The grouping of the <b>charge</b> distributions at a given level of theory, {{as well as the}} sensitivity of a given <b>charge</b> distribution to the inclusion of electron correlation in its computation, are investigated using similarity analysis. Several of the <b>charge</b> definitions have been applied for the first time for <b>charged</b> soliton-bearing systems, and there are substantial differences between the <b>charge</b> distributions for the <b>charged</b> and neutral systems.

50|$|<b>Charge</b> number (z) {{refers to}} a {{quantized}} value of electric <b>charge,</b> with the quantum of electric <b>charge</b> being the elementary <b>charge,</b> so that the <b>charge</b> number equals the electric <b>charge</b> (q) in coulombs divided by the elementary-charge constant (e), or z = q/e. The <b>charge</b> numbers for ions (and also subatomic particles) are written in superscript, e.g. Na+ is a sodium ion with <b>charge</b> number positive one (an electric <b>charge</b> of one elementary <b>charge).</b> Atomic numbers (Z) are a special case of <b>charge</b> numbers, referring to the <b>charge</b> number of an atomic nucleus, {{as opposed to the}} net <b>charge</b> of an atom or ion. All particles of ordinary matter have integer-value <b>charge</b> numbers, with the exception of quarks, which cannot exist in isolation under ordinary circumstances (the strong force keeps them bound into hadrons of integer <b>charge</b> numbers).|$|R
5|$|Some devices, when {{plugged into}} <b>charging</b> ports, draw even more power (10watts at 2.1amperes) than the Battery <b>Charging</b> Specification allows — The iPad {{is one such}} device. Barnes & Noble NOOK Color devices also require a special charger that runs at 1.9amperes.|$|E
5|$|The {{intent is}} to permit uniformly <b>charging</b> laptops, tablets, USB-powered disks and {{similarly}} higher-power consumer electronics, as {{a natural extension of}} existing European and Chinese mobile telephone <b>charging</b> standards.

The standard is designed to coexist with the previous USB Battery <b>Charging</b> specification.|$|E
5|$|These bus power {{currents}} being {{much higher}} than cables were designed for, though not unsafe, cause a larger voltage between {{the ends of the}} ground signal, significantly reducing noise margins causing problems with High Speed signaling. Battery <b>Charging</b> Specification 1.1 specifies that <b>charging</b> devices must dynamically limit bus power current draw during High Speed signaling; 1.2 simply specifies that <b>charging</b> devices and ports must be designed to tolerate the higher ground voltage difference in High Speed signaling.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} image <b>charges,</b> interfacial <b>charge</b> discreteness, and surface roughness on spherical electric double layers in electrolyte solutions with divalent counter-ions {{in the setting of}} the primitive model. By using Monte Carlo simulations and the image <b>charge</b> method, the zeta potential profile and the integrated <b>charge</b> distribution function are computed for varying surface <b>charge</b> strengths and salt concentrations. Systematic comparisons were carried out between three distinct models for interfacial charges: 1) SURF 1 with uniform surface <b>charges,</b> 2) SURF 2 with discrete point <b>charges</b> on the interface, and 3) SURF 3 with discrete interfacial <b>charges</b> and finite excluded volume. By comparing the integrated <b>charge</b> distribution function (ICDF) and potential profile, we argue that the potential at the distance of one ion diameter from the macroion surface is a suitable location to define the zeta potential. In SURF 2 model, we find that image <b>charge</b> effects strongly enhance <b>charge</b> inversion for monovalent interfacial <b>charges,</b> and strongly suppress <b>charge</b> inversion for multivalent interfacial <b>charges.</b> For SURF 3, the image <b>charge</b> effect becomes much smaller. Finally, with image <b>charges</b> in action, we find that excluded volumes (in SURF 3) suppress <b>charge</b> inversion for monovalent interfacial <b>charges</b> and enhance <b>charge</b> inversion for multivalent interfacial <b>charges.</b> Overall, our results demonstrate that all these aspects, i. e., image <b>charges,</b> interfacial <b>charge</b> discreteness, their excluding volumes have significant impacts on the zeta potential, and thus the structure of electric double layers.

5000|$|Conductive metal objects contain mobile {{electric}} <b>charges</b> (electrons) {{that can}} move about freely in the metal. [...] In an uncharged state, {{each part of}} the metal contains equal quantities of positive and negative <b>charges,</b> intimately mixed, so no part of it has a net <b>charge.</b> If an external <b>charged</b> object is brought near a piece of metal, the force of the <b>charge</b> causes these internal <b>charges</b> to separate. [...] The <b>charges</b> of opposite polarity to the external <b>charge</b> are attracted to it, and move {{to the surface of the}} object facing the <b>charge.</b> The <b>charges</b> of the same polarity are repelled and move to the surface of the metal away from the <b>charge.</b> This is called electrostatic induction. In Procedure 2 above, as the <b>charge</b> C is lowered into the container, the <b>charges</b> in the metal of the container separate. If C has a positive <b>charge,</b> the negative <b>charges</b> in the metal are attracted to it and move to the inner surface of the container, while the positive <b>charges</b> are repelled and move to the outside surface. If C has a negative <b>charge,</b> the <b>charges</b> have opposite polarity. Since the container was originally uncharged, the two regions have equal and opposite <b>charges.</b> The induction process is reversible: in Procedure 4, when C is removed, the attraction of the opposite <b>charges</b> cause them to intermingle again, and the <b>charge</b> on the surfaces reduces to zero.|$|R
5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which {{is required to}} have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the <b>charging</b> port, which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The <b>charging</b> port does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for <b>charging</b> port detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power {{as if there were}} a <b>charging</b> port present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory port from the <b>charging</b> port transparently.|$|E

40|$|An {{event-driven}} X-ray CCD imager device uses a floating-gate amplifier {{or other}} non-destructive readout device to non-destructively sense a <b>charge</b> {{level in a}} <b>charge</b> packet associated with a pixel. The output of the floating-gate amplifier is used to identify each pixel that has a <b>charge</b> level above a predetermined threshold. If the <b>charge</b> level is above a predetermined threshold the <b>charge</b> in the triggering <b>charge</b> packet and in the <b>charge</b> packets from neighboring pixels need to be measured accurately. A <b>charge</b> delay register {{is included in the}} event-driven X-ray CCD imager device to enable recovery of the <b>charge</b> packets from neighboring pixels for accurate measurement. When a <b>charge</b> packet reaches the end of the <b>charge</b> delay register, control logic either dumps the <b>charge</b> packet, or steers the <b>charge</b> packet to a <b>charge</b> FIFO to preserve it if the <b>charge</b> packet is determined to be a packet that needs accurate measurement.

Thin-walled, seamless {{304 stainless steel}} cylinders were subjected to blast loads from partially confined bare cylindrical PE 4 <b>charges</b> with different diameter and aspect ratios(charges length to <b>charge</b> diameter). The diameters of interest were: 25 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 3). 30 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 1. 6). 35 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 1. 1). 40 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 0. 9). The effect of aspect ratio, for the constant diameter or constant mass cases, on the structural response of the cylinders (that is, diametric deflection, axial impulse, and axial shortening) is reported. Cylindrical <b>charges</b> with an aspect ratio of 1, were compared to spherical <b>charges</b> of equivalent mass. For <b>charges</b> with constant diameter with varying length: The diametric deflection increased with increasing aspect ratio. The axial shortening increased with increasing aspect ratio.

For <b>charges</b> with constant mass with varying diameter and length: The long <b>charges</b> (that is, <b>charges</b> with aspect ratios greater than 1) caused larger diametric deflections than their mass equivalent short (that is, <b>charges</b> with aspect ratios less than 1) <b>charges.</b> This is because the long <b>charges</b> had more side effective <b>charge</b> mass (that is, {{the mass of the}} <b>charge</b> that contributes directly to the diametric deflection of a cylinder) than the shorter <b>charges.</b> The short <b>charges</b> transferred more axial impulse to the ballistic pendulum, because they had more axial effective <b>charge</b> mass (that is, the mass of the <b>charge</b> that contributes directly to the axial impulse that is transferred to a ballistic pendulum) than their mass equivalent long <b>charges.</b> It was observed that a lighter <b>charge</b> can diametrically deflect a cylinder more effectively than a heavier <b>charge,</b> if its side effective <b>charge</b> mass is greater than that of the heavier <b>charge.</b> The structural responses of the cylinders obtained from cylindrical <b>charge</b> detonations were greater than those obtained from the mass equivalent spherical <b>charge</b> detonations.
