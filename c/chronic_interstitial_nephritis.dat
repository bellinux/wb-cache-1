40|$|Abstract. A 13 -year-old, spayed, female Australian Cattle Dog had {{at least}} a 10 -year history of {{numerous}} subcutaneous nodules for which fine-needle aspiration and cytologic evaluation were nondiagnostic. Abdominal ultrasound 3. 5 months before necropsy detected a small left kidney but no cysts or neoplasms. At gross necropsy, innumerable, firm, round to oval, white, 0. 25 to 2 cm masses were detected throughout the subcutaneous tissues of the axial and appendicular skeleton, epimysium of numerous muscles, and parietal peritoneum of the lateral abdominal body wall. The left kidney was approximately {{half the size of}} the right, and there was severe bilateral renal medullary (papillary) necrosis. Histologically, the subcutaneous nodules were well-demarcated masses of mature, hypocellular collagen that were consistent with previous reports of nodular dermatofibrosis and renal cystadenomas or cystadenocarcinomas.

40|$|Background Balkan endemic {{nephropathy}} (BEN) {{represents a}} <b>chronic</b> progressive <b>interstitial</b> <b>nephritis</b> in striking correlation with uroepithelial tumours {{of the upper}} urinary tract. The disease has endemic distribution in the Danube river regions in several Balkan countries. DNA methylation is a primary epigenetic modification that is involved in major processes such as cancer, genomic imprinting, gene silencing, etc. The significance of CpG island methylation status in normal development, cell differentiation and gene expression is widely recognized, although still stays poorly understood. Methods We performed whole genome DNA methylation array analysis on DNA pool samples from peripheral blood from 159 affected individuals and 170 healthy individuals. This technique allowed us to determine the methylation status of 27 627 CpG islands throughout the whole genome in healthy controls and BEN patients. Thus we obtained the methylation profile of BEN patients from Bulgarian and Serbian endemic regions. Results Using specifically developed software we compared the methylation profiles of BEN patients and corresponding controls and revealed the differently methylated regions. We then compared the DMRs between all patient-control pairs to determine common changes in the epigenetic profiles. SEC 61 G, IL 17 RA, HDAC 11 proved to be differently methylated throughout all patient-control pairs. The CpG islands of all 3 genes were hypomethylated compared to controls. This suggests that dysregulation of these genes involved in immunological response could be a common mechanism in BEN pathogenesis in both endemic regions and in both genders. Conclusion Our data propose a new hypothesis that immunologic dysregulation has a place in BEN etiopathogenesis. Keywords: Epigenetics; Whole genome array analysis; Balkan endemic nephropath...|$|R

40|$|From about 1950, {{doctors in}} Switzerland were {{becoming}} {{aware that the}} pattern of renal disease was changing. In 1953, Spühler and Zollinger described 44 cases of <b>chronic</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>nephritis</b> [1]. Papillary necrosis was observed in 22 cases, and {{it was noted that}} many of the patients had taken antibiotics and/or an analgesic containing phenacetin. Subsequently, it became clear that a pathologic entity of <b>chronic</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>nephritis</b> with papillary necrosis was associated with long-standing abuse of analgesics [2, 3]. Spühler and Zollinger's necropsy cases had bilateral contracted kidneys with surfaces presenting extensive areas of atrophy with some intervening nodular areas. Although the papillary necrosis was thought to be ischemic in origin. Gloor [4], as early as 1960, pointed to some special features of this lesion and suggested that papillary changes preceded the <b>chronic</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>nephritis.</b> Reported from Switzerland were many cases, commonly linked with the consumption of a mixture of phenacetin, caffeine, isopropyl-antipyrine, and pyrithildion. It then became apparent that this form of kidney disease, which was associated with the phenacetin in the mixtures taken, was common in Scandinavia [5], where a popular mixture contained phenacetin, caffeine, and phenazone (antipyrine) [6], In 1957, Schourup made a clear distinction between the classical acute type of papillary necrosis, seen with diabetes or obstruction and infection, and the new chronic and insidious form associated with analgesic abuse [7]. With the exception of Gloor, European pathologists tended to believe that the papillary necrosis resulted from compression of vasa recta in the outer medulla, as an expression of a cortical and outer medullary inflammatory process. It was recognized, however, that urinary tract infection, though common, was often a late development or might not occur at all [8]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Legionellosis is a {{systemic}} disease that primarily affects the lungs. However, dysfunction in many organ systems, including the kidneys, {{has also been}} described. There {{are only a few}} reported cases of renal dysfunction in patients with legionellosis. Case presentation A 27 -year-old Caucasian woman with known adult Still's disease was admitted to our hospital for community-acquired pneumonia, due to Legionella infection, with acute renal failure. Although her respiratory symptoms responded well to antibiotic treatment, her renal function worsened, with severe proteinuria and edema. A renal biopsy showed extracapillary and endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis with accompanying <b>chronic</b> and acute <b>interstitial</b> <b>nephritis.</b> This was consistent with a post-infection immunocomplex glomerulonephritis. After initiation of steroid therapy, her renal function improved. Additionally, therapy with diuretics and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was initiated because of persistent proteinuria. Under this treatment regimen, her severe edema and proteinuria disappeared. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, there is only a handful of reported cases of post-infection glomerulonephritis with a nephrotic syndrome in a patient with legionellosis. Our findings suggest that, in patients with Legionnaires' disease with renal failure, post-infection immunocomplex glomerulonephritis should be considered and steroid therapy may be an effective modality to treat the renal complication. </p...|$|R
