40|$|An {{experimental}} {{model for}} acquired and <b>congenital</b> ocular <b>toxoplasmosis</b> {{as well as}} a model to induce experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) was investigated in Calomys callosus. Toxoplasma gondii, ME- 49 strain, was used to infect males and pregnant- and not pregnant-females while S-antigen, a major glycoprotein of the retinal photoreceptor cell, was used to induce EAU. The ocular lesions elicited by T. gondii were characterized by the presence of cysts, free tachyzoites and inflammatory cells in the retina or related tissues. In the congenital form, 40 % of the fetus presented ocular lesions, i. e., presence of cysts in the retina, vitreous, and extra-retinal tissues. In the acquired form, 75 % of the females and 50 % of the males presented unilateral ocular cysts both at 21 and 47 days post-infection. It was also demonstrated that S-antigen was not uveitogenic in the C. callosus model. No lesion was observed in the animals exclusively immunized with this retinal component, even when jacalin was used as additional adjuvant for polyclonal response to the retinal antigen.

40|$|Despite large {{advances}} {{in the field of}} ocular toxoplasmosis, large gaps still exist in our knowledge concerning the epidemiology and pathophysiology of this potentially blinding infectious disease. Although ocular toxoplasmosis is considered to have a high health burden, still little is known about its exact prevalence and how it affects the quality of life. The epidemiology of toxoplasmosis depends on local habits throughout the globe, and changes are likely in view of increased meat consumption in developing countries and demands for higher animal welfare in the Western world. Water is increasingly seen as an important risk factor and more studies are needed to quantitate and control the role of water exposure (drinking, swimming). Tools are now becoming available to study both the human host as well as parasite genetic factors in the development of ocular toxoplasmosis. Further research on the role of Toxoplasma strains as well as basic studies on parasite virulence is needed to explain why Toxoplasma associated eye disease is so severe in some countries, such as Brazil. Although genetic analysis of the parasite represents the gold standard, further developments in serotyping using peptide arrays may offer practical solutions to study the role of parasite strains in the pathogenesis of Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis. More research is needed concerning the pathways whereby the parasite can infect the retina. Once in the retina further tissue damage may be due to parasite virulence factors or could be caused by an aberrant host immune response. Local intraocular immune responses are nowadays used for diagnostic procedures. Future developments may include the use of Raman technology or the direct visualization of a Toxoplasma cyst by optical coherence tomography (OCT). With the availability of ocular fluid specimens obtained for diagnostic purposes and the development of advanced proteomic techniques, a biomarker fingerprint that is unique for an eye with toxoplasmosis may become available.

40|$|A {{national}} study {{was performed to}} assess the seroprevalence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgG in pregnant women {{at the time of}} delivery. The study was organized between 1990 and 1991 in 23 out of 26 Swiss cantons. 9059 women, corresponding to 11. 8 % of the annual total of births in those cantons, were included. The global seroprevalence of specific IgG was 46. 1 % (95 % confidence interval: 45. 0 - 47. 1 %). There {{was no significant difference in}} seroprevalence between different cantons after adjustment according to age. At the national level, the seroprevalence was 46. 0 % for Swiss women and 45. 8 % for women of other nationality (information on nationality was available only for 8382 persons). The use of a model of linear regression according to age showed that the risk of seroconversion among seronegative women during their 9 months of pregnancy was 1. 21 %. In addition, a certain number of data were calculated from that value to "simulate" a theoretical situation with absence of specific serological screening during pregnancy at a national level and consequently, absence of appropriate treatment. It was estimated that 548 cases of seroconversion would occur annually during pregnancy. This would lead to 183 <b>congenital</b> transmissions of <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> among which, 75 % would be asymptomatic at birth.

There is an urgent need for safe and effective therapies to encounter <b>congenital</b> and persisting <b>toxoplasmosis.</b> The hypothesis was: Combination Diclazuril plus Atovaquone to exert a novel therapeutic synergy to prevent toxoplasmosis syndromes. Methods. Pregnant dams were treated with Diclazuril and Atovaquone monotherapy or combination therapy and infected intraperitoneally with Toxoplasma tachyzoites (600). Results. Infected dams developed severe toxoplasmosis associated syndrome with increases in the abdominal adiposity surrounding uteri, gansterointestinal and other internal organs and excessive weight gain. Numerous organisms along with infiltration of inflammatory cells were detected scattered into adipose tissues. Combination therapy (p< 0. 01) {{and to a lesser extent}} Diclazuril (p< 0. 05) protected dams from inflammatory fat and excess weight gains. This was consistent with pancreatitis development in infected dams (versus normal p< 0. 05) with infiltration of inflammatory cells, degeneration and necrosis of pancreatic cells followed by the degeneration and loss of islets. Combination and monotherapy protected dams from these inflammatory and pathological aspects of pancreatitis. Infected dams exhibited severe colitis, and colonic tissues significantly shortened in length. Brush border epithelial cells were replaced with infiltration of lymphocytes, granulocytes, and microabscess formations into cryptic microstructures. Combination therapy synergistically preserved colonic structure and normalized pathological damages (p< 0. 001) and to a lesser degree Diclazuril monotherapy protected dams from colitis (p< 0. 05) and gastrointestinal toxoplasmosis.
