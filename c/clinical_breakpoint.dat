40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the susceptibility of 40 L. monocytogenes strains isolated from seafood and processing environments to 19 antibiotics currently used in veterinary and human therapy. Susceptibility tests were performed by the automated system VITEK 2. Apart from Penicillin, Ampicillin and Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, for which <b>clinical</b> <b>breakpoint</b> for Listeria susceptibility testing are defined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI), in the present study the CLSI criteria for staphylococci were applied. This study shows that isolated L. monocytogenes strains are susceptible to the antibiotics commonly used in veterinary and human listeriosis treatment. Very few strains (7, 5 %) showed a resistance behaviour towards Oxacillin, whereas a variable pattern was showed for Ciprofloxacin and Moxifloxacin. Moreover, an increase in tetracycline resistance, reported by several authors, can not be confirmed in this study, probably due to the different sources of strains isolation. At last, the VITEK 2 system represents a rapid and easy-to-use means for antimicrobial susceptibility test of Listeria monocytogenes. In conclusion, because of the increase of antimicrobial resistance showed by L. monocytogenes, a continuous surveillance of emerging antimicrobial resistance among this pathogen is important to ensure effective treatment of human listeriosis. These data can be used for improve background data on antibiotic resistance of strains isolated from food and food environment, even considering the lack of <b>clinical</b> <b>breakpoint</b> provided by the CLSI...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} wild-type MIC distributions of first-line drugs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as to explore the usefulness of such distributions when setting <b>clinical</b> <b>breakpoints.</b> Methods: We determined the MICs of rifampicin, isonlazid and ethambutol for M. tuberculosis using a Middlebrook 7 H 10 dilution method for 90 consecutive clinical isolates, 8 resistant strains and 16 isolates from the WHO proficiency test panel. M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv was used for quality control and susceptibility results using 7 H 10 were compared with the results obtained with BACTEC 460. Results: The agreement with BACTEC 460 was very high for isonlazid (99. 1 %) and rifampicin (99. 1 %) but lower for ethambutol (94. 7 %). Intra- and inter-assay variation was below one MIC dilution. The MIC distributions for isoniazid and rifampicin provided a clear separation between susceptible and resistant strains. Regarding ethambutol, the current breakpoint for 7 H 10 (5 mg/L) is close to the wild-type and all strains (n= 6) showing a disagreement between BACTEC 460 and 7 H 10 were distributed very close to the breakpoint (MIC 4 - 8 mg/L). This problematic relation was confirmed by investigating isolates from the WHO panel with an agreement < 95 % (64 %- 88 % among 26 laboratories, n= 4) for which the MICs were 4 - 8 mg/L.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a validation study of the Check-MDR CT 103 microarray (Check-Points, Wageningen, The Netherlands) in 2013, an OXA- 48 -like carbapenemase gen was identified in two isolates that were previously obtained from a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2007. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and subsequent BLAST Ringe Image Generator (BRIG) analysis were performed to establish the presence of OXA- 48 carbapenemase encoding plasmids and their similarity. RESULTS: This case report describes the first documented OXA- 48 -producing Klebsiella pneumonia (ST 648) and Escherichia coli (ST 866) in the Netherlands.

40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{detection of}} OXA- 48 -carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is difficult, as minimum inhibition concentrations for carbapenems are often below the <b>clinical</b> <b>breakpoint.</b> In 2011, the Dutch national guideline {{for the detection}} of highly resistant micro-organisms was issued, which includes recommendations on the use of carbapenem screening breakpoints {{for the detection of}} carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. During a validation study of the Check-MDR CT 103 microarray (Check-Points, Wageningen, The Netherlands) in 2013, an OXA- 48 -like carbapenemase gen was identified in two isolates that were previously obtained from a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2007. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and subsequent BLAST Ringe Image Generator (BRIG) analysis were performed to establish the presence of OXA- 48 carbapenemase encoding plasmids and their similarity. This case report describes the first documented OXA- 48 -producing Klebsiella pneumonia (ST 648) and Escherichia coli (ST 866) in the Netherlands. A similar IncL/M plasmid was identified in both strains, suggesting within-patient horizontal transfer. This case illustrates that OXA- 48 -carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae can be unnoticed without adequate laboratory detection procedures. Our observation stresses the importance of uniform and adequate laboratory methods for the timely and accurate detection of important antimicrobial resistance...|$|E
40|$|The β-lactam {{antibiotic}} temocillin (6 -α-methoxy-ticarcillin) shows {{stability to}} most extended spectrum β-lactamases, but is considered inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mutations in the MexAB-OprM efflux system, naturally occurring in cystic fibrosis (CF) isolates, have been previously shown {{to reverse this}} intrinsic resistance. In the present study, we measured temocillin activity in a large collection (n = 333) of P. aeruginosa CF isolates. 29 % of the isolates had MICs ≤ 16 mg/L (proposed <b>clinical</b> <b>breakpoint</b> for temocillin). Mutations were observed in mexA or mexB in isolates for which temocillin MIC was ≤ 512 mg/L (nucleotide insertions or deletions, premature termination, tandem repeat, nonstop, and missense mutations). A correlation was observed between temocillin MICs and efflux rate of N-phenyl- 1 -naphthylamine (MexAB-OprM fluorescent substrate) and extracellular exopolysaccharide abundance (contributing to a mucoid phenotype). OpdK or OpdF anion-specific porins expression decreased temocillin MIC by ∼ 1 two-fold dilution only. Contrarily to the common assumption that temocillin is inactive on P. aeruginosa, we show here clinically-exploitable MICs on a non-negligible proportion of CF isolates, explained by a wide diversity of mutations in mexA and/or mexB. In a broader context, this work contributes to increase our understanding of MexAB-OprM functionality and help delineating how antibiotics interact with MexA and MexB.

40|$|AbstractClinical {{breakpoints}} {{are used}} in clinical microbiology laboratories to categorize microorganisms as clinically susceptible (S), intermediate (I) or resistant (R) dependent on the quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility {{as indicated by the}} MIC value determined in a well-defined standard test system. The laboratory report, with the designations of S, I or R for each antimicrobial agent, provides guidance to clinicians with respect to the potential use of agents in the treatment of patients, and <b>clinical</b> <b>breakpoints</b> should therefore distinguish between patients that are likely or unlikely to respond to antimicrobial treatment. In Europe, <b>clinical</b> <b>breakpoints</b> are set by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), following a defined procedure. This includes evaluation of efficacy in experimental settings and clinical studies to derive pharmacodynamic targets such as the fAUC/MIC ratio or %fT > MIC required for efficacy, the pharmacokinetic properties of the agent, Monte Carlo simulations to estimate exposures of the antimicrobial agent in the target patient population and commonly used dosing regimens. The probability of target attainment is subsequently determined for a range of pharmacodynamic targets and the results from the Monte Carlo simulations. The breakpoints derived are subsequently evaluated with respect to the wild-type population of the target microorganisms, specific resistance mechanisms and other relevant data. In this paper, we provide an overview of the EUCAST process and considerations for setting pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic breakpoints. These are the breakpoints that in the EUCAST breakpoint tables are referred to as ‘non-species-related breakpoints'...|$|R
40|$|For {{filamentous}} fungi (moulds), species-specific interpretive breakpoints and epidemiological {{cut-off values}} (ECVs) {{have only been}} proposed for {{a limited number of}} fungal species–antifungal agent combinations, with the result that <b>clinical</b> <b>breakpoints</b> are lacking for most emerging mould pathogens. In the current study, we have compiled minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data for 4869 clinical mould isolates and present full MIC distributions for amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin with these isolates which comprise 20 species/genera. In addition, we present the results of an assessment of the fungicidal activity of these same five antifungal agents against a panel of 123 mould isolates comprising 16 of the same species...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Clinical</b> <b>breakpoints</b> and {{epidemiological}} {{cut-off values}} for N. gonorrhoeae azithromycin {{antimicrobial susceptibility testing}} have not been established. This study utilized existing minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data from CDC’s Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) to establish epidemiological cut-off values for azithromycin and N. gonorrhoeae as determined by agar dilution. Methods: MIC distributions for the pooled dataset and each data year (2005 - 2012) were constructed. Epidemiological cut-off values were calculated using two methods. Method 1 considers the wild-type MIC distribution, the modal MIC for the distribution, and the inherent variability of the test (± 1 twofold-dilution). Method 2 defines the epidemiological cut-off value as two twofold-dilutions higher than the MIC 50. Results: Taking into consideration the wild-type MIC distributions and the inherent variability of the test, the epidemiological cut-off value chosen for the pooled dataset and each data year using Method 1 was ≤ 1. 0 µg/mL. The MIC 50 for the pooled dataset and each data year was 0. 25 µg/mL. Two twofold-dilutions higher than the MIC 50 (0. 25 µg/mL) for the pooled dataset and each data year was 1. 0 µg/mL. Discussion: The epidemiological cut-off values chosen using Methods 1 and 2 (≤ 1. 0 µg/mL) were identical for the pooled dataset and each data year, indicating the epidemiological cut-off value has not changed from 2005 - 2012. The epidemiological cut-off value for N. gonorrhoeae azithromycin agar dilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing established during this study {{can be used to}} help set <b>clinical</b> <b>breakpoints</b> and identify isolates with reduced susceptibility to azithromycin...|$|R
