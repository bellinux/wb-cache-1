5000|$|After final {{approval}} {{to buy and}} move the statue out of the country, Carpenter consulted with both Venkov and the architect who had overseen the original casting of the bronze before deciding to cut the statue into three pieces and ship it [...] to Rotterdam, {{and then on to}} the United States, all of which ultimately cost [...] (...) [...] Carpenter financed much of that by mortgaging his home. The statue arrived in Issaquah in August 1993, and <b>Carpenter</b> <b>planned</b> to install it in front of a Slovak restaurant. He died in a car accident in February 1994, during public debates on whether to display the statue in Issaquah that ended in rejection from the suburb's residents. After Carpenter's death, his family planned to sell the statue to a Fremont foundry to be melted down and repurposed into a new piece. The foundry's founder, Peter Bevis, sought to instead display the statue in Fremont, and agreed to have the Fremont Chamber of Commerce hold the sculpture in trust until a buyer is found. The statue was unveiled on June 3, 1995, at the corner of Evanston Avenue North and North 34th Street on private property, one block north of a salvaged Cold War rocket fuselage, another artistic Fremont attraction.|$|R

40|$|In social media, content {{creation}} is often king. The University of North Florida’s Thomas G. Carpenter Library has refocused its efforts away from original content {{in an effort}} to focus on listening and engagement. This practice has led the Carpenter Library to build a reliable, friendly, and helpful online community that has inspired other departments on campus to do the same. By monitoring keywords, hashtags, and geotags, library staff has kept tabs on what students have to say about the library’s various services, resources, spaces, employees, and more. Over the past 2 years, follower counts on Facebook and Twitter have almost doubled, as have engagements such as likes and shares.

50|$|Meanwhile, Ichi {{stays at}} an inn {{in the town}} and comes across a woman he carried passionate {{feelings}} for, and possibly still does, {{by the name of}} Otane (whom Ichi affectionately calls Tane). Tane is not married to a <b>carpenter,</b> as she <b>planned</b> when last seen in a film, but to a quick tempered ronin named Tanakura. She tells Ichi {{that she and her husband}} have done many bad things. The inn keeper's adopted daughter Nobu is in love with the young inheritor of the banker position for the local yakuza but her father does not approve of him. An older yakuza man sees the inheritor as weak and wishes to move in on the territory and demands that Ichi be killed or the inheritor will lose his position.|$|R
500|$|Charisma <b>Carpenter</b> had {{originally}} <b>planned</b> {{to read for}} the role of Buffy, but was late for her audition and instead tried out for Cordelia. Although she had only fifteen minutes to prepare for the character, the producers were [...] "really responsive" [...] to Carpenter's audition, and she left feeling confident she had gotten the part. After Carpenter's audition, Gellar, who had been offered the role of Cordelia before Carpenter, was asked to come back and audition for the part of Buffy. Bianca Lawson originally won the role of Cordelia Chase, but turned it down due to other contractual obligations. Lawson would later be cast as vampire slayer Kendra in the show's second season. Cordelia was originally intended to serve as a dramatic foil to Buffy, and to represent the characteristics of the less mature and shallower Buffy portrayed in the original film.|$|R

Carpenter, who had dressed casually {{for the role of}} Buffy—who she believed [...] "could really be herself"—felt unprepared to read for Cordelia because she [...] "was definitely a character to dress for". Although she had only fifteen minutes to prepare for the character, the producers were [...] "really responsive" [...] to Carpenter's audition, and she left feeling confident she had got the part.

Carpenter, proud of her own character's growth across the two series, did not envy Gellar for winning the role of Buffy over her.|$|R

Over the past two years, the University of North Florida 2 ̆ 7 s Thomas G. Carpenter Library has used its social media presence (@unflibrary) to listen and then engage with students. This practice has led the Carpenter Library to build a reliable, friendly, and helpful online community that has inspired other departments on campus to do the same. By monitoring keywords, hashtags, and geotags, library staff has kept tabs on what students have to say about the library’s various services, resources, spaces, employees, and more. Sometimes the tweets or posts are lighthearted and positive; for example, recent tweets include “The unf library is the MVP of finals week!” and “Love spending time at the UNF Library”. Other times real concerns or complaints are voiced, allowing the library staff to reach out online and address as best they can. The act of listening has also allowed the Carpenter Library to begin fun and engaging conversations with students, which many times leads to that individual liking the library’s reply, retweeting/reposting, and often following the library account.

5000|$|Hagley's first {{building}} was a brick church, on [...] "Westbury Road" [...] for Church of England services. The foundation stone was laid 8 January 1847 {{and the church}} completed, using materials from Deloraine, and opened 9 June 1848. It was built on part of the former Lyttleton Estate, funded by Sir Richard Dry and the estate's trustee, Archdeacon R.R. Davies. When completed the church was in the Parish of Westbury. By 1859, with population growing, parishioners in Hagley held a meeting to consider forming their own Parish. Dry offered to pay the Minister's stipend and provide 1000 pounds towards church buildings. Consequent to this offer, the separate Parish of Hagley and Quamby was created. This first church was used until completion of the later St Mary's Church. It was later demolished {{to make way for}} a Presbyterian Church.The Church of England's parish of Hagley had its beginnings in 1856 when Dry endowed it with three farms.
