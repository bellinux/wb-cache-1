Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.

It is not <b>certain</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} next, but an insertion in the Chronicle of Melrose {{states that}} Donald forced his three nephews into exile, {{although he was}} allied with another of his nephews, Edmund. John of Fordun wrote, centuries later, that an escort into England was arranged for them by their maternal uncle Edgar Ætheling.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} <b>certain</b> <b>what</b> pachycephalosaurs ate; having very small, ridged teeth {{they could not have}} chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that their sharp, serrated teeth were ideally suited for a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, fruit and insects. Stegoceras may have had an entirely herbivorous diet, as the tooth crowns were similar to those of iguanid lizards. The premaxillary teeth show wear facets from contact with the predentary bone, and the maxillary teeth have double wear facets similar to those seen in other ornithischian dinosaurs. Every third maxillary tooth of UALVP 2 are erupting replacement teeth, and tooth replacement happened in backwards progression in sequential threes. The occipital region of Stegoceras was well-demarcated for muscle-attachment and it is believed that the jaw movement of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs was mostly limited to up-and-down motions with only a slight capability for jaw rotation. This is based on the structure of the jaw and dental microwear and wear facets of the teeth indicate that the bite-force was used more for shearing than for crushing.|$|E

Ranjitsinhji did not take it particularly seriously and preferred tennis at the time. No-one was <b>certain</b> <b>what</b> would become of him once he left the college but his academic prowess presented the solution of moving to England to study at Cambridge University.|$|E
25|$|Lack {{of success}} at St Gildas made Abelard {{decide to take}} up public {{teaching}} again (although he remained {{for a few more}} years, officially, Abbot of St Gildas). It is not entirely <b>certain</b> <b>what</b> he then did, but given that John of Salisbury heard Abelard lecture on dialectic in 1136, it is presumed that he returned to Paris and resumed teaching on the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève. It is presumed his lectures included logic, at least until 1136, but were mainly concerned with the Bible, Christian doctrine, and ethics. Then he produced further drafts of his Theologia in which he analyzed the sources of belief in the Trinity and praised the pagan philosophers of classical antiquity for their virtues and for their discovery by the use of reason of many fundamental aspects of Christian revelation.|$|E

25|$|The first clear {{reference}} to 'rhymes of Robin Hood' {{is from the}} alliterative poem Piers Plowman, {{thought to have been}} composed in the 1370s, but the earliest surviving copies of the narrative ballads that tell his story date to the second half of 15th century, or {{the first decade of the}} 16th century. In these early accounts, Robin Hood's partisanship of the lower classes, his Marianism and associated special regard for women, his outstanding skill as an archer, his anti-clericalism, and his particular animosity towards the Sheriff of Nottingham are already clear. Little John, Much the Miller's Son and Will Scarlet (as Will 'Scarlok' or 'Scathelocke') all appear, although not yet Maid Marian or Friar Tuck. It is not <b>certain</b> <b>what</b> should be made of these latter two absences as it is known that Friar Tuck, for one, has been part of the legend since at least the later 15th century where he is mentioned in a Robin Hood play script.|$|E
25|$|It {{was about}} 9 {{million years ago}} that the group of {{primates}} that were to evolve into gorillas split from their common ancestor with humans and chimps; this is when the genus Gorilla emerged. It is not <b>certain</b> <b>what</b> this early relative of the gorilla was, but it is traced back to the early ape Proconsul africanus. Mountain gorillas have been isolated from eastern lowland gorillas for about 400,000 years and these two taxa separated from their western counterparts approximately 2 million years ago. There has been considerable and as yet unresolved debate over the classification of mountain gorillas. The genus was first referenced as Troglodytes in 1847, but renamed to Gorilla in 1852. It was not until 1967 that the taxonomist Colin Groves proposed that all gorillas be regarded as one species (Gorilla gorilla) with three sub-species Gorilla gorilla gorilla (western lowland gorilla), Gorilla gorilla graueri (lowland gorillas found west of the Virungas) and Gorilla gorilla beringei (mountain gorillas including, Gorilla beringei found in the Virungas and Bwindi). In 2003 after a review they were divided into two species (Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei) by The World Conservation Union (IUCN).|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of March 22, 1969, Abebe lost control of his Volkswagen Beetle; it overturned, {{trapping}} him inside. According to biographer Tim Judah, {{he may have been}} drinking. Judah quotes Abebe's account of the accident from the biography by his daughter, Tsige Abebe, that he tried [...] "to avoid a fast, oncoming car". Judah wrote that it was difficult to know for <b>certain</b> <b>what</b> happened. Abebe was freed from his car the following morning and brought to the Imperial Guard hospital. The accident left him a quadriplegic, paralysed from the neck down; he never walked again. On March 29 Abebe was transferred to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England, where he spent eight months receiving treatment. He was visited by Queen Elizabeth II and received get-well cards from all over the world. Although Abebe could not move his head at first, his condition eventually improved to paraplegia, regaining the use of his arms.|$|E
500|$|In 1870, {{a set of}} dies for the three-dollar {{piece was}} sent from the Bureau of the Mint's Engraving Department at the Philadelphia Mint to San Francisco. [...] On May14, 1870, Oscar Hugh La Grange, {{superintendent}} of the San Francisco Mint, sent a telegram to Mint Director Pollock, informing him that dies for the one- and three-dollar pieces had been received, but lacked the customary [...] "S" [...] mint mark, and asking for guidance. [...] The dies were, per Pollock's instructions, returned to Philadelphia, but LaGrange informed Pollock that to secure a three-dollar piece to place in {{the cornerstone of the}} new San Francisco Mint building, Coiner J.B.Harmistead had engraved an [...] "S" [...] on the reverse die. [...] It is not <b>certain</b> <b>what</b> became of the piece to be placed in the cornerstone, but Harmistead also struck a piece for himself, which was mounted as jewelry at one time, and the existence of which was not known until 1907. [...] The only unique regular-issue U.S. gold piece by date and mint mark, it last came on the market in 1982, when it sold for $687,500. [...] Today it forms part of the Harry W.Bass, Jr. Collection in the Money Museum of the American Numismatic Association in Colorado Springs. [...] No other three-dollar pieces were struck at San Francisco in 1870; dies were sent there most years between 1861 and 1873, but, with the exception of 1870, were not used.|$|E
500|$|According to the Life of William Marshal, {{which dates}} to soon after 1219, when word reached William Marshal, {{one of the}} richest and most {{influential}} barons, that Richard was dead, he consulted with Walter and discussed whom to support as the next king. Marshal's choice was John, but Walter initially leaned towards John's young nephew Arthur of Brittany. When Marshall was insistent on John, who was an adult, the author of the Life has Walter say in reply [...] " [...] 'So be it then,' said the archbishop, 'but mark my words, Marshal, you will never regret anything in your life as much as this.'" [...] This is almost certainly a retrospective comment that has been inserted into the biography, however, based on John's later behaviour. Once John knew he had the support of Walter and William Marshal, he sent Walter ahead to England to request all free men to pledge fealty to the new king. On 27 May 1199 Walter crowned John, supposedly making a speech that promulgated, for the last time, the theory of a king's election by the people. This story is only contained in the writings of Matthew Paris, however, and although it seems certain that Walter made a speech, it is not <b>certain</b> <b>what</b> the exact contents were. On his coronation day, John appointed Walter Lord Chancellor. W. L. Warren, historian and author of a biography of John, says of Walter that [...] "No one living had a firmer grasp of the intricacies of royal government, yet even in old age his mind was adaptable and fecund with suggestions for coping with new problems." ...|$|E
