25|$|Amongst the 11 player departures {{were four}} reserve-team players after they too {{reached the end}} of their <b>current</b> <b>contracts.</b> The most notable departing player was Chuks Aneke whose {{development}} was somewhat hindered by the lack of first-team action. As a result, he joined Zulte Waregem on a Bosman free transfer citing the Belgian style of play as his deciding factor. The remaining players whose contracts were not renewed included Daniel Boateng, Leander Siemann, Zak Ansah and Zach Fagan, the latter two joining Charlton Athletic and Welling United respectively.|$|E
25|$|While the {{threshold}} age was {{changed in the}} 2017 CBA, {{the mechanics of the}} rule remained the same. Notably, several members of the union's executive committee at the time the 2017 CBA was negotiated were older players who were seen as potential major beneficiaries of a change to an over-38 rule. For example, the change to an over-38 rule gave union president Chris Paul, scheduled to become a free agent after the 2016–17 season, a potential gain of nearly $50 million over the life of his next contract. Similarly, executive committee members LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, who could opt out of their <b>current</b> <b>contracts</b> after the same season, had the potential for similar gains with this change.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{concern that the}} Sellafield area will become a major dumping ground for {{unwanted}} nuclear material, since there are currently no long-term facilities for storing High-Level Waste (HLW), although the UK has <b>current</b> <b>contracts</b> to reprocess spent fuel {{from all over the}} world. Contracts agreed since 1976 between BNFL and overseas customers require that all HLW be returned to the country of origin. The UK retains low- and intermediate-level waste resulting from its reprocessing activity, and instead ships out a radiologically equivalent amount of its own HLW. This substitution policy is intended to be environmentally neutral and to speed return of overseas material by reducing the number of shipments required, since HLW is far less bulky.|$|E

500|$|Electricity {{from the}} dam's {{powerhouse}} was originally sold pursuant to a fifty-year contract, authorized by Congress in 1934, which ran from 1937 to 1987. In 1984, Congress passed a new statute which set power allocations from the dam from 1987 to 2017. The powerhouse was run under the original authorization by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Southern California Edison; in 1987, the Bureau of Reclamation assumed control. In 2011, Congress enacted legislation extending the <b>current</b> <b>contracts</b> until 2067, after setting aside 5% of Hoover Dam's power {{for sale to}} Native American tribes, electric cooperatives, and other entities. The new arrangement began on October 1, 2017.|$|E

Compensation cheques to victims who had won their claims were dishonoured, outstanding court cases placed on hold and an embargo put in place preventing new actions from being launched.

2500|$|After {{extensive}} {{talks between}} the NFL, the Browns, and officials of the two cities, Cleveland accepted a legal settlement that would keep the Browns legacy in Cleveland. In February 1996, the NFL announced the Browns would be 'deactivated' for three years, and a new stadium would be built for a new Browns team, as either an expansion team or a team moved from another city, that would begin play in 1999. Modell would, in turn, be granted a new franchise, the NFL's 31st, for Baltimore, the Baltimore Ravens, retaining the <b>current</b> <b>contracts</b> of players and personnel. The Browns ceased play {{at the end of}} the 1995 season when Modell relocated the organization to Baltimore. The Browns franchise was then reactivated, and its roster restocked by an expansion draft before resuming play in the 1999 season. The team would be new, but the Browns' name, colors, history, records, awards, and archives would all remain in Cleveland. [...] The move fueled a proliferation of 12 new stadiums throughout the NFL. Using the NFL–City of Cleveland agreement's promise to supply a team to Cleveland by 1999, several NFL franchises used the threat of relocation to coerce their respective cities to build new stadiums with public funds.|$|E
