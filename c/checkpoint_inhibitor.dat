40|$|Immune <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> which target coinhibitory T cell {{molecules}} {{to promote}} anticancer immune responses, {{are on the}} rise to become a new pillar of cancer therapy. However, current immune checkpoint-based therapies are successful only in a subset of patients and acquired resistances pose additional challenges. Finding new targets and combining <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> might help to overcome these limitations. In this study, human T cells stimulated with allogeneic dendritic cells (DCs) were used to compare immune <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> targeting TIM- 3, BTLA, LAG- 3, CTLA- 4, and TIGIT alone or in combination with a PD- 1 antibody. We found that PD- 1 blockade bears a unique potency to enhance T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Other <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> failed to significantly augment T cell responses when used alone. However, antibodies to TIM- 3, BTLA, LAG- 3, and CTLA- 4 enhanced T cell proliferation in presence of a PD- 1 antibody. Upregulation of coinhibitory T cell receptors upon PD- 1 blockade was identified as a potential mechanism for synergistic effects between <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Donor-specific variation in response to immune <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> was attributed to the T cells rather than DCs. Additionally, we analyzed the regulation of checkpoint molecules and their ligands on T cells and allogeneic DCs in coculture, which suggested a PD- 1 blockade-dependent crosstalk between T cells and APC. Our results indicate that several immune <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have the capacity to enhance T cell responses when combined with PD- 1 blockade. Additional in vitro studies on human T cells will be useful to identify antibody combinations with the potential to augment T cell responses in cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{toxicity}} after conventional antineoplastic drugs (eg, anthracyclines) {{has historically}} been a relevant issue. In addition, targeted therapies and biological molecules can also induce cardiotoxicity. Immune <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are a novel class of anticancer drugs, distinct from targeted or tumour type-specific therapies. Cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockers (ie, monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA- 4), programmed cell death 1 (PD- 1) and its ligand (PD-L 1)) has revolutionised the management {{of a wide variety}} of malignancies endowed with poor prognosis. These inhibitors unleash antitumour immunity, mediate cancer regression and improve the survival in a percentage of patients with different types of malignancies, but can also produce a wide spectrum of immune-related adverse events. Interestingly, PD- 1 and PD-L 1 are expressed in rodent and human cardiomyocytes, and early animal studies have demonstrated that CTLA- 4 and PD- 1 deletion can cause autoimmune myocarditis. Cardiac toxicity has largely been underestimated in recent reviews of toxicity of <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> but during the last years several cases of myocarditis and fatal heart failure have been reported in patients treated with <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> alone and in combination. Here we describe the mechanisms of the most prominent <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> specifically ipilimumab (anti-CTLA- 4, the godfather of <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors)</b> patient and monoclonal antibodies targeting PD- 1 (eg, nivolumab, pembrolizumab) and PD-L 1 (eg, atezolizumab). We also discuss what is known and what needs to be done about cardiotoxicity of <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in patients with cancer. Severe cardiovascular effects associated with checkpoint blockade introduce important issues for oncologists, cardiologists and immunologists...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Inhibitory {{molecules}} such as PD- 1, CTLA- 4, LAG- 3, or TIM- 3 {{play a role}} to keep {{a balance}} in immune function. However, many cancers exploit such molecules to escape immune surveillance. Accumulating data support that their functions are dysregulated in lymphoid neoplasms, including plasma cell myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia. In lymphoid neoplasms, aberrations in 9 p 24. 1 (PD-L 1, PD-L 2, and JAK 2 locus), latent Epstein-Barr virus infection, PD-L 1 3 ′-untranslated region disruption, and constitutive JAK-STAT pathway are known mechanisms to induce PD-L 1 expression in lymphoma cells. Clinical trials demonstrated that PD- 1 blockade is an attractive way to restore host’s immune function in hematological malignancies, particularly classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Numerous clinical trials exploring PD- 1 blockade as a single therapy or {{in combination with other}} immune <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in patients with hematologic cancers are under way. Although impressive clinical response is observed with immune <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in patients with certain cancers, not all patients respond to immune <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Therefore, to identify best candidates who would have excellent response to <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> is of utmost importance. Several possible biomarkers are available, but consensus has not been made and pursuit to discover the best biomarker is ongoing...|$|R

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} The {{aim of this}} review is to draw the {{attention}} of the physicians and oncologists on the rare side-effects of <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> not usually reported in clinical trials to treat them quickly and render their prognosis better. Recent findings Rare side-effects of <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are mainly neurologic, haematologic, rheumatologic, renal, and cardiac. The majority of reported side-effects are consequent of the treatment by ipilimumab in patients diagnosed with melanomas. Neurologic side-effects have poorer prognosis compared with other rare side-effects. There is no relationship between developing rare side-effects and the outcome of the disease. Summary It is important to be aware, when treating patients with <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> to detect as early as possible the unpredictable and uncontrollable rare side-effects of these agents. The large spectrum of these rare side-effects should be well documented and reported to assure to the physicians a road map for the diagnosis and the management of these toxicities.

40|$|Abstract The {{inhibition}} of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway {{in the treatment}} of cancers has recently reached an exciting stage with several cell cycle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> that are now being tested in several clinical trials in cancer patients. Although the great amount of pre-clinical and clinical data are from the solid tumor experience, only few studies have been done on leukemias using specific cell cycle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> This review aims to summarize the most recent data found on the biological mechanisms of the response to DNA damages highlighting the role of the different elements of the DDR pathway in normal and cancer cells and focusing on the main genetic alteration or aberrant gene expression that has been found on acute and chronic leukemias. This review, for the first time, outlines the most important pre-clinical and clinical data available on the efficacy of cell cycle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in single agent and in combination with different agents normally used for the treatment of acute and chronic leukemias...|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} program for pembrolizumab {{was seen as}} high priority at Organon, but low at Schering, and then at Merck, and in early 2010 Merck terminated development and began preparing to outlicense it. [...] But then later in 2010 scientists from Bristol Myers Squibb published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that their <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> ipilimumab (Yervoy) had shown strong promise in metastatic melanoma and that a second BMS <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> nivolumab, (Opdivo) was also promising. [...] Merck at that time has little commitment and expertise in oncology or immunotherapy, but understood the opportunity and reacted strongly, reactivating the program and filing its IND {{by the end of}} 2010. As an example, Martin Huber {{was one of the few}} senior people at Merck with strong experience in lung cancer drug development, but had been promoted to senior management and was no longer involved in product development; he ended stepped down from his role and led clinical development of pembrolizumab for lung cancer.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{immunotherapy}} {{has produced}} encouraging {{results in a}} rapidly increasing number of solid tumors. The responsiveness of bladder cancer to immunotherapy was first established in nonmuscle invasive disease in 1976 with intravesical instillations of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Very recently immune <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> demonstrated good activity and significant efficacy in metastatic disease. In particular the best results were obtained with programmed death-ligand- 1 (PD-L 1) and programmed death- 1 (PD- 1) inhibitors, but many other immune <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> including anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein- 4 (CTLA- 4) antibodies, are currently under investigation in several trials.

Most of these have the purpose to promote adaptive T cell-mediated immunity against cancer. Here, we review another checkpoint acting to potentiate the activity of innate immune cells towards cancer. This innate immune checkpoint is composed of what {{has become known as}} the 'don't-eat me' signal CD 47, which is a protein broadly expressed on normal cells and often overexpressed on cancer cells, and its counter-receptor, the myeloid inhibitory immunoreceptor SIRPα. Blocking CD 47 -SIRPα interactions has been shown to promote the destruction of cancer cells by phagocytes, including macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that targeting of the CD 47 -SIRPα axis may also promote antigen-presenting cell function and thereby stimulate adaptive T cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity. The development of CD 47 -SIRPα <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and the potential side effects that these may have are discussed. Collectively, this identifies the CD 47 -SIRPα axis as a promising innate immune checkpoint in cancer, and with data of the first clinical studies with CD 47 -SIRPα <b>checkpoint</b> <b>inhibitors</b> expected within the coming years, this is an exciting and rapidly developing fiel...|$|R
