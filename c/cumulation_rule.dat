40|$|Rules of Origin (RoO) are an {{integral}} part of all trade rules. In order to be eligible for Common Effective Preferential Tariffs (CEPT) under AFTA and similar arrangements under the ASEAN-China FTA, a product must satisfy the conditions relative to local content. The paper tries to calculate local content as well as cumulative local content in East Asian economies, with use of the Asian International Input-Output Tables; it also investigates factors of change in local content by applying decomposition analysis. The paper finds that the <b>cumulation</b> <b>rule</b> increased local content of the electronics industry more significantly than local content of the automotive industry, and the contribution of the <b>cumulation</b> <b>rule</b> increased in the period 1990 - 2000, due to rising dependency on neighboring ASEAN countries and China.

40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} diagonal cumulation on free trade agreement (FTA) utilization by exploring Thai exports to Japan under two kinds of FTA schemes. While the one scheme adopts bilateral cumulation, the other scheme does diagonal cumulation. Comparing trade under these two kinds of FTAs, we can {{examine the effect of}} diagonal cumulation without relying on not only the variation in <b>cumulation</b> <b>rules</b> across country pairs but also the variation across years. In short, our estimates do not suffer from biases from time-variant elements and country pair-specific elements. As a result, our estimates show around 4 % trade creation effect of diagonal cumulation, which is much smaller than the estimates in the previous studies (around 15 %) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} various {{indicators of}} the utilisation of preferences granted to developing countries by the EU and the US in the agricultural, food and fisheries sector. We conclude that {{only a very small}} proportion of the imports eligible to these preferences is actually exported outside a preferential regime. The rate of utilisation is therefore high. However, the flow of imports from poorest countries remains very limited in spite of rather generous tariff preferences, which leads to question the overall impact of the preferential agreements. In addition, preferential regimes overlap, and in such cases some regimes are systematically preferred to others. We use econometric estimates of the (latent) cost of using a given preference in order to explain why particular regimes are used. We focus on possible explanations, such as the <b>cumulation</b> <b>rules</b> (that restrict the use of materials originating from other countries), fixed administrative costs, and differences in the preferential margin.

40|$|Both the European Union and the United States grant non-reciprocal {{preferences}} {{to developing}} countries under the Generalised System of Preferences as well as under several regional schemes. The benefits of these preferences have recently been questioned. Several authors have pointed out the under-utilisation of these preferences due to the constraints attached. There have been claims that rules of origin requirements and administrative costs, as well as uncertainty on eventual eligibility, have deterred exporters from using preferential regimes. We calculate various indicators of the utilisation of preferences in the agricultural, food and fisheries sector. We conclude that {{only a very small}} proportion of the imports eligible for these preferences is actually exported outside a preferential regime. The rate of utilisation is therefore high. However, the flow of imports from the poorest countries remains very limited in spite of rather generous tariff preferences, which leads to questions over the overall impact of the preferential agreements. In addition, preferential regimes overlap, and in such cases some regimes are systematically preferred to others.

40|$|Neuroscience {{has always}} been an {{attractive}} and mysterious subject. In the last years the studies on the brain have increased massively and mathematics has {{played a key role in}} this research work. This thesis project is an example of how mathematics is central to the comprehension and the modelling of biological processes (in this specific case neuronal processes). This work is organised into three chapters: the first about a biological description of the neuron, the second about the modelling of the mechanism with which neurons communicate and the last about the analysis of a network of neurons. More specifically, in the first chapter we describe the anatomy of the neuron and we analyse the mechanisms with which neurons receive and transmit signals from a biological point of view. In the second chapter we model action potentials: processes which allow neurons to quickly transmit information. We start with the description of the Morris-Lecar model, a deterministic mathematical system developed by Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar to reproduce the transmission of signals in the giant barnacle muscle fiber. We construct then a stochastic version of this one in order to give to this base model a more realistic and random behaviour. To do that we use the piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), a class of non-diffusion models introduced by Mark H. A. Davis in 1984. At the end of the chapter we show some simulations of action potentials obtained by using various methods such as the Gillespie method or the thinning. In the third chapter we analyse a network of neurons. The aim of this part is to study the behaviour of a network of neurons and the spatial propagation of signals. We first introduce a network of interconnected neurons, with specific signal <b>cumulation</b> <b>rules</b> and show by numerical simulations how the signal propagates. Then, in the spirit of mean field theory, we prove that an empirical density of neurons converges to the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), when the number of neurons tends to infinity...|$|R
40|$|Within any {{preferential}} trade agreement (PTA) origin rules exist {{in order to prevent}} third countries from taking advantage of the PTA concessions. The rules thus are there to preserve the existing external protection of countries within the PTA. However, depending on their formulation, they can also increase that level of external protection, resulting in trade suppression and trade diversion. This paper provides the first serious empirical examination of the possible impact of rules of origin on patterns of trade in the European context. The methodology employed is that of an augmented gravity model where we focus on the impact within the Pan-european system of cumulation. The results suggest that rules of origin do indeed restrict trade, that the <b>cumulation</b> of such <b>rules</b> could increase trade in the order of 50 %, and that the impact is greater on intermediate than manufacturing trade. international trade, rules of origin, gravity model...|$|R
40|$|Striking {{a balance}} between trade {{facilitation}} and preventing trade deflection {{is the single most}} difficult challenge with regard to the issue of rules of origin (ROO). ASEAN ROO is already considered as among the simplest in the world and still, in practice, results fall short of expectations. Haddad (2007) made the following observations about the ASEAN ROO : (1) low AFTA preference utilization rate, (2) difficult compliance even for supposedly simple value-added rule, (3) administrative cost of compliance to prove origin acting as deterrent, (4) low margin of preference for goods traded within ASEAN, and (5) the bulk of intra-ASEAN trade occurring in commodities where preference margins are below the threshold that would justify the cost of compliance. Lessons from the EU experience indicate {{that there are a number}} of factors which could further lessen the negative effects of restrictive rules of origin schemes. This is related to the wide spectrum of ROO among the various East Asian FTAs. According to Manchin and Pelkmans-Balaoing (2007), the burden of production costs induced by restrictive rules of origin can be somewhat reduced by allowing less restrictive <b>cumulation</b> <b>rules</b> (e. g. diagonal or full cumulation), allowing duty drawback, outsourcing and higher de minimis levels. Furthermore, administrative costs can also be reduced by more trader-friendly approaches, such as self-certification methods. The reforms in ASEAN ROOs are indeed heading toward the direction of less restriction and simplification as described by Manchin and Pelkmans-Balaoing (2007) : The relatively ample allowance for imports in the AFTA stems from the realization that for many heavily-traded products in the region, like electronics, production processes may be so splintered that the value of local content is often a small percentage of the products total value. Very early on in the formation of AFTA, it was recognized that the 40 percent ASEAN origin rule may often not be met in the case of trade in textile and textile products. In 1995, it was therefore decided that either the percentage value-added or the substantial transformation rule may be used by ASEAN exporters. The AFTA ROO underwent further overhaul, starting in 2003, when operational procedures were further clarified and simplified. In the same year, the decision was reached to adopt a change in tariff heading rule for determining the origin of the product as a general alternative rule applicable to all products which cannot comply with the 40 percent local/ASEAN content requirement, giving priority to sectors which are the subject of private sector requests and those sectors prioritized by the AEM for accelerated integration. As of last year (2006), the change of tariff heading rule is fully endorsed for four sectors : wheat-flour, wood-based products, aluminum products and iron and steel. Forging ASEAN in an effective regional economic bloc and eventually an economic community, however, would entail more fundamental structural reforms. The argument by the 2003 McKinsey report that market fragmentation lies at the heart of ASEANs competitiveness challenge is rather simplistic. Fortunately, the six projects currently being undertaken by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) address these fundamental issues. These studies deal primarily with supply side constraints focusing on enhancing the capability of ASEAN member countries to engage with each other and other countries more effectively and meaningfully. In the medium term, ASEAN member countries can push for an East Asia Free Trade Area that will consolidate the various bilateral and sub-regional FTAs and therefore overcome the noodle bowl syndrome. This would be a direct result of harmonizing the various ROO. It goes without saying that the ultimate or long-term objective would be an equitable and efficient multilateral trading system anchored on lower MFN rates under the auspices of the WTO.

We have selected 10 economically important codified contract types containing default rules and 8 countries particularly relevant as mother countries of legal origins, financial centers or newly industrialized economies (France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, the UK and the US). We exclude countries having received their laws as colonial “transplants” and countries in legal transformation. The economic impact of default rules is detectable by econometric analysis based on panel data inference over prolonged periods (1870 - 2008). Codified default rules favor economic performance, the higher their number the better. The results are controlled for time and country fixed effects, confirmed by counterfactual simulations and robust. We also test whether the presence of all ten contract types can compensate the absence of financial center advantage, and find that they {{do so in the}} civil law mother countries and the two newly industrialized countries of our sample. The Swiss case shows that the <b>cumulation</b> of default <b>rule</b> advantage and financial center advantage results in superior economic performance. While qualifying legal origins theory, our results strongly confirm institutional economics in its core of contract theory...|$|R
40|$|International {{trade has}} been defined as the engine of growth by {{international}} development institutions as more cross-border trade associated with more economic activity, higher employment, hence, poverty alleviation. If trade is the engine of growth, trade finance can be defined as grease for the engine. Hence, availing more funds to finance the enormous amount of international trade, counting about half of global GDP, is an important agenda for the OIC as well as many multilateral development institutions. The main reason behind the efforts to avail more funds for trade finance is to direct valuable financial resources from speculation to explore opportunities to increase international trade in a way to grease and roll the wheel of real economy. With reference to the OIC Ten-Year Programme of Action to Meet the Challenges Facing the Muslim countries in the 21 st century, this research aims to introduce outward-looking, cost-effective, and informal policy options for a resilient OIC trade integration to increase international trade among OIC countries. In this regard, the first essay aims to explore the determinants of recent increase in intra-OIC trade to ascertain if it is due to policy instruments implemented by OIC organs or some other externalities. It is argued that recent increase in intra-OIC trade percentage {{is likely to be the}} product of reverse effects of oil price surge and Euro appreciation but not trade diversion effect of OIC membership. OIC membership itself alone would not increase intra-OIC trade if not accompanied with policy instrument for trade facilitation to make cross-border trade easier among member countries. However, as customs revenue constitutes the bulk of public revenue for many OIC countries, they need to be convinced about benefit of trade facilitation. Accordingly, with reference to the unwillingness of OIC countries for trade facilitation, the same essay scrutinizes the effect of tariff and WTO Customs Valuation Agreement on customs’ revenue of OIC countries. The results suggest that increasing tariffs might increase customs revenue for big countries but not for small countries. Besides, the implementation of WTO Customs Valuation Agreement does not decrease customs revenue as its indirect undervaluation effect would be surpassed by its direct effect of less incentive for tax evasion. As a crucial crop for public finances in many OIC countries and initial stage of industrialization, special emphasis is given to development of the cotton sector under the OIC Ten-Year Programme of Action. The Third Expert Group Meeting on Enhancing Production Efficiency and International Competitiveness in OIC Cotton-Producing Countries adopted the Five-Year OIC Cotton Plan of Action (2007 - 2011). As per the mandate of OIC, two Islamic trade finance products are proposed, one for the cotton sector through the resources mobilized with mudarabah, by proposing salam for complete supply chain financing in the second essay, and another for resource mobilization based on 2 -Step murabahah in the context of international trade as an alternative to commodity murabahah, sukuk as well as mudarabah in the third essay. In conclusion, based on further findings of the survey, the questionnaire and interviews; capacity building in trade facilitation for small countries to be complemented with OIC mutual recognition agreement for standard and conformity assessment within halal food standard development; integrated single window among OIC countries’ customs; OIC <b>cumulation</b> system of <b>rules</b> of origin for market access; inward processing relief as an alternative to free trade zones; development of the cotton sector among OIC countries to address production constraints of LDMCs and 2 -Step murabahah to mobilize trade finance resources to boost trade of OIC countries, particularly for LDMCs, are proposed as a part of concretely defined and well-grounded OIC trade integration framework...|$|R
