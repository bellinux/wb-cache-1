40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{large-scale}} dynamics in the Earth's magnetosphere due to solar wind driving. When the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is orientated southward, reconnection on the dayside magnetopause opens magnetic flux, which eventually reconnects in the magnetotail. When dayside reconnection is dominant, the polar cap, {{the area where}} open magnetic flux meets the Earth's surface, increases. Similarly, when nightside reconnection is dominant, the polar cap decreases in size. This framework {{is known as the}} expanding and contracting polar cap paradigm (ECPC). Part of this thesis considers the ionospheric flows, a part of the ECPC, which relates global auroral imagery {{of the size of the}} polar cap through a physics-based model of the ECPC, and compares the calculated ionospheric flow velocities to satellite, and ground-based measurements of plasma drift. The comparison also discusses the known limitations of the model and the observations. In the following chapters, specific events within the ECPC, or magnetospheric modes, are put into the context of solar wind driving and the auroral response. Substorms are a sporadic magnetospheric response mode, where the polar cap expands at first, followed by a distinct nightside brightening of the aurora and a decrease in polar cap flux. Steady magnetospheric convection events (SMCs) are times when the day and nightside reconnection rates are balanced, such that the polar <b>cap</b> flux <b>stays</b> constant. By considering dayside reconnection rates and the magnetospheric response during these events, it is established that the majority of SMCs are part of the substorm cycle. Sawtooth events (SEs) appear as a quasi-periodic version of substorms, but occur under more extreme solar wind driving. It is shown that the aurora behaves according to the ECPC in terms of latitudinal expansions and contractions, but the temporal behaviour is significantly different from substorms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Data centers {{can lower}} costs {{significantly}} by provisioning expensive electrical equipment (such as UPS, diesel generators, and cooling capacity) {{for the actual}} peak power consumption rather than server nameplate power ratings. However, {{it is possible that}} this under-provisioned power level is exceeded due to software behaviors on rare occasions and could cause the entire data center infrastructure to breach the safety limits. A mechanism to <b>cap</b> servers to <b>stay</b> within the provisioned budget is needed, and processor frequency scaling based power capping methods are readily available for this purpose. We show that existing methods, when applied across a large number of servers, are not fast enough to operate correctly under rapid power dynamics observed in data centers. We also show that existing methods when applied to an open system (where demand is independent of service rate) can cause cascading failures in the software service hosted, causing the service performance to fall uncontrollably even when power capping is applied for only a small reduction in power consumption. We discuss the causes for both these short-comings and point out techniques that can yield a safe, fast, and stable power capping solution. Our techniques use admission control to limit power consumption and ensure stability, resulting in orders of magnitude improvement in performance. We also discuss why admission control cannot replace existing power capping methods but must be combined with them. Keywords-power capping; admission control; frequency scaling; I...|$|R
40|$|Current design {{practices}} {{recommend to}} comply with the capacity protection principle, which pays special attention to ensuring an elastic response of the foundations under ground motion events. However, in cases such as elevated reinforced concrete (RC) pile-cap foundation typologies, this design criterion may lead to conservative designs, with excessively high construction costs. Reinforced concrete elevated pile-cap foundations is a system formed by a group of partially embedded piles connected through an aboveground <b>stayed</b> <b>cap</b> and embedded in soil. In the cases when they are subjected to ground motions, the piles suffer large bending moments that make it difficult to maintain their behavior within the elastic range of deformations. Aiming to make an in-depth analysis of the nonlinear behavior of elevated pile-cap foundations, a cyclic loading test was performed on a concrete 2 x 3 pile configuration specimen of elevated pile-cap foundation. Two results of this test, the failure mechanism and the ductile behavior, were used for the calibration of a numerical model built in OpenSees framework, by using a pushover analysis. The calibration of the numerical model enabled an in-depth study of the seismic nonlinear response of this kind of foundations. A parametric analysis was carried for this purpose, aiming to study how sensitive RC elevated pile-cap foundations are, when subjected to variations in the diameter of piles, reinforcement ratios, external loads, soil density or multilayer configurations. This analysis provided a set of ductility factors that {{can be used as a}} reference for design practices and which correspond to each of the cases analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background During the 1990 s, {{health care}} {{restructuring}} in Nova Scotia resulted in downsized hospitals, reduced inpatient length of <b>stay,</b> <b>capped</b> physician incomes and restricted practice locations. Concurrently, the provincial homecare program was redeveloped and out-of-hospital cancer deaths increased from 20 % (1992) to 30 % (1998). These factors all {{pointed to a}} transfer of end-of-life inpatient hospital care to more community-based care. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the trends in the provision of Family Physician (FP) visits to advanced cancer patients in Nova Scotia (NS) during the years of health care restructuring. Methods Design Secondary multivariate analysis of linked population-based datafiles including the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre Oncology Patient Information System (NS Cancer Registry, Vital Statistics), the NS Hospital Admissions/Separations file and the Medical Services Insurance Physician Services database. Setting Nova Scotia, an eastern Canadian province (population: 950, 000). Subjects: All patients who died of lung, colorectal, breast or prostate cancer between April 1992 and March 1998 (N = 7, 212). Outcome Measures Inpatient and ambulatory FP visits, ambulatory visits by location (office, home, long-term care facility, emergency department), time of day (regular hours, after hours), total length of inpatient hospital stay and number of hospital admissions during the last six months of life. Results In total, 139, 641 visits were provided by family physicians: 15 % of visits in the office, 10 % in the home, 5 % in the emergency department (ED), 5 % in a long-term-care centre and 64 % to hospital inpatients. There was no change in the rate of FP visits received for office, home and long-term care despite the fact that there were 13 % fewer hospital admissions, and length of hospital stay declined by 21 %. Age-sex adjusted estimates using negative binomial regression indicate a decline in hospital inpatient FP visits over time compared to 1992 – 93 levels (for 1997 – 98, adjusted RR = 0. 88, 95 %CI = 0. 81 – 0. 95) and an increase in FP ED visits (for 1997 – 98, adjusted RR = 1. 18, 95 %CI = 1. 05 – 1. 34). Conclusion Despite hospital downsizing and fewer deaths occurring in hospitals, FP ambulatory visits (except for ED visits) did not rise correspondingly. Although such restructuring resulted in more people dying out of hospital, it does not appear FPs responded by providing more medical care to them in the community. </p...|$|R
