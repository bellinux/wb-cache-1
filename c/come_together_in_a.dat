25|$|Cultural {{competence}} {{is defined as}} a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> system, agency, or among professionals and that enables them to work effectively in cross-cultural situations. Essential elements that enable organizations to become culturally competent include valuing diversity, having the capacity for cultural self-assessment, being conscious of the dynamics inherent when cultures interact, having institutionalized cultural knowledge, and having developed adaptations to service delivery reflecting an understanding of cultural diversity. By definition, diversity includes differences in race, ethnicity, age, gender, size, religion, sexual orientation, and physical and mental ability. Accordingly, organizations should include these considerations in all aspects of policy making, administration, practice, and service delivery.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the lumping-together of taxa {{had come to}} be preferred. The 3rd edition of the AOU {{checklist}} in 1910 placed the screech owls back in Otus. Although this move was never unequivocally accepted, it was the dominant treatment throughout most of the 20th century. In 1988 it was attempted to resolve this by re-establishing all those genera split some 140 years earlier at subgenus rank inside Otus. Still, the diversity and distinctness of the group failed to <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good evolutionary and phylogenetic picture, and {{it was not until the}} availability of DNA sequence data that this could be resolved. In 1999, a preliminary study of mtDNA cytochrome b across a wide range of owls found that even the treatment as subgenera was probably unsustainable and suggested that most of the genera proposed around 1850 should be accepted. Though there was some debate about the reliability of these findings at first, they have been confirmed by subsequent studies. In 2003, the AOU formally re-accepted the genus Megascops again.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the reasons}} this bat is in so much danger is its slow {{reproduction}} rate. The Eastern small-footed bat usually has only one offspring a year, although a few instances of twins have been noted. Mating most often occurs in autumn and the female stores the male’s sperm throughout hibernation in the winter. Fertilization occurs in the spring once the females are active again, and gestation occurs between 50–60 days with young being born in late May and early June. Mating has also been noted to occur throughout the hibernation period if individuals awake. [...] During the time of breeding large number of bats <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> behavior commonly known as “swarming.” All bats of this species are polyandrous, meaning they mate with multiple partners throughout the mating period. This mating behavior allows them to {{increase the likelihood of}} copulation, and therefore increase their reproductive success.|$|E

Portland State University's Daily Vanguard described Katz as: [...] "leaning close to a small body with legs crossed and hands in, squeezed together in her lap as if she's cold, too.

Critics praised the artwork in both Tokyo Mew Mew and the sequel Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode. Ikumi's [...] "free flowing" [...] style and character designs were seen as a perfect fit for the series. Criticism of Ikumi's art focused on images which regularly spilled out of panel borders and speech bubbles with ambiguous speakers. Patrick King of Animefringe stated: [...] "one of the most attractive aspects of Tokyo Mew Mew is easily Mia Ikumi's ultra-cute artwork. Big eyes, cat ears, fuzzy tails, and short skirts all <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cuteness combo that's hard to resist." [...] According to Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, [...] "Mia Ikumi's artwork is perfectly suited to the story, and it is not even all that wispy and frilly compared to other shōjo material. Like many budding manga artist, Ikumi's greatest strength is in carefully posed character portraits, and her prolific use of tones creates unique effects while also sidestepping the challenge of backgrounds." [...] Conversely, in writing for , Shaenon Garrity criticizes the series, calling it [...] "uninspired", [...] "insipid" [...] and [...] "creative bankrupt" [...] and feeling it was [...] "clearly designed by its publisher to ride the magical girl tsunami for all it was worth: the creators' marginal notes are filled with references to big book signings, photo shoots, and models hired to dress as the scantily clad preteen heroines." [...] She also remarks that the series makes poor use of its endangered species theme, while still having a [...] "preachy environmental theme".|$|E
