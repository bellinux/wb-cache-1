5|$|The Mendip Hills are {{the most}} southerly <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone upland in Britain. The rock strata known as the <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone were laid down during the early <b>Carboniferous</b> Period, about 320–350million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe {{underwent}} continental collision throughout the late Paleozoic Era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of}} the <b>Carboniferous,</b> 300million years ago. This tectonic activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe.|$|E
5|$|The extinct {{families}} Arthrolycosidae, {{found in}} <b>Carboniferous</b> and Permian rocks, and Arthromygalidae, so far {{found only in}} <b>Carboniferous</b> rocks, have been classified {{as members of the}} Mesothelae.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carboniferous</b> Period (359–299 {{million years}} ago) rocks are {{represented}} by the <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of the flat landscape of the Somerset Levels and Moors. The limestones are very fossiliferous, and contain evidence of the abundant marine life that existed {{at the time of}} their creation, including fossil crinoids (sea-lilies), corals and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Coal balls often {{preserve}} a remarkable {{record of the}} microscopic tissue structure of <b>Carboniferous</b> swamp and mire plants, which {{would otherwise have been}} completely destroyed. Their unique preservation of <b>Carboniferous</b> plants makes them valuable to scientists, who cut and peel the coal balls to research the geological past.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>Carboniferous</b> spiders {{were members}} of the Mesothelae, a {{primitive}} group now represented only by the Liphistiidae.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls first {{appeared}} in the Early <b>Carboniferous</b> around 330 million years ago (Mya). During the <b>Carboniferous,</b> temnospondyls included basal medium-sized forms such as Dendrerpeton or large semiaquatic forms such as Cochleosaurus. Other, more derived temnospondyls, such as the amphibamids, were smaller and more terrestrial. They resembled salamanders, and some taxa, such as the genus Branchiosaurus, even retained external gills like the modern-day axolotl. During the latest <b>Carboniferous</b> and Early Permian around 300 Mya, several groups, such as the dissorophids and trematopids evolved strong, robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life on land while others such as the eryopids, developed into large semiaquatic predators. The dvinosaurs, a group of small aquatic temnospondyls, evolved from terrestrial ancestors in the Late <b>Carboniferous.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mendip Hills, {{of which}} Brean Down forms the most {{westerly}} part, {{are the most}} southerly <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone upland in Britain. These rock strata were laid down during the early <b>Carboniferous</b> period, about 320–350million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe underwent continental collision throughout the late Paleozoic era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of}} the <b>Carboniferous</b> period, 300million years ago. This tectonic activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe. As a result of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now comprises at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. West of the main Mendip plateau the <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone continues in Bleadon Hill and Brean Down, and on the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.|$|E
5|$|The Peak District {{is formed}} almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} <b>Carboniferous</b> period. They comprise the <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone, the overlying Gritstone and the Coal Measures which occur only on the extreme margins of the area and infrequent outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates.|$|E
5|$|The first amniotes (clade of {{vertebrates}} {{that today}} includes reptiles, mammals, and birds) are {{known from the}} early part of the Late <b>Carboniferous.</b> By the Triassic, this group had already radiated into the earliest mammals, turtles, and crocodiles (lizards and birds appeared in the Jurassic, and snakes in the Cretaceous). This contrasts sharply with the (possibly fourth) <b>Carboniferous</b> group, the baphetids, which have left no extant surviving lineages.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Carboniferous</b> period (359–299 Ma), Scotland lay {{close to}} the equator. Several changes in sea level {{occurred}} and the coal deposits of Lanarkshire and West Lothian and limestones of Fife and Dunbar date from this time. There are oil shales near Bathgate around which the 19th-century oil-processing industry developed, {{and elsewhere in the}} Midland Valley there are ironstones and fire clay deposits that had significance in the early Industrial Revolution. Fossil Grove in Victoria Park, Glasgow contains the preserved remains of a <b>Carboniferous</b> forest. More volcanic activity formed Arthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags in Edinburgh and the nearby Bathgate Hills.|$|E
5|$|North {{and east}} of the Mendips the <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone layers {{are found in the}} {{subsurface}} and are exposed in Avon Gorge, and are overlain by younger strata in Dundry Hill and the Cotswolds, where oolitic limestone of Jurassic age is found at the surface. West of the main Mendip plateau the <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone continues in Bleadon Hill and Brean Down, and on the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm in the Bristol Channel.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in the <b>Carboniferous</b> Period, some 350 {{million years}} ago, {{when there were}} only two major land masses, insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed, however, is not well understood, largely due to the {{scarcity}} of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower <b>Carboniferous.</b> Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they developed from thoracic protrusions used as radiators.|$|E
5|$|The Palaeozoic era is {{represented}} in the park by the model rock exposure showing a succession of beds, namely the <b>Carboniferous</b> (including Coal Measures and limestone) and Permian.|$|E
5|$|The geology of {{the area}} {{is made up of}} a <b>carboniferous</b> bedrock of sandstone, {{mudstone}} and coal, which is covered mainly by boulder clay and till.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} formed of <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone {{and is often}} {{described}} as geologically a continuation of the Mendip Hills at Brean Down; however, the dip is at a different angle to that on Brean Down. On Steep Holm the dip is about 30 degrees to the north whereas at Brean Down it is 30 degrees to the south. There are some folds and fractures with dip angles up to 75 degrees created during the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of the}} <b>Carboniferous</b> Period, 300million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the soft tissue of temnospondyls. A block of sandstone, {{described}} in 2007 from the Early <b>Carboniferous</b> Mauch Chunk Formation of Pennsylvania, included impressions of the bodies of three temnospondyls. These impressions show, when alive, they had smooth skin, robust limbs with webbed feet, and a ridge of skin on their undersides. Trackways referable to small temnospondyls have also been found in <b>Carboniferous</b> and Permian rocks. The trackways, called batrachichni, are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments, suggesting the animals had some ties to the water.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Carboniferous</b> {{rainforest}} collapse amphibian dominance {{gave way}} to reptiles, and amphibians were further devastated by the Permian–Triassic extinction event. During the Triassic Period (250 to 200 million years ago), the reptiles continued to out-compete the amphibians, leading {{to a reduction in}} both the amphibians' size and their importance in the biosphere. According to the fossil record, Lissamphibia, which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage, may have branched off from the extinct groups Temnospondyli and Lepospondyli at some period between the Late <b>Carboniferous</b> and the Early Triassic. The relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating, but the most recent molecular study, based on multilocus sequence typing, suggests a Late Carboniferous/Early Permian origin for extant amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} <b>Carboniferous</b> rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The <b>Carboniferous</b> period has long been associated with thick, steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work is being done to better understand the fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E
5|$|At Middle Hope a {{sequence}} of <b>carboniferous</b> limestone is exposed, which includes thick volcanic tuffs and lavas, demonstrating Tournaisian carbonate sections. The site contains a Pleistocene-aged fossil cliff and shore platform. These features {{have led to the}} designation of Middle Hope as a regionally important geological site (RIGS).|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} fossil record, which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age Burgess Shale. Most of the major groups of crustaceans appear in the fossil record {{before the end of}} the Cambrian, namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including barnacles and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate as to whether or not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods, which would otherwise start in the Ordovician. The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no fossil record, and the Remipedia, which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the <b>Carboniferous.</b> Most of the early crustaceans are rare, but fossil crustaceans become abundant from the <b>Carboniferous</b> period onwards.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Devonian (400 million years ago) are all wingless, {{but by the}} <b>Carboniferous</b> (320 million years ago), more than 10 {{different}} genera of insects had fully functional wings. There is little preservation of transitional forms between the two periods. The earliest winged insects are from this time period (Pterygota), including the Blattoptera, Caloneurodea, primitive stem-group Ephemeropterans, Orthoptera and Palaeodictyopteroidea. Very early Blattopterans (during the <b>Carboniferous)</b> had a very large discoid pronotum and coriaceous forewings with a distinct CuP vein (an unbranched wing vein, lying near the claval fold and reaching the wing posterior margin). Even though the oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, estimated at 396–407 million years old, it possessed dicondylic mandibles, a feature associated with winged insects.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{amphibians}} (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) {{are classified}} in Lissamphibia. Lissamphibians {{appear to have}} arisen in the Permian. Molecular clock estimates place the first lissamphibian in the Late <b>Carboniferous,</b> but {{the first member of}} Batrachia (frogs and salamanders, but not caecilians) is estimated to have appeared in the Middle Permian using the same technique.|$|E
5|$|The {{central and}} {{southern}} section of the Peak District, where <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone is found {{at or near the}} surface, is known as the White Peak in contrast to the northern Dark Peak and the South West Peak, which are characterised by Millstone Grit outcrops and broad swathes of moorland.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecology of}} the area {{includes}} ancient woodland and calcareous grassland which supports nationally rare species including the Cheddar pink. The underlying rocks are <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone containing phreatic caves at Shute Shelve Cavern and Picken's Hole from which fossils dating from the Middle Devensian have been recovered.|$|E
5|$|The main {{geological}} {{component of}} the Mendips is <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone. It represents {{the remnants of a}} much higher range of hills that existed hundreds of millions years ago. This has allowed the formation of features such as Cheddar Gorge, Ebbor Gorge and Burrington Combe. There are a wide variety of caves and swallet holes caused by dissolution of the rock by water. Further east there are Silurian volcanoes, <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone outcrops, Variscan thrust tectonics, Permo-Triassic conglomerates, sediment-filled fissures, a classic unconformity, Jurassic clays and limestones, Cretaceous Greensand and chalk topped with Tertiary remnants including Sarsen Stones. These sediments have yielded a fairly rich fossil fauna of brachiopods and trilobites indicating that they were deposited in a shallow marine sea into which the lavas were extruded. The rocks are quarried at Moons Hill near Stoke St Michael for aggregate.|$|E
5|$|The town is near Haughmond Hill, a {{site where}} Precambrian rocks, {{some of the}} oldest rocks in the county can be found, and the town itself is sited on an area of largely <b>Carboniferous</b> rocks. A fault, the Hodnet Fault, starts {{approximately}} at the town, and runs as far as Market Drayton.|$|E
5|$|These {{earliest}} tetrapods {{were not}} terrestrial. The earliest confirmed terrestrial forms are {{known from the}} early <b>Carboniferous</b> deposits, some 20 million years later. Still, they may have spent very brief periods out of water and would have used their legs to paw {{their way through the}} mud.|$|E
5|$|Yates and Warren {{also named}} Dvinosauria, a clade of small aquatic temnospondyls from the <b>Carboniferous,</b> Permian, and Triassic. They placed Dvinosauria within Limnarchia, but more recent studies {{disagree}} on their position. For example, a 2007 study places {{them even more}} basal than euskelians, while a 2008 study keeps them as basal limnarchians.|$|E
5|$|A disused quarry at East Kirkton in the Bathgate Hills is the {{location}} where the <b>Carboniferous</b> fossil of Westlothiana lizziae (aka 'Lizzie') {{was found in}} 1984. This lizard {{is one of the}} earliest known ancestors of the reptiles. The specimen was purchased in part by public subscription and is now on display in the National Museum of Scotland. The site was originally discovered in the early 19th century and has also provided fossil eurypterids, sharks and a variety of primitive acanthodian fish.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis is {{all that}} remains of a Devonian volcano that met a cataclysmic end in the <b>Carboniferous</b> period around 350 million years ago. Evidence near the summit shows light-coloured granite (which had cooled in {{subterranean}} chambers several kilometres beneath the surface) lies among dark basaltic lavas (that only form on the surface). The two lying side-by-side is evidence the huge volcano collapsed in on itself creating an explosion comparable to Thera (2nd millennium BC) or Krakatoa (1883).|$|E
5|$|Bivalve fossils {{are formed}} when the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and <b>Carboniferous</b> periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.|$|E
5|$|Body {{impressions}} of Early <b>Carboniferous</b> temnospondyls from Pennsylvania {{suggest that some}} terrestrial temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians. They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water. The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the temnospondyls were gregarious. The head of one individual rests under the tail of another {{in what may be}} a courtship display. Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern salamanders.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{movements}} {{after the}} <b>Carboniferous</b> period {{resulted in the}} up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north–south axes. The region {{was raised in a}} north–south line which resulted in the dome-like shape and the shales and sandstones were worn away until limestone was exposed. At the end of this period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks.|$|E
5|$|Isopods first {{appeared}} in the fossil record during the <b>Carboniferous</b> period of the Paleozoic some 300 million years ago. They were primitive, short-tailed members of the suborder Phreatoicidea. At that time, Phreatoicideans were marine organisms with a cosmopolitan distribution. Nowadays, the members of this formerly widespread suborder form relic populations in freshwater environments in South Africa, India and Oceania, the greatest number of species being in Tasmania. Other primitive, short-tailed suborders include Asellota, Microcerberidea, Calabozoidea and the terrestrial Oniscidea.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. It is particularly poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the Late <b>Carboniferous</b> separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even existed at the time.|$|E
5|$|Made of <b>Carboniferous</b> Limestone, it is a {{continuation}} of the Mendip Hills. Two further continuations are the small islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. The cliffs on the northern and southern flanks of Brean Down have large quantities of fossils laid down in the marine deposits about 320–350 million years ago. The site has been occupied by humans since the late Bronze Age and includes the remains of a Romano-Celtic Temple. At the seaward end is Brean Down Fort which was built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War.|$|E
