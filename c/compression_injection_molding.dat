The purpose of this study was to compare the {{flexural strength}} of three different denture base resins fabricated by <b>compression</b> <b>molding,</b> <b>injection</b> <b>molding,</b> and pre-polymerized CAD/CAM milling. Three groups of ten PMMA acrylic denture base resins were processed into rectangular plates for total sample size of thirty (n= 30).
