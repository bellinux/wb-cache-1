5|$|The Art Nouveau Chadderton Baths was {{a public}} {{swimming}} facility opened in 1937. Henry Taylor, the British Olympic freestyle swimming triple gold medallist and champion was an attendant at Chadderton Baths where many of his awards were displayed. Chadderton Baths were closed indefinitely in 2006 after a structural survey found faults which could have put the public at risk. Chadderton Sports Centre, built onto the Baths, was closed and replaced by the Chadderton Wellbeing Centre in January 2010. An application to demolish the Baths was made in March 2011, but is now in private ownership with <b>conversion</b> <b>work</b> due soon. The Wellbeing Centre is a multi-purpose facility with a swimming pool, dance studio, library, gym, meeting rooms, and café.|$|E
5|$|As a carrier, {{the ship}} was {{to have had a}} {{complement}} of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 dive-bombers. She would have been armed with an anti-aircraft battery of ten 10.5cm SK C/33 guns in dual mounts, ten 3.7cm SK C/30 guns in dual mounts, and twenty-four 2cm Flak 38 guns in quadruple mounts. <b>Conversion</b> <b>work</b> was halted in June 1943, however, and the incomplete vessel was towed to Königsberg where she was eventually scuttled on 29 January 1945. The ship was seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sister ship Lützow, which had been purchased by the Soviet Navy before the war. This plan was also abandoned, and {{the ship was}} broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, the {{two ships}} made a {{daylight}} dash up the English Channel from occupied France to Germany. After reaching Kiel in early February, the ship went into drydock. On {{the night of}} 26 February, the British launched an air attack on the ship; one bomb penetrated her armored deck and exploded in the forward ammunition magazine, causing serious damage {{and a large number}} of casualties. The repairs necessitated by the damage were so time-consuming that it was determined to rebuild the ship to accommodate the 38cm guns as originally intended. The 28cm guns were removed and used as shore batteries. In 1943, Hitler ordered the cessation of <b>conversion</b> <b>work,</b> and on 27 March 1945, she was sunk as a blockship in Gotenhafen (Gdynia) in German-occupied Poland. She was eventually broken up for scrap in 1951.|$|E

5|$|The {{terms of}} the February 1922 Washington Naval Treaty forced the class' cancellation, but the two closest to {{completion}} (Amagi and Akagi) were saved from the scrappers by a provision that allowed two capital ships to be converted to aircraft carriers. However, the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake caused significant stress damage to the hull of Amagi. The structure was too heavily damaged to be usable, and <b>conversion</b> <b>work</b> was abandoned. Amagi was struck from the navy list and sold for scrapping, which began on 14 April 1924. The other two ships, Atago and Takao, were officially cancelled two years later (31 July 1924) and were broken up for scrap in their slipways. Akagi went on as an aircraft carrier {{to fight in the}} Second World War, where it was sunk after air attack during the Battle of Midway.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{effects were}} {{supervised}} by Tim Webber at the London-based VFX company Framestore, which {{was responsible for}} creating most of the film's visual effectsexcept for 17 shots. Framestore was also heavily involved in the art direction and, along with The Third Floor, the previsualization. Tim Webber stated that 80 percent of the movie consisted of CGcompared to James Cameron's Avatar (2009), which was 60 percent CG. To simulate the authenticity and reflection of unfiltered light in space, a manually controlled lighting system consisting of 1.8 million individually controlled LED lights was built. The 3D imagery was designed and supervised by Chris Parks. The majority of the 3D was created by stereo rendering the CG at Framestore. The remaining footage was converted into 3D in post-productionprincipally at Prime Focus, London, with additional <b>conversion</b> <b>work</b> by Framestore. Prime Focus's supervisor was Richard Baker.|$|E
5|$|Hessen {{served in}} the fleet from 1925 to 12 November 1934, when she was {{withdrawn}} and converted into a target ship. <b>Conversion</b> <b>work</b> lasted from 31 March 1935 to 1 April 1937, when she was recommissioned as a target. She served in this capacity until 1945; {{at the end of}} World War II, she was renamed Tsel and ceded to the Soviet Union. The ship was eventually scrapped in the 1960s. Preussen saw active service with the fleet as a minesweeper depot ship from 1919 to 5 April 1929, when she was stricken from the navy list. The ship was sold for breaking on 25 February 1931 for 216,800Mark, and scrapped in Wilhelmshaven. A 63m (68.9yd) section of the hull was kept for use as a torpedo target and other explosives. The hull section was bombed and sunk by Allied aircraft in April 1945. The wreck was eventually raised and scrapped in 1954. Lothringen was also converted into a minesweeper depot ship, and she served in this capacity from 1922 to 1926. The ship was stricken on 31 March 1931, sold for scrapping for 269,650Marks, and broken up by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.|$|E

40|$|As well {{as their}} {{intrinsic}} value, derived from factors such as their historical significance and meaning, redundant traditional rural working buildings {{have the potential for}} instrumental value through being economic assets that can accommodate alternative uses. The <b>conversion</b> <b>works</b> and subsequent re-use can impact upon the locality in terms of income generation and employment creation, thereby supporting local economic development. However, the extent of this local economic impact rests on the expenditure patterns of the building owner and user. Drawing on a mix of exogenous and endogenous growth theories, the study investigated the local economic impacts of converting and re-using redundant traditional rural working buildings. The focus was on the local economic impacts that were measurable spatially at the sub-regional level. The fieldwork was conducted with the collaborating partner, the National Trust, and primary data was collected from 30 traditional rural building conversion projects across England. The local economic impact of both the <b>conversion</b> <b>works</b> process and the subsequent re-use of the building were analysed. A modelling framework, drawing on the principles of Keynesian multiplier analysis and Local Multiplier 3 (LM 3) modelling, was used to generate a range of estimated income and employment multipliers according to distinguishing characteristics of the buildings. In total, 12 building <b>conversion</b> <b>works</b> and 14 building re-use models were produced. The building characteristics with the largest <b>conversion</b> <b>works</b> income multipliers included: animal housing buildings, listed buildings, and buildings converted for manufacturing purposes. For building re-use, the characteristics with the largest income multipliers included: animal housing buildings, Accommodation and Food Services SIC class and let buildings. A guidance document was produced based on the findings to aid the National Trust with the consideration of local economic impact in future traditional rural working building conversion projects...|$|R

5|$|With the {{commencement}} of hostilities between Japan and the British Empire, {{it became clear that}} the three hospital ships currently serving Australia—Manunda, Wanganella, and Oranje—would not be able to operate in the shallow waters typical of Maritime Southeast Asia, so a new hospital ship was required. Of the Australian Merchant Navy vessels able to operate in this region, none were suitable for conversion to a hospital ship, and a request to the British Ministry of Shipping placed Centaur at the disposal of the Australian military on 4 January 1943. The <b>conversion</b> <b>work</b> began on 9 January and Centaur was commissioned as an Australian Hospital Ship on 1 March. During her conversion, Centaur was painted with the markings of a hospital ship as detailed in Article 5 of the tenth Hague Convention of 1907 ("Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention"); white hull with a green band interspersed by three red crosses on each flank of the hull, white superstructure, multiple large red crosses positioned so that the ship's status would be visible from both sea and air, and an identification number (for Centaur, 47) on her bows. At night, the markings were illuminated by a combination of internal and external lights. Data on the ship's markings and the layout of identifying structural features was provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross during the first week of February 1943, who passed this on to the Japanese on 5 February. This information was also circulated and promoted by the press and media.|$|E
