25|$|On 5 November 1997, a Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340-300, G-VSKY, made an {{emergency}} landing following an undercarriage malfunction. Part of the undercarriage collapsed on landing, and both aircraft and runway were damaged. Recommendations made {{as a result of}} the accident included one that aircraft <b>cabin</b> <b>door</b> simulators should more accurately reproduce operating characteristics in {{an emergency}}, and another that cockpit voice recorders should have a two-hour duration in aircraft registered before April 1998.|$|E
25|$|Dan-Air Flight 240 was a fatal {{accident}} involving a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 series 2A turboprop aircraft operated by Dan Air Services Limited {{on the first}} stage of a night mail flight from London Gatwick Airport to East Midlands Airport. The crash, which occurred on 26 June 1981 near the village of Nailstone, Leicestershire, following major structural failure caused by the failure of a <b>cabin</b> <b>door,</b> resulted in the aircraft's destruction and the deaths of all three on board (both pilots and a cabin attendant).|$|E
25|$|Five {{crew members}} {{escaped from the}} cockpit through a 14-by-10-inch clear vision panel, and two more through a gash in the {{fuselage}} in the crew compartment, the sole survivors of the accident. Holes were cut in the fuselage through which a stewardess and two passengers were removed, but the latter died before reaching a hospital, and the stewardess died later of her injuries. No {{attempt was made to}} use the emergency exits, and the main <b>cabin</b> <b>door</b> was jammed; at the inquiry a fire expert attached to the RAF stated that the door of the Constellation was the most difficult he had had to open in his 24-year firefighting career.|$|E

25|$|Having {{broken through}} the barrier, the truck, driving in a zigzag fashion, knocked down random {{members of the}} crowd milling about on the {{pavement}} and in the three traffic lanes on the seaward side of the Promenade. The driver tried {{to stay on the}} pavement—returning to the traffic lanes only when blocked by a bus shelter or pavilion—thus increasing the number of deaths. After reaching the Hotel Negresco, the progress of the truck, already travelling more slowly, was further slowed down by a passing cyclist, whose attempts to open the <b>cabin</b> <b>door</b> were abandoned after being threatened with a gun through the window; followed by a motorcyclist, in pursuit from the Centre Universitaire Méditerranéen, who threw his scooter under the front wheels of the truck at the intersection with rue Meyerbeer, striking blows at the driver from the running board before being struck with the butt of the driver's gun, suffering moderate injuries from falling off the truck's side. The driver fired several shots at police from his 7.65mm firearm, close to the Hotel Negresco, as police arrived; they returned fire with their 9mm Sig Sauer handguns, gave chase to the vehicle and attempted to disable it.|$|E
500|$|The Spray reached New York City {{safely and}} sold its cargo for $500 {{in gold and}} bills. Foote {{returned}} to Guilford by other means. The Spray set course for Guilford and was seen at various points along the route. One night, she anchored near Norwalk, where cries of [...] "Murder!" [...] and [...] "Open the Cabin Door!" [...] were allegedly heard. Supposedly, Jackalow had locked the <b>cabin</b> <b>door</b> before dispatching Elijah on the deck. Elijah had yelled [...] "Murder!"; and Jonathan, [...] "Open the Cabin Door!" [...] Then, Jackalow {{was supposed to have}} shot Jonathan through the cabin skylight, thrown the bodies overboard, and searched the cabin for the money. Alone, Jackalow was further supposed to have sailed the Spray to South Brooklyn, purchased supplies, and then sailed south.|$|E

500|$|The 757-200, the {{original}} version of the aircraft, entered service with Eastern Air Lines in 1983. The type was produced with two different door configurations, both with three standard cabin doors per side: the baseline version has a fourth, smaller <b>cabin</b> <b>door</b> on each side aft of the wings, and is certified for a maximum capacity of 239, while the alternate version has a pair of over-the-wing emergency exits on each side, and can seat a maximum of 224. The 757-200 was offered with a MTOW of up to some airlines and publications have referred to higher gross weight versions with ETOPS certification as [...] "757-200ERs", but this designation is not used by the manufacturer. Similarly, versions with winglets are sometimes called [...] "757-200W" [...] or [...] "757-200WL". The first engine to power the 757-200, the Rolls-Royce RB211-535C, was succeeded by the upgraded RB211-535E4 in October 1984. Other engines used include the RB211-535E4B, along with the Pratt & Whitney PW2037 and PW2040. [...] Its range with full payload is [...]|$|E

2500|$|... "After {{clearing}} the baggage and cargo from the forward aircraft hold, {{it was evident}} that one passenger oxygen cylinder (number-4 from a bank of seven cylinders along {{the right side of the}} cargo hold) had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold, rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing-fuselage leading edge fairing. The cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge, puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main <b>cabin</b> <b>door.</b> The cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame, door handle and overhead panelling, before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hawk 4 had a steel {{rotor mast}} and engine {{mountings}} but was mostly aluminium elsewhere, including the rotor, rotor head and propeller. The fuselage was an aluminium semi-monocoque. [...] Some components, {{such as the}} nosecone, engine cowling and <b>cabin</b> <b>door</b> were formed from composite materials. [...] The rotor was a semi-rigid or teetering design with a swash plate, rotating at up to 270 rpm. [...] Yaw was jointly controlled by the balanced rudders on the endplate fins and the all-moving inboard rudders. [...] It had a fixed, tricycle undercarriage with mainwheels mounted at {{the tips of the}} stub wings. [...] Two rows of seats accommodated the pilot and up to three passengers; alternatively, the rear seats could be folded to provide baggage space.|$|E

The aircraft struck the ground at a shallow angle and then bounced for [...] before crashing into trees. Due to the empty fuel tanks, there was no post-crash fire. The forward fuselage {{as far back as}} the <b>cabin</b> <b>door</b> was torn open. The starboard side of the fuselage was also torn open when the aircraft swung violently to port. The tail of the aircraft was largely undamaged. All seats were torn from their anchorages in the floor of the aircraft, although seatbelts remained fastened. Two crew and three passengers were killed in the crash, which was the first for BOAC since 1944.|$|E
2500|$|Commonwealth {{departed}} New York on {{her usual}} run on December 28, 1865. Shortly after arriving at Groton, at about 1:30am {{on the morning}} of the 29th, a fire broke out at the Groton depot which could not be contained. An attempt to tow Commonwealth to safety was made by a local ferry, but an unusually low tide, combined with the weight of Commonwealths freight which was still aboard, had grounded the vessel on a sandbar, and Commonwealth caught fire at the bows and was burned to the water's edge. Fortunately, most of Commonwealths passengers had already disembarked and departed by train, but a young medical student named J. Dickson Ripley, a nephew of Connecticut Governor William A. Buckingham, could not be aroused despite repeated poundings on his <b>cabin</b> <b>door</b> and was presumed to have suffocated from smoke inhalation in his sleep.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{wreckage}} {{consisting of}} the forward fuselage, right wing, inner part of the left wing and number 2, 3 and 4 engines was badly burned.
