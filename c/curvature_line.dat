40|$|International audienceDesigners {{frequently}} draw <b>curvature</b> <b>lines</b> {{to convey}} bending of smooth surfaces in concept sketches. We present {{a method to}} extrapolate <b>curvature</b> <b>lines</b> in a rough concept sketch, recovering the intended 3 D curvature field and surface normal at each pixel of the sketch. This 3 D information allows us to enrich the sketch with 3 D-looking shading and texturing. We first introduce the concept of regularized <b>curvature</b> <b>lines</b> that model the lines designers draw over curved surfaces, encompassing <b>curvature</b> <b>lines</b> and their extension as geodesics over flat or umbilical regions. We build on this concept to define the orthogonal cross field that assigns two regularized <b>curvature</b> <b>lines</b> to each point of a 3 D surface. Our algorithm first estimates the projection of this cross field in the drawing, which is non-orthogonal due to foreshortening. We formulate this estimation as a scattered interpolation of the strokes drawn in the sketch, which makes our method robust to sketchy lines that are typical for design sketches. Our interpolation relies on a novel smoothness energy that we derive from our definition of regularized <b>curvature</b> <b>lines.</b> Optimizing this energy subject to the stroke constraints produces a dense non-orthogonal 2 D cross field, which we then lift to 3 D by imposing orthogonality. Thus, one central concept of our approach is the generalization of existing cross field algorithms to the non-orthogonal case. We demonstrate our algorithm {{on a variety of}} concept sketches with various levels of sketchiness. We also compare our approach with existing work that takes clean vector drawings as input...|$|R

We define some conformally {{invariant}} differential 1 -forms {{along the}} <b>curvature</b> <b>lines</b> of a hypersurface M and we observe that the ridges of M {{can be viewed}} as their zeros. We characterize the highest order ridges, which are isolated points generically, as zeros of these conformally invariant differential 1 -forms along special curves of ridges. We also prove that the highest order ridges are vertices of the <b>curvature</b> <b>lines</b> when they are considered as curves in n-space...|$|R
40|$|Discrete {{differential}} geometry aims to develop discrete equivalents of the geometric notions {{and methods of}} classical {{differential geometry}}. In this survey we discuss the following two fundamental Discretization Principles: the transformation group principle (smooth geometric objects and their discretizations are invariant {{with respect to the}} same transformation group) and the consistency principle (discretizations of smooth parametrized geometries can be extended to multidimensional consistent nets). The main concrete geometric problem discussed in this survey is a discretization of <b>curvature</b> <b>line</b> parametrized surfaces in Lie geometry. By systematically applying the Discretization Principles we find a discretization of <b>curvature</b> <b>line</b> parametrization which unifies the circular and conical nets...|$|E
40|$|In {{the search}} for {{appropriate}} discretizations of surface theory {{it is crucial to}} preserve such fundamental properties of surfaces as their invariance with respect to transformation groups. We discuss discretizations based on Möbius invariant building blocks such as circles and spheres. Concrete problems considered in these lectures include the Willmore energy as well as conformal and <b>curvature</b> <b>line</b> parametrizations of surfaces. In particular we discuss geometric properties of a recently found discrete Willmore energy. The convergence to the smooth Willmore functional is shown for special refinements of triangulations originating from a <b>curvature</b> <b>line</b> parametrization of a surface. Further we treat special classes of discrete surfaces such as isothermic and minimal. The construction of these surfaces is based on the theory of circle patterns, in particular on their variational description.

50|$|A third {{property}} {{which characterizes}} Dupin cyclides {{is that their}} <b>curvature</b> <b>lines</b> are all circles (possibly through the point at infinity). Equivalently, the curvature spheres, which are the spheres tangent to the surface with radii equal to the reciprocals of the principal curvatures {{at the point of}} tangency, are constant along the corresponding curvature lines: they are the tangent spheres containing the corresponding <b>curvature</b> <b>lines</b> as great circles. Equivalently again, both sheets of the focal surface degenerate to conics. It follows that any Dupin cyclide is a channel surface (i.e., the envelope of a one-parameter family of spheres) in two different ways, and this gives another characterization.|$|R

40|$|Given {{a smooth}} surface, a blue (red) ridge is a curve along which the maximum (minimum) {{principal}} curvature has an extremum along its <b>curvature</b> <b>line.</b> Ridges are curves of extremal curvature and encode important informations used in surface analysis or segmentation. But reporting the ridges of a surface requires manipulating {{third and fourth}} order derivatives whence numerical difficulties. Additionally, ridges have self-intersections and complex interactions with the umbilics of the surface whence topological difficulties. In this context, we make two contributions for the computation of ridges of polynomial parametric surfaces. First, by instantiating to the polynomial setting a global structure theorem of ridge curves proved in a companion paper, we develop the first certified algorithm to produce a topological approximation of the curve P encoding all the ridges of the surface. The algorithm exploits the singular structure of P umbilics and purple points, and reduces the problem to solving zero dimensional systems using Gröbner basis. Second, for cases where the zero-dimensional systems cannot be practically solved, we develop a certified plot algorithm at any fixed resolution. These contributions are respectively illustrated for Bezier surfaces of degree four and five...|$|E
40|$|Consider {{a smooth}} surface, and at each point {{which is not}} an umbilic, {{respectively}} paint in blue (red) anything related to the maximum (minimum) principal curvature. Given such a surface, a blue (red) ridge is a curve on the surface such that at each of its points, the principal blue (red) curvature has an extremum along its blue (red) <b>curvature</b> <b>line.</b> Ridges are curves of extremal curvature and therefore encode important informations used in segmentation, registration, matching and surface analysis. Surprisingly, no method developed so far to report ridges from a mesh approximating a smooth surface comes with a careful analysis, which entails that one does not know whether the ridges are reported in a coherent fashion. This paper aims at bridging this gap with the following contributions. First, a careful analysis of the Acute rule - an orientation procedure used in most algorithms - is presented. Second, given a triangulation $T$ approximating a smooth generic surface $S$, we present sufficient conditions on $T$ together with a certified algorithm reporting ridges in a topologically coherent fashion. Third, we develop an algorithm and a filtering procedure aiming at reporting the most salient features of a coarse mesh $T$...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe main notions {{concerning}} umbilics {{and lines}} of principal curvature, traditionally studied on surfaces in R 3, are extended {{in this paper}} to surfaces immersed in R 4. Departing from the classical second fundamental form and the ellipse of curvature of the immersion of a surface into R 4 here {{are studied in detail}} the concepts of a) axiumbilic points, analogous to classical umbilics since at them the ellipse of curvature has equal axes, and b) periodic lines of axial curvature, called here axial cycles, corresponding both to principal and mean curvature cycles in the classical R 3 case. To any immersed surface in R 4 its axial configurations: the principal configuration and the mean curvature configuration are associated. For surfaces in R 3, the first one reduces to the configuration by umbilics and principal lines, while the second one gives the configuration by umbilics and integral foliations of the mean <b>curvature</b> <b>line</b> fields. Also the notion of principal structural stability of immersions of surfaces into R 3 is extended to that of axial structural stability, for the case of surfaces in R 4. Sufficient conditions for the axial structural stability are provided in terms of axiumbilics, axial cycles and the asymptotic behavior of all the other lines of axial curvatur...|$|E
