Strong influences of the geometrical factor (ratio of distance between cylinders to cylinder diameter) and the Knudsen number on the flow structure (the shape of shock waves, the stagnation point location), skin friction, pressure distribution, lift and drag have been found. For small geometrical factors, the repulsive lift force becomes significant with a lift-drag ratio of 0. 35.

40|$|Abstract:The {{crankshaft}} accidents due to vibration become severe {{with increasing}} number of rows of reciprocating compressors. The crankshaft vibration needs to be studied thoroughly to promote development of the reciprocating compressor. Early calculations of crankshaft torsional vibration was mainly with discretization method, the crankshaft is discretized {{into a series of}} lumped inertia and lumped stiffness,then calculate the swing angle of crankshaft in the gas force and inertia force,but because of the simplified calculation,which has low precision. The currently calculation method of crankshaft torsional vibration is simplified into an equivalent system model,the model is composed of a lumped mass disc,massless elastic shaft and a damping. In calculation the torsional natural frequency and forced vibration usually adopt the Holzer method and transfer matrix method,due to this method only calculation the crankshaft torsional direction, so it can only obtained the crankshaft natural frequency and vibration characteristics in the direction. To make the crankshaft torsional vibration calculation more accurately,we proposed a new calculation model based on the flexible multibody dynamics theory. The process of the model establishment and solving by ADAMS was introduced. The torsional vibration of a crankshaft, which often suffers from the crankpin fracture,was calculated before and after the structure change. Results show that before the structure change,the crankshaft natural frequency was closed to the excitation frequency,so that the tortional vibration amplitude of the crankshaft is very large. The stress of piston pins in the first and second row increase so rapidly along the directionof the <b>cylinder</b> <b>center</b> <b>line</b> that the impact factor ofthe crank pin bearing reache the upper limit,thus the oil film of it is damaged. After the structure change,the natural frequency of crankshaft is away from the excitation frequency,the vibration amplitude of the crankshaft torsional vibration decrease substantially,and the crankpin fracture does not happen anymore. This is a successful validation of the proposed calculation method...|$|E
40|$|A unique {{feature of}} the shear system is the {{requirement}} for a removable master tool module and tool submodule assembly. Each tooling submodule is designed specifically to meet the compaction, gagging, and shearing requirements for specific spent fuel assemblies. These submodules are interchangeable within a common master tool module housing. The {{cross section of the}} spent fuel assemblies range from a 4. 575 -in. hexagonal shrouded to a 8. 75 -in. square grid-unshrouded. A number of interrelated initial design problems had to be solved: a hydraulic force system arrangement with minimum spacing between cylinders; readily removable couplings between the force system and associated tooling submodule; couplings with maximum stiffness and minimum geometry; a roller bearing system for each tool submodule and hydraulic stem assembly; and long life tool operation under high loads, wear, high temperaure, and corrosive conditions. It was established that the cylinder arrangement should consist of three 200 -ton, 10 -in. dia tandem cylinders, and one 100 -ton, 10 -in. dia standard cylinder at 3000 psi operating pressure. The shear would be operated by two - 200 ton tandem cylinders in a vertical straddle mode about the horizontal <b>center</b> <b>line</b> of the tooling arrangement. The compactor would be operated by one - 200 ton tandem <b>cylinder</b> at the <b>center</b> <b>line</b> of the fuel assembly and tooling arrangement.

Later in 1917, the same line was continued west of Crown Point. Rexford first conceived the idea of a yellow <b>center</b> <b>line</b> in early 1917 while riding on a bus from Salem, Oregon on a dark and rainy night, and advocated it as a safety measure on the Columbia River Highway, which Rexford patrolled as a traffic officer. When Multnomah County declined to fund the project, Rexford's boss, Chief Deputy Martin T. Pratt (later elected Sheriff), paid for the paint out of his own pocket so that the <b>center</b> <b>line</b> could be painted. Rexford later described the April 1917 line as the [...] "first yellow <b>center</b> <b>line</b> ever painted on pavement" [...] in the United States. An article published in The Oregonian upon Rexford's retirement claimed that a contest with a $10,000 reward was once held to determine the originator of the highway <b>center</b> <b>line,</b> but the contest was scrapped when information from Europe revealed that ancient civilizations had used white bricks to mark the <b>center</b> <b>lines</b> of their streets.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{deals with}} the effects of a blowing ratio {{measured}} with narrowband liquid crystal in transonic experiments on the heat transfer characteristics of trailing edge cutback. The experimental results are compared and contrasted in terms of available data for traditional experiments with thermocouples. It is concluded that the blowing ratio exerts rather significant effects on film cooling effectiveness distribution of the rib <b>center</b> <b>line.</b> As the blowing ratio decreases, similar to the cooling effectiveness distribution curve of the slot <b>center</b> <b>line,</b> that of the rib <b>center</b> <b>line</b> makes a clockwise rotation about the end. When the blowing ratio increases, the regular film cooling effectiveness curve of the surface becomes rather smooth. On the whole measuring surface, the most intensive heat transfer occurs at the extended borderline of the slot and the rib, neither at the rib <b>center</b> <b>line</b> nor at the slot <b>center</b> <b>line.</b> The experimental results of cooling effectiveness measured with thermocouples are lower than those with liquid crystal. In addition, the transient experiments using narrowband liquid crystal can eliminate the higher errors of Nusselt numbers in measurements with thermocouples at the slot outlet...|$|R
