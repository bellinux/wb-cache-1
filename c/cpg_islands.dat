25|$|In mammals, {{the only}} {{exception}} for this global CpG depletion resides in a specific category of GC- and CpG-rich sequences termed <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> that are generally unmethylated and therefore retained the expected CpG content. <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> are usually defined as regions with 1) a length greater than 200bp, 2) a G+C content greater than 50%, 3) a ratio of observed to expected CpG greater than 0.6, although other definitions are sometimes used. Excluding repeated sequences, there are around 25,000 <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> in the human genome, 75% of which being less than 850bp long. They are major regulatory units and around 50% of <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> are located in gene promoter regions, while another 25% lie in gene bodies, often serving as alternative promoters. Reciprocally, around 60-70% of human genes have a CpG island in their promoter region. The majority of <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> are constitutively unmethylated and enriched for permissive chromatin modification such as H3K4 methylation. In somatic tissues, only 10% of <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> are methylated, {{the majority of them}} being located in intergenic and intragenic regions.|$|E
25|$|Similar to mammals, {{chickens}} seem to use <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> (segments of Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine {{that are}} more readily methylated and silenced than other DNA segments) to regulate gene expression. One study found that <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> were found primarily in compensated areas of the Z chromosome—areas that are differentially expressed in male and female chickens. Thus {{it is likely that}} these <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> are locations where genes on the male Z chromosome are methylated and silenced, but which stay functional on the female Z chromosome.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} about 60% of human protein coding genes are {{regulated}} by miRNAs. Many miRNAs are epigenetically regulated. About 50% of miRNA genes {{are associated with}} <b>CpG</b> <b>islands,</b> that may be repressed by epigenetic methylation. Transcription from methylated <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> is strongly and heritably repressed. Other miRNAs are epigenetically regulated by either histone modifications or by combined DNA methylation and histone modification.|$|E
40|$|<b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> {{methylation}} {{plays an}} important role in normal cellular processes, such as genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation, as well as in abnormal processes, such as neoplasia. However, the dynamics of de novo <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation, during which a <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> is converted from an unmethylated, active state to a densely methylated, inactive state, are largely unknown. It is unclear whether the development of de novo <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation is a progressive process, in which a subset of CpG sites are initially methylated with a subsequent increase in methylation density, or a single event, in which the initial methylation event encompasses the entire <b>CpG</b> <b>island.</b> The tumor suppressor gene p 16 /CDKN 2 a/INK 4 a (p 16) is inactivated by <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation during neoplastic progression in a variety of human cancers. We investigated the development of methylation in the p 16 <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> in primary human mammary epithelial cell strains during escape from mortality stage 0 (M 0) growth arrest. The methylation status of 47 CpG sites in the p 16 <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> on individual DNA molecules was determined by sequencing PCR clones of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA. The p 16 <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> was initially methylated at a subset of sites in three discrete regions in association with p 16 transcriptional repression and escape from M 0 growth arrest. With continued passage, methylation gradually increased in density and methylation expanded to sites in adjacent regions. Thus, de novo methylation in the p 16 <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> is a progressive process that is neither site specific nor completely random but instead is region specific. Our results suggest that early detection of methylation in the <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> of the p 16 gene will require methylation analysis of the three regions and that the identification of region-specific methylation patterns in other genes may be essential for an accurate assessment of methylation-mediated transcriptional silencing...|$|R
40|$|Background: PTEN is an {{important}} tumour suppressor gene that is mutated in Cowden syndrome as well as various sporadic cancers. <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> hypermethylation is another route to tumour suppressor gene inactivation, however, the literature regarding PTEN hypermethylation in cancer is controversial. Furthermore, investigation of the methylation status of the PTEN <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> is challenging due to sequence homology with the PTEN pseudogene, PTENP 1. PTEN shares a <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> promoter with another gene known as KLLN. Here we present a thorough reinvestigation of the methylation status of the PTEN <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> in DNA from colorectal, breast, ovarian, glioma, lung and haematological cancer cell lines. Results: Using a range of bisulphite-based PCR assays we investigated 6 regions across the PTEN <b>CpG</b> <b>island.</b> We found that regions 1 - 4 were not methylated in cancer cell lines (0 / 36). By allelic bisulphite sequencing and pyrosequencing methylation was detected in regions 5 and 6 in colorectal, breast and haematological cancer cell lines. However, methylation detected in this region {{was associated with the}} PTENP 1 promoter and not the PTEN <b>CpG</b> <b>island.</b> Conclusions: We show that methylation of the PTEN <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> is a rare event in cancer cell lines and that apparent methylation most likely originates from homologous regions of the PTENP 1 pseudogene promoter. Future studies should utilize assays that reliably discriminate between PTEN and PTENP 1 to avoid data misinterpretation...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigated}} whether sall 3 transcription was {{regulated by}} promoter <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> hypermethylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: The cell lines Huh 7, HepG 2, SK-HEP 1, SMMC 7721, Bel 7402, QGY 7703 and {{a cohort of}} 38 HCC tissue specimens and corresponding nontumorous tissues were subjected to analysis for sall 3 promoter <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation and mRNA transcription. sall 3 promoter <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation levels were determined using the MassARRAY platform and mRNA transcription levels of the gene were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The levels of sall 3 mRNA were decreased by more than twofold in 33 of 38 tumor tissues compared to adjacent noncancerous tissues. Among these 33 tumor tissues {{with lower levels of}} sall 3 mRNA, 24 showed higher levels of methylation. Based on these results, we hypothesized that the decrease in sall 3 mRNA transcription level was likely due to promoter <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> hypermethylation. Changes in sall 3 mRNA transcription and promoter <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation were determined in the above six cell lines after treatment with 0, 0. 1, 0. 5 and 2. 5 &#x 3 BC;mol 5 -aza- 2 -deoxycytidine, a demethylating agent. Promoter <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner in all six cell lines, while the mRNA transcription level increased dose-dependently in Huh 7, HepG 2, SK-HEP 1 and SMMC 7721 cells and irregularly in Bel 7402 and QGY 7703 cells. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that promoter <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> hypermethylation contributes to the downregulation of sall 3 mRNA transcription in HCC...|$|R

25|$|Methylation-specific PCR (MSP): {{developed}} by Stephen Baylin and Jim Herman at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, {{and is used}} to detect methylation of <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> in genomic DNA. DNA is first treated with sodium bisulfite, which converts unmethylated cytosine bases to uracil, which is recognized by PCR primers as thymine. Two PCRs are then carried out on the modified DNA, using primer sets identical except at any <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> within the primer sequences. At these points, one primer set recognizes DNA with cytosines to amplify methylated DNA, and one set recognizes DNA with uracil or thymine to amplify unmethylated DNA. MSP using qPCR can also be performed to obtain quantitative rather than qualitative information about methylation.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{was probably}} present at some extent in very early eukaryote ancestors. In virtually every organism analyzed, methylation in promoter regions correlates negatively with gene expression. CpG-dense promoters of actively transcribed genes are never methylated, but reciprocally transcriptionally silent genes {{do not necessarily}} carry a methylated promoter. In mouse and human, around 60–70% of genes have a CpG island in their promoter region {{and most of these}} <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> remain unmethylated independently of the transcriptional activity of the gene, in both differentiated and undifferentiated cell types. Of note, whereas DNA methylation of <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> is unambiguously linked with transcriptional repression, the function of DNA methylation in CG-poor promoters remains unclear; albeit {{there is little evidence that}} it could be functionally relevant.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of aberrant <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation in oncogenesis {{are not fully}} characterized. In particular, {{little is known about}} the {{mechanisms of}} inhibition of <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation. Here we show that sal-like 3 (SALL 3) is a novel inhibitory factor for DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT 3 A). SALL 3 binds to DNMT 3 A by a direct interaction between the double zinc finger motif of SALL 3 and the PWWP domain of DNMT 3 A. SALL 3 expression reduces DNMT 3 A-mediated <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation in cell culture and in vitro. <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation is enhanced in SALL 3 -depleted cells. Consistently, DNMT 3 A from SALL 3 -depleted cells increases methyltransferase activity in vitro. Binding of DNMT 3 A to chromatin is reduced or increased by SALL 3 expression or depletion, respectively, accounting for the mechanism by which SALL 3 inhibits DNMT 3 A-mediated <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> methylation. We also show that SALL 3 is inducible by BMP- 4 and silenced by associated DNA methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our results suggest that silencing of SALL 3 results in acceleration of DNA methylation in HCC. This functional characterization of SALL 3 sheds light on regulatory mechanisms for DNMT 3 A and provides new strategies to inhibit aberrant methylation in cancer...|$|R

25|$|In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene {{promoter}} <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> acquire abnormal hypermethylation, {{which results in}} transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as {{an important component of}} cancer development. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing, but might be a target for epigenetic therapy.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} frequently {{occurs in}} repeated sequences, {{and helps to}} suppress the expression and mobility of 'transposable elements': Because 5-methylcytosine can be spontaneously deaminated (replacing nitrogen by oxygen) to thymidine, CpG sites are frequently mutated and become rare in the genome, except at <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> where they remain unmethylated. Epigenetic changes of this type thus {{have the potential to}} direct increased frequencies of permanent genetic mutation. DNA methylation patterns are known to be established and modified in response to environmental factors by a complex interplay of at least three independent DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, the loss of any of which is lethal in mice. DNMT1 is the most abundant methyltransferase in somatic cells, localizes to replication foci, has a 10–40-fold preference for hemimethylated DNA and interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).|$|E

40|$|Regulatory T cells (T reg cells) are a {{population}} of CD 4 + T cells that limit immune responses. FoxP 3 is a master control transcription factor for development and function of these cells, but its regulation is poorly understood. We have identified a T cell receptor–responsive enhancer in the FoxP 3 first intron that is dependent on a cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) /activating transcription factor (ATF) site overlapping a <b>CpG</b> <b>island.</b> Methylation of this island inversely correlates with CREB binding and FoxP 3 expression. Interestingly, transforming growth factor-β, which induces T reg cell formation, decreases methylation of the <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> and increases FoxP 3 expression. Similarly, inhibiting methylation with 5 -azacytidine or knocking down the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt 1 also induces FoxP 3 expression. Conversely, methylation of the <b>CpG</b> <b>island,</b> which decreases CREB binding or expression of dominant-negative CREB, decreases FoxP 3 gene expression.

25|$|Another {{gene that}} {{experiences}} {{a change in}} methylation status in atherosclerosis is the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT3), which produces a protein responsible for the transport of lactate and other ketone bodies out of many cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells. In atherosclerosis patients, there {{is an increase in}} methylation of the <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> in exon 2, which decreases MCT3 protein expression. The down regulation of MCT3 impairs lactate transport, and significantly increases smooth muscle cell proliferation, which further contributes to the atherosclerotic lesion. An ex vivo experiment using the demethylating agent Decitabine (5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine) was shown to induce MCT3 expression in a dose dependant manner, as all hypermethylated sites in the exon 2 CpG island became demethylated after treatment. This may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to treat atherosclerosis, although no human studies have been conducted thus far.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the cell}} types {{targeted}} for DNA methylation polymorphisms are monocytes and lymphocytes, which experience an overall hypomethylation. One proposed mechanism behind this global hypomethylation is elevated homocysteine levels causing hyperhomocysteinemia, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. High plasma levels of homocysteine inhibit DNA methyltransferases, which causes hypomethylation. Hypomethylation of DNA affects gene that alter smooth muscle cell proliferation, cause endothelial cell dysfunction, and increase inflammatory mediators, {{all of which are}} critical in forming atherosclerotic lesions. High levels of homocysteine also result in hypermethylation of <b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b> in the promoter region of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) gene, causing its down regulation. ERα protects against atherosclerosis due to its action as a growth suppressor, causing the smooth muscle cells to remain in a quiescent state.

The majority of CpG pairs in mammals are chemically modified by the covalent attachment of a methyl group to the C5 position of the cytosine ring.

Large genomic fragments incorporating the <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> {{region of the}} HNRPA 2 B 1 locus are resistant to transcriptional silencing. Results In this report we describe studies {{on the use of}} a novel series of vectors combining the HNRPA 2 B 1 <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> with the hCMV promoter for expression of transgenes in CHO-K 1 cells. We show that the <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> gives at least twenty-fold increases in the levels of EGFP and EPO observed in pools of transfectants, and that transgene expression levels remain high in such pools for more than 100 generations. These novel vectors also allow facile isolation of clonal CHO-K 1 cell lines showing stable, high-level transgene expression. Conclusion Vectors incorporating the hnRPA 2 B 1 <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> give major benefits in transgene expression from the hCMV promoter, including substantial improvements in the level and stability of expression.

WT 1 expression correlates with hypomethylation of the <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> in Intron 1, and pharmacologic demethylation of this <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> induces WT 1 mRNA expression. Hypoxia causes decreases in DNMT expression and activity and increased expression and activity of TET 2 and TET 3, resulting in demethylation of this <b>CpG</b> <b>island</b> and expression of WT 1 mRNA.

In addition, this is the first report that TET 2 and TET 3, increasingly recognized as important epigenetic regulators of gene expression in stem cells and in cancer cells, can be regulated by hypoxia, providing a solid mechanistic link between hypoxia and epigenetic regulation of gene expression with important implications for the role of hypoxia in stem cell function...|$|R
