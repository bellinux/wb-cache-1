The transformation function is the quantile function of the normal distribution, i.e., the inverse of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution.</b> It is, in fact, the same transformation as zROC, below, except that the complement of the hit rate, the miss rate or false negative rate, is used. This alternative spends more graph area on the region of interest. Most of the ROC area is of little interest; one primarily cares about the region tight against the y-axis and the top left corner – which, because of using miss rate instead of its complement, the hit rate, is the lower left corner in a DET plot. Furthermore, DET graphs have the useful property of linearity and a linear threshold behavior for normal distributions. The DET plot is used extensively in the automatic speaker recognition community, where the name DET was first used. The analysis of the ROC performance in graphs with this warping of the axes was used by psychologists in perception studies halfway through the 20th century, where this was dubbed [...] "double probability paper".|$|E

Pollen survival curves conformed much more closely to negative <b>cumulative</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> than to negative exponential relations. Estimates ofp 50 (storage period required to reduce pollen viability to 50 %), provided by negative <b>cumulative</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions,</b> were available from 37 different storage environments in which pollen viability was reduced below 50 %. Once observations at 0. 5 % and 5. 5 % relative humidity were excluded from analysis, there was a negative logarithmic relation between these estimates of longevity and pollen moisture content (%, wet basis) and a curvilinear semi-logarithmic relation between longevity and temperature. When the negative logarithmic relation between longevity and moisture content {{was replaced by a}} negative semi-logarithmic relation between longevity and the relative humidity of the storage environment the resultant model was less satisfactory, principally because pollen longevity over saturated solutions of calcium nitrate (43 – 62 % relative humidity) and sodium nitrite (60 – 66 % relative humidity) were consistently greater and smaller, respectively, than fitted values. Notwithstanding these errors, comparison between the fitted relations and observations at the two lowest relative humidities provided estimates of the lower-relative-humidity limits to these relations. These provisional estimates varied with storage temperature being lowest at 25 °C ( 0. 25) : the mean estimate was 11. 9 (s. e. = 1. 4) %.
