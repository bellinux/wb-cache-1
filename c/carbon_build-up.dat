2500|$|MCFCs hold several {{advantages}} over other fuel cell technologies, including their resistance to impurities. They are not prone to [...] "carbon coking", {{which refers to}} <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up</b> on the anode that results in reduced performance by slowing down the internal fuel reforming process. Therefore, carbon-rich fuels like gases made from coal are compatible with the system. The Department of Energy claims that coal, itself, might even be a fuel option in the future, assuming the system can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal into hydrogen. MCFCs also have relatively high efficiencies. They can reach a fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 50%, considerably higher than the 37–42% efficiency of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant.

50|$|Although direct {{injection}} provides {{more power and}} efficiency, a <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up</b> occurs in the intake valves that over time reduces the airflow to the cylinders, and therefore reduces power. Fuel contains various detergents and can keep the intakes clean. When fuel is no longer being sprayed in the intake valves, small amounts of dirt from intake air and blowback carbon from the crankcase ventilation system cakes on the intake walls, even with air filters that prevent most of the dirt from entering the cylinder. This build-up can become severe enough that a piece can break off and {{has been known to}} burn holes in catalytic converters. It can also cause sporadic ignition failures. These problems have been known for some time and technologies have been improved to reduce the <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Around 1620, in England, Cornelius Drebbel made {{an early}} oar-powered submarine. To re-oxygenate the air inside it, he likely {{generated}} oxygen by heating saltpetre (potassium nitrate) {{in a metal}} pan to emit oxygen. Heating turns the saltpetre into potassium oxide or hydroxide, which absorbs carbon dioxide from the air. That may explain why Drebbel's men were not affected by <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>build-up</b> as much as would be expected. If so, he accidentally made a crude rebreather {{more than two centuries}} before Saint Simon Sicard's patent.|$|R
50|$|Diesel engines {{can suffer}} damage {{as a result}} of misapplication or misuse, such as {{internal}} glazing (occasionally referred to as bore glazing or piling) and <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up.</b> Ideally, diesel engines should be run at least 60% to 75% of their maximum rated load. Short periods of low load running are permissible providing the set is brought up to full load, or close to full load on a regular basis. Another potential problem is cylinder cavitation and erosion.|$|E
50|$|Internal glazing and <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up</b> {{is due to}} {{prolonged}} {{periods of}} running at low speeds or low loads. Such conditions may occur when an engine is left idling as a 'standby' generating unit, ready to run up when needed, (misuse); if the engine powering the set is over-powered (misapplication) for the load applied to it, causing the diesel unit to be under-loaded, or as is very often the case, when sets are started and run off load as a test (misuse).|$|E
50|$|The forward assist {{may cause}} the {{cartridge}} to become jammed, requiring a cleaning rod {{to be pushed}} into the muzzle of the rifle to force the casing {{back out of the}} chamber. The high pressure of a round getting hung up when fired could potentially cause an explosion in the rifle. One recommendation is to avoid using the forward assist, and instead dispose of the shell that wouldn't seat properly. The main reason a bolt carrier group (BCG) won't go fully forward is usually an excessive amount of dirt, <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up,</b> etc.|$|E

For Weaver and Hamaker, a new glacial period, one in a long series of glacial periods, was due in the geological and glacial-interglacial cycle timeframe. Weaver explained that Hamaker was convinced that humanity was rushing into the next glacial period due to <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>build-up</b> after the normal interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession, as summarized by Johannes Iversen and Svend Andersen, State Geologists from Denmark in the book The Holocene by Neil Roberts.|$|R
50|$|Clearcutting {{can destroy}} an area's {{ecological}} integrity {{in a number}} of ways, including: the destruction of buffer zones which reduce the severity of flooding by absorbing and holding water; the immediate removal of forest canopy, which destroys the habitat for many rainforest-dependent insects and bacteria; the removal of forest carbon sinks, leading to global warming through the increased human-induced and natural <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>build-up</b> in the atmosphere; the elimination of fish and wildlife species due to soil erosion and habitat loss; the removal of underground worms, fungi and bacteria that condition soil and protect plants growing in it from disease; the loss of small-scale economic opportunities, such as fruit-picking, sap extraction, and rubber tapping; and the destruction of aesthetic values and recreational opportunities.|$|R

50|$|These {{problems}} were fixed by the PVAR rifle's system. Where in the Direct Gas Impingement System pressurized gas is {{used throughout the}} operating cycle, the UDMC PVAR System utilizes instead mechanical energy for more effective and more reliable cycling. The UDMC PVAR System prevents much heat, <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up,</b> un-burned powder, and dirt from being deposited inside the bolt assembly and the bolt carrier group, resulting in cleaner and cooler operation, less downtime for cleaning and repair, and considerably longer life span of the rifle. It can fire underwater and even accept successfully drum magazines.|$|E
50|$|Tell-tale {{signs of}} such {{eventual}} related damage are a white foam that {{appears on the}} inside of the oil filler cap and the gradually increasing loss of antifreeze coolant (due to seepage into the intake passages which will lead to engine lock up failure in such cases). External seepage is also found near the valley edge of the lower intake manifold. These engines are also known for problematic EGR Valves in which <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up</b> occurs very rapidly, therefore reducing gas mileage drastically, however without affecting the reliability of the engine.|$|E
50|$|Once glazing or carbon {{build up}} has occurred, {{it can only}} be cured by {{stripping}} down the engine and re-boring the cylinder bores, machining new honing marks and stripping, cleaning and de-coking combustion chambers, fuel injector nozzles and valves. If the problem is detected in its early stages, running an engine at maximum load to raise the internal pressures and temperatures allows the piston rings to scrape glaze off the bores and allows <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up</b> to be burnt off. However, if glazing has been allowed to progress to the stage where the piston rings have seized into their grooves, this will not have any effect.|$|E

In all experiments, warming stimulated in particular heterotrophic bacterial processes and had an accelerating effect on the temporal development of phytoplankton blooms. This was also mirrored in the build-up and partitioning of organic matter between particulate and dissolved phases. Thus, warming increased both the magnitude and rate of dissolved organic <b>carbon</b> (DOC) <b>build-up,</b> whereas the accumulation of particulate organic carbon (POC) and phosphorus (POP) decreased with rising temperature. In concert, the observed temperature-mediated changes in biogeochemical components suggest strong shifts in the functioning of marine pelagic food webs and the ocean’s biological carbon pump, hence providing potential feedback mechanisms to Earth’s climate system...|$|R

5000|$|Longevity, as {{demonstrated}} in early automotive applications of the Knight engine. Prior to the advent of leaded gasolines, poppet-valve engines typically required grinding of the valves and valve seats after 20,000 to 30,000 miles (32,000 to 48,000 km) of service. Sleeve valves did not suffer from the wear and recession caused by the repetitive impact of the poppet valve against its seat. Sleeve valves were also subjected to less intense heat build-up than poppet valves, owing to their greater area of contact with other metal surfaces. In the Knight engine, <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up</b> actually helped to improve the sealing of the sleeves, the engines being said to [...] "improve with use", in contrast to poppet valve engines, which lose compression and power as valves, valve stems and guides wear. Due to the continuous motion of the sleeve (Burt-McCollum type), the high wear points linked to poor lubrication in the TDC/BDC (bottom dead centre) of piston travel within the cylinder are suppressed, so rings and cylinders lasted much longer.|$|E
50|$|The Dragunov is a semi-automatic, gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke gas-piston system. The barrel breech {{is locked}} through a {{rotating}} bolt (left rotation) and uses three locking lugs to engage corresponding locking recesses in the barrel extension. The rifle has a manual, two-position gas regulator. A gas regulator meters {{the portion of}} the combustion gases fed into the action in order to cycle the weapon and sets the recoil velocity of the gas-piston system. The gas regulator can be set {{with the help of the}} rim of a cartridge. The normal position #1 leaves a gas escape port opened in the form of a hole that lets some combustion gas escape during cycling. Position #2 closes the gas escape port and directs extra combustion gas to the piston increasing the recoil velocity of the gas-piston system and felt recoil. It is used for when the rifle does not reliably cycle due to <b>carbon</b> fouling <b>build-up</b> in the gas port, when shooting in extreme cold or high altitude or using low powered ammunition.|$|R

40|$|At NASA, {{there exists}} no {{standardized}} design or testing protocol for spacecraft {{fire suppression systems}} (either handheld or total flooding designs). An extinguisher's efficacy in safely suppressing any reasonable or conceivable fire is the primary benchmark.

While there exists the temptation to over-size' the fire extinguisher, weight and volume considerations on spacecraft will always (justifiably) push for the minimum size extinguisher required. This paper attempts to address the question of extinguisher size by examining how large a fire a crew member could successfully survive and extinguish in the confines of a spacecraft. The hazards to the crew and equipment during an accidental fire include excessive pressure rise resulting in a catastrophic rupture of the vehicle skin, excessive temperatures that burn or incapacitate the crew (due to hyperthermia), <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>build-up</b> or other accumulation of other combustion products (e. g. carbon monoxide).

50|$|When {{filling a}} {{kerosene}} heater, {{there is an}} opportunity for the fuel to vaporize and create an odour in the air. This is why it is important to fill the heater in a garage or outdoors. When a kerosene heater is first ignited, it takes a few seconds to a few minutes for the fuel to mix with the air in the perfect ratio for complete combustion. During that time, the fuel to air mixture is quite rich. This results in a small amount of unburned kerosene, thus creating an odour. A common strategy is to light the heater outdoors, on the patio for example, until the fumes dissipate, and then bring it indoors. Once the heater is burning normally, no additional odour is created. An improperly adjusted wick also causes smoke and odour. This is corrected by adjusting the wick-height. A wick with <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up</b> will also cause odour and should be replaced. Odour may also be apparent when the heater is extinguished. The wick holder remains quite warm, and as the wick continues to draw kerosene, it causes vaporization of the fuel which is detected as odour.|$|E
50|$|The MCA-Jet {{system has}} a small third valve {{separate}} from the intake and exhaust valves. Separate passages in the intake manifold feed each MCA-Jet valve. Since these passages are smaller than the main intake manifold passages, the air/fuel mixture must move faster. When the faster moving air/fuel mixture from the MCA-Jet valve hits the slower moving air/fuel mixture from the intake valve, a strong air swirling effect occurs that promotes more complete combustion. With MCA-Jet {{it was found that}} stable combustion could be obtained even with large amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), NOx could be reduced, and combustion improved. Honda's CVCC Stratified charge engine approach also used a small third valve, but sent a richer air/fuel mixture to a small pre-combustion chamber near the spark plug, to help ignite a leaner air/fuel mixture in the main combustion chamber. MCA-Jet was a simpler system that sent the same air/fuel mixture to all intake and MCA-Jet valves. Each MCA-Jet valve is quite small and may be prone to <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up,</b> causing the MCA-Jet valve(s) to stick open. If a Mitsubishi-designed engine has low compression, the MCA-Jet valve(s) could be the cause. Fortunately, each MCA-Jet valve and valve seat are a self-contained cylinder-shaped unit that screws into the cylinder head for easy replacement. Aftermarket MCA-Jet valves are available. With the advent of 4-valve-per-cylinder engines, manufacturers typically design the camshaft(s) to open one intake valve slightly before the other to create a swirling effect. This has made the MCA-Jet system obsolete. The MCA-Jet system was used in certain Mitsubishi-designed engines installed in both Mitsubishi-branded and Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth-branded vehicles during the late 1970s to late 1980's.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Kaibo in southern Burkina Faso on an Eutric Cambisol during the 2000 rainy season to assess the interaction of organic amendment quality and soil fauna, affecting soil organic carbon and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) performance. Plots were treated with the pesticides Dursban and Endosulfan to exclude soil fauna or left untreated. Sub-treatments consisted of surface-placed maize straw (C/N ratio= 58), Andropogon straw (C/N ratio= 153), cattle dung (C/N ratio= 40), sheep dung (C/N ratio= 17) or compost (C/N ratio= 10) and the control. Organic amendments were applied at a dose equivalent to the application of 40 kg N ha(- 1). The presence of soil fauna increased soil total carbon by 32 % and grain yield production by 50 %. The interaction between high C/N ratio organic amendment, Andropogon straw (SA), and soil fauna reduced soil <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up.</b> We suggest that {{this is due to}} a priming effect of SA on soil organic matter in the presence of soil fauna. We also suggest that the interaction between soil fauna and easily decomposable organic amendment led to the smallest decrease in soil <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up.</b> It is concluded that in semi-arid West Africa, in the presence of soil fauna, soil <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up</b> is more affected by the quality of organic amendments than the quantity of carbon inputs. Sorghum grain yield production was significantly reduced in the absence of soil fauna. High C/N ratio organic amendment interacted negatively with soil fauna in its effects on crop performance. We propose that the effect of soil fauna on soil <b>carbon</b> <b>build-up</b> and crop performance can be optimised by using high quality organic matter of supplementing low-quality organic matter with inorganic nitrogen in semi-arid West Africa...|$|E
40|$|Vegetation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{spatially}} and temporally dynamic reservoirs of carbon in the world. The amount of carbon stored in vegetation above ground in woody biomass is particularly variable, and is subject to rapid change via land uses that remove vegetation cover, causing carbon emissions. Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, as well as from other non-forested ecosystems, is therefore a priority in both national and international strategies to conserve ecosystems and to reduce <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>build-up</b> in the atmosphere. Perú harbors an enormous range of ecological conditions, from hot and humid lowland Amazonian forests to high-altitude Andean ecosystems and desert conditions on the Pacific coast.

The previous work introduced a simplified model that treated the fire primarily as a source of heat and combustion products and sink for oxygen prescribed (input to the model) based on terrestrial standards. The model further treated the spacecraft as a closed system with no capability to vent to the vacuum of space. The model in the present work extends this analysis to more realistically treat the pressure relief system(s) of the spacecraft, include more combustion products (e. g. HF) in the analysis and attempt to predict the fire spread and limiting fire size (based on knowledge of terrestrial fires and the known characteristics of microgravity fires) rather than prescribe them in the analysis.

Environmental impacts are particularly pronounced {{in terms of}} <b>carbon</b> footprint <b>build-up</b> while societal impacts are reflected in often unhealthy food choice. These impacts should be minimised to facilitate progress of the sector towards sustainability. A significant share of the negative impacts from food service provision is attributed to irresponsible consumer choice which needs to be architected and made more society- and climate-benign. Customer ‘nudging’ is an effective tool of consumer choice architecture and yet little research has examined its application {{within the context of}} private food service provision. This study set to better understand the determinants of consumer choice when dining out and how consumer choice could be reinforced to make it more beneficial from the sustainability viewpoint. To this end, the study reported on the outcome of a consumer survey conducted among visitors to a UK casual dining restaurant where menu design was employed as a customer ‘nudging’ tool. The survey demonstrated that, next to price, food provenance and nutritional value determined consumer choice when dining out. This information should therefore be displayed on restaurant menus to enable educated, and more environment- and society-benign, food choice. While presenting the food carbon values on a menu was well perceived, some skepticism attached to their prospective use as a determinant of consumer choice was recorded.

40|$|LetterInternational audienceThe {{carbon balance}} of {{terrestrial}} ecosystems is particularly sensitive to climatic changes in autumn and spring, with spring and autumn temperatures over northern latitudes having risen by about 1. 1 °C and 0. 8 °C, respectively, {{over the past}} two decades. A simultaneous greening trend has also been observed, characterized by a longer growing season and greater photosynthetic activity,. These observations have led to speculation that spring and autumn warming could enhance carbon sequestration and extend the period of net carbon uptake in the future. Here we analyse interannual variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration data and ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes. We find that atmospheric records from the past, years show a trend towards an earlier autumn-to-winter <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>build-up,</b> suggesting a shorter net carbon uptake period. This trend cannot be explained by changes in atmospheric transport alone and, together with the ecosystem flux data, suggest increasing carbon losses in autumn. We use a process-based terrestrial biosphere model and satellite vegetation greenness index observations to investigate further the observed seasonal response of northern ecosystems to autumnal warming. We find that both photosynthesis and respiration increase during autumn warming, but the increase in respiration is greater. In contrast, warming increases photosynthesis more than respiration in spring. Our simulations and observations indicate that northern terrestrial ecosystems may currently lose carbon dioxide in response to autumn warming, with a sensitivity of about 0. 2 PgC °C- 1, offsetting 90 % of the increased carbon dioxide uptake during spring. If future autumn warming occurs at a faster rate than in spring, the ability of northern ecosystems to sequester carbon may be diminished earlier than previously suggeste...|$|R
40|$|A key {{challenge}} for living systems is balancing utilization of multiple elemental nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, whose availability {{is subject to}} environmental fluctuations. As growth can be limited by the scarcity of any one nutrient, {{the rate at which}} each nutrient is assimilated must be sensitive not only to its own availability, but also to that of other nutrients. Remarkably, across diverse nutrient conditions, E. coli grows nearly optimally, balancing effectively the conversion of carbon into energy versus biomass. To investigate the link between the metabolism of different nutrients, we quantified metabolic responses to nutrient perturbations using LC-MS based metabolomics and built differential equation models that bridge multiple nutrient systems. We discovered that the carbonaceous substrate of nitrogen assimilation, ÃÂ±-ketoglutarate, directly inhibits glucose uptake and that the upstream glycolytic metabolite, fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate, ultrasensitively regulates anaplerosis to allow rapid adaptation to changing carbon availability. We also showed that NADH controls the metabolic response to changing oxygen levels. Our findings support a general mechanism for nutrient integration: limitation for a nutrient other than <b>carbon</b> leads to <b>build-up</b> of the most closely related product of carbon metabolism, which in turn feedback inhibits further carbon uptake...|$|R

In this study, mitigation of carbon emissions through carbon uptake and storage in forest biomass and the use of forest biofuel for fossil fuel substitution were considered. The analysis was performed for a 3. 2 million hectare region in northern Sweden. The objective was to maximize net present value for harvested timber, biofuel production and carbon sequestration. A <b>carbon</b> price for <b>build-up</b> of <b>carbon</b> storage and for emissions from harvested forest products was introduced to achieve an economic value for carbon sequestration. Forest development was simulated using an optimizing stand-level planning model, and the solution for the whole region was found using linear programming. A range of carbon prices was used to study the effect on harvest levels and carbon sequestration. At a zero carbon price, the mean annual harvest level was 5. 4 million m 3, the mean annual carbon sequestration in forest biomass was 1. 48 million tonnes and the mean annual replacement of carbon from fossil fuel with forest biofuel was 61 000 tonnes. Increasing the carbon price led to decreasing harvest levels of timber and decreasing harvest levels of forest biofuel. Also, thinning activities decreased more than clear-cut activities when the carbon prices increased. The level of carbon sequestration was governed by the harvest level and the site productivity. This led to varying results for different parts of the region...|$|R
