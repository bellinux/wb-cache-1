25|$|To {{increase}} {{access to}} universities by lower income people, Thaksin initiated the Student Loan Fund (SLF) and Income <b>Contingency</b> <b>Loan</b> (ICL) programs. He initiated the ICL program to increase access to higher education, whereby needy students could secure a loan {{to support their}} studies from vocational to university levels. Thai banks had traditionally not given educational loans. The ICL, however, required recipients to start repayments when their salaries reached 16,000 baht a month, with interest equivalent to inflation from the day the loan was granted. The SLF had an eligibility limit on family income, but interest was 1 per cent starting a year after graduation. The programs were merged and the income limit modified after Thaksin's government was overthrown.|$|E

Thaksin made Thailand {{one of the first}} supporters of Nicholas Negroponte's One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project, with the Thai Ministry of Education committing to purchase 600,000 units. [...] However, the military junta later cancelled the project.|$|E

The ICL granted loans regardless of financial status, and required recipients to start repayments when their salaries reach 16,000 Baht a month, {{with an interest}} rate equivalent to inflation from the day the loan was granted. The SLF had an eligibility limit on family income but carried interest of 1%, starting one year after graduation. The programs were merged and the income limit modified after Thaksin's government was overthrown.|$|E
40|$|This chapter aims {{to develop}} {{indicators}} of social vulnerability related to flood {{impacts on the}} regional level. Impacts are seen here {{as a function of}} the exposure as well as the vulnerability dimensions. Because key vulnerability factors include several variables that cannot be found in statistical databases, such as preparedness to the hazard, mental coping capacity, social relations, and trust, an approach based on questionnaire surveys instead of only using statistical data from institutions was chosen. The analysis is based on an empirical survey conducted in the Bodrogkvz area and in the Bereg region within the Tisza flood basins. We found that while the most important variables influencing impacts were the exposure level and the geographic location, the most important factors of vulnerability were found to be the following: health, education, savings, opportunities of taking loans, trust in the members of the community and in institutions, and perception of preparedness of institutions against floods. Based on the results we give some policy recommendations with regard to increasing the resilience of the exposed communities. These include: increasing public spending on education, strengthening social cohesion, introducing <b>contingency</b> <b>loans</b> so that borrowing is feasible also for the poorer communities and improving flood preparedness by providing relevant information for inhabitants...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the new funding framework for Thai higher education under the autonomous university system. The study also explores {{the effects of}} this new funding framework on university faculty, especially with respect to institutional income generation. The research is employed a mixed method approach involving quantitative archival data and qualitative interviews. Six Thai university faculty from three different universities were interviewed using open-ended interviews. The archival data such as legislations, reports, and recommendation documents were collected and analyzed. The research findings reveal that the new framework of higher education funding is comprised of four major elements: performance-based funding mechanism, resource mobilization for higher education, institutional external income generation, and shifting greater funding to demand side (students and parents) through income <b>contingency</b> <b>loans.</b> The research findings also disclose that the new funding framework for higher education has effects on academic work time and effort of university faculty: they must to teach more students {{while at the same time}} they are compelled to focus much more on research and publications. In interviews, university faculty emphasize a discrepancy: research performance of faculty is enhanced whereas the quality of students is viewed to decline. The study raises four issues: equity assurance; cultural change of public???s giving to education; the pressure of resource allocation over available time for teaching, and leadership issues. Recommendations are made for further development of Thai higher education funding: developing regulations to assure financial aid or loan for needy students; creating a culture of giving to education; utilizing graduate assistance; and developing leadership program. In conclusion, the study provides suggestions for future research...|$|R

To address the challenges faced by credit risk or credit portfolio managers, RiskFrontier models a credit investment’s value at the analysis date, its value distribution at some investment horizon, {{as well as the}} portfolio-referent risk of every instrument in the portfolio. The approach is designed to explicitly analyze a wide range of credit investments and <b>contingencies,</b> including term <b>loans</b> with prepayment options and grid pricing, dynamic utilization in revolving lines of credit, bonds with put and call options, equities, credit default swaps, retail instruments, commercial real estate loans, and structure...|$|R
