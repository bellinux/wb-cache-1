25|$|Before {{the advent}} of the 7-8th century CE, Japan used <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> for its exchanges. It {{generally}} consisted of material that was compact, easily transportable and had a widely recognized value. <b>Commodity</b> <b>money</b> was a great improvement over simple barter, in which commodities were simply exchanged against others. Ideally, <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> had to be widely accepted, easily portable and storable, and easily combined and divided in order to correspond to different values. The main items of <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> in Japan were arrowheads, rice grains and gold powder.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{most modern}} {{monetary}} systems {{are based on}} fiat money. However, for most of history, almost all money was <b>commodity</b> <b>money,</b> such as gold and silver coins. As economies developed, <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> was eventually replaced by representative money, such as the gold standard, as traders found the physical transportation of gold and silver burdensome. Fiat currencies gradually took over in the last hundred years, especially since {{the breakup of the}} Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Many items {{have been}} used as <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> such as {{naturally}} scarce precious metals, conch shells, barley, beads etc., as well as many other things that are thought of as having value. <b>Commodity</b> <b>money</b> value comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity. Examples of commodities that {{have been used}} as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, rice, Wampum, salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or price system economies. Use of <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> is similar to barter, but a <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> provides a simple and automatic unit of account for the commodity which is being used as money. Although some gold coins such as the Krugerrand are considered legal tender, there is no record of their face value {{on either side of the}} coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value of their fine gold content.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Having {{argued in}} the part I paper that the interest-based fiat {{monetary}} system is not compatible with {{the objectives of the}} Islamic law or the Shariah, this paper seeks to argue why <b>commodity</b> <b>moneys,</b> like the gold dinar and silver dirham, are compatible with the maqasid. Design/methodology/approach – This is a theoretical paper that integrates information from the Qur’an, the traditions of the Prophet, the writings of early Islamic scholars and historical observations vis-à-vis the objectives or the maqasid al-Shariah and makes logical deductions therefrom. Findings – The theoretical conclusion is that while fiat money is counterproductive to the maqasid al-Shariah, <b>commodity</b> <b>moneys</b> like the gold dinar and silver dirham, are indeed compatible with the maqasid. The Islamic economic system is, therefore, fundamentally a “barter” system, i. e. an exchange economy where goods and services are exchanged value for value, but avoids the problems associated with barter by taking some of the commodities exchanged in the economy, that have the characteristics of money, as money. Gold is argued to be the best Shari’ah money. Research limitations/implications – Empirical investigations may shed further light. Practical implications – If the theoretical deductions and contentions of the paper are correct, then their practical implications cannot simply be understated. For the Islamic economic system to emerge in reality, or for that matter any process of Islamization of knowledge/disciplines to succeed, it is foremost crucial that <b>commodity</b> <b>moneys</b> gradually replace fiat money. Originality/value – The paper establishes that <b>commodity</b> <b>moneys</b> like gold and silver are Shariah-compatible moneys, whereas the current fiat money is not.

5000|$|Money, as {{described}} by Marx, can only be transformed into capital through the circulation of <b>commodities.</b> <b>Money</b> originates not as capital, but only as means of exchange. Money becomes capital when it {{is used as a}} standard for exchange. The circulation of commodities has two forms that make up the general formula: C-M-C and M-C-M. C-M-C represents the process of first selling a <b>commodity</b> for <b>money</b> (C-M) and then using that money to buy another commodity (M-C): [...] "selling in order to buy". M-C-M describes transacting <b>money</b> for a <b>commodity</b> (M-C) and then selling the commodity for more capital, (C-M).|$|R

25|$|Fiat money, if {{physically}} {{represented in}} the form of currency (paper or coins) can be accidentally damaged or destroyed. However, fiat money has an advantage over representative or <b>commodity</b> <b>money,</b> in that the same laws that created the money can also define rules for its replacement in case of damage or destruction. For example, the U.S. government will replace mutilated Federal Reserve Notes (U.S. fiat money) if {{at least half of the}} physical note can be reconstructed, or if it can be otherwise proven to have been destroyed. By contrast, <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> which has been lost or destroyed cannot be recovered.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{as early}} as 4000 BCE, people were trading livestock, tools, and other items. In Sumer, an early civilization in Mesopotamia, a token system {{was one of the}} first forms of <b>{{commodity}}</b> <b>money.</b> Labor markets consist of workers, employers, wages, income, supply and demand. Labor markets have been around as long as commodity markets. The first labor markets provided workers to grow crops and tend livestock for later sale in local markets. Capital markets emerged in industries that require resources beyond those of an individual farmer.|$|E
25|$|As {{production}} {{became more}} specialized, trade guilds were divided and subdivided, eliciting the squabbles over jurisdiction {{that produced the}} paperwork by which economic historians trace their development: The metalworking guilds of Nuremberg were divided among dozens of independent trades in the boom economy of the 13th century, and there were 101 trades in Paris by 1260. In Ghent, as in Florence, the woolen textile industry developed as a congeries of specialized guilds. The appearance of the European guilds was tied to the emergent money economy, and to urbanization. Before {{this time it was}} not possible to run a money-driven organization, as <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> was the normal way of doing business.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{adoption}} of metallic <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> was a late development in monetary history. Bullion bars and ingots {{were used as}} money in Mesopotamia since the 7th millennium BC; and Greeks in Asia Minor had pioneered the use of coinage (which they employed {{in addition to other}} more primitive, monetary mediums of exchange) as early as the 7th century BC. Coinage proper was only introduced by the Roman Republican government c. 300 BC. The greatest city of the Magna Graecia region in southern Italy, and several other Italian cities, already had a long tradition of using coinage by this time and produced them in large quantities during the 4th century BC to pay for their wars against the inland Italian groups encroaching on their territory. For these reasons, the Romans would have certainly known about coinage systems long before their government actually introduced them.|$|E

5000|$|The {{circulation}} {{of money is}} first initiated by the transformation of a <b>commodity</b> into <b>money.</b> The <b>commodity</b> is taken from its natural state and transformed into its monetary state. When this happens the commodity [...] "falls out of circulation into consumption." [...] The previous commodity now in its monetary form replaces a new and different commodity continuing the {{circulation of}} money. In this process, money is the means for the movement and circulation of <b>commodities.</b> <b>Money</b> assumes the measure of value of a commodity, i.e. the socially necessary labor-time. The repetition of this process constantly removes commodities from their starting places, taking {{them out of the}} sphere of circulation. Money circulates in the sphere and fluctuates with the sum of all the commodities that co-exist within the sphere. The price of commodities varies by three factors: [...] "the movement of prices, the quantity of commodities in circulation, and the velocity of circulation of money." ...|$|R

50|$|Price is the money-name of {{the labor}} {{objectified}} in a commodity. Like the relative form of value in general, price expresses {{the value of a}} commodity by asserting that a given quantity of the equivalent is directly interchangeable. The price form implies both the exchangeability of <b>commodities</b> for <b>money</b> and the necessity of exchange. Gold serves as an ideal measure of value only because it has already established itself as the <b>money</b> <b>commodity</b> in the process of exchange.|$|R

2500|$|The {{system of}} <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> {{eventually}} {{evolved into a}} system of representative money. This occurred because gold and silver merchants or banks would issue receipts to their depositors – redeemable for the <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> deposited. Eventually, these receipts became generally accepted {{as a means of}} payment and were used as money. Paper money or banknotes were first used in China during the Song dynasty. These banknotes, known as [...] "jiaozi", evolved from promissory notes that had been used since the 7th century. However, they did not displace <b>commodity</b> <b>money,</b> and were used alongside coins. In the 13th century, paper money became known in Europe through the accounts of travelers, such as Marco Polo and William of Rubruck. Marco Polo's account of paper money during the Yuan dynasty {{is the subject of a}} chapter of his book, The Travels of Marco Polo, titled [...] "." [...] Banknotes were first issued in Europe by Stockholms Banco in 1661, and were again also used alongside coins. The gold standard, a monetary system where the medium of exchange are paper notes that are convertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold, replaced the use of gold coins as currency in the 17th-19th centuries in Europe. These gold standard notes were made legal tender, and redemption into gold coins was discouraged. By the beginning of the 20th century almost all countries had adopted the gold standard, backing their legal tender notes with fixed amounts of gold.|$|E

Capitalist production cannot exist without market sales, and therefore it {{is a type of}} production that fully depends on market trade. For the purpose of the analysis of the immediate process of capitalist production, which is the main subject of Capital, Volume I, successful market transactions are assumed and market fluctuations are initially mostly disregarded - but that gives only one half of the story. The products have to be sold at a profit, and purchased at a competitive price, through market trade and the circulation of capital.|$|R
2500|$|Money is {{historically}} an emergent market phenomenon establishing a <b>commodity</b> <b>money,</b> but nearly all contemporary money systems {{are based on}} fiat money. Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without use value as a physical commodity.

2500|$|Japan's first formal {{currency}} {{system was}} the Kōchōsen (Japanese: 皇朝銭, [...] "Imperial currency"). It was {{exemplified by the}} adoption of Japan's first official coin type, the Wadōkaichin. It was first minted in 708 CE on order of Empress Genmei, Japan's 43rd Imperial ruler. [...] "Wadōkaichin" [...] is {{the reading of the}} four characters printed on the coin, and is thought to be composed of the era name Wadō (和銅, [...] "Japanese copper"), which could alternatively mean [...] "happiness", and [...] "Kaichin", thought to be related to [...] "Currency". The pronunciation of [...] "Kaichin" [...] also sounds similar to [...] "happiness" [...] in Chinese [...] "开心". This coinage was inspired by the Tang coinage (唐銭) named [...] (Chinese: 開元通宝, Kai Yuan Tong Bao), first minted in Chang'an in 621 CE. The Wadokaichin had the same specifications as the Chinese coin, with a diameter of 2.4cm and a weight of 3.75g. The main items of <b>commodity</b> <b>money</b> in Japan were arrowheads, rice grains, and gold powder, as well as hemp cloth.
