50|$|Although {{native to}} China and Japan, {{the plant is}} also found {{where it has been}} {{introduced}} in the southeastern United States, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Taiwan, India, Martinique, Sudan, and southern France. Incorrectly thought to have been introduced in colonial times by Benjamin Franklin, the tree has become naturalized from North Carolina southward along the Atlantic and the entire Gulf coast, where it grows profusely along ditchbanks and dikes. It grows especially well in open fields and abandoned farmland coastal prairie regions featuring disturbed ground—such as abandoned farmland, spoil banks, roadsides, and storm-damaged forests—and along the edges of the Western Gulf coastal grasslands biome, sometimes forming pure stands. In the Houston area, <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> trees account for a full 23 percent of all trees, more than any other tree species and is the only invasive tree species in the 14 most common species in the area.

50|$|In 1900, up to {{one million}} Attwater's prairie {{chickens}} inhabited the coastal grasslands. Loss of habitat {{is believed to be}} the prime reason for their decline. One of the major factors contributing to the habitat loss was the widespread planting, beginning in the early 1900s, of <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> trees (Triadica sebifera) to establish a soapmaking industry. Since that time, T. sebifera has proven to be an aggressive invader of the coastal grasslands where it displaces the diverse native plant assemblage that was dominated by prairie grasses and forbs with dense near monospecific stands, that significantly alter biotic and abiotic ecosystem processes. Urbanization further contributes to habitat loss. As a result of these changes over the last 100 years, the entire grassland ecosystem where Attwaters's prairie chicken once thrived exists in small, scattered patches whose continued existence is threatened. Where once grazing Plains bison and periodic wildfires due to lightning reduced brush, the birds now have difficulty making their way through thick undergrowth. Other, less-apparent changes in the ecosystem possibly have had an effect, as well.|$|E
5000|$|The coastal prairies of the Texas coast once covered about 65,000 km² (13 million acres) from Kennedy County {{north to}} the Louisiana border. Today, however, it is {{estimated}} that under 65000 acre remain mostly under private ownership. The remaining grasslands are facing human and agricultural pressures with about one-third of the area cultivated for rice, sorghum, corn, and tame pastures. Much of the rest is threatened by aggressive non-native (also called exotic or noxious) invaders, most introduced intentionally by humans. These species, such as the <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> (Sapium sebiferum), have little value to native wildlife and can out-compete native plant species. The Louisiana Natural Heritage Program's classifies coastal prairie as [...] "critically imperiled" [...] and the Texas Natural Heritage Program's 1993 classification of the little bluestem and brownseed Paspalum community as [...] "imperiled" [...] and the grama grass and switchgrass community as [...] "critically imperiled."

50|$|As aforementioned, the {{tallow tree}} is a {{non-native}} species to many {{places around the}} world. Its introduced status in North America along with the harm it causes to ecosystems makes the tree considered an invasive species there. Tallow trees present a danger of expansion that can hurt local ecosystems by out-competing native vegetation and creating a monoculture. The monoculture would then lower the species diversity and overall resilience of the area. The tree’s tenacious nature, high growth rates, and high reproductive ability contribute to its invasive success. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, tallow trees begin producing viable seed in as soon as three years. They can spread by root sprouts and cuttings and are quick to invade after a disturbance occurs in an area, due to the clearing out of land. A single tallow tree can produce nearly 100,000 viable seeds annually that can remain in the soil for several years before sprouting. A mature stand can produce 4,500 kilograms of seeds per hectare per year. These seeds are easily carried to different places by birds and water. Tallow trees can remain productive for 100 years. It is also extremely hard to kill—its poisonous features in its leaves and berries leave it with few to no predators, and its short generation time means even freshly cut trees can quickly regrow. Currently, herbicides and prescribed fire are the only effective treatments available to contain and control <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow.</b>|$|E

40|$|Global {{climate change}} and {{anthropogenic}} activity have facilitated the movement and invasive potential of nonnative plants in native environments. These invasions can have negative effects on ecosystem diversity and function. The nonnative and invasive plant, <b>Chinese</b> <b>Tallow</b> (Triadica sebifera), has already invaded much of the south eastern US where it is outcompeting native tree species and changing ecosystem diversity {{in a variety of}} habitats. Leaf litter from the <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> has been shown cause changes in dissolved oxygen and pH in the aquatic environment. Turbidity is also affected when <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter is present in water. A series of experiments were performed to determine the causes of these chemical changes in water when <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter is present. I determined that <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter has a different chemical composition from native litter, a different concentration of essential soluble nutrients from native litter, and a faster decomposition rate compared to native plant litter. Sterilization experiments suggest that <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter is promoting microbial activity through the rapid release of elemental nutrients, which subsequently influences a change in dissolved oxygen thorough stimulated microbial respiration. Changes in pH are not fully understood, but sterilization experiments suggest that unknown secondary chemicals, perhaps tannins and phenolic compounds, are the source of declining pH when <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter is present in water. Using high throughput 16 s and 18 s rRNA mass parallel gene sequencing, followed by Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling ordination scatter plots, I determined that <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter can promote differences in microbial community composition from that of native plant litter.

One group was not flooded (NF, soil water content was 75 % of field capacity), while the other group was treated with flooding (FL, water level was 5 cm above soil surface) for 95 days. We found that flooding inhibited growth of both baldcypress and <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> tree, and biomass increment of baldcypress and <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> tree under FL decreased 36. 4 % and 74. 5 %, respectively, indicating that baldcypress was more tolerant to flooding.

Flooding also stimulated aerenchyma formation in the roots (lateral and adventitious), stems and leaves of baldcypress and roots of <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> tree. Porosity in the roots, stems and leaves of the two tree species increased significantly under flooding. The aerenchyma formation and increased porosity enhanced O 2 diffusion to the roots.

To simulate low spectral but high spatial resolution satellitelairborne image and digital video data, the CIR photography was transformed into raster images at spatial resolutions approximating 0. 5 m and 1. 0 m.

Combining all land covers, there was no difference at detecting tallow occurrences (equal omission errors) between the two resolutions, but the higher spatial resolution was associated with less inclusion of non-tallow land covers as tallow (lower commission error).

Expected costs were confined to the value of timber production losses plus costs for search and control. We simulated management strategies including (1) no control (NC), and control beginning as soon as the percentage of invaded forest land exceeded (2) 60 (Low Control), (3) 25 (Medium Control), or (4) 0 (High Control) using a spatially-explicit, stochastic, bioeconomic model. With NC, simulated invasions spread northward and westward into Arkansas and along the Gulf of Mexico to occupy < 1. 2 million hectares within 20 years, with associated expected total costs increasing exponentially to <$ 300 million. With LC, MC, and HC, invaded areas reached < 275, 34, and 2 thousand hectares after 20 years, respectively, with associated expected costs reaching <$ 400, $ 230, and $ 200 million. Complete eradication would not be cost-effective; the minimum expected total cost was achieved when control began as soon as the percentage of invaded land exceeded 5 %. These results suggest the importance of early detection and control of <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow,</b> an...|$|E
