The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at Westminster Abbey, on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that she thought she had been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{documentary evidence}} of building work at Halton Castle shows {{that during the}} 15thcentury and into the 16thcentury it was regularly maintained. Between 1450 and 1457 a new gate tower was built. There {{is no evidence that}} the castle featured in the Wars of the Roses; this would have been unlikely because of its relatively obscure position. However a survey of the Royal Palaces in 1609 suggests that by then the castle had fallen into disrepair. During the Tudor period it was used less as a fortress and more as a prison, an administrative centre, and a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> In 1580–81 the castle was designated as a prison for Catholic recusants, but there is no evidence that it was ever used for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, however, Robertson's most important contribution was made {{not on a}} basketball court, but rather in a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> It was {{the year of the}} landmark Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n, an antitrust suit filed by the NBA's Players Association against the league. As Robertson was the president of the Players Association, the case bore his name. In this suit, the proposed merger between the NBA and American Basketball Association was delayed until 1976, and the college draft as well as the free agency clauses were reformed. Robertson himself stated that the main reason was that clubs basically owned their players: players were forbidden to talk to other clubs once their contract was up, because free agency did not exist back then. Six years after the suit was filed, the NBA finally reached a settlement, the ABA–NBA merger took place, and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players.|$|E

5|$|In 1962 Lord Evershed {{resigned}} as Master of the Rolls, and Denning {{was appointed to}} replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of £9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' he was pleased with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the Court of Appeal than the House of Lords. Court of Appeal judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so {{it was suggested that}} to get his way in the Court of Appeal Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House of Lords it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the Court of Appeal is that it hears more cases than the House of Lords, and so has a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of the Rolls, Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively had the last word; comparatively few cases went on to the House of Lords, which was at that time Britain's highest <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 2009, Wiens {{was found}} guilty of the murder of El-Sherbini and the {{attempted}} murder of Okaz, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Judge Birgit Wiegand stated that the court had also found that Wiens's deeds constituted a heinous crime, because they were committed in front of a child, against two people, in a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> and fulfilled the murder criterion of treacherousness, such as hatred against foreigners. It meant that Wiens received the maximum sentence for this crime. Wiens appealed the conviction; however, the appeal was rejected by the Federal Court of Justice. In a decision published on 18 June 2010, the fifth criminal division of the court of justice in Leipzig stated that the appeal on points of law was unfounded and confirmed the verdict and sentence of the regional court as final matter of criminal law.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seminal}} Court of Appeal {{decision}} Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the respondents submitted that the President's discretion under section 8(1) was subjective, {{and so was}} not open to review by the courts. The appellants argued that the discretion was objective, and thus a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> could review the grounds on which the discretion had been exercised. The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10, and hence the exercise of these powers was normally challengeable on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. In coming to this decision, it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, which had held to the contrary. While the Court's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter, later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct approach. It gave several reasons for its decision. First, the reasoning in cases supporting a subjective test {{was found to be}} questionable, and, secondly, such a test was inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Finally, the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion was contrary {{to the rule of law}} and all powers had legal limits.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{viewed the}} {{tradition}} of wives abandoning their own surname to assume that of their husbands {{as a manifestation of}} the legal annihilation of a married woman’s identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as “Lucy Stone” or “Lucy Stone – only.” But during the summer, Blackwell tried to register the deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as “Lucy Stone Blackwell.” The couple consulted Blackwell’s friend, Salmon P. Chase, a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately able to answer their question about the legality of her name. So while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in private correspondence, for eight months she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents and allowed herself to be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone. In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she {{would not be allowed to}} vote unless she added “Blackwell” to her signature. This she refused to do, and because her time and energy were consumed with suffrage work, she did not challenge the action in a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Rova of Antananarivo occurred {{at a time when}} the complex was in the final stages of the process to become classified as Madagascar's first cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Six people were initially charged in connection with the Rova's destruction in an Antananarivo <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> but the official investigation concluded that the fire was an accident. Public accusations of a cover-up placed the blame for the fire on government officials, various ethnic groups, foreign powers and other parties. Widespread belief persists within and outside Madagascar that a deliberate arson was the cause. Rumoured justifications for arson at the Rova were numerous and remain unproven. The revelation that important financial archives had been destroyed early on the morning of the fire sparked rumours that corrupt government officials had lit the blaze to create a public distraction from their illicit activities. Other explanations have included popular dissatisfaction with the election of divisive mayor Guy Willy Razanamasy or a flare-up of long-standing tensions among coastal peoples resentful of Merina socio-political domination. Accusations were also made against both then-president Albert Zafy and his predecessor, Didier Ratsiraka. The debate over why and how the Rova burned remains an unresolved and highly contentious subject decades later.|$|E
