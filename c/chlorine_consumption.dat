The bio-bleaching of kraft pulp with xylanase was the most effec-tive at an enzyme dose of 10 IU/g oven dried pulp, pH 9. 0 and 120 min incubation at 55 C. Under the optimized conditions, xylanase pretreatment reduced Kappa number by 1. 6 points and increased brightness by 1. 9 points. Subsequently, chlorine dioxide and alkaline bleaching sequences (CDE 1 D 1 D 2) finally resulted in brightness gain of 2. 7 points {{as compared with the}} control.

40|$|Disinfection is {{the last}} {{treatment}} stage of a Drinking Water Treatment Plant (DWTP) and is carried out to maintain a residual concentration of disinfectant in the water distribution system. Chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) is a widely used chemical employed for this purpose. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of several treatments on <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>consumption</b> and on chlorite and chlorate formation in the final oxidation/disinfection stage. A number of tests was performed at laboratory scale employing water samples collected from the DWTP of Cremona (Italy). The following processes were studied: oxidation with potassium permanganate, chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite, coagulation/flocculation with ferric chloride and aluminum sulfate, filtration and adsorption onto activated carbon. The {{results showed that the}} chlorine dioxide demand is high if sodium hypochlorite or potassium permanganate are employed in pre-oxidation. On the other hand, chlorine dioxide leads to the highest production of chlorite and chlorate. The coagulation/flocculation process after pre-oxidation shows that chlorine dioxide demand decreases if potassium permanganate is employed as an oxidant, both with ferric chloride and aluminum sulfate. Therefore, the combination of these processes leads to a lower production of chlorite and chlorate.

Washing stage performance can be evaluated by the dilution factor, which determines the water amount used for pulp ton, and washing loss, which determines the amount of washable components in pulp discharged with pulp to bleaching that could not be washed away. This study focused on utilization of brown stock washing stage upper level control, which was based on the real time online measurement of total dry solids of the pulp suspension and washer filtrates in several points of the process. Online measurements were used to determine the chemical state of the process and adjustments to dilution factor made accordingly.

The initial GEMS model incorporated assumptions estimated by Edwards, for chlorine chemical adjustment which resulted from the accumulation of recycled organics. Laboratory studies, applied to organics generated from bleaching of Pinus Radiata pulp were carried out to verify these assumptions. Bench scale experiments were conducted in D/C-stage and E 1 -stage filtrates for both laboratory generated filtrates and mill samples, whereas for the D 1 -stage filtrate, only the generated filtrate was investigated. <b>Chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> of the generated D/C-stage and E 1 -stage filtrates was measured as 0. 33 kg and 0. 20 kg active chlorine per kg of organics, at the temperatures of 50 °C and 70 °C, respectively. The quantity of organics in each filtrate was determined as Total Volatile Solids. For the D/C-stage filtrate, the organics-chlorine reaction was shown to be temperature dependent with a maximum consumption occurring at approximately 50 °C, whereas for the E 1 -stage filtrate, the organics chlorine reaction {{as a function of}} temperature was not investigated. For the mill filtrate samples, <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> measured as kg active chlorine per kg of organics was 0. 38 and 0. 14 for D/C-stage and E 1 -stage organics, respectively. The <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> of D 1 -stage organics was negligible compared to the D/C-stage and the E 1 -stage organics, due to only a minor concentration of volatile solids present in the effluent, i. e., approximately 20 - 30 mg per litre of effluent. The generated D/C-stage and E 1 -stage filtrates were also found to consist of 17. 8 kg and 17. 0 kg of organics per tonne of O. D. pulp, respectively. The measured <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> values were incorporated into the fine tuned GEMS model (total closure case) to assess the effect of various amounts of fresh water substitution, by recycling D/C-stage and E 1 -stage effluents, on the economics of bleach plant operation with respect to chemical, water, and steam usage. The studies indicated a lowering of the total cost of these utilities, with increasing amounts of recycled effluent. Using the existing bleach plant model (open case) as a base case, the annual savings in cost of utilities for total mill closure was estimated to be NZ$ 0. 2 million.

40|$|Cette étude présente les principaux résultats se rapportant d'une part à l'évolution des consommations en chlore par des composés organiques en {{solutions}} synthétiques de minéralisation variable. D'autre part, quelques essais sont consacrés aux possibilités de formation de sous- produits de la chloration tels les trihalométhanes. Les différences de réactivité entre les composés simples (phénol, résorcinol, aniline) et les substances humiques, déjà observées en eau distillée, ont pu également être mises en évidence lors de leur dilution dans des milieux minéralisés (eaux de sources ou de forages). L'influence de la minéralisation, appréhendée par le paramètre "conductivité" ou par des teneurs variables en éléments minéraux spécifiques, s'est concrétisée par des écarts souvent considérables entre les potentiels de consommation en chlore en eau distillée et ceux en eaux minéralisées. La présence d'ions bromures dans les eaux les plus minéralisées induit en particulier une formation plus importante des THM bromés. L'intervention d'ions chlorures et sulfates, en provoquant une diminution des potentiels de consommation en chlore, peut rendre plus complexe le schéma réactionnel du chlore avec les différentes entités réactives présentes dans une eau naturelle. L'application du procédé de chloration à des eaux de surface algériennes a permis de distinguer entre les eaux très minéralisées du sud algérien et celles moins minéralisées du nord du pays. Leur réactivité vis-à-vis du chlore s'est trouvée directement liée à leurs caractéristiques physico-chimiques. Les différences de réactivité relevées peuvent être attribuées d'une part à la variabilité de la proportion en matériel humique et d'autre part aux teneurs relatives en éléments minéraux promoteurs ou inhibiteurs de la réaction de chloration. The {{organic compounds}} studied {{during this work}} are simple aromatic structures (phenol, resorcinol, aniline), as well as macromolecular structures (humic substances). These compounds are representative of natural organic matter in surface waters. Various studies (De Laat et al., 1982; Norwood and Christman, 1987; Legube et al., 1990) showed that chlorination of these organic substances led to a strong <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> {{and the formation of}} volatile and non-volatile organohalogenated compounds. However, the majority of these experiments were conducted in aqueous media at very low ionic strength or in distilled water. The aim {{of the present study was}} to observe the reactivity of organic compounds in mineralised media. Indeed, Algerian waters are often very mineralised, excessively hard with high amounts of chloride and sulphate (Achour, 2001). In addition, humic substances can account for 60 to 90 % of the total organic carbon (TOC) in most surface waters used to produce drinking water (Achour and Moussaoui, 1993). The first part of this study involved the investigation of the impact of the overall parameter "total mineralisation", which can be directly related to conductivity measurements in the dilution waters. In addition to distilled water, dilution media for the organic compounds included four ground waters initially free of organic matter and residual chlorine. Figure 1 shows the geographic location of sampling sites for the waters of Drauh and Oued Biskra (Biskra) as well as those of waters of Ifri (Bedjaïa) and Youkous (Tebessa). Their main physico-chemical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The influence of certain specific inorganic constituents such as ammonia, bromide, chloride and sulphate is also observed on the chlorination of the organic compounds tested. The objective was to determine and to compare <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> potentials respectively for the simple organic compounds (D) and the humic substances (PCCl 2) in media with differing degrees of mineralisation and under controlled conditions (pH, contact time and chlorine dose applied). Chlorination ratio is expressed for the simple organic compounds by r=moles of introduced chlorine/moles of organic compound and for the humic substances by m=mg of introduced chlorine/mg of humic substances. Tests were performed to evaluate the formation of trihalomethanes (chloroform and brominated trihalomethanes). Analysis was done by gas chromatography using a head space method. The main experimental chlorination conditions for the synthetic solutions of organic compounds are summarised in Table 2. The results obtained (Table 3) show that the organic compounds tested remain very reactive towards chlorine, whatever the mineralisation of the dilution media. Potentials of <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> in distilled water and in mineralised waters are different (E), showing the obvious effect of the degree of mineralisation (Table 4). The reactivity of humic substances seems intermediary between the structures of resorcinol and phenol or aniline. The highest variations (E) between distilled water and the natural mineralised waters were observed in the case of the most highly mineralised water (water of Oued Biskra); generally the gaps decreased in the order E (Oued Biskra) > E (Ifri) > E (Youkous) > E (Drauh). In studies at different pH values, the oxidation capacity of chlorine was exerted more vigorously at circumneutral pH values (Table 5). For phenol and humic substances, gaps are more meaningful within five minutes of contact time, during the first step of the chlorination reaction (Table 6). Total mineralisation does not seem to be the only parameter able to affect the reactivity of organic matter. The composition of the inorganic matrix must be considered too. Thus, according to the relative proportions of ammonia and bromides, competitive reactions (chlorine/organic matter and chlorine/inorganics) will condition <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> and the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs). For waters with a low ammonia/bromide ratio, an increase of the bromide concentration can induce a significant degradation of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> potentials, even for resorcinol, which is habitually more reactive with chlorine than with bromide (Figure 2). In waters with high levels of bromides (waters of Drauh and Oued Biskra), bromoform may be formed (Table 7). The presence of high concentrations of chloride and sulphate in aqueous solutions with humic substances seems to induce a reduction of <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> potentials (Figures 3 and 4). Several hypotheses can be advanced to explain this phenomenon, especially the decrease of activity of the chlorinating element by the increase of the ionic strength of the aqueous media. At the same time, it can be assumed that chlorinated entities may be formed with less reactivity than hypochlorous acid. The reduction of <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> is less significant in the presence of sulphates than chlorides. Moreover, the cation associated with sulphate seems to have an effect on the reactivity of the humic substances towards to chlorine. In the second part of the work, chlorination was applied to four surface water samples. The sampling sites (Figure 1) relate to reservoir waters of Souk El Djemâa (Tizi-Ouzou), Aïn Zada (Sétif), Foum El Gherza (Biskra) and Fontaine des gazelles (Biskra). Amounts of humic material are relatively important and constitute about 60 % of the TOC found in the raw waters. The mineralisation in these waters is considerable, particularly for waters in the southern part of the country (Table 8). <b>Chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> and THMs formed seem to be correlated with the nature and concentration of organic matter, as well as with the inorganic component of these waters (Table 9). Chlorination of water samples taken from the north of Algeria (Aïn Zada and Souk El Djemâa) leads to higher values of <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> potentials than for water samples taken from the south of the country. Taking into account the results obtained on synthetic solutions, this trend can be explained by the appreciable contents of humic substances as well as by a lower degree of mineralisation of waters in the north. It also interesting to note that proportion of brominated trihalomethanes compared to the total trihalomethanes increases not only with the initial concentration of bromides but also with increasing levels of chlorides and sulphates. Highly mineralised waters, containing humic material, seem therefore to favour numerous competitive reactions during chlorination...|$|E

Conventional analytical techniques for “active” chlorine measurements have demonstrated potential interference by organic chloramines. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more accurate technique for chlorination process control so as to provide adequate disinfection while limiting the toxicity associated with residual chlorine and DBPs. ^ A membrane introduction mass spectrometric (MIMS) method for differentiation and quantification of free chlorine and inorganic chloramines in aqueous solution was developed based on a low cost mass spectrometer. Several factors were examined for system optimization. Linearity of the response and limits of detection of all inorganic chlorine and chloramines were evaluated. System performance was evaluated with comparison of DPD/FAS titration from chlorination of ammoniacal water, aqueous solutions containing glycine and samples of potable water and wastewater. ^ The MIMS system was applied for purposes of studying the chlorination of aqueous solutions containing model organic N-compounds and pure bacterial cultural solutions.

Our experiments focused on the role of ozone and granular activated carbon in removing mutagenic compounds and precursors that become toxic after chlorination. We found that if a sufficient dose of ozone is applied, its use does not lead to the creation of mutagenic compounds in drinking water and can even eliminate the initial mutagenicity of the water. The formation of new mutagenic compounds seems to be induced by ozonation that is too weak, although these mutagens can be removed by GAC filtration. Ozone used with activated carbon {{can be one of the}} best means for eliminating the compounds contributing to the mutagenicity of water. A combined treatment of ozone and activated carbon also decreases the <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> of the treated water and consequently reduces the formation of chlorinated organic compounds...|$|E

By coupling mass balance analysis and multi-criteria decision analysis, the paper seeks to assess the greenness of three commercial-scale production processes of a broad spectrum herbicide named glyphosate on the basis of seven assessment criteria and sixteen metrics. The seven criteria include mass intensity, efficiency of four core elements (i. e., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and <b>chlorine),</b> energy <b>consumption,</b> nature of the industrial waste, cost of raw materials, and toxicity of materials. The multi-criteria decision method is applied to rank the greenness of glyphosate's three synthetic alternatives in a comprehensive, aggregate manner. Our findings highlight the discrepancy between greenness-driven alternative and cost-driven alternative in fine chemical production. At present, the actual choice of glyphosate production process in China remains dominated by the economic criteria rather than a more comprehensive, balanced set of criteria spanning economic profitability, environmental soundness, and social responsibility. Nonetheless, the underlining research method is relevant to the choice of synthetic alternatives of other fine chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Consumption of {{chemicals}} during ECF bleaching of kraft pulp correlates reasonably well with kappa number, which measures with KMnO 4 {{the total amount}} of oxidizable material in the pulp. However, the method does not distinguish between the oxidizable material in residual lignin and other structures susceptible to oxidation, such as hexenuronic acids (HexAs), extractives and carbonyl groups in the pulp. In this study an attempt is made to separate the main contributors to the kappa number in oxygen - delignified eucalyptus Kraft pulps and evaluate how these fractions behave during ECF bleaching using chlorine dioxide as the sole oxidant (DEDD sequence). Residual lignin and HexAs proved to be the main fractions contributing to the kappa number and <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>consumption</b> in ECF bleaching. Pulp bleachability with chlorine dioxide increases with increasing HexAs content of the pulp but chlorine dioxide per se does not react with HexAs. Reduction of pulp with sodium borohydride under conditions for removing carbonyl groups has no impact on bleachability. No correlation was found between the pulp of the extractive content and pulp bleachability. The removal of HexAs prior to ECF bleaching significantly decreases the formation of chlorinated organics in the pulp (OX) and filtrates (AOX) as well as of oxalic acids in the filtrates...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is based}} on the {{utilisation}} of sawdust and wood chip screenings for different purposes. A substantial amount of these byproducts are readily available in the Finnish forest industry. A black liquor impregnation study showed that sawdust-like wood material behaves differently from normal chips. Furthermore, the fractionation and removal of the smallest size fractions did not {{have a significant effect on}} the impregnation of sawdust-like wood material. Sawdust kraft cooking equipped with an impregnation stage increases the cooking yield and decreases the lignin content of the produced pulp. Impregnation also increases viscosity of the pulp and decreases <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>consumption</b> in bleaching. In addition, impregnation increases certain pulp properties after refining. Hydrotropic extraction showed that more lignin can be extracted from hardwood than softwood. However, the particle size had a major influence on the lignin extraction. It was possible to extract more lignin from spruce sawdust than spruce chips. Wood chip screenings are usually combusted to generate energy. They can also be used in the production of kraft pulp, ethanol and chemicals. It is not economical to produce ethanol from wood chip screenings because of the expensive wood material. Instead, they should be used for production of steam and energy, kraft pulp and higher value added chemicals. Bleached sawdust kraft pulp can be used to replace softwood kraft pulp in mechanical pulp based papers because it can improve certain physical properties. It is economically more feasible to use bleached sawdust kraft pulp in stead of softwood kraft pulp, especially when the reinforcement power requirement is moderate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} gold {{extraction}} from a refractory concentrate by chlorine leaching. The process considers a pre-treatment of refractory materials by low temperature oxidation {{carried out with}} low oxygen concentration. The oxidized material is treated by leaching with brine. After gold adsorption/reduction onto activated carbon, iron and base metals can be precipitated by NaOH. Roasting tests show the necessity {{to carry out a}} thermal pre-treatment at least at 550 C to obtain a reduction of sulfur and mercury in the material (50 % and 90 %, respectively). Highest gold extraction yield (around 93 %) is obtained in the leaching test performed with material sample treated at 650 C. This result confirms the necessity to optimize the thermal pre-treatment to improve Au recovery and to reduce <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption.</b> A comparison with conventional cyanidation confirms that chlorination could be an useful alternative: in fact, gold extraction yield is quite low: 57 % in non-pre-treated material and 25 % in pre-treatment material. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper reports {{high level}} {{production}} of a cellulase-free xylanase using wheat bran, a cost-effective substrate, under submerged fermentation by alkalophilic Bacillus subtilis ASH. Production of xylanase was observed even at alkaline pH up to 11. 0 and temperature 60 °C, although the highest enzyme titer was recorded at neutral pH and 37 °C. The enzyme production under optimized fermentation was 1. 5 -fold greater than under unoptimized conditions. Pre-treatment of unbleached pulp of 10 % consistency with crude xylanase (6 IU/g o. d. pulp) at 60 ºC for 2 h increased the final brightness by 4. 9 %. The enzyme treatment reduced the <b>chlorine</b> <b>consumption</b> by 28. 6 % with the same brightness as in the control. A reduction in kappa number and increase in viscosity was observed after enzyme pre-treatment. Scanning electron microscopy revealed loosening and swelling of pulp fibers. The strength properties viz. grammage, fiber thickness, beating degree, tensile index, breaking length, tear index and double fold of the treated pulp were improved {{as compared to the}} control pulp. This study reveals the potential of B. subtilis ASH xylanase as a biobleaching agent for the paper and pulp industry...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Water becomes {{contaminated}} with enteric pathogens such as coliform group of bacteria viz Salmonellae, Vibrio and dysentery causing bacilli. The human faecal material carried along with domestic sewage is often dumped in {{rivers and lakes}} leading to water contamination. The present study was undertaken to detect the enteric pathogens and to measure the extent of drinking water contamination with the pathogenic microorganisms. Water samples were collected from different areas of Solan city in Himachal Pradesh. Most probable number (MPN) test was performed to detect the coliforms in water samples collected from surface water sources, hand pumps, taps, roof top storage tanks and aqua-guards. Chlorination of some water samples was done to see the effect of chlorine on bacteria. The indicator organisms isolated were E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes are the characteristic of intestinal tract of man and animals. The study reveals that surface water and roof top storage tank water was more liable to contamination whereas, ground water and aqua-guard water was safer for human <b>consumption.</b> <b>Chlorine</b> was effective in removing these bacteria from water...|$|R
40|$|Chlor-alkali {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processes in the chemical industry. It produces chlorine and caustic soda, which become the main feedstock of daily products. The aim of this study is to report the phenomenon of plasma electrolysis and how it can be used in chlor-alkali production for more efficient energy consumption. When the plasma is formed, the current fluctuates and gradually declines. Plasma electrolysis begins with the process of electrolysis itself. Due to Joule heating, gas bubbles are formed and a sheath is made on both electrodes, resulting in the plasma field. Plasma electrolysis can be identified by its radical production. The higher the voltage and concentration, the greater the production of radicals. In 10 minutes or less, the number of OH radicals produced can reach 4 ppm at 400 V and 0. 1 M. This amount is relatively small and is caused by other reactions consuming OH radicals to form other radicals such as <b>chlorine.</b> The energy <b>consumption</b> of plasma electrolysis in this study can reach 16 kJ/mmol Cl 2 at 0. 5 M NaCl solution. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{reactions}} of Cl(III) were investigated utilizing iodometric titration {{in combination with}} DMSO and EDTA to prevent undesired side reactions. Among {{a large group of}} suggested Cl(III) decomposition reactions, two reactions were found to be adequate to describe the Cl(III) decomposition in the absence of metals and HOCl. The rate parameters (k - rate coefficient, Ea - activation energy) were determined for these reactions. The reaction between Cl(III) and HOCl is known to start with the formation of a Cl 2 O 2 intermediate. The Cl 2 O 2 intermediate was found to be formed through both, hypochlorous acid and chlorine. The kinetic parameters were obtained for the reaction between chlorous acid and hypochlorous acid. The reaction rate between chlorine and chlorite was found to be restricted by the kinetics of the HOCl/Cl 2 equilibrium. The extremely fast Cl 2 O 2 consuming reactions were identified among a group of suggested reactions and their relative rates were determined. Kinetic parameters were identified for several aldehydes with Cl(III). Aldehyde groups were shown to be present in kraft pulps and a considerable amount of aldehydes was found to be formed during chlorine dioxide bleaching. These aldehydes seemed to originate both from carbohydrates and lignin and the amount was dependent on the ClO 2 dosage used. According to the results obtained, it was concluded that the reaction between Cl(III) and aldehydes may contribute substantially to the overall Cl(III) <b>consumption</b> during <b>chlorine</b> dioxide bleaching. Chlorine dioxide prebleaching (D 0 -stage) experiments were conducted to gain more knowledge of the rate of the different reactions and on the time-dependent behavior of various components. Kappa number reduction, hexenuronic acid depletion, chlorination and <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>consumption</b> were all found to be fast reactions, with almost everything occurring during the first minute of bleaching. Cl(III) was an exception. The amount of Cl(III) first increased rapidly and then decreased slowly...|$|R
