40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{assumed that the}} stress state at passive margins is mainly dominated by ridge push and that other stress sources have only a limited temporal and/or spatial influence. We show, by means of numerical modelling, that observed variations in lithosphere structure and elevation from a margin towards continental interiors may also produce significant gravitational potential stresses competing with those induced by ridge push forces. We test this hypothesis on an actual case where abundant geological and geophysical datasets are available, the shelf of southern Norway and adjacent southern Norwegian mountains (or Southern Scandes). The modelling {{results are consistent with}} the main features of three key-observables: (1) undulations of the truncated geoid (reflecting variations in gravitational potential energy in the lithosphere), (2) significant stress rotations both offshore and onshore and (3) the seismicity pattern of southern Norway. The contribution of the Southern Scandes to the regional stress pattern appears to be far more significant than previously anticipated. In addition, the modelling provides a physical explanation for the enigmatic seismicity of southern Norway. Gravitational potential stresses arising from variations in the lithospheric structure between a passive margin and its <b>continental</b> <b>borderlands,</b> can exert a significant control on the dynamic evolution of the margin in concert with ridge push. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|We present new {{analytical}} {{data from}} lavas and associated rocks dredged and/or drilled from the South Fiji Basin, Northland Plateau, Colville Ridge and Havre Trough. These results provide much-needed ground {{truth about the}} geology, age and tectonic evolution of the Cenozoic submarine ridges and basins between the active intraoceanic TongaKermadec arc, and rifted <b>continental</b> <b>borderlands</b> of New Zealand, the Norfolk Ridge and New Caledonia. Key {{results from this study}} include: (1) ArAr dates on Minerva Abyssal Plain oceanic crust suggest that the ages of magnetic anomalies in the South Fiji Basin have been overestimated by earlier workers; (2) subduction-related lavas are widespread across the region, are not presently organised into arc-like chains, and cluster in the age range 22  18 Ma (Early Miocene); (3) the oldest subduction-related lavas occur {{in the western part of}} the region (32  26 Ma: Norfolk and Three Kings Ridge); (4) shoshonites, interpreted as rifted arc lavas, were erupted in a narrow 20  21 Ma interval over a wide area. Put together, these results indicate high magmatic flux and large and rapid horizontal tectonic translations and basin opening from 18  23 Ma in the region immediately north of New Zealand. We explain the Miocene tectonomagmatic development of the region by a model of rapid rollback of a single, east-facing Pacific arctrench system that became established after Northland Allochthon emplacement. Critical testing of this, versus other, tectonic models must await drilling and dating of thus-far unsampled Kupe Abyssal Plain crust...|$|E
40|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} with periods longer than 30 s create periodic, {{horizontally}} propagating pressure fields at the deep seafloor. Seafloor displacements resulting from these pressure fields {{depend on the}} density and elastic parameters of the oceanic rust. The displacement to pressure transfer function, the seafloor compliance, pro-vides information about ocean crustal density and elasticity, and we outline a linearized inversion method to determine ocean crustal shear velocity from the compliance. By computing compliance partial differences with respect to changes in ocean crust shear velocity, we provide estimates of inversion stability and of the compli-ance sensitivity to crustal properties. Seafloor compliance, measured from pressure and acceleration spectra, is presented for two different sites: Axial Seamount on the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the West Cortez Basin in the California <b>continental</b> <b>borderlands.</b> The compliances and inverted structure for these two sites show significant differences; in particular, a zone of low shear strength is observed at depth within Axial Seamount, suggesting the presence of at least 3 % partial melt Within the upper 2500 meters ofthe ediface.
