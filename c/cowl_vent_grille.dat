2500|$|... 1976 models {{featured}} steel {{floor panels}} shielding the catalytic converter exhaust. These steel floor panels weighed {{less than the}} previous fiberglass floor and reduced interior noise levels. Horsepower rose to [...] for the base L-48 engine; [...] for the optional L-82. To further reduce cabin noise levels, cowl induction was dropped {{in favor of the}} air cleaner ducted over the radiator, picking up outside air {{from the front of the}} car, thus reducing wind turbulence at the base of the windshield. The hood was carried over, with its <b>cowl</b> <b>vent</b> <b>grille</b> and induction system opening becoming non-functional. The optional cast aluminum wheels were finally made available, which reduced the unsprung weight of the car by 32pounds. Nearly 15% of the cars were ordered with the new wheels at a cost of $299. A standard steel rim spare was used. This was the last year for optional white striped tires, as 86% of the cars were being delivered with the optional white lettered tires. A new rear nameplate for the rear bumper cover was introduced, eliminating the individual [...] "Corvette" [...] letters used since 1968. An unwelcome change was the [...] "Vega GT" [...] 4-spoke steering wheel, although its smaller diameter did provide extra room and eased entry/exit. The steering wheel, color-keyed to the interior, continued on 1977 through 1979 models, limited to non-tilt wheel cars only. GM's [...] "Freedom" [...] battery, a new sealed and maintenance-free unit, was now installed in all cars. The rear window defroster option was changed from the forced-air type of previous years to the new [...] "Electro-Clear" [...] defogger, an in-glass heated element type. Even without a convertible model, the Corvette still set new sales records.|$|E
5000|$|... 1950 - Telescopic shock {{absorbers}} replace lever-action type. Last year for driver's side <b>cowl</b> <b>vent,</b> its handle is now flat steel, not maroon knob as in previous years. New serial number codes: HP ½ ton, HR ¾ ton, & HS 1 ton.|$|R
50|$|All {{the various}} {{elements}} of Kahn's unique approach to modernistic design {{were brought to}} bear on the Film Center Building's interior. Its walls and ceilings are handsomely worked in the plaster tapestry effect, and the polychromatic and decorative schemes are broad enough to include mosaics, elevator doors, the directory board, <b>vent</b> <b>grilles,</b> staircase risers, and elaborate, purely ornamental, three-dimensional motifs of abstract cylinders and stylized movie cameras. The overall effect is one of Kahn's most striking interior designs.|$|R
50|$|Only 602 Z/28s {{were sold}} in 1967, along with {{approximately}} 100 Indianapolis Pace Car replicas. The 1967 and 1968 Z/28s {{did not have the}} cowl induction hood, optional on the 1969 Z/28s. The 1967 Z28 received air from an open element air cleaner or from an optional cowl plenum duct attached {{to the side of the}} air cleaner that ran to the firewall and got air from the <b>cowl</b> <b>vents.</b> 15-inch rally wheels were included with Z/28s while all other 1967-9 Camaros had 14-inch wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The 1936 Series 70 and 75 {{both had}} {{v-shaped}} windshield styles by Fleetwood. A narrower radiator shell {{was supported by}} the new louver style [...] "Convex vee" [...] grill. Headlights were mounted on the radiator shell. Parking lights were inside the headlights. Front fenders were new with a crease along the center line. The <b>cowl</b> <b>vent</b> was changed back to opening forward. There were built-in trunks on [...] "touring" [...] styles, town cars and 4-door convertibles. Coupes and 2-door convertibles had rumble seats plus a separate door for the spare tire at the extreme rear of the deck. All bodies now utilized the Fisher Turret Top.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from high}} {{capacity}} and high output V8 engines, enhanced suspension and braking systems, CSV {{models have been}} characterised by upgraded interiors and full body kits (in particular, bonnet air <b>vents,</b> revised <b>grilles</b> and large decklid spoilers).|$|R
50|$|Ground floor {{dining rooms}} and sitting room have plaster {{ceilings}} with elaborate circular surrounds to central lights. Doors are cedar panelled with rectangular fan lights over. Deep cornices and pelmets are of moulded cedar. The front dining room has walls of full height cedar, with 4 inch 100mm beaded vertical boarding above the panelling to dado height. The fireplace is dark grey marble. The sitting room has full height cedar panelling {{and a white}} marble fireplace. The formal dining room opposite has rendered walls with deep cedar skirting. The fireplace is painted. The adjoining office has an angled fireplace sheeted over. This room leads into a vaulted strong room in the northwest corner, rendered, with metal <b>vent</b> <b>grilles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Interior spaces {{evoke the}} clean, Modern {{exterior}} of the courthouse. Pale grey terrazzo floors and white walls are accented with dark grey painted surfaces and aluminum and silvertone metallic details such as handrails and <b>vent</b> <b>grilles.</b> Green marble panels cover elevator lobby walls, and granite tiles in pale and dark tones cover the floor. Gleaming steel elevator doors and surrounds reinforce the Modern interior design features and finishes. Courtrooms, {{some of which have}} been altered to make them appear more Classical, have dark wood wainscoting and jury boxes. Coffered ceilings contain both recessed lighting and hemispherical pendant lights. Clerestory windows with decorative geometric metalwork admit exterior light into some of the courtrooms. A covered patio with brick flooring, planted containers, chairs, and tables provides a transitional space between indoor and outdoor areas.|$|R
5000|$|The Italia {{featured}} a radio (not yet standard equipment even on Cadillacs), form-fitting bucket seats made from foam rubber three different densities for maximum comfort covered {{in red and}} white leather, featuring reclining backrests made up of two contoured bolsters, one for the shoulders {{and one for the}} lower back. The seats were firmer at the lower back than the upper and between the two cushions was air space so [...] "the seats actually 'breathed' through the motion of the passengers." [...] A non-reflecting dash was finished in red, with bright red deep-pile Italian carpet, all contrasting with the [...] "Italian Cream" [...] exterior color. Even red leather seat belts were incorporated as they were just beginning to appear as standard equipment that was pioneered by Nash but attached only to the seats themselves. Flow-through ventilation, usually credited as a General Motors innovation, feeding through a <b>cowl</b> <b>vent</b> (just becoming usual in 1950s U.S. cars), was also standard.|$|R
50|$|With {{the exhaust}} venting {{through the top}} rear of the vehicle engine deck similar to Cromwell. These could be fitted with cowls to {{redirect}} exhaust fumes away from the air inlet <b>vents.</b> <b>Cowls</b> were usually split into two independent covers, {{as opposed to the}} single cover fitted to Cromwell.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the {{bodywork}} includes three vents (visible in the photo above) {{on each side of}} the bike to cool the mechanicals: a pair of forward vents on the wheel <b>cowling,</b> a lower <b>vent</b> on each side for the transmission, and two larger vents to accommodate the engine's cooling system.|$|R
40|$|The {{exhaust system}} plays {{a vital role}} in {{removing}} the gaseous emissions that is being produced within the combustion chamber during fuel-air mixture activities. The exhaust system is defined as a series of chambers and pipes that starts at the engine and ends {{at the back of the}} car with the tail pipe. However if there are any leaks in the exhaust system, it provide a direct path for the emission gaseous including carbon monoxide to enter can be very dangerous as it provides a direct path for carbon monoxide and other dangerous gaseous emissions to enter the <b>cowl</b> <b>vent</b> at the base of the windshield and directly to the passenger compartment. The risk of exposure to these hazardous gaseous is also high especially during vehicle maintenance services in suspected cases of leakages to the exhaust system.   The inspection of the exhaust system is done manually in most of the automotive services workshops. In this paper, accidental risks of performing these inspection jobs on a vehicle’s exhaust system, performed by a technician are discussed. In order to minimize the risks to technicians or mechanics, a prototype device to detect exhaust leakage was developed using a gas sensor module and a web camera. This device was successfully operated in detecting possible leakages of the exhaust system...|$|R
50|$|Plenums are {{the central}} {{distribution}} and collection units for an HVAC system. The return plenum carries {{the air from}} several large return <b>grilles</b> (<b>vents)</b> or bell mouths to a central air handler. The supply plenum directs air from the central unit to the rooms which the system is designed to heat or cool. They must be carefully planned in ventilation design.|$|R
25|$|Kiln roofs, {{where the}} kiln was external, were {{generally}} built of a timber frame {{and covered in}} either peg tiles or slate. Some oasts had conical kiln roofs built of brick, these were covered in tar or pitch to keep them weatherproof. A few oasts had square kilns with brick roofs, again covered in tar or pitch. The top of the roof was open, and carried a <b>cowl</b> or louvred <b>vent.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Toy Story 2, Woody is {{preparing}} to go with Andy to Cowboy Camp, but his arm is accidentally ripped and Andy decides not {{to take him to}} camp. Woody is shelved and fears the worst for his fate. A squeaky toy Penguin named Wheezy is also on the shelf with a broken squeaker. Andy's Mom holds a yard sale and marks Wheezy to be sold for 25 cents. Woody saves Wheezy with help from Andy's new puppy, Buster. Woody, however, gets stolen by a greedy toy collector named Al. At his apartment, Woody discovers his forgotten past and legacy as the star of a 1950s Western children's show [...] "Woody's Roundup", but learns that he will be shipped to Japan to be displayed in a toy museum. Even worse, one of the toys from the franchise, Stinky Pete the Prospector, is intent to make sure that Woody {{and the rest of the}} [...] "Roundup" [...] toys get to Japan. It is revealed that Stinky Pete was never sold and had never experienced the love of a child for decades. Al then calls a restoration expert to fix Woody's right arm. After that Stinky Pete convinces Woody to go along with the plan after Buzz and a few of the toys from the first film arrive to rescue Woody, who has a change of heart after watching an episode of Woody's Roundup in which he sings [...] "You've Got a Friend in Me". Stinky Pete is able to prevent Woody from leaving by replacing the bolts on the air <b>vent</b> <b>grille</b> through which Buzz and the others managed to get into Al's apartment.|$|R
5000|$|The SPV was {{realised}} as {{a series}} of balsa and hardwood models built to various scales, the largest being 24 in in length. The vehicle's appearance was conceived by special effects director Derek Meddings based on a brief description in the Andersons' pilot script, specifying that the SPV incorporate inverted seating (therefore having no windscreen) and a versatile and removable [...] "lightweight power unit". Meddings incorporated a shock-absorbent front bumper into the design, and elected for both larger and smaller wheels, having [...] "always thought that vehicles with a large number of wheels looked more interesting on screen". For realism, air <b>vents</b> and <b>grilles</b> were added in lieu of windows; a tail fin was inserted to fulfil Meddings' vision of a [...] "menacing, shark-like", ten-wheeled assault vehicle.|$|R
25|$|In 1906, Mauretania was {{launched}} by the Duchess of Roxburghe. At {{the time of her}} launch, she was the largest moving structure ever built, and slightly larger in gross tonnage than Lusitania. The main visual differences between Mauretania and Lusitania were that Mauretania was five feet longer and had different vents (Lusitania had oil drum-shaped vents, which proved fragile on winter runs and were eventually replaced with the <b>cowl</b> design <b>vents</b> of her sister ship). Mauretania also had two extra stages of turbine blades in her forward turbines, making her slightly faster than Lusitania. Mauretania and Lusitania were the only ships with direct-drive steam turbines to hold the Blue Riband; in later ships, reduction-geared turbines were mainly used. Mauretanias usage of the steam turbine was the largest application yet of the then-new technology, developed by Charles Algernon Parsons. During speed trials, these engines caused significant vibration at high speeds; in response, Mauretania received strengthening members aft and redesigned propellers before entering service, which reduced vibration.|$|R
5000|$|The 1934 Model 355D was {{completely}} restyled and mounted on {{an entirely new}} chassis but used the same engine as in 1933. The Model 355 was divided into three series, the Series 10, 20 and 30. Bodies on the Series 10 and 20 were built by Fisher and on the Series 30 by Fleetwood. The bodies on the Series 30 were shared with the Cadillac V-12 and V-16. Styling emphasized streamlining, including concealment of all chassis features except the wheels. Body construction was improved for better insulation against engine heat and reduction of engine, road and wind noise. Bumpers were a stylish but ineffective biplane design, mounted against telescoping springs. The grille was V-shaped and sloping, set into a painted shell. Although restricted use of chrome was {{a feature of the}} overall ornamentation, a chrome plated radiator shell was available as an option. Horns and radiator filler cap were concealed under the hood. Teardrop Guide Multibeam headlights were mounted on streamlined supports attached to the fenders. Parking lamps were mounted on the headlight supports. Airfoil shaped fenders were brought low over the chassis. The hood sills were high with the entire fender shape molded into the radiator shell. A curious horizontal crease broke the nose contour of the fenders. Hoods extending nearly to the windshield carried shutter-type louvers in the side panel. Windshields were fixed and steeply sloping; 18 degrees on Fisher bodies, 25 degrees flat or a 29.5 degree V on Fleetwood bodies. <b>Cowl</b> <b>vents</b> opened toward the windshield; one vent on flat windshield bodies, two vents projecting through openings in the hood on V-shaped windshield bodies. Bodies were 2.0 in lower than on previous models. Added passenger space in the front compartment was achieved by moving the hand brake lever {{to the left of the}} driver, under the instrument panel. Rear fenders were airfoil shaped and carried rear lights that matched the headlights. The gas tank filler was on the left side at the rear of the body, on Fleetwood bodies in the left rear fender. All bodies featured beaver tail deck that completely covered the chassis. On Fleetwood bodies the spare was concealed under the rear deck, unless optional fender mounts were specified. Independent front suspension was introduced, called [...] "knee-action". Engine horsepower increased to 120.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an effort}} to extend a line growing {{obsolete}} {{in the face of}} advances in sports car design, Allard introduced an 'improved' model in late 1951, the J2X (extended). The chassis remained unchanged from the previous J2 (Tom Lush, Allard the inside story) but in an attempt to improve handling, the front suspension's rear attaching radius rods were redesigned with forward ones, which required a forward cross member and extending the nose out past the front wheels. This, in turn, allowed the engine to be moved forward, yielding more cockpit room. There is often confusion when it comes to identification of J2 and J2X types because they are seemingly very similar. However, the most obvious differences are that the J2 nose does not extend past the front tyres and has two <b>vents</b> below the <b>grille,</b> while the J2X nose has a more protruding chin with a single <b>vent</b> below the <b>grille,</b> which, as explained extends out past the front tyres. Allard historian Tom Lush, who was Sydney Allard's Personal Assistant and Allard employee from the beginning, said in his definitive book [...] "Allard: The Inside Story" [...] that the chin was the most obvious difference between the two models. In standard form the spare wheel was carried hidden on top of the rear-mounted fuel tank, but either version could carry one or two side mounted optional spares. This allowed the use of a 40 gallon long distance fuel tank.|$|R
5000|$|B1807 - Pup under {{restoration}} to airworthy condition. Built by Standard Motors in 1917 {{and delivered}} to a Home Defence squadron. This aircraft was originally {{fitted with a}} 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome Monosoupape engine, along with the distinctive three-quarter <b>vented</b> <b>cowling.</b> It was refitted by the 80 hp (60 kW) Le Rhône engine sometime in 1918. B1807 was sold at Croydon in 1920 and entered the civil register as G-EAVX. It appeared on 16 July at the 1921 Aerial Derby at Hendon, where it was groundlooped by its pilot. The wings were removed and the fuselage disappeared until 1973, when the current owner discovered {{the remains of the}} aircraft in a barn in Dorset.|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} {{determination}} of {{boundaries of the}} flow from a benchmark automotive vent (right-front situated – {{in front of a}} front passenger) using the smoke visualization. In this thesis is tested a pack of eight different constructional variants which differ among them by the type of deflection grille. The angles of the flow borders are compared to specific directional requirements (defined by ŠKODA AUTO a. s.) and there is evaluated a directability of each of the constructional variant on the bases of these results. The results of experiments show that better directability in vertical plane achieve deflection grilles with horizontal vanes situated closer to orifice of the <b>vent</b> or deflection <b>grilles</b> with higher number of horizontal vanes and lower number of vertical vanes (independently of their location). Directability of the deflection grilles in horizontal plane is analogically better with vertical vanes situated closer to orifice of the vent or with deflection grilles with higher number of vertical vanes and lower number of horizontal vanes (independently of their location) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, a new variant was launched, named V12 GT or V12 GTA when {{equipped}} with an automatic transmission. It was essentially an improved version of the Vantage, its V12 engine producing [...] and [...] of torque for the manual GT, although the automatic GTA retained the [...] and [...] of torque of the standard DB7 Vantage. Additionally, the GT and GTA chassis had substantially updated suspension from the DB7 Vantage models. Aesthetically, compared to the Vantage it has a mesh front <b>grille,</b> <b>vents</b> in the bonnet (hood), a boot (trunk) spoiler, an aluminium gear lever, optional carbon fibre trim and new wheels. It also has 355 mm front and 330 mm rear vented disc brakes made by Brembo. When being tested by Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear in 2003, he demonstrated the car's ability to pull away in fourth gear and continue until it hit the rev limiter: the speedometer indicated 135 mi/h km/h. Production of the GT and GTA was extremely limited, as only 190 GT's and 112 GTA's were produced worldwide and only 64 GTs and 17 GTAs were shipped to the US market, {{out of a total}} of 302 cars.|$|R
