40|$|A {{variety of}} {{existing}} studies have characterized the <b>chemical</b> <b>compositions</b> in particulate matters (PM) for various megacities. However, these studies rarely {{accounted for the}} size-dependence of chemical constituents in PM, hindering {{the application of the}} data for inhalation exposure assessment and thus epidemiological studies. In this work, a series of field measurements were conducted to characterize the major emission sources of Singapore, i. e. traffic and industry emissions (coal combustion is rare in Singapore and thus disregarded). The particle size distribution and corresponding size-dependent <b>chemical</b> <b>compositions</b> were identified. Existing respiratory deposition models were employed to analyze the deposition distributions of particles and <b>chemical</b> <b>compositions</b> in the human respiratory system, based on the data of particle size and <b>chemical</b> <b>compositions.</b> Finally, potential protection suggestions were proposed to mitigate the PM exposure for susceptible populations.

5|$|Other {{factors that}} broaden the main {{sequence}} band on the HR diagram include {{uncertainty in the}} distance to stars {{and the presence of}} unresolved binary stars that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity. Variations in <b>chemical</b> <b>composition</b> caused by the initial abundances, the star's evolutionary status, interaction with a close companion, rapid rotation, or a magnetic field can all slightly change a main-sequence star's HR diagram position, {{to name just a few}} factors. As an example, there are metal-poor stars (with a very low abundance of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium) that lie just below the main sequence and are known as subdwarfs. These stars are fusing hydrogen in their cores and so they mark the lower edge of main sequence fuzziness caused by variance in <b>chemical</b> <b>composition.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{inherited}} its <b>chemical</b> <b>composition</b> {{from the}} interstellar medium out of which it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and the heavier elements were produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in generations of stars that completed their stellar evolution and returned their material to {{the interstellar medium}} before {{the formation of the}} Sun. The <b>chemical</b> <b>composition</b> of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System. However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere. Therefore, in today's photosphere the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). The protostellar Sun's composition {{is believed to have been}} 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.|$|E

Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the three-domain system: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally Eubacteria) and Eukaryota (including protists, fungi, plants, and animals) These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the <b>chemical</b> <b>composition</b> of key biomolecules such as ribosomes.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in <b>chemical</b> <b>composition,</b> these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E
