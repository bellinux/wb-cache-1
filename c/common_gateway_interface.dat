5|$|PHP code may be {{embedded}} into HTML or HTML5 markup, {{or it can}} be used {{in combination}} with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a <b>Common</b> <b>Gateway</b> <b>Interface</b> (CGI) executable. The web server software combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{significance}} of the Internet, {{as a tool for}} health researchers has yet to be determined. Although search engines have been developed to use the Internet in health database information retrieval, the current practice is for health researchers to use the Internet as a billboard to post facts and information. This paper describes a model for design, which has been used to extend the Internet's capabilities in health research beyond the elementary posting of facts through to the collection of data. The benefits of combining a scripting language with a <b>common</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>interfacing</b> software are exemplified through an application in academic research...|$|R
40|$|The {{expansion}} of the Internet has supported the development of online teaching resources based on this communication media (e-learning). However, the possibility to run experiments on remoteaccessible Labs, in a teaching context, is a more recent fact. This paper describes the framework for delivering through the Web, a course on Design for Debug and Test that contains several practical exercises involving {{the use of the}} IEEE 1149. 1 and 1149. 4 test infrastructures. The exercises are done in a remote-accessible Lab, installed at our facilities, through a simple interface readable on any web browser. By using a complete Java-based solution, {{there is no need for}} installing any sort of plug-ins at the client computer as it happens in other similar approaches that require some sort of downloading extra software or the development of <b>Common</b> <b>Gateway</b> <b>Interfaces</b> (CGIs). info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The World-Wide Web (WWW) {{changes the}} way people {{retrieve}} information from the Internet. The Web {{is regarded as a}} public information system which offers access to the network community with the client/server protocol Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The Web uses client interface programs (browsers), hypertext and multimedia techniques to make it easy for anyone to roam, browse, and contribute to the information base. However, most information available on the Web is read-only, frozen messages. The introduction of HTML Fill-out Forms and <b>Common</b> <b>Gateway</b> <b>Interfaces</b> changes this situation. In this thesis we explore supplying dynamic information to users through the Web. We build an environment on the Web using CGI and HTML forms. This environment uses forms to let the user interact with the Web server, and generates text, pages and hyper links on the Web based on the users 2 ̆ 7 requirements. This environment is accessible to all authorized users and the information in it is changeable. An changes are visible immediately to all users. Applications of the environment are described.

500|$|There are {{two primary}} ways for adding support for PHP to a web server {{as a native}} web server module, or as a CGI executable. [...] PHP has a direct module {{interface}} called Server Application Programming Interface (SAPI), which is supported by many web servers including Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS, Netscape (now defunct) and iPlanet. [...] Some other web servers, such as OmniHTTPd, support the Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI), which is a Microsoft's web server module interface. [...] If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always {{be used as a}} <b>Common</b> <b>Gateway</b> <b>Interface</b> (CGI) or FastCGI processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files.|$|E
