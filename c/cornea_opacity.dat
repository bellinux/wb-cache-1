In addition to comprehensive ophthalmic examination, health-seeking behavior and use of self-medication and TEM was assessed in the adult population using a semi-structured questionnaire. Physical verification of available ophthalmic medications in the enumerated households was conducted by the study team. Descriptive statistics were computed along with multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine associated factors for use of self-medication and TEM. Of the 2160 participants interviewed, 396 (18. 2 %) reported using ophthalmic medications without consulting an ophthalmologist, mainly for symptoms like watering (37. 1 %), redness (27. 7 %), itching (19. 2 %) and infection (13. 6 %). On physical verification of available eye drops that were being used without prescription, 26. 4 % participants were practicing self-medication.

A mean of 12 +/- 11 and 0. 033 +/- 0. 025 Joules was required to complete an iridotomy with the argon and Nd:YAG lasers, respectively. Thirty percent of the argon iridotomies became sufficiently closed with pigment to require retreatment; whereas none of the Nd:YAG iridotomies closed. A postoperative rise in IOP greater than 10 mm Hg was seen in 38 % argon- and 29 % Nd:YAG-treated eyes. Although bleeding around the iridotomy occurred in 48 % of eyes, in no case was this of significant consequence. No acute lens damage was observed in the Nd:YAG-treated human eyes, while 43 % of lenses in the argon group had focal opacities. Thirty-three percent of Nd:YAG- and 24 % of argon-treated eyes had focal, nonprogressive corneal opacities above the iridotomy.

40|$|AbstractUser-centered {{design is}} a wide term on {{describing}} end-users influence on the shaping of a particular design process. Wayfinding {{is one of the}} design projects where user-centered design methodologies are necessary and applied. There is a need in defining the circulation axes and the specific areas of a determined environment and this requires a survey of who are those who will use that specific space or building and how they perceive it. A more specific evaluation is needed when projecting a wayfinding system for a hospital, and even more for an ophthalmological hospital. Concerning this last one, a varied group of users will use that particular space, from the person with normal vision until the visual impaired and specifically older people. In this case a evaluation of visual and of other senses perception is needed in order to create an organizational distribution system to be interpreted by all users specifically those with vision difficulties. Visual impaired persons are mainly the elderly and most of the pathologies observed are related with aging and the loss of vision capacities. Common to these eye pathologies, such as the loss of the visual field, are the <b>cornea</b> <b>opacity</b> resulting in a blurred vision and the yellowing of the cornea that alters color perception. The use of user-sensing evaluation process will help us in the definition of the senses that more efficiently promote the interpretation and usage of a particular space. For that purpose a participatory design methodology will be required through interviews and tests done to the potential users in order to create the necessary data that will define the guidelines for the wayfinding project development. This user-sensing design evaluation, waysensing, will focus on color and background contrast color definition for the written material and also on floor stripes; on the legibility and readability, by evaluating the most efficient typefaces, text sizes and letter spacing and on the haptic evaluation of foot touch and its relation with dexterity and balance.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} Fourier-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (FD-OCT) as {{an adjunct}} to traditional slit lamp examination of donor corneas with suspected Anterior Stromal <b>Opacities.</b> Methods. Seven <b>corneas</b> suspected of having anterior stromal opacities by slit lamp examination were evaluated with FD-OCT. Each cornea was evaluated to confirm the presence of opacity and, if present, the depth of opacity was measured. Results. The opacity depth ranged from 82 [*]μm to 624 [*]μm. The initial slit lamp impressions of five of the seven corneas were confirmed by OCT. In two corneas, the OCT findings were different from the initial slit lamp impressions. Slit lamp examination of the first cornea gave the impression of anterior stromal scarring, but OCT showed that the opacity was limited to the epithelium. Slit lamp examination of the second <b>cornea</b> suggested <b>opacity</b> limited to the epithelium, but OCT identified significant sub-Bowman's scarring. In all cases, the Eye Bank Technicians reported that the location and depth of corneal opacity were more sharply defined by OCT than by slit lamp. Conclusion. The high resolution of OCT makes it easier to determine the location of corneal opacities compared to slit lamp examinations.

40|$|The {{transparency}} {{of the human}} cornea is vital in maintaining vision. The cells on the surface, corneal epithelium cells, are constantly replaced by differentiated limbal stem cells. Damage to the limbus can cause a deficiency in the limbal stem cell population which can cause <b>cornea</b> <b>opacity</b> and vascularisation consequently leading to blindness. Currently limbal stem cell deficiency can be detected clinically and treated surgically by transplanting stem cells onto the damaged cornea. However, the long term success rate is low 68 % and the results vary from patient to patient. There is an interest to understand the cause for this variability in results and the low long term success rates. The aim {{of the project was}} to develop an Ultrahigh resolution OCT (UHROCT) to locate the transplanted corneal epithelium cells. Optical Coherence Tomography system (OCT) is a non-invasive micron resolution imaging technique that can image several millimetres in tissue. The cells to be transplanted are labelled with super paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. After uptake these SPIO embedded cells are displaced with an external magnetic field at a known frequency whilst being imaged by the UHROCT. This technique known as phased resolved magnetomotive OCT, allowed us to locate the oscillating nanoparticle which is embedded in the cell by detecting the location of the modulation frequency. For the Ultrahigh resolution OCT a super luminescent diode (SLD) light with centre wavelength at 890 e- 9 m and a bandwidth of 150 e- 9 m. The system has an axial and lateral resolution of 2. 5 μm and 6. 20 μm in air respectively. The system was able to detect as low as 1273 SPIO loaded cells/ mm^ 2 on rabbit cornea. The spectral domain UHROCT constructed was also used to image 3 D oral mucosa constructs. The system shows superior contrast in comparison to 1310 nm swept source systems. The UHROCT was able to identify key difference between the normal, dysplastic and malignant construct. For the malignant construct Cal 27 ’s, hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to confirm the formation of a keratinized superficial layer. The keratinized layer was presented as a hyper-reflective thickened layer superficial to a darker region on both OCT platforms. This keratinized layer causes a sharp fall in the signal in the UHROCT making it difficult to visualise the underlying structures of the construct...|$|E

Ipsilateral rotational autokeratoplasty can be an effective alternative to penetrating allokeratoplasty for some patients with corneal scars. This procedure involves a rotation of the patient%u 2019 s own <b>cornea</b> to move <b>opacity</b> out of the visual axis. An important consideration when selecting cases for rotational autokeratoplasty is the dimensions of the corneal scar. Although ipsilateral autokeratoplasty may not provide as good a quality of vision as penetrating allokeratoplasty because of higher astigmatism and reduced corneal pupillary clear zone, these disadvantages are often outweighed when the risk of allograft rejection is high, as in pediatric patients and those with vascularised corneas. This technique would at least partially resolve the issue of scarcity of donor corneal tissue in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Producción CientíficaThe aim of {{this work}} is to provide {{experimental}} data for corneal transparency and scattering to help create a more complete model of corneal transparency. The scattered light in 96 healing hen corneas was measured for three wavelengths by a scatterometer constructed in the Optics Laboratory (The University of Valladolid, Spain). With the help of mirrors and beamsplitters, {{the light from the}} three lasers is directed toward the cell containing the sample to be measured. The measured scattered light varies between six orders of magnitude. Corneal transmissivity, mean cosine of a scattering angle, and angular distribution of scattered light were all computed. The total transmitted light remained practically constant over a wide range of light values transmitted in a forward direction (direct transmissivity). The value of the mean cosine of the scattering direction is very close to the unit (g 40 : 98), even in <b>corneas</b> with high <b>opacities.</b> The behavior of g indicates that even damaged corneas evidence extremely small scattering, compared to other biological tissues. The transmission reduction of each cornea is related to an increase in scattered light. In all cases, scattered light is concentrated at very small angles. This behavior is acceptable in corneas that are healthy or which evidence small lesions, but remains in corneas that are severely injured...|$|R
40|$|This {{intriguing}} {{case report}} provides novel images and {{a description of}} the anterior and rarer posterior segment findings seen in ocular inflammation associated with tarantula spider hair exposure. We present an interventional case report of a 9 -year-old boy who presented with a red, sore eye. Slit lamp examination revealed right eye injection, multiple small hairs at differing levels of the <b>cornea</b> with associated <b>opacities</b> and inflammation within the anterior and posterior segments of the eye. Only after detailed and repeated questioning did the aetiology become apparent. Conservative management in the form of topical steroid and antibiotics was commenced and he did well with no obvious sequelae in the medium term. Healthcare personnel (and indeed pet shop owners, arachnid enthusiasts and even parents) {{should be aware of the}} potential ocular complications of tarantula hair exposure and clinicians should perhaps specifically ask about pet-keeping when presented with an unusual red eye.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of vitamin C supplementation on reducing the size of corneal opacity resulting from infectious keratitis. The study included 82 patients (82 affected eyes), admitted for infectious keratitis from January 2009 to August 2013, who were followed for more than 3 months. Patients were divided into control, oral vitamin C (3 g/d), and intravenous vitamin C (20 g/d) groups during hospitalization. Corneal opacity sizes were measured using anterior segment photographs and Image J program (version 1. 27; National Institutes of Health, Jinju, South Korea) at admission, discharge, and final follow-up. The corneal opacity size used for analysis was the measured opacity size divided by the size of the whole <b>cornea.</b> The corneal <b>opacity</b> size decreased by 0. 03 0. 10 in the oral vitamin C group, 0. 07 0. 22 in the intravenous vitamin C group, and 0. 02 0. 15 in the control group. Intravenous vitamin C reduced the corneal opacity size more than oral vitamin C (P 0. 043). Intravenous vitamin C produced greater reduction in corneal opacity size in younger patients (P 0. 015) and those with a hypopyon (P 0. 036). Systemic vitamin C supplementation reduced the size of corneal opacity resulting from infectious keratitis. Intravenous vitamin C was more beneficial than oral supplementation, especially in younger patients and those with hypopyon.

40|$|To {{validate}} tissue quality {{parameters for}} donor corneas designated for emergency grafting for corneal graft survival. In a longitudinal cohort follow-up study, 131 emergency penetrating grafts were studied. Grafts were performed {{with a pool}} of organ-cultured donor corneas designated for emergency grafting and prepared for immediate use with all safety tests performed. Assignation criteria were: corneas with a small superficial stromal opacity but meeting all selection criteria for PKP tissue and <b>corneas</b> without stromal <b>opacity,</b> but an endothelial cell density from 1800 to 2300 cells/mm(2) or mild polymegathism or pleomorphism. Cox multivariate regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival and log rank test were applied. Of the 131 keratoplasties, 115 could be followed. One eye was lost during surgery because of an expulsive bleeding. In 15 cases, a conjunctival transplantation finished off the penetrating graft. Corneal graft survival was not {{significantly related to the}} presence of PKP quality of the donor endothelium, neither with a cloudy graft nor with endothelial decompensation as the cause of failure. Main risk factors for a failed graft were vascularization of the host cornea (p= 0. 0001), the presence of a systemic auto immune disease in the recipient (p= 0. 003) and the disease leading to the (imminent) perforation and emergency graft (p= 0. 021). A selected pool of donor corneas designated for emergency grafting that does not interfere with the scheduled procedures allows more efficient and safe use of donor tissue in case of a(n) (imminent) perforation.

In a longitudinal cohort follow-up study, 151 emergency grafts in the Netherlands were studied. Grafts were performed with a pool of organ-cultured donor corneas designated for emergency grafting and prepared for immediate use with all safety tests performed. Assignation criteria were corneas with a small superficial stromal opacity but meeting all selection criteria for penetrating keratoplasty tissue and <b>corneas</b> without stromal <b>opacity</b> but an endothelial cell density from 1800 to 2300 cells per square millimeter or mild polymegethism or pleomorphism. Cox multivariate regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival, and log rank test were applied. All requests for corneal tissue were honored within 24 hours. Ninety-one patients showed a complete and 60 an imminent perforation. One hundred thirty-one penetrating grafts and 20 lamellar grafts have been used. The globes were saved in 140 of the 151 patients (92. 7 %). Globe preservation was not {{significantly related to the}} absence of penetrating keratoplasty quality of the donor endothelium, the type of grafting, the degree of vascularization in the host cornea, or diabetic disease in the recipient. The main risk factor for globe preservation was the presence of a systemic autoimmune disease in the recipient (P = 0. 0021).
