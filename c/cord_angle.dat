40|$|Abstract. Air {{spring is}} used for the {{suspension}} system and it affects the vehicle stability and riding comfort by improving the impact-relief, braking, and cornering performance. Air Spring is comprised of the upper plate, lower plate, and rubber sleeve. Rubber sleeve is the composite material, which is made up of combination of rubber and Nylon, and the characteristics are changed according to the shape of rubber-sleeve, the angle of reinforcement cord. In this study, the distribution of internal stresses and the deformation of rubber composite material are analyzed through the nonlinear finite element method. The result showed that the internal maximum stresses and deformations about the changes of <b>cord</b> <b>angle</b> caused the more the Young's modulus decrease, the more maximum stress reduced...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{finite element}} and experimental results for single ply strips of unidirectional cord-rubber composite using {{two types of}} finite elements: rubber elements and cord-rubber elements. The finite element model {{takes into account the}} large strain and nonlinear behavior of the rubber material, bimodular material behavior and geometrical nonlinear behavior due to reorientations of the cords. To illustrate the be-havior of strips of single ply composites, results are presented in the form of load-displacement, deformed shapes and cord strains for three polyester cord rubber composite specimens. It is shown that the rubber between cords may contract or bulge, depending on the <b>cord</b> <b>angle.</b> The effect of the material models for rubber material and cord-rubber com-posite material on the load displacement behavior is also presented. Utilizing this finite el-ement model and critical tearing energy criterion, an attempt is made to predict the critical loads for crack growth initiation and final fracture for four cracked rubber composite spec-imens. All the finite element results are compared to experimental data with relatively good agreement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The article {{deals with}} {{experimental}} modelling of single-layer long-fibre composite structures with a non-linear matrix and a steel reinforcement {{in the form}} of a wire or twisted wire. These specific composites are used in radial automobile tires as steel-belt layers. The article also deals with the design of the shape and geometric parameters of composite specimens taking into account the type of testing machine. The design was necessary since the shapes and parameters of the specimens for different forms of loading are not standardized. Presented as examples of experimental modelling of composite specimens are results of tensile tests of single-layer specimens with selected <b>cord</b> <b>angles</b> with respect to the loading direction simultaneously with a variety of specimen widths...|$|R
40|$|An {{existing}} fan {{stage was}} redesigned to reduce stator lift fluctuations and was acoustically tested at three nozzle sizes for reduced noise generation. The lift fluctuations on the stator were reduced {{by increasing the}} stator <b>cord,</b> adjusting incidence <b>angles,</b> and adjusting the rotor velocity diagrams. Broadband noise levels were signficantly reduced in the middle to high frequencies. Blade passage tone sound power was not lessened, but decreases in the harmonics were observed. Aerodynamic improvements in both performance and efficiency were obtained...|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{the fabric}} was built up {{on a flat}} steel drum, with the <b>cords</b> at <b>angles</b> of about +60 and −60 degrees from the {{direction}} of travel, so they criss-crossed over each other. They were called cross ply or bias ply tires. The plies were turned up around the steel wire beads and the combined tread/sidewall applied. The green (uncured) tire was loaded over a curing bladder and shaped into the mold. This shaping process caused the cords in the tire to assume an S-shape from bead to bead. The angle under the tread, the crown angle, stretched down to about 36 degrees. In the sidewall region the angle was 45 degrees, and in the bead it remained at 60 degrees. The low crown angle gave rigidity to support the tread and the high sidewall angle gave comfort. To increase strength, the manufacturer would increase the number of plies, and the heat buildup in the tire.|$|R
5000|$|Danger! - Andrew and {{the experts}} {{comment on what}} they {{considered}} the most dangerous thing that they had seen on the show, and the most common handyman mistake that they had seen on the show. Andrew believes that Deen's initial entry {{last year was the}} most dangerous (so much so that the camera crew had to intervene), before changing his mind and saying the massive plumbing leak in last year's group challenge as the kitchen was installed when he mentions destroying toilets with a sledgehammer as his most common handyman mistake. Geoff's nomination of the most dangerous thing was Joe [...] "The Bullets demolition work in his first year as an expert and his indiscriminate use of the sledgehammer which ultimately caused him to intervene, while he names mismeasuring as the most common handyman mistake. Gail names the incidents in last year's group challenges where Deen repeatedly drops a power <b>cord</b> of an <b>angle</b> grinder into a puddle, only to get shocked as he tries to pick it up as the most dangerous. Her candidate on what the most common handyman mistake is a lack of effort into planning ahead. All three agree that not reading and following instructions, however, {{is by far the most}} common cause of handyman mistakes; Andrew even believes that it happens at least once an episode in each of the six seasons.|$|R
40|$|Spinal {{shortening}} {{is performed}} {{for a wide}} spectrum of diseases. This study was designed to investigate the morphologic effects of shortening on the spinal cord, to enlighten the amount and direction of the sliding of the cord, the alteration of the angles of the roots, and to identify the appropriate laminectomy length. Total vertebrectomy of T 12 was applied to ten sheep models after spinal instrumentation. Gradual shortening was applied to five sheep; then, the degree and direction of the sliding of the spinal <b>cord</b> and the <b>angles</b> of the adjacent roots were measured. On five other sheep, additional sagittal sectioning was performed via excision of the pedicles. Measurements were taken at different laminectomy lengths to record kinking of the spinal cord with gradual shortening. The mean sliding of the spinal cord was 9  mm cranially and 7. 8  mm caudally. T 11 spinal nerves became more vertical caudally, and T 12 spinal nerves achieved an ascending position with gradual shortening. Both T 11 and T 12 spinal nerves were sharply bent in the foramen and on the pedicle of T 13, respectively. In full-length shortening, the mean kink of the spine in the sagittal plane was 92. 4 ° for two levels of hemi-laminectomies, 24. 6 ° for complete laminectomy of T 11 with hemilaminectomy of T 13, and 20. 2 ° for two levels of complete laminectomies. The slippage of the cord is dominant in the earlier stages and kinking is dominant in later stages of shortening. Increasing the laminectomy length by only a half or one level prevents excessive kinking and compressions at the upper and lower margins of the laminectomy. In the later stages of shortening, the spinal nerves near the vertebrectomy site are at risk because of the sharp bending of the nerves. This study describes the mechanism of the sliding and kinking of the cord due to gradual shortening of the spine, which might be useful in spinal surgery procedures. It also states {{that it is possible to}} avoid excessive kinking by planning the appropriate technique of laminectomy style in full-length shortening...|$|R
