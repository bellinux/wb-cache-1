Lycopene is fat-soluble, so the oil is said to help absorption. Gac is a possible commercial source of lycopene {{for the purposes of}} extraction and purification, as its seed content of lycopene is high. Another source of lycopene is the fungus Blakeslea trispora.|$|E
25|$|With the {{discovery}} of the importance of airtight containers for food preservation by French inventor Nicholas Appert, the tin <b>canning</b> <b>process</b> was patented by British merchant Peter Durand in 1810. After receiving the patent, Durand did not himself follow up with canning food. He sold his patent in 1812 to two other Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who refined the process and product and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813, they were producing the first canned goods for the Royal Navy.|$|E
25|$|The {{capital of}} the Maldives, Malé {{is known for its}} busy fish markets. Fish is an {{integral}} part of the Maldivian diet and it is a common sight to see office workers in formal white shirts and ties on bicycles after work taking skipjack home to eat. Trolleys packed full of fresh tuna or skipjack are carted around in door to door sales. Tuna however is the most important fish, and in recent years in the Maldives the industry has become more efficient, using tuna waste and residue to be processed into fishmeal, an animal food supplement, further contributing to the economy. The tuna industry in the Maldives has been greatly helped by The State Trading Organisation which rebuilt the efficient tuna cannery plant on the island of Felivaru. The <b>canning</b> <b>process</b> typically takes four days, and the plant has the benefits of modern technology and even a laboratory for research and quality control.|$|E

500|$|The use {{of water}} as a coolant raised the problem of {{corrosion}} and oxidation of the aluminum tubing. The Metallurgical Laboratory tested various additives to the water to determine their effect. It was found that corrosion was minimized when the water was slightly acidic, so dilute sulfuric acid {{was added to the}} water to give it a pH of 6.5. Other additives such as sodium silicate, sodium dichromate and oxalic acid [...] were also introduced to the water to prevent a build up of film that could inhibit the circulation of the cooling water. The fuel slugs were given a jacket of aluminum to protect the uranium metal from corrosion that would occur if it came into contact with the water, and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive fission products that might be formed when they were irradiated. Aluminum was chosen because the cladding had to transmit heat but not absorb too many neutrons. The aluminum <b>canning</b> <b>process</b> was given close attention, as ruptured slugs could jam or damage the channels in the reactor, and the smallest holes could vent radioactive gases. The Metallurgical Laboratory investigated production and testing regimes for the <b>canning</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

Alvin Weinberg noted that Szilard served as the project [...] "gadfly", asking all the embarrassing questions. Szilard provided important insights. While uranium-238 did not fission readily with slow, moderated neutrons, it might still fission with the fast neutrons produced by fission. This effect was small but crucial. Szilard made suggestions that improved the uranium <b>canning</b> <b>process,</b> and worked with David Gurinsky and Ed Creutz on a method for recovering uranium from its salts.|$|E
2500|$|The tin <b>canning</b> <b>process</b> was {{allegedly}} created by Frenchman Philippe de Girard {{and the idea}} passed to British merchant Peter Durand who {{was used as an}} agent to patent Girard's idea in 1810. [...] The canning concept was based on experimental food preservation work in glass containers the year before by the French inventor Nicholas Appert. Durand did not pursue food canning, but, in 1812, sold his patent to two Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who refined the process and product, and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London.

50|$|These {{coatings}} {{have made}} it possible for both beverages and food products to maintain both taste and quality, therefore extending their shelf life. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a main component in epoxy resins.

The average amount of BPA taken in a day is 0.00011 milligrams per kg body weight per day, about 450 times less than the ‘acceptable’ dose of 0.05 milligrams per kg body weight per day.|$|E
