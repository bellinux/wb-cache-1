40|$|The {{effect of}} metalliferous grains on {{electrical}} comminution efficiency was investigated by comparative experiments using natural rocks and synthetic samples. The result {{indicated that the}} existence of metalliferous grains affects the breakage probability and product size distribution of electrical comminution. On average, metalliferous grains increased the breakage probability of particle in the first pulse discharge by 55 % and generated finer product at the <b>coarse</b> <b>end.</b> As a result, particles with metalliferous grains exhibited higher energy efficiency than that without metalliferous grain in electrical comminution. A positive linear relation between product fineness and specific energy in electrical comminution was observed. With the assistance of numerical simulation on the electrical field distribution of ore particle, the role of metalliferous grains in electrical comminution is confirmed and the mechanism of metalliferous grains effect is elucidated. Understanding of the effect of metalliferous grains on electrical comminution is important to evaluate the feasibility of applying electrical comminution to ores with different mineral composition, and to understand the breakage behavior in electrical comminution...|$|E
40|$|Megaclasts (giant clastic deposits) – {{replacing}} ‘blocks’, ‘slabs ’ and ‘monoliths ’ on {{the extended}} Wentworth grain-size scale for sedimentary particles. The expanded Wentworth grain-size scale {{is an important}} tool for classifying the size of sedimentary particles, as used in geology, geomorphology and related disciplines. Unfortunately, however, existing terminology at the <b>coarse</b> <b>end</b> of the scale is problematic. In particular, the current terms ‘‘block’ ’ and ‘‘slab’ ’ are applied to specific particle size ranges, {{in spite of these}} terms also being widely used to describe particle shape and appearing in standard diagrams of particle form. This dual usage of “block” and “slab ” terminology is therefore undesirable and {{may have contributed to the}} lack of strict adherence to the upper end of the Wentworth scale. This has resulted in part in the appearance of a number of alternative expressions over recent years for describing very large clasts, some of which are not well defined. The best solution to this problem is to abandon shape-related terms entirely from the Wentworth grain-size scale. Instead, it is recommended that they be replaced with an incremental system based on the prefixes “meso- “ and “macro- “ to classify very large boulder size ranges (Figure 1). Both size and shape classification of very coarse sediments can be achieved simultaneously in this way withou...|$|E

Arkose usually contains small amounts of calcite cement, which causes it to 'fizz' slightly in dilute hydrochloric acid; sometimes the cement also contains iron oxide. Arkose is typically grey to reddish in colour. The sand grains making up an arkose may range from fine to very coarse, but tend toward the <b>coarser</b> <b>end</b> of the scale.

40|$|Flotation {{works very}} well for {{particles}} that are typically in the range 20 to 150 μm in diameter, for base metal ores. In this range, {{it is possible to}} obtain quite high recoveries in conventional flotation machines. Outside this range, the recoveries decline progressively, whether it is with the very fine or the <b>coarse</b> <b>end</b> of the size spectrum. In this paper, the reasons for the drop-off in recovery are briefly reviewed, together with strategies for future work. Recent progress in the author's laboratory is described. This includes the Concorde CellTM, which takes advantage of the high dissipation rates in the shock wave created when a gas-liquid mixture reaches supersonic velocities. The environment thus created is very beneficial for the flotation of ultra-fines. For coarse particles, the reasons for the drop-off in recovery can be related to the highly turbulent nature of the pulp in a conventional flotation cell. To improve recovery, it is necessary to find a way of bringing particles and bubbles into contact in a quiescent environment. A new process for coarse particle flotation is described in which a fluidized bed is created in the flotation cell. The flow conditions are very gentle and the high solids concentration leads to rapid rates of capture of the particles. Experimental results are presented. It is apparent that the maximum floatable size for coal and minerals can be increased by a factor of ten over the limits found in current practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{coarseness}} of the 10 - 63 µm terrigenous silt (i. e., sortable-silt) fraction {{tends to}} vary independently of sediment supply in current-sorted muds in the world's oceans, with coarser sediments representing relatively greater near-bottom flow speeds. Traditionally, the coarseness {{of this size}} fraction is described using an index called sortable-silt mean size (SS), which is an arithmetic average calculated from the differential volume or mass distribution of grains within the 10 - 63 µm terrigenous silt fraction, where the relative weights of the individual size bins become increasingly disproportionate, {{with respect to the}} actual number of grains within those size bins, toward the <b>coarse</b> <b>end</b> of the size range. This not only increases the absolute value of the apparent "mean size" within the 10 - 63 µm terrigenous silt fraction, but it may also affect the apparent pattern of relative changes in the coarseness of the sortable-silt fraction along the core. In addition, it makes SS more prone to biases due to, for example, analytical errors. Here we present a detailed analysis of grain-size distributions over three selected Holocene time intervals from two complementary sediment cores (JM 97 - 948 / 2 A and MD 95 - 2011), extracted from the center of a high-accumulation area along the flow path of the main branch of the Atlantic Inflow into the Nordic Seas and show that differential-number-based statistics, which likely better describes variations in the actual coarseness of the sortable-silt fraction, may provide a more robust alternative to SS...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{system was}} developed for the rapid measurement of the aspiration/transfer efficiency of aerosol samplers in a wind tunnel. We attempted to measure the aspiration and particle transfer characteristics of two inlets commonly used for sampling airborne Particulate Matter (PM) : the 'Total Suspended Particulate' or TSP inlet, and the louvered 'dichotomous sampler inlet' typically used in sampling PM 10 or PM 2. 5. We were able to determine the fraction of the external aerosol that enters the inlet and is transferred through it, and hence is available for collection by a filter, or further size fractionation into PM 10 or PM 2. 5. This 'sampling efficiency' was analysed {{as a function of}} dimensionless aerodynamic parameters {{in order to understand the}} factors governing inlet performance. We found that for the louvered inlet the sampling efficiency increases as the external wind increases. Under all conditions expected in practical use the louvered inlet aspirates sufficient PM to allow either PM 10 or PM 2. 5 to be selected downstream. The TSP inlet's sampling efficiency decreases with increasing external wind, and the TSP inlet is likely to under-sample the <b>coarse</b> <b>end</b> of the PM 10 fraction at moderate and high external winds. As this inlet is generally not used with a downstream size fractionator, changes in sampling efficiency directly affect the measured aerosol concentration. We also investigated whether it is possible to dimensionally scale the PM inlets to operate at either higher or lower flow rates, while preserving the same sampling characteristics as the current full-scale, 16. 67 L min(- 1) versions. In the case of the louvered inlet, our results indicate that scaling to lower flow rates is possible; scaling to higher flow rates was not tested. For the TSP sampler, the sampling efficiency changes if the sampler is scaled to operate at smaller or larger flow rates, leading to unreliable performance...|$|E

Three different prototypes of crushing chambers have been manufactured based on the conceptual designs obtained from theoretical optimizations.

40|$|The terrigenous {{fraction}} of sediments recovered from Walvis Ridge, SE Atlantic Ocean, reveals {{a history of}} southwestern African climate of the last 300 kyr. End-member modelling of a data set of grain-size distributions (n = 428) results in three end members. The two <b>coarsest</b> <b>end</b> members are interpreted as eolian dust, the third end member as hemipelagic mud. The ratio of the two eolian end members reflects the eolian grain size and is attributed to {{the intensity of the}} SE trade winds. Trade winds were intensified during glacials compared to interglacials. Changes in the ratio of the two eolian end members over the hemipelagic one are interpreted as variations in southwestern African aridity. Late Quaternary southwestern African climate was relatively arid during the interglacial stages and relatively humid during the glacial stages, owing to meridional shifts in the atmospheric circulation system. During glacials the polar front shifted equatorward, resulting in a northward displacement of the zone of westerlies, causing increased rainfall in southwestern Africa. The equatorward shift of the polar front is coupled with an increase of the meridional pressure gradient, leading to enhanced atmospheric circulation and increased trade-wind intensity. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Blast {{fragmentation}} {{can have}} a significant impact on the profitability of a mine. An optimum run of mine (ROM) size distribution is required to maximise the performance of downstream processes. If this fragmentation size distribution can be modelled and controlled, the operation will have made a significant advancement towards improving its performance. Blast fragmentation modelling is an important step in Mine to Mill™ optimisation. It allows the estimation of blast fragmentation distributions for a number of different rock mass, blast geometry, and explosive parameters. These distributions can then be modelled in downstream mining and milling processes to determine the optimum blast design. When a blast hole is detonated rock breakage occurs in two different stress regions - compressive and tensile. In the-first region, compressive stress waves form a 2 ̆ 7 crushed zone 2 ̆ 7 directly adjacent to the blast hole. The second region, termed the 2 ̆ 7 cracked zone 2 ̆ 7, occurs outside the crush one. The widely used Kuz-Ram model does not recognise these two blast regions. In the Kuz-Ram model the mean fragment size from the blast is approximated and is then used to estimate the remaining size distribution. Experience has shown that this model predicts the <b>coarse</b> <b>end</b> reasonably accurately, but it can significantly underestimate the amount of fines generated. As part of the Australian Mineral Industries Research Association (AMIRA) P 483 A Mine to Mill™ project, the Two-Component Model (TCM) and Crush Zone Model (CZM), developed by the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC), were compared and evaluated to measured ROM fragmentation distributions. An important criteria for this comparison was the variation of model results from measured ROM in the-fine to intermediate section (1 - 100 mm) of the fragmentation curve. This region of the distribution is important for Mine to Mill™ optimisation. The comparison of modelled and Split ROM fragmentation distributions has been conducted in harder ores (UCS greater than 80 MPa). Further work involves modelling softer ores. The comparisons will be continued with future site surveys to increase confidence in the comparison of the CZM and TCM to Split results. Stochastic fragmentation modelling will then be conducted to take into account variation of input parameters. A window of possible fragmentation distributions can be compared to those obtained by Split. Following this work, an improved fragmentation model will be developed in response to these findings...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} twofold; on the one hand it investigates the susceptibility to suffusion of glacial till, and, on the other, it presents approaches to evaluate internal erosion susceptibility of dams composed of this type of core soil. Concentrated leak erosion, backward erosion, contact erosion, and suffusion erosion are the mechanisms associated with the initiation of internal erosion. How these interplay in the continuation phase is still a relatively unresolved issue. In engineering practice, these mechanisms have all been seen in dams with glacial till cores; backward erosion activity as seen in Juktan dam, Juklavatn dam, Grundsjöndam, Wreck Cove dam, and in Brodhead dam; possible suffusion as seen in Lövön dam and in Stenkullafors dam; and, furthermore, signs indicating concentrated leaks, such as in Songa dam. A laboratory program of tests was performed on four natural, non-plastic glacial till soils from the core or its borrow area of existing earth dams in Sweden, and on eight mixtures based on these tills, making in total 12 tests. The longest running for 77 days, and the highest applied gradient was 9. 5, in bounds of what can occur in dam cores. The tests revealed that gradations of low fines content (§ 60 %) are susceptible to suffusion. These are grading characteristics present in the <b>coarse</b> <b>end</b> of the envelope of glacial till cores in many existing dams. Available state-of-the-art assessment criteria for internal stability were evaluated in reference to these experimental data, yielding a modification to the Kenney-Lau adaptation by Li-Fannin. Furthermore, a screening tool for the assessment of internal erosion of dams is proposed, i. e., the unified-plot approach, which combines attributes of the filter gradation and the probable occurrence of internal erosion in a dam. Given the variety of potential mechanism interplaying in the internal erosion of dams with cores of glacial till, it lend confidence to an assessment approach which addresses, susceptibility to several mechanisms.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{atomisation}} is introduced {{and related to}} granulation. Some processes applicable to ferroalloys are discussed, along with their limitations and advantages. Examples of applications of atomisation to the processing of ferroalloys, including ferrosilicon and ferromanganese {{for use in the}} welding industry and as injectable additions to steel or cast iron are also presented. The economics of the process and the impact of process scale are discussed, along with criteria for process selection and system design. 1. THE ATOMISATION PROCESS Atomisation is the breaking up of liquid into droplets (Fig 1). If a molten material is atomised into droplets, these normally cool rapidly to produce solid particles. Thus one could say that granulation and atomisation are conceptually identical, differing only in the size of particles produced. Granulation produces granules, which may loosely be defined as particles of the millimetre range (sometimes up to> 10 mm). Atomisation is normally taken, in a metallurgical context, to imply that the particles resulting are powder which can loosely be taken to mean substantially sub-millimetre range particles. In fact atomised metal powders are produced with sizes ranging from a few microns to a millimetre.

40|$|DEM {{models of}} fine {{grinding}} in ball and stirred mills have to date almost entirely {{focused on the}} motion of the media and their interaction with the mill configuration. For SAG mills, a large fraction of the feed material can now be accurately represented in DEM models. However, for other mill types with much finer feed materials, such as the second chamber of a cement ball mill, the vast numbers of feed particles makes their explicit inclusion in the models prohibitive. However, it is now feasible to model a periodic section of a laboratory scale ball mill and include the <b>coarser</b> <b>end</b> of the ore size distribution directly in the DEM model. This provides the opportunity to better understand the effect of media on the interstitial bed of powder and of the effect of the powder on the media. The effect of the powder fill level, which is varied between 0 % and 150 % of the pore space in the media charge, is explored. The distribution of the powder, its effect on power draw {{and the way in which}} it contributes to the pattern of energy utilisation is assessed. The simulation results are compared with experimental results from a test at similar ball loading and rotation rate and for several size fractions of ore at a range of powder fill fractions. Tracking the collision histories of specific ore particles within the charge allows estimates of the probability (per unit time) of collision between media and ore particles (the “Selection” function) and of the intensity of each collision which can be used to estimate the severity of breakage using the JKMRC breakage model (the “Breakage” function). The energy spectra indicate that for a typical ore, only very few collisions are large enough to cause damage to the body of each particle. This provides an estimate of the energy efficiency which is less than 10 % at even the best operating conditions...|$|R

According to the anatomical mapping of nociceptors and their physiological property, a neuromechanical model coupling fiber-skin-nociceptor property is developed to stimulate the process of coarse fibers prickling human forearm skin. This model focuses on the content of coarse edge of fiber ends protruding from fabric surfaces, and the spatial distribution of these fibers is random. For fiber ends, their diameter and length are assumed to be normally distributed. By systematically changing the fibers ends per unit fabric surface area, or the distribution of their diameter or their length, we turn to three variables to measure the resulting neural activity of nociceptors. The results firstly confirmed the highly correction between firing rates of nociceptors and density of <b>coarse</b> fiber <b>ends.</b> Meanwhile, the firing rates of populations of nociceptors fluctuate with the density of fiber ends, as implies the probability of coarse fibers triggering nociceptors.

The three components of biodiversity are: 4 Genetic diversity (variation of genes within a species or population), Species diversity (variety of living species at local, regional or global scales), and Ecosystem diversity (the variety of ecological units which consist of communities of organisms interacting {{with each other and with}} their physical environment). Habitat and habitat diversity are particularly important concepts to help maintain biological diversity. Habitat is the natural environment of a plant or animal and is characterized by the quality and quantity of food, water, shelter, cover and space available to a particular species. Every species has habitat preferences. Habitat diversity on the other hand is the complexity, distribution, and abundance of different plant and animal habitats in a given area. Short-rotation woody crop plantations are generally established with a single woody plant species (e. g., willow, poplar), much as in a corn field. In that monoculture, the grower is able to establish plants which will have similar input needs (e. g., the amount and timing of fertilizer, water, herbicides) and which will mature at the same rate.

40|$|Fine scale {{heterogeneities}} {{may have}} a significant effect on flow performances in subsurface formations. A large number of grid cells are required to capture the effect of such heterogeneities on flow responses. However flow simulation is rarely feasible without prior upscaling. This presents a problem for the joint integration of fine (well-log) and coarse (seismic, production) data. Most approaches proceed in a hierarchical fashion where small scale data is integrated on the fine scale and after upscaling, large scale data is integrated on a separate coarse scale. The correspondence between the two scales is largely ignored leading to a loss of data conditioning either at the fine scale or the coarse scale. In this paper we propose a parallel modeling approach where fine and coarse scale realizations are modeled jointly. With this approach, we mainly target three advantages. Small scale data (log data, seismic data) will be integrated on all scales. Full flow simulations are only performed on the <b>coarse</b> scale. The <b>end</b> result will be a non-uniformly gridded coarse model that matches history and honors important geological fine scale features, eliminating the necessity for posterior upscaling. In addition to history matching the coarse model, the method ensures that the corresponding fine scale model also matches history up to a certain degree. This new approach is based on making a fast non-uniform upscaling technique a part of the history matching process. Fast upscaling is achieved through an existing elastic upgridding technique (3 DDEGA). Gridding is determined by both static (permeability) and dynamic (streamlines) information. During history matching an optimization routine determines optimal 3 DDEGA parameters thereby minimizing the mismatch between the flow responses of fine and coarse models. In addition, the 3 DDEGA parameters are forced to optimally preserve reservoir properties by non-uniform gridding near wells. Various realistic 3 D examples are used to demonstrate the methodology...|$|R

For example, the Wisconsin state specifications require coarse aggregates used in portland cement concrete to be free of deleterious substances and adherent coatings; however, neither the washing procedure nor the desired end result of aggregate washing is specified. The purpose of this research was to identify which aggregate coatings in Wisconsin are deleterious and to determine what degree they affect concrete durability and strength. To this <b>end,</b> <b>coarse</b> aggregates containing surface coatings were collected throughout the state and characterized with the California cleanness test, methylene blue adsorption test, and x-ray diffraction. Based on the results of these tests, a subset of the sampled aggregates was selected to further study the effects of the coatings on concrete performance. It was hypothesized that coatings containing clay material are more deleterious than coatings containing either dust or carbonate material. The 10 -batch mixing plan tested coarse aggregates fiom three different sources and in the following three conditions: (1) coated aggregates that were sampled in the field, (2) washed aggregates that were washed in the laboratory to remove the existing coating, and (3) coated aggregates that were manufactured with dust and clay fines to increase the extent of the coating. The effect of each aggregate coating on concrete performance was assessed by comparing the relative changes in compressive strength, tensile strength, drying shrinkage, freeze-thaw durability, and chloride ion penetrability between batches containing the washed and coated aggregates. The test results confirmed that coatings with high clay contents are more deleterious to concrete strength and durability than coatings that consist largely of dust or carbonate material. While the carbonate coatings appeared to slightly improve performance, the clay coatings appeared to significantly decrease strength and durability. Although current washing procedures {{do not need to be}} changed, it was recommended that the WisDOT require the California cleanness test whenever aggregate coatings are suspected of influencing strength or durability during concrete construction.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} standard random assignment problem (Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001)) and investigates {{the scope of}} designing a desirable random assignment rule. Specifically, I ask the following two questions: 1. Is there a reasonably restricted domain of preferences on which there exists an strategy-sd-efficient proof, sd-efficient and sd-envy-free or equal-treatment-of-equals rule? 2. Moreover, {{if the answer is}} in the affirmative, what is that rule? As a starting point, attention is restricted to the connected domains (Monjardet (2009)). It is shown that if a connected domain admits a desirable random assignment rule, it is structured in a specific way: a tier structure is fixed such that each tier contains at most two objects and every admissible preference respects this tier structure. A domain structured in this way is called a restricted tier domain. In addition, on such a domain, the probabilistic serial (PS) rule is characterized by either sd-efficiency and sd-envy-freeness or sd-strategy-proofness, sd-efficiency, and equal-treatment-of-equals. Since these domains are too restricted, it becomes an important question whether we can find some unconnected domains on which desirable rules exist. To facilitate such an investigation, the adjacency notion in Monjardet (2009) is weakened to block-adjacency, which refers to a flip between two adjacent blocks. Hence block-connectedness can be defined accordingly. Block-connected domains include connected domains as well as many unconnected ones. A sufficient condition called ”path-nestedness” is proposed for the equivalence between sd-strategy-proofness and the local sd-strategy-proofness on a block-connected domain, called the block-adjacent sd-strategy-proofness. Next, a class of domains, sequentially dichotomous domains, is proposed. A partition of the object set is called a direct refinement of another partition if from the latter to the former, exactly one block breaks into two and all the other blocks are inherited. Then a sequence of partitions is called a partition-path if it starts from the <b>coarsest</b> partition, <b>ends</b> at the finest partition, and along the sequence every partition is a direct refinement of its previous one. Hence a partition-path plots a way of differentiating objects by dichotomous divisions. Fix a partition-path, the corresponding sequentially dichotomous domain is the collection of preferences that respect all the partitions along the partition-path. Every such domain satisfies path-nestedness and hence the PS rule is shown to be sdstrategy- proof by verifying block-adjacent sd-strategy-proofness. In addition, every such domain is maximal for the PS rule to be sd-strategy-proof. Hence sequentially dichotomous domains significantly expand the scope of designing a desirable rule beyond what is indicated by the restricted tier domains. The last part of this dissertation investigates realistic preference restrictions, which are modeled as follows. Each object can be evaluated according to a large set of characteristics. The planner chooses a subset of these characteristics and a ranking of them. Then she describes each object as a list according to the chosen characteristics and their ranking. Being informed of such a description, each agent’s preference that is assumed to be lexicographically separable with respect to the ranking proposed by the planner. Hence a description induces a collection of admissible preferences. It is shown that, under two technical assumptions, whenever a description induces a preference domain which admits an sd-strategy-proof, sd-efficient, and equal-treatmentof-equals rule, it is a binary tree, i. e., for each feasible combination of the top-t characteristic values, the following-up characteristic takes two feasible values. In addition, whenever a description is a binary tree, the PS rule is sd-strategy-proof on the induced preference domain. In order to show sd-strategy-proofness of the PS rule on the domain induced by a binary tree, the domain is shown to be contained by a sequentially dichotomous domain and then the result stating the sd-strategy-proofness of the PS rule on sequentially dichotomous domains is invoked...|$|R
40|$|Sea level rise poses {{challenges}} to the tidal inlet systems of the Wadden Sea, including the barrier islands. If no measures are taken, the shorelines of the islands will retreat and the basins may drown. In the Ameland Inlet, the Boschplaat at the eastern tip of Ameland and Bornrif at the western tip of Terschelling are currently shrinking. This thesis evaluates different nourishment strategies to counteract the coastal retreat, with {{the ultimate goal of}} improving our understanding of how nourishment sand of different grain sizes is shared between the different morphological units of the Ameland Inlet. The process-based model Delft 3 D is used as a means of predicting the transport pathways of nourishment sand on a time scale of 10 years. In this thesis an existing model of the Ameland Inlet is improved, {{in order to make it}} suitable for medium term nourishment calculations. The Mormerge (parallel online) approach is applied in combination with a phase shift in the tidal signal for the different wave conditions. As a result the computational time is significantly reduced. The bathymetry is updated based on the 2016 Vaklodingen and Bed Composition Generation is used to create a suitable bottom composition. The composition of the nourishments is based on the particle size distribution of the borrow area. The model results suggest that different objectives, such as feeding the Terschelling or Ameland coast, feeding the basin, or reinforcing the ebb tidal delta, can be met by varying the nourishment location and composition. The main findings regarding the transport pathways within the inlet system are as follows: Near the Terschelling beach import via Boschgat is dominant. Further offshore, bypassing via the ebb tidal delta is the most important transport pathway. Boschgat feeds the western part of the basin and Borndiep feeds the eastern part, but interaction between the two is limited. The model predicts some transport from Boschgat to Borndiep via Westgat under the influence of the tide, or driven by waves over the shallow area in between the channels. There is no connection in the other direction. Borndiep connects the basin to the ebb tidal delta, resulting in transport in and out of the system. Bornrif is the only location where a net westward transport into the inlet is observed. Finer fractions are imported further into the basin by the tidal flow. When bypassing the inlet, they are transported further offshore, since they are more influenced by the tidal currents flowing out of the inlet. As a result <b>coarser</b> nourishment fractions <b>end</b> up closer to the Ameland shoreline. The model has several limitations, mainly since insufficient data is currently available for a sound calibration and validation. However important phenomena observed in the field are reproduced by the model, such as the coastal retreat at Boschplaat and the bar migration at Bornrif. This gives confidence in the model performance regarding the predictions of the sediment transport patterns. Civil engineerin...|$|R

In Zimbabwe, Busani Bafana investigates how {{restaurants}} use {{herbs and spices}} in their cooking to enhance the flavour in the food. Busani spoke to John Daines, owner of the Art Groove restaurant in Bulawayo, to find out more. As he discovers, if no spices and herbs {{are available in the}} market ? there are no alternatives. Nothing can replace the flavour or the colour that particular herbs and spices have. So, for smallscale farmers who produce them, there is a niche market. The secret is finding out more about it. If you are a smallscale farmer producing herbs and spices for the local market, listen in for a tour around the Art Grove restaurant to spice up your market ? and hear some good tips about what restaurants near you might be after. IN:	?We use both herbs and? OUT:	?fine or a coarse granule. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 54 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Busani Bafana speaking to John Daines at the Art Groove restaurant in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. If you are a smallscale farmer producing herbs and spices for local sale, find out what restaurants near you might want. You could see your market improve. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Daines	We use both herbs and spices as ingredients for a lot of our meals to enhance the flavour of our dishes and when we purchase these spices and herbs we look at what is available at the market at the time. Bafana	Where do you buy your dried spices and your herbs? Daines	We buy them wherever we can. Sometimes it is in a supermarket, sometimes it is at a wholesale centre in Bulawayo or often than not we get them in from Harare. Bafana	Is this close to your restaurant?Is this, say, down the road or several kilometres away from your restaurant? Daines	Yes, it can be as close as just around the corner. We buy what we can and what is available at the time. Bafana	What standards, then, do you expect from your suppliers of dried spices and herbs? Daines	From a herb point of view when we are looking at the different herbs that are available we look at the colour and obviously a herb is very much of a green colour because everything is a leaf, whether it can be chives, whether it can be rosemary or oregano, we have mint, herbs like that obviously the brighter and the green, the fresher they are. If they are brown and dull and yellow we know that they have been sitting for an age. And from a spice point of view if we look at something like paprika we are looking at the redness, a strong red colour is absolutely important as opposed to a yellow and orange colour. And the same for if we purchase something like chilli, we look at the hot, the hotness, I do not know if that is good English but we want to burn the mouth when we buy that! If it is dull in flavour we know that it is not of good quality. Bafana	How then have you actually maintained these standards that you talked about? Daines	I think we just use sight and smell really when we look at these products. We know what we are looking for when we are buying and we just make sure that that is what we look for otherwise we just leave it. You know it is really important that we get good quality. Bafana	What opportunities are there for smallscale farmers to supply businesses like yours? Daines	One of the most common herbs that we purchase at this moment is something very simple called mixed herbs and it is just a basic mixture of dried herbs like oregano, marjoram, basil and those types of herbs and that is a very common ingredient to enhance the flavour of whether it is a soup or whether it is a gravy or a sauce or your meat and you actually simply cannot find it at the moment and we find ourselves actually purchasing the individual herb and rubbing and mixing them together. Bafana	What kind of spices and herbs do you buy? Daines	From the herbs I have already mentioned that there is basil, there is oregano, there is mint, there is chives, there is a whole array of herbs that are being used and on the spices side we have what a natural spice is like your paprika, like turmeric which is a root, like cumin, chilli, Bird?s-eye chilli which is the very small chilli which is really, really hot and then we can also get a blend of spices. Bafana	When these certain types of spices and herbs that you mentioned are not available, are there any alternatives? Daines	No, there are no alternatives, you know they enhance the flavour of your food and if it is not there you just have to go without. Bafana	Do you buy in bulk or say even for a month supply or a week?s supply? Daines	It can be like that even longer because you do not know when {{you are going to see}} it next. Bafana	How long have you been buying these products yourself? Daines	Well herbs and spices have been around for generations and I do not think there is not one restaurant or even a household that does not use them. Bafana	What of the packaging of the spices and the herbs and could the packaging influence the reason to buy or not to buy? Daines	Obviously the packaging can play an important part but I think we are not interested in the packaging because all it does is enhances the price. Bafana	What is your advice to smallscale farmers who want to start selling dried spices and herbs but have no clue of where to begin? Daines	I think that a little bit of investigating, they will see that there is a market and they just need to do a little bit of homework. Bafana	I have been interviewing John away from the crowd actually of the restaurant but right now we will actually move into behind the scenes where the food is prepared so I can maybe sample some of these spices. SFX	Kitchen Bafana	We are actually behind the scenes in John?s restaurant, where he prepares the meals, and he is about to explain to us about all the spices that he uses. John, go ahead. Daines	This is a product called turmeric and it is a very much yellow spice as you can see and this is actually made from a root and it is purely used for colour and it has no flavour. Bafana	For what meals do you use it with? Daines	Well very much it is used for curries and spiced Indian food. This one is black peppercorns, this is one that is used everywhere, it is the most simplest spice that we get and it is just basically used as a flavouring. It is left on our tables in the restaurant and it is very much used as an ingredient in our kitchen. Bafana	It has a very strong aroma? There is black pepper and white pepper? Daines	Black and white pepper and I know in South Africa you can get red and green as well just to enhance the colour as well. Bafana	You also feel the texture of the spices? Daines	Not really. Bafana	Not really? Daines	No, everything is ground very finely here and that is what we are looking at so that we don?t see any residue in the product that we are making, so it blends into the meal. Bafana	So tell me, do these spices come already prepared, you don?t grind them yourself here? Daines	Very much they come prepared except, obviously, for the peppercorns, which we can grind ourselves to how we want it, whether it?s a fine or a <b>coarse</b> granule. <b>End</b> of trackSpice up your market with some good tip...|$|R
