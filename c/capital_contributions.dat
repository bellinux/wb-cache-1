2500|$|Rural areas In {{terms of}} rural and small town infrastructure, {{channeling}} {{funds to the}} final users through the various layers of local government remains a challenge. According to the World Bank, China differs from many other developing countries in {{that there is not}} a history of the central government providing large subsidies for the financing of rural water supply and sanitation. Instead, there is greater emphasis on self-reliance with rural people using their own contributions and resources to improve their water supply. This financing structure causes poor rural areas to [...] "accurately match their ability to pay with the proper type of systems and level of service", i.e. to choose sanitation solutions that they can afford. According to the World Bank, as a result, [...] "China is held up as a model for other developing countries". Support for capital costs for water supply is partially provided by the local and/or provincial government. Beneficiaries have to provide upfront <b>capital</b> <b>contributions.</b> Through World Bank financing and central government counterpart financing these upfront <b>capital</b> <b>contributions</b> were reduced, thus making sanitation more affordable to the poor. According to The Economist magazine, [...] "some provinces are now bypassing both the prefectural- and township-level governments in order to get funds more directly to rural areas." ...|$|E

The Madoff firm also paid out $4.5 million to support Ruth Madoff's real-estate-related investments. More than $11.5 million was used to buy two yachts for the Madoff family. [...] The firm provided corporate cards to his wife, Ruth, his son's wife and brother's wife, even though they didn't work at the firm.

40|$|The {{following}} study {{seeks to}} analyze how the Danish bank bailout packages, {{with a view}} to “The Law of <b>Capital</b> <b>Contribution</b> by the State”, affect the flow of the financial sector. Through analysis we attempt to demonstrate how known economical theories, can be connected to the bank bailout packages as an economical initiative. Furthermore, we seek to decide in which ways ”The Law of <b>Capital</b> <b>Contribution</b> by the State” has influenced the financial sector and especially the administration within the financial world, with particular focus on whether a paradigm shift has emerged. Finally, we discuss whether “The Law of <b>Capital</b> <b>Contribution</b> by the State” has had the desired effect on the financial sector. Based on the analyses and the discussion, we reach our final conclusion of the thesis at hand. We establish, that a paradigm shift is going on within the financial sector, based upon the government’s initiatives in the area. Furthermore, that the bank bailout packages in Denmark, has had an actual effect on the sector. It is difficult to decide, whether or not, the effect of the initiative is sufficiently efficient, but “the Law of <b>Capital</b> <b>Contribution</b> by the State” has had a part in the influence and changes in this sector, which has been organized according to the characteristics of a New Public Management paradigm...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} worker cooperatives {{are prone to}} {{redistribution}} among members, and that this redistribution distorts incentives. I assume that employment contracts are incomplete. In the model cooperative members pay in a <b>capital</b> <b>contribution</b> to purchase equipment. They then receive shocks to ability. Each worker's (observable) output depends on ability and on effort, neither {{of which can be}} observed separately. After ability is realized, members vote on a wage schedule as a function of output. If the median member has less than average ability, the cooperative will vote for a redistributive schedule, dulling incentives. Whereas workers in firms owned by outside shareholders would quit if the firm redistributed away from them, cooperative members will be reluctant to leave, since this entails forfeiting the dividends on their <b>capital</b> <b>contribution.</b> The model can explain why cooperatives typically have egalitarian wage policies. ...|$|R
