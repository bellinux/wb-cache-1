5|$|With few exceptions, each neuron in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle. Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, <b>chlorpromazine,</b> and many others.|$|E
5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. <b>chlorpromazine</b> as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
25|$|Consuming food {{prior to}} taking <b>chlorpromazine</b> orally limits its absorption, {{likewise}} cotreatment with benztropine can also reduce <b>chlorpromazine</b> absorption. Alcohol can also reduce <b>chlorpromazine</b> absorption. Antacids slow <b>chlorpromazine</b> absorption. Lithium and chronic treatment with barbiturates can increase <b>chlorpromazine</b> clearance significantly. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can decrease <b>chlorpromazine</b> clearance and hence increase <b>chlorpromazine</b> exposure. Cotreatment with CYP1A2 inhibitors like ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine or vemurafenib can reduce <b>chlorpromazine</b> clearance and hence increase exposure and potentially also adverse effects. <b>Chlorpromazine</b> can also potentiate the CNS depressant effects of drugs like barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, lithium and anaesthetics and hence increase {{the potential for}} adverse effects such as respiratory depression and sedation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> {{may also}} {{interact}} with epinephrine (adrenaline) {{to produce a}} paradoxical fall in blood pressure. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and thiazide diuretics may also accentuate the orthostatic hypotension experienced by those receiving <b>chlorpromazine</b> treatment. Quinidine may interact with <b>chlorpromazine</b> to increase myocardialdepression. Likewise it may also antagonize the effects of clonidine and guanethidine. It also may reduce the seizure threshold and hence a corresponding titration of anticonvulsant treatments should be considered. Prochlorperazine and desferrioxamine may also interact with <b>chlorpromazine</b> to produce transient metabolic encephalopathy.|$|E
25|$|There {{appears to}} be a dose-dependent risk for {{seizures}} with <b>chlorpromazine</b> treatment. Tardive dyskinesia and akathisia are less commonly seen with <b>chlorpromazine</b> than they are with high potency typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol or trifluoperazine, and some evidence suggests that, with conservative dosing, the incidence of such effects for <b>chlorpromazine</b> may be comparable to that of newer agents such as risperidone or olanzapine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> {{and other}} {{antipsychotics}} with sedative properties such as promazine and thioridazine {{are among the}} most potent agents at α-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, they are also among the most potent antipsychotics at histamine H1 receptors. This finding is in agreement with the pharmaceutical development of <b>chlorpromazine</b> and other antipsychotics as anti-histamine agents. Furthermore, the brain has a higher density of histamine H1 receptors than any body organ examined which may account for why <b>chlorpromazine</b> and other phenothiazine antipsychotics are as potent at these sites as the most potent classical antihistamines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> {{tends to}} have greater effect at {{serotonin}} receptors than at D2 receptors, which is notably {{the opposite effect}} of the other typical antipsychotics. Therefore, <b>chlorpromazine</b> with respect to its effects on dopamine and serotonin receptors is more similar to the atypical antipsychotics than to the typical antipsychotics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> does also act as FIASMA (functional {{inhibitor}} of acid sphingomyelinase).|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> {{has also}} been used in {{porphyria}} {{and as part of}} tetanus treatment. It still is recommended for short-term management of severe anxiety and psychotic aggression. Resistant and severe hiccups, severe nausea/emesis, and preanesthetic conditioning are other uses. Symptoms of delirium in medically-hospitalized AIDS patients have been effectively treated with low doses of <b>chlorpromazine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> {{has been}} studied in Naegleria fowleri infections in animal models.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, <b>chlorpromazine</b> still carries label {{indications}} for insomnia, severe pruritus, and preanesthesia.|$|E
25|$|The {{veterinary}} use of <b>chlorpromazine</b> {{has generally}} been superseded by use of acepromazine.|$|E
25|$|Pierre Deniker {{had heard}} about Laborit's work from his brother-in-law, who was a surgeon, and ordered <b>chlorpromazine</b> for a {{clinical}} trial at the Hôpital Sainte-Anne in Paris where he was Men's Service Chief. Together with the Director of the hospital, Professor Jean Delay, they published their first clinical trial in 1952, in which they treated 38 psychotic patients with daily injections of <b>chlorpromazine</b> {{without the use of}} other sedating agents. The response was dramatic; treatment with <b>chlorpromazine</b> went beyond simple sedation with patients showing improvements in thinking and emotional behaviour. They also found that doses higher than those used by Laborit were required, giving patients 75–100mg daily.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also a}} {{moderate}} inhibitor of CYP2D6 and also a substrate for CYP2D6 and hence can inhibit its own metabolism. It can also inhibit the clearance of CYP2D6 substrates such as dextromethorphan and hence also potentiate their effects. Other drugs like codeine and tamoxifen which require CYP2D6-mediated activation into their respective active metabolites may have their therapeutic effects attenuated. Likewise CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine or fluoxetine can reduce <b>chlorpromazine</b> clearance and hence increase serum levels of <b>chlorpromazine</b> and hence potentially also its adverse effects. <b>Chlorpromazine</b> also reduces phenytoin levels and increases valproic acid levels. It also reduces propranolol clearance and antagonises the therapeutic effects of antidiabetic agents, levodopa (a Parkinson's medication. This is likely {{due to the fact}} that <b>chlorpromazine</b> antagonises the D2 receptor which is one of the receptors dopamine, a levodopa metabolite, activates), amfetamines and anticoagulants. It may also interact with anticholinergic drugs such as orphenadrine to produce hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> may deposit in ocular tissues {{when taken}} in high dosages {{for long periods}} of time.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs that}} may have {{interactions}} with diazepam include antipsychotics (e.g. <b>chlorpromazine),</b> MAO inhibitors, and ranitidine.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{hypersensitivity}} (including jaundice, agranulocytosis, etc.) to phenothiazines, especially <b>chlorpromazine,</b> {{or any of}} the excipients in {{the formulation}} being used.|$|E
25|$|Rhône-Poulenc {{licensed}} <b>chlorpromazine</b> to Smith Kline & French (today's GlaxoSmithKline) in 1953. In 1955 it {{was approved}} in the United States {{for the treatment}} of emesis (vomiting). The effect of this drug in emptying psychiatric hospitals has been compared to that of penicillin and infectious diseases. But the popularity of the drug fell from the late 1960s as newer drugs came on the scene. From <b>chlorpromazine</b> a number of other similar antipsychotics were developed. It also led to the discovery of antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs that}} prolong the QT {{interval}} such as quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, sotalol and methadone may also interact with <b>chlorpromazine</b> to produce additive QT interval prolongation.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>chlorpromazine</b> in food-producing {{animals is}} not {{permitted}} in the EU, as a maximum residue limit {{could not be}} determined following assessment by the European Medicines Agency.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Histone {{antibodies}} {{are positive}} {{in up to}} 95% of patients with drug induced lupus. DIThe most common medications associated with drug induced lupus are hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, methyldopa, <b>chlorpromazine,</b> quinidine, and minocycline.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> {{may be used}} as an {{antiemetic}} in {{dogs and}} cats, or, less often, as sedative prior to anesthesia. In horses, it often causes ataxia and altered mentation, and is therefore seldom used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> is an {{antagonist}} to H1 receptors (provoking antiallergic effects), H2 receptors (reduction {{of forming}} of gastric juice), M1 and M2 receptors (dry mouth, reduction in forming of gastric juice) and some 5-HT receptors (different anti-allergic/gastrointestinal actions).|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> is {{occasionally}} used off-label {{for treatment}} of severe migraine. It is often, particularly as palliation, used in small doses to reduce nausea suffered by opioid-treated cancer patients and to intensify and prolong the analgesia of the opioids as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to influencing the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine {{it has been}} reported that antipsychotic drugs could achieve glutamanergic effects. This mechanism involves direct effects on antipsychotic drugs on glutamate receptors. By using the technique of functional neurochemical assay <b>chlorpromazine</b> and phenothiazine derivatives have been shown to have inhibitory effects on NMDA receptors that appeared to be mediated by action at the Zn site. It was found that there is an increase of NMDA activity at low concentrations and suppression at high concentrations of the drug. No significant difference in glutamate and glycine activity from the effects of <b>chlorpromazine</b> were reported. Further work will be necessary to determine if the influence in NMDA receptors by antipsychotic drugs contributes to their effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, are {{sometimes}} used {{in addition to}} benzodiazepines to control agitation or psychosis. Antipsychotics may potentially worsen alcohol withdrawal as they lower the seizure threshold. Clozapine, olanzapine, or low-potency phenothiazines (such as <b>chlorpromazine)</b> are particularly risky; if used, extreme caution is required.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacotherapies {{that have}} been used for ORS include antidepressants, (e.g. {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors), antipsychotics, (e.g. blonanserin, lithium, <b>chlorpromazine),</b> and benzodiazepines. The most common treatment used for ORS is SSRIs. Specific antidepressants {{that have been}} used include clomipramine.|$|E
25|$|Environmental and {{task-related}} {{factors are}} suspected {{to trigger the}} development of focal dystonias because they appear disproportionately in individuals who perform high precision hand movements such as musicians, engineers, architects, and artists. <b>Chlorpromazine</b> can also cause dystonia, which can be often misjudged as a seizure.|$|E
25|$|The blue urine {{was used}} to monitor {{psychiatric}} patients' compliance with medication regimes. This led to interest - from the 1890s {{to the present day}} - in the drug's antidepressant and other psychotropic effects. It became the lead compound in research leading to the discovery of <b>chlorpromazine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{community-based}} alternatives were suggested and tentatively {{implemented in}} the 1920s and 1930s, although asylum numbers continued to increase up to the 1950s. The movement for deinstitutionalisation moved to the forefront in various countries during the 1950s and 1960s {{with the advent of}} <b>chlorpromazine</b> and other antipsychotic drugs.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the late}} 1950s, the first modern {{antipsychotic}} and antidepressant drugs were developed: <b>chlorpromazine</b> (also known as Thorazine), the first widely used antipsychotic, was synthesized in 1950, and iproniazid, {{one of the first}} antidepressants, was first synthesized in 1957. In 1959 imipramine, the first tricyclic antidepressant, was developed.|$|E
25|$|Following on, Laborit {{considered}} whether <b>chlorpromazine</b> {{may have}} a role in managing patients with severe burns, Raynaud's phenomenon, or psychiatric disorders. At the Villejuif Mental Hospital in November 1951, he and Montassut administered an intravenous dose to psychiatrist Cornelia Quarti who was acting as a volunteer. Quarti noted the indifference, but fainted upon getting up to go to the toilet, and so further testing was discontinued (orthostatic hypotension is a possible side effect of <b>chlorpromazine).</b> Despite this, Laborit continued to push for testing in psychiatric patients during early 1952. Psychiatrists were reluctant initially, but on January 19, 1952, it was administered (alongside pethidine, pentothal and ECT) to Jacques Lh. a 24-year-old manic patient, who responded dramatically, and was discharged after three weeks having received 855mg of the drug in total.|$|E
25|$|Antipsychotics are {{generally}} ineffective for benzodiazepine withdrawal-related psychosis. Antipsychotics {{should be avoided}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as they tend to aggravate withdrawal symptoms, including convulsions. Some antipsychotic agents may be more risky during withdrawal than others, especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines (e.g., <b>chlorpromazine),</b> as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used, extreme caution is required.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> {{and other}} typical {{antipsychotics}} are primarily blockers of D2 receptors. In fact an almost perfect correlation {{exists between the}} therapeutic dose of a typical antipsychotic and the drug's affinity for the D2 receptor. Therefore, a larger dose is required if the drug’s affinity for the D2 receptor is relatively weak. A correlation exists between average clinical potency and affinity of the antipsychotics for dopamine receptors.|$|E
25|$|Levomepromazine (INN, BAN, USAN), {{also known}} as methotrimeprazine, is a {{phenothiazine}} neuroleptic drug. It is sold in many countries under the generic name (levomepromazine) or under brand names such as Nozinan, Levoprome, Detenler, Hirnamin, Levotomin, Neurocil and many more. It is a low-potency antipsychotic (approximately half as potent as <b>chlorpromazine)</b> with strong analgesic, hypnotic and antiemetic properties that is primarily used in palliative care.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorpromazine</b> (CPZ), marketed {{under the}} trade names Thorazine and Largactil among others, is an {{antipsychotic}} medication. It is primarily {{used to treat}} psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Other uses include the treatment of bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, nausea and vomiting, anxiety before surgery, and hiccups that do not improve following other measures. It can be given by mouth, by injection into a muscle, or into a vein.|$|E
