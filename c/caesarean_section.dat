5|$|The total medical {{cost for}} a pregnancy, {{delivery}} and {{care of a}} newborn in the United States is on average $21,000 for a vaginal delivery and $31,000 for a <b>Caesarean</b> <b>section</b> as of 2012. In most other countries the cost is less than half. For a child born in 2011, an average US family will spend $235,000 over 17 years to raise them.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by <b>Caesarean</b> <b>section.</b> Another issue that affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E
40|$|Determinants of {{regional}} variation in <b>caesarean</b> <b>sections</b> can contribute {{explanations for the}} observed overall increasing trend of <b>caesarean</b> <b>sections.</b> We assessed which mechanism explains the higher rate of <b>caesarean</b> <b>sections</b> in the former West than East Germany: a more liberal use of <b>caesarean</b> <b>sections</b> {{in the case of}} relative indications or more common <b>caesarean</b> <b>sections</b> without indications...|$|R

5|$|The Bushes {{had tried}} to {{conceive}} for three years, but pregnancy did not happen easily. On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna. The twins were born five weeks early by an emergency <b>Caesarean</b> <b>section,</b> as Laura had developed life-threatening pre-eclampsia (toxemia). The twins {{graduated from high school}} in 2000 and attended Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin, respectively, in 2004. To date, Bush is the only First Lady to have given birth to twins.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she {{brought back to}} Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a <b>Caesarean</b> <b>section</b> at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both {{civil and political rights}} for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E

25|$|Mothers {{who have}} {{previously}} had a <b>caesarean</b> <b>section</b> {{are more likely}} to have a <b>caesarean</b> <b>section</b> for future pregnancies than mothers who have never had a <b>caesarean</b> <b>section.</b> There is discussion about the circumstances under which women should have a vaginal birth after a previous caesarean.|$|E
25|$|Both {{have higher}} risks than a vaginal birth with no {{previous}} <b>caesarean</b> <b>section.</b> There are many issues {{which must be}} taken into account when planning the mode of delivery for every pregnancy, not just those complicated by a previous <b>caesarean</b> <b>section</b> and there is a list of some of these issues in the list of indications for section in the first part of this article. A vaginal birth after <b>caesarean</b> <b>section</b> (VBAC) confers a higher risk of uterine rupture (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or endometritis (10 per 1,000), and perinatal death of the child (0.25 per 1,000). Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in <b>caesarean</b> <b>section</b> being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat <b>caesarean</b> <b>section</b> than in an elective repeat <b>caesarean</b> <b>section.</b> On the other hand, VBAC confers less maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat <b>caesarean</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} {{trimester}} of pregnancy, induced abortion may be performed surgically by intact dilation and extraction or by hysterotomy. Hysterotomy abortion is a procedure {{similar to a}} <b>caesarean</b> <b>section</b> and is performed under general anesthesia. It requires a smaller incision than a <b>caesarean</b> <b>section</b> and is used during later stages of pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|Pliny the Elder {{theorized that}} Julius Caesar's name {{came from an}} {{ancestor}} who was born by <b>caesarean</b> <b>section,</b> {{but the truth of}} this is debated (see the discussion of the etymology of Caesar). The Ancient Roman <b>caesarean</b> <b>section</b> was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, lived through childbirth and successfully gave birth to her son, ruling out the possibility the Roman ruler and general was born by <b>caesarean</b> <b>section.</b> His first wife however died in childbirth, giving birth to a stilborn son who might have lived had a caesarean taken place.|$|E
25|$|Higher infant {{mortality}} risk: In <b>caesarean</b> <b>sections</b> performed with no indicated medical risk (singleton at full term in a head-down position {{with no other}} obstetric or medical complications), {{the risk of death}} in the first 28 days of life has been cited as 1.77 per 1,000 live births among women who had <b>caesarean</b> <b>sections,</b> compared to 0.62 per 1,000 for women who delivered vaginally.|$|R

The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense nerve block.|$|E

The {{complications}} during vaginal deliveries were {{first or second}} degree perineal laceration (45.4  %), episiotomy (18.2  %), and tracheloraffia (1.5  %). There were no urinary tract injuries during the <b>caesarean</b> <b>sections</b> in the control group, but 2 patients (7.4  %) had severe intra-operative bleeding with necessity of blood transfusion in one case (3.7  %).|$|R
50|$|The more <b>caesarean</b> <b>sections</b> that a {{woman has}} had, the less likely she will be {{eligible}} for VBAC. VBAC after two or more prior lower uterine segment transverse CS is controversial. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that women with a prior history of even two previous uncomplicated low transverse <b>Caesarean</b> <b>sections,</b> in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy at term, with no contraindication for vaginal birth, may be considered suitable for planned VBAC.|$|R

In 2002, ACOG estimated that incidence has increased 10-fold over the past 50 years. The risk of placenta accreta in future deliveries after Caesarian section is 0.4-0.8%. For patients with placenta previa, risk increases with number of previous <b>Caesarean</b> <b>sections,</b> with rates of 3%, 11%, 40%, 61%, and 67% for the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth or greater number of <b>Caesarean</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
