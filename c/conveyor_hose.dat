50|$|The ECO-HARVESTING™ {{gathering}} method {{employs a}} continuous mid-water/pelagic trawl {{system that is}} guarded by a fine mesh net, which prevents anything larger than krill from entering. Underwater cameras monitor the system. Rather than heaving a trawl to get the catch on board, a <b>conveyor</b> <b>hose</b> {{is attached to the}} end of the net, which remains underwater throughout the entire operation. A continuous stream of water flows through the hose, bringing the live krill directly into the ship. Supply vessels offload products, bring fuel and replace the crew of the fishing grounds. The products are shipped to a hub in South America, and then distributed to the global market. Aker's fishing vessels feature a processing plant that transforms the entire content of the catch into meal. Historically, retrieving the innumerable krill in the Antarctic waters has been difficult, because of the krill’s delicate nature. Once a krill dies, its powerful digestive enzymes quickly break down the body tissue, rendering it useless before processing.|$|E

The wide use of wire-reinforced rubber products such as <b>conveyor</b> belts, <b>hose</b> and radial ply tyres has reawakened interest in the parameters affecting the adhesion of rubber to brass plated steel wire. My research work {{is an attempt to}} improve and explain the rubber to metal bonding technology; it is concerned with the effect of rubber compounding ingredients as well as wire surface factors on adhesion. This work pertains to show the role played by two of the recently introduced and widely used bonding systems namely (i) Hexamethylene tetramine-resorcinol system and (ii) the Triazine system (Vulcabond SW) * on the adhesion of the rubber to brass plated steel wire. Different carbon blacks, as well as different accelerators and silica are shown to have a great influence on the amount of rubber adhesion to brass plated steel wire. The state of the wire plating as well as the contamination of its surface affects bonding and these parameters were studied using the scanning electron microscope. XPS techniques are employed to explain the role of some accelerators in the mechanism of bonding rubber to brass plated steel wire. A relationship has been found to exist between bind strength and rubber fracture properties. Because of the widespread use of radial tyres in the automobile industry and in every field in which heavy types of tyres are used, this research considers in detail the phenomena of fatigue and pressure at various temperatures on bond life. Also wire ageing is considered to be very important and to effect the bond between the rubber and the brass plated steel. * Trade name of Vulnax International Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Rubbers are widely used to manufacture industrial articles such as tyres, <b>conveyor</b> belts, <b>hoses,</b> and engine mounts. During flexing, these articles fail in service due to initiation and subsequent growth of cracks leading to catastrophic failure. The failure is due to either environmental ageing by ozone and oxygen or mechanical failure due to crack initiation and growth. The unexpected failure in service is due to mechanical crack growth and may cause danger to life and property. Therefore, rubber articles are designed for long durability and low fatigue damage. To achieve these requirements, reinforcing fillers such as colloidal carbon black and synthetic silica are added to raw rubbers. In recent years, silica has been replacing carbon black in many industrial rubber articles. Some studies have investigated crack growth behaviour in unfilled and carbon black filled rubbers. But limited data is available for crack growth behaviour in silica-filled rubber vulcanisates and their effects on the durability and service life of industrial rubber articles has remained uncertain. When partly soluble chemical curatives are mixed with raw rubber, they migrate to the rubber surface, which can be detrimental to the rubber properties. Two rubber compounds with different amounts of curatives were prepared by mixing natural rubber with a high loading of precipitated amorphous white silica nanofiller. The silica surfaces were pretreated with bis(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) -tetrasulphane (TESPT) coupling agent to chemically adhere silica to the rubber. The chemical bonding between the filler and rubber was optimised via the tetrasulphane groups of TESPT by adding accelerators and activators. The rubber compounds were cured and stored at ambient temperature for up to 65 days before they were tested. One compound showed extensive blooming {{as a function of}} storage time. The cyclic fatigue life of the rubber vulcanisates was subsequently measured at a constant strain amplitude and test frequency at ambient temperature using standard dumbbell test pieces. The crack length, c, was also measured {{as a function of the}} number of cycles, N, at a constant strain amplitude ranging from 15...|$|R

Typical rubber compounds used to manufacture industrial products such as tyres, <b>hoses,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts, acoustics, shock pads, and engine mountings contain up to eight classes of chemical additives· including curing agents, accelerators, activators, processing aids, and antidegradants. The cure systems in these articles often consists of primary and secondary accelerators, primary and secondary activators, and elemental sulphur. Recent legislation impacting upon the working environment, safety and health has imposed a considerable burden on the manufacturers of rubber compounds to meet various obligations. The selection of raw materials and manufacturing processes that do not harm the environment is of great importance. A novel technique for preparing rubber formulations using crosslinking nanofillers such as silanised precipitated silica has been developed in this research. The silica surfaces were pre-treated with bis[3 -triethoxysilylpropyl-] tetrasulphane coupling agent (TESPT). · TESPT is a sulphur containing bifunctional organosilane which chemically adheres silica to rubber and also prevents silica from interfering with the reaction mechanism of sulphur-cure systems. The tetrasulphane groups of the TESPT are rubber reactive and react {{in the presence of}} accelerator at elevated temperatures, i. e. 140 - 260 °C, with or without elemental sulphur being present, to form crossIinks in rubbers containing chemically active double bonds for example styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) and polybutadiene rubber (BR) [...] SBR and BR rubber compounds containing 60 phr of TESPT pre-treated silica nanofiller were prepared. The silica particles were fully dispersed in the rubber, which was cured primarily by using sulphur in TESPT. The reaction between the tetrasulphane groups of TESPT and the rubbers was optimised by incorporating different accelerators and activators in the rubber. The mechanical properties of the rubber vulcanisates such as hardness, tear strength, tensile strength, elongation at break, stored' energy density at break, abrasion resistance, modulus and cyclic fatigue life were increased significantly when the treated silica filler was added. The need for the accelerator and activator was dependent on the composition of the rubber. Interestingly, the rubbers were fully cured without the use of elemental sulphur, secondary accelerator and secondary activator. As a result, a substantial reduction {{in the use of the}} curing chemicals was achieved without compromising the important properties of rubber compounds which are essential for maintaining long life and good performance of industrial rubber products in service. This approach has also helped to improve health and safety within the workplace and minimise harm to the enviromnent.
