As a result, research conducted {{in this area is}} limited and the awareness on ferroresonance is relatively low among utility engineers.

40|$|Abstract – One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in high voltage networks is over voltages due to lightning. These over voltages, which are not possible to prevent, create problems where the insulating level of the equipment is not enough. Selecting a high insulating level will increase the costs and volume of the equipment. For the sake of decreasing insulating levels and their costs, {{it is necessary to}} control over voltages and lead them to earth by equipment like arresters. In this paper, over voltages, mostly due to lightning and its dangers to power networks, have been studied for: 1 - The effect of arrester earthing resistance, 2 - Tower footing resistance, 3 - <b>Capacitive</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>transformer</b> and 4 - Tower structure.

40|$|Measurement {{errors of}} a <b>capacitive</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>transformer</b> (CVT) are {{relevant}} to its equivalent parameters for which its capacitive divider contributes the most. In daily operation, dielectric aging, moisture, dielectric breakdown, etc., it will exert mixing effects on a capacitive divider’s insulation characteristics, leading to fluctuation in equivalent parameters which result in the measurement error. This paper proposes an equivalent circuit model to represent a CVT which incorporates insulation characteristics of a capacitive divider. After software simulation and laboratory experiments, the relationship between measurement errors and insulation parameters is obtained. It indicates that variation of insulation parameters in a CVT will cause a reasonable measurement error. From field tests and calculation, equivalent capacitance mainly affects magnitude error, while dielectric loss mainly affects phase error. As capacitance changes 0. 2 %, magnitude error can reach − 0. 2 %. As dielectric loss factor changes 0. 2 %, phase error can reach 5 ′. An increase of equivalent capacitance and dielectric loss factor in the high-voltage capacitor will cause a positive real power measurement error. An increase of equivalent capacitance and dielectric loss factor in the low-voltage capacitor will cause a negative real power measurement error...|$|E

The frequency response of the transconductance ratio is shown to be linear and easily predictable for the harmonic frequency band, i. e. from the rated frequency of the device to approximately 2. 5 kHz. This is explained {{with reference to the}} reactance of the intermediate voltage capacitor and the input impedance of the electromagnetic unit. The results are verified by simulations for a 138 kV cvt, using the equivalent circuit model and parameter values presented in a recent EPRI study.

40|$|<b>Capacitive</b> <b>Voltage</b> <b>Transformers</b> (CVTs) {{are common}} in {{high-voltage}} transmission line applications. These same applications require fast, yet secure protection. However, as the requirement for faster protective relays grows, so does the concern over the poor transient response of some CVTs for certain system conditions. Solid-state and microprocessor relays can respond to a CVT transient due to their high operating speed and iflCreased sensitivity. This paper discusses CVT models whose purpose is to identify which major CVT components contribute to the CVT transient. Some surprises include a recommendation for CVT burden and the type offerroresonant-suppression circuit that gives the least CVT transient. This paper also reviews how the System Impedance Ratio (SIR) affects the CVT transient response. The higher the SIR, the worse the CVT transient for a given CVT. Finally, this paper discusses improvements in relaying logic. The new method of detecting CVT transients is more precise than past detection methods and does not penalize distance protection speed for close-in faults.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} and simulation of distance relays in ATP - EMTP. Transmission line which is 125. 6 miles long operates at 60 Hz and 115 kV line voltages are simulated in ATP - EMTP. The {{first part of the}} thesis discusses the implementation and simulation of the ATP - EMTP model for microprocessor based mho distance relay using angle comparator method in the network. The model includes the modeling of input filter, sample and Fourier fundamental frequency detector, which process the input for mho distance relay model. A number of simulations of single line to ground faults (SLGF) with different fault locations were carried out to verify the correct operation of the relay based on the developed protection scheme. The results of the simulation show the operation of the relay based on its protection scheme and its response time related to the fault locations. The study is also extended to the double line to ground fault for the same purpose. The second part of the thesis discusses the model for an electromechanical mho distance relay, which includes the modeling of current transformer (CT) and <b>capacitive</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>transformer</b> (CVT). A validated ninth-order mathematical model of the electromechanical Mho distance relay is constructed in ATP - EMTP to observe the dynamic behavior of the relay during a critical fault. For that purpose, SLGF were tested in critical locations which is very close to the relay. The results show how CT saturation and CVT transient influence the relay operation. The applied procedure can be used for testing of distance protection performance against single phase fault currents.

40|$|Ferroresonance incidences in {{electrical}} power system have been commonly regarded as unexplained phenomenon due to its relatively rare frequency of occurrence which is not critical by the utility engineers. As a result, research conducted {{in this area is}} limited and the awareness on ferroresonance is relatively low amongst the utility engineers. However, as the electrical system evolves, its complexity increases in line with the increasing risk of ferroresonance. Ferroresonance gained prominence only in the recent decade, when it has been reported to cause damaging consequences to power equipment. Several literatures had concerning reported practical encounters of ferroresonance which led to equipment failures and electrical blackout. It must be noted that most of the literatures concentrated on ferroresonance in power transformer only. In contrast, this research will place ferroresonance in <b>capacitive</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>transformer</b> (CVT) as the main focus. It is demonstrated in this research that ferroresonance can also occur in CVT due to circuit breaker switching. Various ferroresonance suppression techniques have since been proposed as ferroresonance mitigation solutions in CVT. This research presents a new technique for detection and mitigation of the ferroresonance phenomenon in CVT. In addition, the transient performance of CVT and ferroresonance mitigation performance with the proposed new technique is also compared with other existing ferroresonance suppression techniques. EMTP-RV simulation results demonstrate that, the transient response for a CVT with the proposed ferroresonance suppression circuit (FSC) is much better than conventional active and passive FSCs. The accuracy of the proposed ferroresonance detection and mitigation technique is verified through comparison of the laboratory test (Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) real-time simulations) results and with those obtained from EMTP-RV simulation results. Closed-loop testing is performed using real time digital simulator (RTDS). The experimental results demonstrate that the developed technique can accurately detect the phenomenon of ferroresonance in CVT and can suppress ferroresonance faster than other conventional techniques...|$|E
