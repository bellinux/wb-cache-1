5|$|<b>Chimes</b> at Midnight (onscreen {{title and}} UK title: Falstaff (<b>Chimes</b> at Midnight), Spanish release: Campanadas a medianoche), is a 1965 English-language Spanish-Swiss co-produced film {{directed}} by and starring Orson Welles. The film's plot centres on William Shakespeare's recurring character Sir John Falstaff and the father-son relationship he has with Prince Hal, who must choose between loyalty to his father, King Henry IV, or Falstaff.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Shrewsbury {{sequence}} {{has been}} particularly admired, and inspired later movies, including Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan. Film critics have compared it to the Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin and the Battle on the Ice sequence in Alexander Nevsky, both directed by Sergei Eisenstein. Kenneth Branagh's Henry V used Welles's Battle of Shrewsbury sequence as an inspiration for the Battle of Agincourt, and depicted Prince Hal's rejection of Falstaff {{in a way that}} was more influenced by <b>Chimes</b> at Midnight than from more traditional interpretations of the scene. In 1988, director Patrick Garland staged a version of <b>Chimes</b> at Midnight starring Simon Callow as Falstaff at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Michael Anderegg said that <b>Chimes</b> at Midnights use of wide angle lenses, low-key lighting and costumes, and its focus on the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal influenced My Own Private IdahoGus Van Sant's 1991 loose adaptation of Henry IV Parts 1 and 2.|$|E

5|$|Welles's alleged {{biological}} son Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who {{was born}} out of wedlock to Welles and actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, first met Welles when he was 15 and later worked on the 1960 stage play <b>Chimes</b> at Midnight. This was the only significant amount of time that the two spent together and afterwards Lindsay-Hogg only saw Welles sporadically. Like Welles, Lindsay-Hogg had two surrogate fathers in addition to his biological father. In the late 1950s when she was 16, Welles's eldest daughter Christopher Welles Feder cut off all ties with Welles under pressure from her mother, who disapproved of Welles's influence on her. Welles and Feder later reconnected but their relationship never fully recovered. Welles's youngest daughter Beatrice, who resembled her father as a young boy, appears in the film version of <b>Chimes</b> at Midnight.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Chimes</b> {{shopping}} centre was built beside Uxbridge station in 2001, incorporating {{many of the}} existing buildings into the new structure. The centre was originally to be named St George's Centre in plans {{dating back to the}} early 1990s, though this name was eventually taken by another {{shopping centre}} in Harrow on the Hill. Instead, The <b>Chimes</b> was said to refer {{to the sound of the}} bells from the nearby market house on the High Street. An Odeon cinema opened as a major part of the centre, with the smaller cinema at the opposite end of the High Street closing. Some houses on Chippendale Way and the St George's car park were demolished to allow for the construction of the new shopping centre car park. The offices of the local building company Fassnidge were also included in the new development; built in the 19th century, they now house a Pizza Express restaurant. Preserved timber from earlier demolished buildings in Uxbridge was used in the construction of a new building beside the former offices of Fassnidge, designed to resemble a much older structure.|$|E
