5|$|On 14 and 15 July 1942, {{during the}} First Battle of El Alamein, the {{battalion}} {{was engaged in}} what would {{be known as the}} Battle of Ruweisat Ridge. Ruweisat Ridge was held by the enemy and was in the centre of the El Alamein line, dominating the surrounding area. The 4th Brigade was to take the western end of the ridge, with Kippenberger's 5th Brigade tasked with the capture of the centre of the ridge. The 5th Indian Brigade was allocated to deal with the eastern end. British tanks, in the form of two armoured brigades, were to protect the flanks and be in support to deal with the expected counterattack. However, little thought was given to communication and liaison between the infantry and armoured brigades, nor was a <b>clear</b> <b>chain</b> of command established. This would have implications for the outcome of the battle.|$|E
500|$|Two {{months after}} Kippenberger's brigade arrived in Syria, Panzer Army Afrika {{attacked}} into Libya. This prompted {{the recall of}} the 2nd New Zealand Division. The Eighth Army was defeated at the Battle of Gazala and retreated into Egypt. The recalled New Zealanders manned a defensive position at Minqar Qaim, and rebuffed several attacks. However, {{it was not long}} before the division was cut off. It successfully forced a breakout with minimal losses on 27 June and withdrew to new positions at El Alamein. On 14 July 1942, during the First Battle of El Alamein, Kippenberger led the 5th Brigade in what would be known as the Battle of Ruweisat Ridge. Ruweisat Ridge was held by the enemy and was in the centre of the El Alamein line, dominating the surrounding area. The 5th Brigade was tasked with the capture of the centre of the ridge. The 4th Brigade was to take the western end of the ridge and the 5th Indian Brigade the eastern end.

5000|$|Adolf Hitler {{actively}} encouraged interservice rivalries within Nazi Germany, due to {{a belief}} in a [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] principle that competition would result in weeding out the weaker elements. Generally this {{proved to be a}} disaster: with no <b>clear</b> <b>chains</b> of responsibility, contradicting orders were often given, and the different services were at odds when fast coordinated action was vital.|$|R
2500|$|On 28 September 2016, the JIT gave a {{press conference}} in which it {{confirmed}} that the aircraft was shot down with a 9M38 Buk missile which it concluded had been fired from a rebel-controlled field near Pervomaisky, a town [...] south of Snizhne. It also found the Buk missile system used had been transported from Russia into Ukraine {{on the day of the}} crash, and then back into Russia after the crash, with one missile less than it arrived with. The JIT said they had identified 100 people, witnesses as well as suspects, who were involved in the movement of the Buk launcher, though they had not yet identified a <b>clear</b> <b>chain</b> of command to assess culpability, which was a matter for ongoing investigation. The Dutch chief prosecutor said [...] "the evidence must stand before a court" [...] which would render final judgement. During the investigation, the JIT interviewed 200 witnesses, collected half a million photos and videos and analysed 150,000 intercepted phone calls. According to [...] JIT head prosecutor Fred Westerbeke the criminal investigation is fully based on [...] "immense body of evidence", including testimonies of live witnesses who saw the [...] "Buk" [...] launcher, original photos, movies and primary radar data rather than random social media publications as frequently claimed by Russian media.|$|E
2500|$|Noting {{the growing}} union support, {{an article in}} the progressive-leaning Mother Jones {{magazine}} said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a <b>clear</b> <b>chain</b> of command, Occupy Wall Street is the opposite in that they are [...] "a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought." [...] However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that [...] "effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics." [...] As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan. Damon Silvers, the AFL–CIO's policy director, said, “We think the Occupy movement has given voice to something very basic about what’s going on in our country right now. The fact that they’ve figured out certain concepts and language for doing that, we think is really important and positive.” The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) has endorsed the movement saying, [...] "We recognize the need to work together and learn from each other. The vitality, energy and dialogue growing from the Occupy Wall Street movement show the potential to organize, build power and win justice for the middle class.” ...|$|E

50|$|In most states, {{the county}} sheriff {{is the chief}} law {{enforcement}} officer in the county. However, except in major emergencies where <b>clear</b> <b>chains</b> of command are essential, the county sheriff normally does not directly control the police departments of city governments, but merely cooperates with them (e.g., under mutual aid pacts). Thus, the most common interaction between county and city law enforcement personnel is when city police officers deliver suspects to sheriff's deputies for detention or incarceration in the county jail.|$|R
50|$|By late 1967 it {{was clear}} that the North Koreans were {{attempting}} to develop a full-scale insurgency in the South with strongholds in the Taebaek Mountains and around Jirisan mountain. President Park, in consultation with General Bonesteel, developed a counterinsurgency strategy in the form of Presidential Instruction #18. The instruction established a national coordinating council with <b>clear</b> <b>chains</b> of command for all classes of incidents ranging from individual agent sightings to province-level unrest. Eight (later ten) new ROKA counter-infiltration battalions were to be formed, together with further expansion of the Combat Police.|$|R

50|$|Engineering {{colleges were}} {{established}} {{to feed the}} enormous demand for expertise. Railroads invented modern management, with <b>clear</b> <b>chains</b> of command, statistical reporting, and complex bureaucratic systems. They systematized the roles of middle managers and set up explicit career tracks. They hired young men ages 18-21 and promoted them internally until a man reached the status of locomotive engineer, conductor, or station agent at age 40 or so. Career tracks were invented for skilled blue-collar jobs and for white-collar managers, starting in railroads and expanding into finance, manufacturing, and trade. Together with rapid growth of small business, a new middle class was rapidly growing, especially in northern cities.|$|R
50|$|Facing {{mounting}} {{pressure in}} the aftermath of the 2011 Norway attacks over the state of the police and security, the incumbent Justice Minister, Knut Storberget, announced his resignation. He declared that six years as Justice Minister was sufficient and that he wished to focus his attention on remaining in parliament and his family. Faremo took over the Ministry on 11 November 2011, tasked with strengthening the Norwegian emergency system. This involved the establishment of a new structure, new communication systems, and <b>clear</b> <b>chains</b> of command for crisis management and communications. A thorough analysis of the police, commissioned by Faremo, formed the basis for reforms in the Norwegian police structure.|$|R

30|$|If the {{problems}} surrounding {{the issue of}} recycling up until now have been due to, at least in part, the complex relationships between provider, customer and recycler, the fact that provider and re-cycler become {{one and the same}} is fundamental. It establishes a <b>clearer</b> <b>chain</b> of supply, in which the one that produces is also the one that gets the benefits of the recuperation of material. That is attractive because he is also the one that has the capacity and machinery to transform this ‘waste’ into ‘nutrient’, as MacDonough and Braungart say in their book. If the architect tries {{to be aware of the}} life-spans of the different elements that go into his design, he can either consciously create the possibility for re-cycling of parts, or he condemns the building as a whole to an early demolition.|$|R

5000|$|Following the Franco-Siamese War of 1893, the Left Bank {{fell under}} French rule as an {{administrative}} block, with its royalty stripped of many privileges; French colonial administration of Lao kingdoms impoverished the region. The 1893 treaty {{called for a}} twenty-five-kilometer-wide demilitarized zone along the Right Bank, which made Siamese control impossible. It soon became a haven for lawless characters from both banks of the river. Lack of <b>clear</b> <b>chains</b> of authority resulted in turmoil in the whole region, and in what was known to the Siamese side as the [...] "Holy Man's Rebellion".Ong Keo and Ong Kommandam of the Bolaven Plateau Alak people, led initial resistance against French control, which subsumed into the First Indochina War. The parallel right-bank Holy Man's Rebellion of 1901-1902 was a short-lived cause. Following legal actions against captured local leaders of the movement, the Thai government considered {{the case of the}} rebellion closed. The right-bank dependencies were absorbed into the Siamese North-East Monthon Isan (...) and the House of Na Champassak ceased to rule.|$|R
25|$|The King's County coroner, Henry C. Simms, {{convened a}} jury on the {{disaster}} which heard testimony through December and January 1877. When {{it was published}} {{at the end of}} January 1877, it was especially harsh on the theatrical managers, Sheridan Shook and A. M. Palmer. The jury held Shook and Palmer responsible for failing to take adequate precautions against fire, failing to train stage hands in either fire prevention or the management of incipient fires, failing to establish <b>clear</b> <b>chains</b> of command in the theatre's management, permitting the stage to become cluttered with properties and failing to maintain in good working order fire fighting equipment and emergency exits that had originally been installed. The jury found lesser fault with the design of the building, observing that the five-year-old structure had better exits than many other public buildings in the city. Fault was found with the stairways leading to the family circle and the auditorium, which lacked a firewall between the audience and the stage. In delivering the verdict, the jury reported that death occurred mainly through suffocation in the dense smoke that prevailed in the gallery, likely in the few minutes after Charles Vine dropped from the family circle to the balcony below.|$|R
40|$|Throughout the {{operations}} of the War of the Spanish Succession in the Low Countries and Germany, senior commanders such as John Churchill, duke of Marlborough, were aided, abetted and, on occasion, disrupted by a number of general and staff officers. These officers provided the mechanism by which supra-regimental command, military direction and management was effected. While these individuals possessed military dignity according to their rank and station, their real authority in the army was in no small part drawn from the powers and duties delegated to them by the commander-inchief, or assumed upon their own initiative; <b>clear</b> <b>chains</b> of command did not exist. Such officers functioned not only as vital elements in their own army, but within the broader context of the confederate warfare as a whole, in an army composed of English (later British), Dutch, Imperial, Danish and auxiliary German contingents. They came from diverse backgrounds and could possess constrasting political affiliations, aspirations and notions of duty. Their careers were governed as much by patronage and preference as any personal merit. A burgeoning sense of military duty was complicated by personal prejudice and the boundary between public and private endeavour was indistinct. Some officers gained wealth and financial security; others were ruined by the peculations of others. ...|$|R
