40|$|Objectives: Many clinicians treat {{patients}} with a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) due to bacterial infection with antibiotics, and regard antibiotic treatment as obligatory for patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia. The necessity of antibiotic treatment is largely unknown and rarely challenged. Patients and methods: Twenty-five general practitioners (GPs) recorded clinical information on 247 adult patients presenting with LRTI. Standard microbiological, susceptibility and serological analysis, and chest radiography was performed for all patients. At 28 days after entry into the study, the GPs took a history and conducted a physical examination again and decided {{whether or not the}} patient was fully recovered. Results: Thirty of 63 patients with <b>cultured</b> pathogenic <b>bacteria</b> were either not treated with antibiotics, or treated with an antibiotic to which the <b>cultured</b> <b>bacterium</b> was non-susceptible. All but one recovered spontaneously, although it took more than 28 days for two patients. The other patient recovered with an additional course of antibiotics. Five patients from this cohort with radiological evidence of pneumonia fully recovered without antibiotic treatment. Conclusions: Not all patients with bacterial LRTI and/or pneumonia require antibiotic treatment in order to recover.

40|$|Background: Hyperbilirubinemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes for {{hospital}} admission in neonatal infants. Previous studies have found that jaundice may be one of the initial symptoms related to urinary tract infection (UTI) in infants. This study is to evaluate the incidence and related factors of neonatal infants with the initial presentation of hyperbilirubinemia and final diagnosis of UTI in a tertiary teaching hospital. Methods: We retrospectively investigated the medical records of admitted infants younger than 8 weeks old with hyperbilirubinemia between January and December 2008. The jaundiced infants having tests of urinalysis were enrolled into our study and grouped into UTI or no UTI group according to the findings of urinary culture. Results: A total of 217 neonatal jaundiced infants were enrolled. Among them, 12 cases (5. 5 %) were grouped into the UTI group, and the most common <b>cultured</b> <b>bacterium</b> from their urine was Escherichia coli. There was no significant difference in the babies’ birth weight, maternal conditions, or total bilirubin levels between the two groups. There was also no significant difference between the two groups in their admission age (9. 7  ±  13. 5 days vs. 6. 1  ±  6. 7 days in UTI and no UTI groups, respectively) or the ratio of outpatients (50 % vs. 25 % in UTI and no UTI groups, respectively) (p >  0. 05). The cases of UTI group had significantly lower hemoglobin (15. 2  ±  2. 7 g/dL vs. 17. 2  ±  2. 3  g/dL, respectively) and higher formula feeding rate (8. 3 % vs. 2. 9 %, respectively) than the no UTI group (p <  0. 05). Conclusion: The incidence of UTI in the admitted infants with hyperbilirubinemia was as high as approximately 5. 5 %. The most common <b>cultured</b> <b>bacterium</b> in urine was E coli. Therefore, performing urinary tests to exclude the possibility of coincidental UTI may be necessary for admitted jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{number and}} {{diversity}} of uncultured ruminal bacterial and archaeal species revealed by 16 S rRNA gene (rrs) sequences greatly exceeds that of <b>cultured</b> <b>bacteria</b> and archaea. However, the significance of uncultured microbes remains undetermined. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the numeric importance of select uncultured bacteria and <b>cultured</b> <b>bacteria</b> and the impact of diets and microenvironments within cow rumen in a comparative manner. Results Liquid and adherent fractions were obtained from the rumen of Jersey cattle fed hay alone and Holstein cattle fed hay plus grain. The populations of cultured and uncultured bacteria present in each fraction were quantified using specific real-time PCR assays. The population of total bacteria was similar between fractions or diets, while total archaea was numerically higher in the hay-fed Jersey cattle than in the hay-grain-fed Holstein cattle. The population of the genus Prevotella was about one log smaller than that of total bacteria. The populations of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the genus Butyrivibrio, and R. albus was at least one log smaller than that of genus Prevotella. Four of the six uncultured bacteria quantified were as abundant as F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens and the genus Butyrivibrio. In addition, the populations of several uncultured bacteria were significantly higher in the adherent fractions than in the liquid fractions. These uncultured bacteria may be associated with fiber degradation. Conclusions Some uncultured bacteria are as abundant as those of major <b>cultured</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the rumen. Uncultured bacteria may have important contribution to ruminal fermentation.
