40|$|Despite being curable {{reproductive}} tract infections (RTIs) including sexually transmitted infections {{continue to be}} a major health problem in developing countries. The present study was undertaken to know the prevalence of trichomoniasis, vaginal candidiasis, genital herpes, <b>chlamydiasis,</b> and actinomycosis in rural and urban women of Haryana by using wet mount, PAP smear, and fluorescent microscopic examination. Patients suspected of suffering from bacterial vaginosis were given treatment and {{were not included in the}} study. RTIs were seen in 16. 6 % of urban and 28. 7 % of rural women. The highest prevalence seen was that of trichomoniasis in both rural (24. 2 %) and urban (15. 7 %) women, followed by candidiasis (4. 2 % in rural and 0. 6 % in urban women), genital herpes (0. 3 % in rural and 0. 2 % in urban women), and <b>chlamydiasis</b> (0. 02 % in rural and 0. 05 % in urban women). Pelvic actinomycosis was seen in 1. 4 % of rural and 0. 06 % of urban women using intrauterine contraceptive devices. Mixed infection of Trichomonas vaginalis with Candida spp. was seen in 6. 3 % of rural women only. It is desirable to have a baseline profile of the prevalence of various agents causing RTIs in a particular geographic area and population which will help in better syndromic management of the patients...|$|E

40|$|FOR THIS STUDY 32 SHEEP, ABOUT 1 YEAR OLD EACH WERE USED. THEY WERE ASSIGNED IN FOUR GROUPS (8 ANIMALS IN EACH). THE ANIMALS OF THE FIRST GROUP WERE GIVEN SELENIUM, THE ONES IN THE SECOND GROUP WERE TAKEN VIT E, THE ANIMALS OF THE THIRD GROUP RECEIVED SELE NIUM AND VIT E AND THE ANIMALSOF THE FOURTH GROUP WEREUSED AS CONTROLS. ALL THE ANIMALS WERE VACCINATED FOR <b>CHLAMYDIASIS</b> 2 TIMES. THE SECOND VACCINATION WAS MADE 15 AFTER THE FIRST. THE ADMINISTRATION OF SELENIUM AND/OR VIT E DOESN'T AFFECT THE GROWTH OF SHEEP AND THE PCV. SELENIUM (ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH VIT E) LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF THE CHLAMYDIA ANTIBODY RESPONSE (P< 0. 05) COMPARED TO THE TITERS DEVELOPED BY THE ANIMALSTHAT RECEIVED ONLY VIT E OR THE CONTROLS. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SEL ENIUM AND GSH-PX WAS HIGH (R^ 2 = 0. 79 - 0. 98). ...|$|E
40|$|Aims. This article {{argues that}} sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS in Vanuatu are {{a cause for}} concern and that a strong response is needed to stem an epidemic. Methods. Three sources of data are used: studies and policy documents on STIs and HIV/AIDS in Vanuatu; analysis of reported STI cases from public health facilities; and key informant interviews with 14 policy stakeholders. Results. In Port Vila (capital of Vanuatu), {{more than a quarter of}} the women attending antenatal clinics were positive for at least one STI. Although Vanuatu Ministry of Health (MoH) case records for gonorrhoea, genital ulceration, and syphilis show national prevalence rates have remained relatively constant between 1. 2 % and 2 %, there is probably gross under-reporting because MoH data exclude trichomoniasis and <b>chlamydiasis</b> cases; surveillance systems are poor; and patient access to services is limited. High STI prevalence and several socioeconomic factors create a high-risk environment for the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS...|$|E
40|$|The epizootiologic, climatic, and ecologic {{conditions}} in the Middle East, combined with socioeconomic and agricultural structures in Israel, have created a unique and hazardous veterinary public health situation in this country. In this paper, emerging zoonotic diseases are newly introduced disease agents or endemic zoonoses whose previous epidemiologic patterns have changed. As of 1996, 15 zoonotic diseases of animals, anthrax, brucellosis, cysticercosis (bovine), erysipelas, leishmaniasis (canine), leptospirosis, listeriosis, malleus (glanders), psittacosis (<b>chlamydiasis),</b> Q fever, rabies, Rift Valley fever (RVF), salmonellosis, trichinosis, and tuberculosis (bovine and avian) (Table 1), have been declared notifiable in Israel. When diagnosed in animals, these diseases are officially reported to the state veterinary officers, who in turn report them to the medical officers. Of these notifiable zoonoses, RVF has never been recorded in Israel, and glanders has not been reported since 1951; ten are notifiable in humans at the national level. This article examines five of the reportable animal diseases whose epidemiologic features have changed in Israel during the last decade: Brucella melitensis in cattle, Salmonella enteritidis in poultry, rabies, canine leishmaniasis, and trichinosis in wild boars. Two nonreportable diseases in animals—botulism in ruminants and echinococcosis—will also be discussed briefly. (Table 1). Recently, the possibility that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) may be a zoonotic disease has been discussed worldwide. Thus, we also describe steps adopted by the Veterinary Services and Animal Health (VSAH) to prevent the introduction of BSE into Israel. The data on zoonotic diseases in animals are from VSAH’s annual reports to the Office International des Epizootics in Paris. If not otherwise mentioned, the data on the diseases in humans are from the weekly and monthly reports of th...|$|E
40|$|We {{are glad}} that the {{usefulness}} of Papanicolaou smears in the diagnosis of cervical <b>chlamydiasis</b> was confirmed by Panuco et al. 1 In developing countries {{it is difficult to}} obtain more expensive tests, such as immunoflourescence and polymerase chain reaction. We earlier evaluated the usefulness of the cervical smear in screening for six sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) that have specific manifestations in cervical smears: trichomoniasis; candidiasis; bacterial vaginitis; chlamydiasis; and herpes simplex and human papillomavirus infections. We also reported the usefulness of the smear in detecting Actinomyces in cervical smears from Cu-T users. 2 We were the first to extend the use of cervical smears to the diagnosis of reproductive tract infections in India and especially in low-risk populations, where regular screening for STDs is uncommon. Data on 300 cases were first presented at an all-India conference in 1985 and were extended to a larger population later. 3 The high prevalence (15 %) of Chlamydia trachomatis cervicitis in family welfare clinics was reported by us, and we also showed that the use of an intrauterine device (Cu-T) per se does not increase the incidence in this low-risk group, but the symptoms {{may be related to the}} presence of chlamydial infection. 4, 5 Our recent study on a total of 357 women using the direct fluorescent antigen test to detect antigens in endocervical specimens showed that the Papanicolaou smear has a sensitivity of 58 %, specificity of 99 %, positive predictive value of 70 % and negative predictive value of 88 %. 6 This was comparable to the performance of an antigen-detecting enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); actually, the sensitivity of ELISA was lower. Both were superior to the use of Giemsa stain for endocervical smears. We would like to add that we have reason to believe that the absence or low incidence reported by some laboratories is due to the poor quality of the Papanicolaou smears. The collection of separate endocervical smears with a brush, immediate fixation before drying occurs and proper staining with good-quality stains and careful screening will go a long way to improve the use of this method for the screening of not only STDs but also cervical neoplasia. Since culture methods are not easily available in most clinical situations, it is extremely important to evaluate nonculture methods of screening for this common sexually transmitted infection. ...|$|E
