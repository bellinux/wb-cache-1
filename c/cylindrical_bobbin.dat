40|$|When tension acts on a yarn {{running on}} a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bobbin,</b> the yarn leaves for a new {{equilibrium}} position and draws a curve on its surface. In this paper, we assumed that the yarn was free to bend, but did not stretch and that its inertial force was negligible compared to the external forces such as reaction force and friction force. The force balance equations, which determined a yarn path contacting with a curved surface, were developed in vector form {{on the basis of}} differential geometry. We derived a set of differential equations describing the space curve drawn by the yarn traveling on the cylindrical surface. Two experiments were compared with the simulations. The measured yarn path and tension for two actual examples turned out that the parabola obtained by our simulation was a fairly good approximation for the yarn path sliding on a cylindrical surface...|$|E
40|$|The Fiber Pulling Apparatus (FPA) is {{a device}} {{designed}} to produce continuous glass fibers from simulated lunar soil, {{and to determine}} the effects of reduced gravity, specifically 1 / 6 g on fiber formation and resultant properties. Briefly, pre-melt simulated lunar soil will be placed in a pint crucible and heated to 1200 C or higher, up to a maximum temperature of 1400 C. At a given temperature, a quartz fiber will be immersed into the melt and then pulled through a chill block and wound onto a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bobbin</b> using a servo motor control. A high resolution video camera will record the fiber as it is being pulled. This assembly wil be enclosed in Plexiglas. Before fiber pulling commences, the apparatus will be backfilled with dry nitrogen. A separate data acquisition system will support this apparatus. This system will contain a personal computer, video recorder, and monitor. Temperature, acceleration, winding speed, and video images will be controlled and recorded using the data acquisition system. Thus, the FPA will consist of two hardware packages, the fiber production assembly and the data acquisition rack. The primary objective of this test is {{to determine the effects}} of 1 / 6 g on the formation of continuous glass fiber made from simulated lunar soil. Baseline studies using the FPA on the ground will provide a reference for the 1 / 6 g studies. Of particular interest will be the effect of 1 / 6 g on the free fluid zone where the fiber exits the crucible. In the fiber spinning parlance this zone is known as the upper jet region, where the boundary slope is greater than one tenth. The properties of the resulting glass fiber will depend on the jet shape as well as distributions of velocity, temperature and tension within the jet. It is unknown at this time how 1 / 6 g will effect these parameters...|$|E
25|$|Samuel Crompton {{invented the}} {{spinning}} mule in 1779, so called {{because it is}} a hybrid of Arkwright's water frame and James Hargreaves' spinning jenny {{in the same way that}} mule is the product of crossbreeding a female horse with a male donkey (a female donkey is called a jenny). The spinning mule has a fixed frame with a creel of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bobbins</b> to hold the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage with the spindles. On the outward motion, the rovings are paid out through attenuating rollers and twisted. On the return, the roving is clamped and the spindles reversed to take up the newly spun thread.|$|R
