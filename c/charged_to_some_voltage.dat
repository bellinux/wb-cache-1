40|$|Battery {{is one of}} {{the media}} for power {{supplies}} in electronic devices. However, the battery�s ability supplied power limited on how big the capacity that is stored in batteries. When the battery charge runs out, it needs re-charging (charge), where the device to recharge the battery charge must consider several aspects such as charging current, battery voltage and when the charging process must be stopped, this is considering that batteries for electric bicycles 3 x 12 V/ 12 ah has a maximum current limit charging 3 A, and with charger in the sales package, not allowed <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> more than five hours. The fact is, many owners of electric bicycles do excessive charging so the battery does not last long. The solution to this problem is <b>to</b> use battery <b>charger,</b> which can be used <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> the battery <b>charge</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>voltage</b> rating (12 V and 24 V). This battery charger is equipped with buckboost converter for voltage and charging current regulator which way this works is based on the large PWM duty cycle generated by the microcontrolle...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the latest}} {{developments}} in smart grid infrastructures of today’s modern networks, in this paper, end-consumers are presented as a means for participating in distribution networks voltage control. In this regard, for reactive power control of the smart grids, a new algorithm for selecting candidate buses for injecting reactive power in distributed voltage control approach is proposed. In the distributed voltage control approach, at first, -decomposition technique is adopted to calculate sensitivities of bus voltage to the injected reactive power. Therefore, buses with strong voltage relation are considered as a region which divides the network <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>voltage</b> related regions. Afterwards, candidate buses for reactive power injection for each one of the achieved region are identified by use of the proposed algorthim. It is noted that, candidate buses of the network are those with reasonably better response to the reactive power injection. Finally, genetic algorithm is applied to obtain optimal reactive power injection of each region. For better evaluation of the proposed selecting candidate buse algorithm, the IEEE 33 -bus test system which is commonly used in literature is applied here. Simulation results clearly illustrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm in improving voltage profile of distributio...|$|R

The period 4 oscillation of the oxygen-releasing reaction, as measured by UV absorbance changes, is shifted by one flash at pH 8. 3.

It is concluded that at pH 8. 3 the S 1 -state is reduced to S 0. The half-time of the reduction of S 1 to S 0 is 45 s, and the reduction is reversed in the dark if the pH is readjusted to pH 6. 0.

This study seeks to find the reasons why charges of life {{insurance companies}} differ. Exploiting recently available data from the Financial Services Authority, this dissertation use a regression model to test if firm size and organizational form are significantly determining charges. In addition, data are used to estimate the price of different product characteristics in the UK stakeholder & personal pension and investment bonds markets. The results show that firm size, organizational form and product characteristics have significant relationship with <b>charges</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent.

The findings show that if insurance companies have low charges for personal pension, there is high probability they will have low charges for investment bonds...|$|R
50|$|In electronics, {{a linear}} {{regulator}} {{is a system}} used to maintain a steady voltage. The resistance of the regulator varies {{in accordance with the}} load resulting in a constant output voltage. The regulating device is made to act like a variable resistor, continuously adjusting a voltage divider network to maintain a constant output voltage and continually dissipating the difference between the input and regulated voltages as waste heat. By contrast, a switching regulator uses an active device that switches on and off to maintain an average value of output. Because the regulated voltage of a linear regulator must always be lower than input voltage, efficiency is limited and the input voltage must be high enough to always allow the active device <b>to</b> drop <b>some</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|R

5000|$|While {{it is not}} {{possible}} to create an isolated drive with op-amp circuitry alone, it is possible to create a floating output. This is important if one leg of the line might become grounded or connected <b>to</b> <b>some</b> other <b>voltage</b> reference.

A floating op-amp output can only float within the limits of the op-amp's supply rails. [...] An isolated output can be achieved without transformers with the addition of opto-isolators.|$|R
