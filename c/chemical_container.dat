5000|$|The Gas Gang {{appeared}} in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode [...] "Clash of the Metal Men" [...] with Oxygen voiced by Brian Bloom, Carbon Dioxide voiced by Hynden Walch, Hydrogen voiced by Lex Lang, Helium voiced by Bill Fagerbakke, and Chloroform and Nitrogen having no dialogue. This version of the team is altered somewhat from the original: Hydrogen (an explosive gas) is added, Carbon Dioxide has the body of Carbon Monoxide (leaving Carbon Monoxide out of the team altogether), and Carbon Dioxide's body from the comics is used by a new character, Nitrogen. This version of the Gas Gang are Dr. Magnus' fellow scientists who were turned into gaseous forms following a lab accident {{trying to use the}} experiment for themselves and then develop the right gas to cause volcanoes to erupt causing mass destruction. They kidnap Dr. Will Magnus in order to form robotic bodies to store their fading bodies. They fought Batman and the Metal Men and ended up defeating them. Dr. Magnus reluctantly made them robotic bodies to store their gaseous forms when they tricked him into believing that he was responsible for their condition. They then strapped a <b>chemical</b> <b>container</b> to Dr. Magnus and slowly lowered him into a volcano so that the heat can trigger the <b>chemical</b> <b>container</b> and set off the volcano. When their powers were too much for the Metal Men, they formed around Batman to form an armor. After taking a beating, the Gas Gang also combined and turned the tide against Batman and the Metal Men. Batman threw a torch at the combined Gas Gang exploding their robotic bodies and combined their gas forms into a deadly gas cloud. While Batman went after the Gas Gang, the Metal Men saved Dr. Magnus. Batman set his Batplane to self-destruct destroying the Gas Gang.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nowadays the {{management}} of the security of goods and persons is a stake mattering in industries. In general, product’s security level is the matter of each individual product and it often depends on products ’ interactions within vicinity. An efficient security management needs to be based on distributed security model supported by each individual products. Ambient and communication technologies bring new visions in creating reliable security systems, where products are transformed into smart products. Thus, each product acts as an active brick of the whole security system by means of embedded security functions as monitoring, controlling, decision making and alarming actions according to security and dependency rules. We propose the Active Product concept that provides product reactive behaviors to changes and inappropriate storage conditions, based on the security rules it is compelled. In our approach a product as for example a <b>chemical</b> <b>container</b> can be aware of its handling and storage conditions, and of changes in its environment and can be sensitive to products which surround it. Using wireless sensors attached to products, we create a network of interactive and communicating products to manage an Active Security System in an Ambient Intelligent Environment where human operators and hazardous chemical products are interacting securily in warehoursing and handling area.

40|$|Information on {{the seismic}} {{response}} of <b>chemical</b> <b>containers</b> located in storage racks is very limited. Unfortunately, no clearly established data and statistics exist related to potential damage of chemical racking systems during earthquakes. Hence, this work presents an approach for developing fragility curves for chemical racking {{systems in the}} cross-aisle direction through dynamic non-linear analysis. It aims to simulate the structural behaviour of various racking systems in the cross-aisle direction for the worst-case scenario, in order to quantify the vulnerability of chemical racks in seismic areas and {{to better understand the}} associated natech risk. Analytical fragility curves and a fault tree model were derived and used to evaluate the probabilities of <b>chemical</b> <b>containers</b> falling from racks. The damage state limits were considered as four levels of intensity of loss of containment. Three damage modes (overturning, sliding, and buckling), two types of <b>chemical</b> <b>containers</b> (205 l metal drums and 1000 l IBCs), three types of rack base anchoring (unanchored, anchored-brittle, and anchored-plastic), and four rack heights (3, 4. 5, 6, 7. 5, 9 m) were considered in the analysis. Overall, twenty-four fragility curves were developed based on twenty-six strong motion records from the PEER Strong Motion database. However, the analytical method employed in this study can also be used for deriving fragility curves for other merchandise types of racking structures. In order to assess the natech risk of a chemical rack containing a flammable substance, to test the developed fragility curves, and to illustrate the natech risk assessment and mapping capabilities of RAPID-N, a case study based on the 1786 Olivieri earthquake scenario was conducted. The findings demonstrate that chemical racks loaded with IBCs are more vulnerable than those loaded with drums. Moreover, although a very robust anchorage reduces the probability of collapse of the rack, it increases the probability of <b>chemical</b> <b>containers</b> falling. JRC.
