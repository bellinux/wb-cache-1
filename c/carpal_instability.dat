40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{prevalence}} of <b>carpal</b> <b>instability</b> in a paraplegic population was investigated {{to establish an}} association between chronic repetitive stress on the wrist {{and the development of}} such instability. Nine of 162 paraplegic patients had static <b>carpal</b> <b>instability</b> and no history of an acute injury of the wrist. The predom-inant pattern of instability, found in eleven wrists (six patients), was non-dissociative volar intercalated seg-mental instability.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Carpal</b> <b>instability</b> is a biomechanical {{alteration}} with {{a multiple}} pathogenesis which, if not identified and treated in time, leads to gradual articular collapse. Traumatism {{is known to}} be one of the main causes of <b>carpal</b> <b>instability,</b> while deposits of microcrystals caused by metabolic (chondrocalcinosis and gout) and congenital (ulna minus variance) diseases are less frequently involved in the pathogenesis. In forms secondary to traumatism, the trauma causes ligamentous injuries that lead to misalignments of the joint surfaces, or badly healed fractures with consequent articular incongruency. In both situations, an alteration of carpal kinematics is generated and, if normal carpal biomechanics are not restored, this alteration leads, over the course of time, to degenerative alterations of the cartilage, followed by chondral erosions and to the exposure of the bone. We present the etiology, topography and consequences of <b>carpal</b> <b>instability,</b> discussing the diagnostic procedure, which always begins with a conventional X-ray examination, followed by a CT and/or an MRI with an intra-articular injection of contrast medium as the gold standard for a correct evaluation.

40|$|Thirteen {{patients}} with lunate and perilunar dislocations were treated in our {{department in the}} last five years. Ten out of the thirteen patients were followed more than eight months with an average of two years and two months. Two out of the ten patients followed failed to obtain normal anatomical carpal architecture. These two patients were treated by arthrodesis of the wrist and proximal row carpectomy, respectively. The remaining eight patients, that obtained reduction, were classified into three groups according to existence of gap between the scaphoid and lunate, and incongruity between the lunate and triquetrum. Patients with a gap between the scaphoid and lunate of more than 3 millimetres after reduction of their dislocations had poor clinical results. This suggests significant correlation between clinical results and <b>carpal</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Lunate and perilunar dislocations are comparatively uncommon and constitute only about 10 % of all carpal injuries (Dobyns, 1975 a).

40|$|In {{many cases}} {{articular}} damages cannot be diagnosed through {{an examination of}} a single image. A motion analysis of a joint's bones might be necessary to make a reliable diagnosis. Examples are lesions of the ligaments and cartilage of the knee or in the cervical and lumbar regions of the vertebral.

Compared to other applications a motion analysis of the wrist bones is more difficult because there are many bones with a similar shape which complicates their identification.

40|$|Carpal dislocations {{commonly}} {{occur as}} the result of high-energy axial loading of the forearm with the wrist extended. There exists several variants of carpal dislocations with the most commonly observed being those about the lunate. Perilunate dislocations and fracture dislocations were first characterized by Mayfield in 1980 and represent a spectrum of traumatic carpal dislocation beginning radial and progressing to the ulnar side of the wrist (Mayfield et al. J Hand Surg [Am] 5 : 226 – 241, 1980). The path of energy takes a predictable pattern around the lunate from the scapho-lunate ligament, into the mid-carpal joint and then to the luno-triquetral joint. The final stage is volar dislocation of the lunate into the carpal canal. These complex fracture dislocations are unstable and require operative fixation through open reduction and with internal fixation (Herzberg et al. J Hand Surg [Am] 18 : 768 – 779, 1993; Adkison and Chapman Clin Orthop Rel Res 164 : 199 – 207, 1982). Other types of carpal dislocations have been described; however, these are much less frequently encountered (Green and O’Brien Clin Orthop Rel Res 149 : 55 – 72, 1980; Irwin et al. J Hand Surg [Br] 20 B: 746 – 749, 1995; Rosado J Bone Joint Surg 48 B: 504 – 506, 1966). These also include mid-carpal instability and longitudinal (axial) instability and have been described extensively in the literature (Norbeck et al. J Hand Surg 12 A: 509 – 514, 1987; Primiano and Reef J Bone Joint Surg 56 A: 328 – 332, 1974; Garcia-Elias et al. J Hand Surg 14 A: 446 – 457, 1989; Taleisnik Hand Clinics 3 : 51 – 68, 1987). <b>Carpal</b> <b>instabilities</b> can be characterized as dissociative which disrupt joints within a carpal row, or as non-dissociative which have dislocations or subluxations between carpal rows (Dobyns and Cooney 1998). We report a case of complex carpal injury non-dissociative involving dislocation of the entire proximal carpal row volarly. To our knowledge such a variation of complex carpal dislocation has not been reported.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{roentgen}} {{appearance and}} pathogenesis of <b>carpal</b> <b>instability</b> {{are described in}} an evaluation of patients and cadavers with rheumatoid arthritis and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.

40|$|AbstractThe wrist is {{a region}} that is very {{vulnerable}} to injuries of the extremities.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the results}} of conventional and MR arthrography on 20 wrists with chronic or subacute wrist pain, which were suspected mainly for scapholunate instability and ruptures of the triangular fibrocartilage complex, by the physical and radiological examination. On the basis of bibliography and {{the results of}} this study the following conclusions are derived: 1. Conventional arthrography and conventional MRI are precious methods for the diagnostic approach of <b>carpal</b> <b>instabilities.</b> However, our diagnostic modalities can be improved by the intraarticular injection of contrast materials and therefore joints enhancement. 2. A detailed physical examination and evaluation of radiographic findings of a painful wrist, can lead us to the wright choice of which partial compartment or compartments should be injected. So, performance of the more invasive and time consuming triple injection wrist arthrogram is not neseccary. Otherwise, satisfactory images are being taken for the rest of the ligamentous or fibrocartilaginus structures by the following magnetic resonance images. 3. Conventional arthrography is a dynamic examination which can reveal a lesion at the time of contrast leakage. This is of great value especially for cases which concern the lunatotriquetral ligament which is very small at ulnar to radial dimension and because, during the MR imaging later, the borders of the rupture may overlap and they would not be visible, so a false negative result might be given. 4. Conventional arthrography provides indirect but sufficient information for TFC lesions. Therefore, MRA, a much more expensive and time consuming examination is not necessary to be performed. 5. On the other hand, magnetic resonance arthrography is necessary when the conventional one, reveals interosseous ligaments lesions, as it has the advantage to provide us precise information about the localization, size and extention of a defect of the ligamentous structures, which is very important for the following treatment. Additionally, it attributes a direct image of the examined structures. Moreover, it can give us information about the extrinsic ligaments integrity, which play an important role for the wrist stability. 6. As far as the sequenses used are concerned, we found that, T 1 with fat suppresion and T 2 are the most useful. 7. As far as the used sections are concerned, coronal sections are sufficient in revealing the lesions, although performing the axial and saggital ones, completes a thorough evaluation. 8. Conventional and MR arthrography are examinations which confirm and complete one another. They are also examinations with high diagnostic accuracy especially when they are combined. However, when still having diagnostic doubts, arthroscopy has an indication. ...|$|R

Wrist function was graded preoperatively and postoperatively using an assessment system modified from Chun and Palmer (1993). The results show that distal ulnar shortening osteotomy successfully reduces pain and improves wrist function both for ulnar <b>carpal</b> <b>instability</b> (UCI) and ulnar impaction syndrome (UIS) and is equally effective for those patients with combined UIS and UCI. Grip strength and wrist stability were significantly improved and range of wrist and forearm motion was little affected by the procedure. Oblique osteotomies were found to heal faster and to have a lower non-union rate than transverse osteotomies.

All cases were followed for minimal 16 months after each operation. Tendon ball replacement arthroplasty after excision of lunate could not prevent further carpal collapse with persistent chronic wrist pain. The triscaphe fusion or radio-lunate fusion induced a marked limited wrist motion later, and the triscaphe fusion alone was not fit {{for the treatment of}} advanced one because of progressive proximal migration of capitate and continuous wrist pain due to ligamentous <b>carpal</b> <b>instability</b> in follow-up. So we tried to simultaneously combine tendon ball replacement arthroplasty after excision of lunate with triscaphe fusion in far advanced Kienböck's disease, and their end results was favorable. Proximal row carpectomy could be done in far advanced Kienböck's disease with reasonably painless wrist motions. The overall end results of proximal row carpectomy are much better than any form of carpal arthrodesis. Conclusively the proper way to treat advanced Kienböck's disease seems to depend on the patient's age, their job and sex, and the stage of disease.

40|$|A normal {{database}} of {{qualitative and quantitative}} data, obtained from standard posteroanterior wrist radiographs has been established which might be useful in clinical practice. Variations in the parameters obtained could provide {{an explanation for the}} variable carpal kinematics and multiple concepts of <b>carpal</b> <b>instability</b> described in the literature. Selected landmarks were digitized on 80 posteroanterior wrist radiographs of asymptomatic volunteers. Besides classical parameters, measurement of carpal dimensions and angular relationships were also taken. Two new parameters, the scapholunate ratios, are described which evaluate the relative lengths of the frontal projections of the scaphoid and lunate: these ratios might prove useful in the diagnosis of <b>carpal</b> <b>instability.</b> The shapes of the frontal projections of the radiocarpal, midcarpal and STT joint spaces were also analysed. Average values for parameters already reported in the literature agreed with previous findings. Some parameters, however, displayed important individual variations, the standard deviations ranging from 1 to 3 mm for dimensions and from 3 to 13 degrees for angular measurements. The posteroanterior and anteroposterior scapholunate ratios averaged 1. 41 +/- 0. 21 and 0. 66 +/- 0. 13 respectively. The potential clinical benefit of these ratios is discussed. Different types of joint space projection shapes could be determined. With respect to the difficulty of obtaining reliable lateral wrist radiographs, compared to posteroanterior radiographs, it is suggested that the clinical significance of the proposed parameters must be evaluated.

40|$|Scaphoid {{fracture}} union {{depends upon}} early diagnosis and adequate management {{and is considered}} to be adversely influenced by proximal scaphoid avascularity and <b>carpal</b> <b>instability.</b> There is, however, controversy on various aspects in the diagnosis and management of this injury. Studies investigating some of these aspects are reported in this thesis. With regard to the initial diagnosis of this fracture this thesis demonstrated that the fracture was usually visible on the 'Ziter' or the posterio-anterior radiographic view while radiographic evaluation of soft tissue swelling was of less value than that suggested by current literature. Moreover, the second week radiograph did not provide reliable evidence of a fracture in those suspected on clinical examination alone. Normal lines in an intact scaphoid could be mis-interpreted as a fracture. With regard to management, the fracture healed equally well in a Colles' cast: thumb immobilisation {{did not appear to be}} neccessary. The incidence of non-union was around 12 % and most were symptomatic. A further 25 %, in whom the fracture site was easily identified but appeared to have healed, formed a distinct clinical group and many had symptoms. The reliability and reproducibility of radiographic signs of union were poor. Therefore, a real time ultrasonographic method of demonstrating movement at the scaphoid fracture site was developed. Proximal avascularity was more common than that suggested by radiographic appearances alone while <b>carpal</b> <b>instability</b> was uncommon within two years of injury. Based on these observations a rational approach to management of scaphoid fractures was proposed...|$|E

The overall incidence reported by Tang (1992) was 30 %. This is in contrast with Dobyns et al (1975) who reported a 10 % incidence. Stanley and Trail (1994) found one ligamentous lesion in 25 % and multiple injuries of the ligaments in 75 % of patients during post-traumatic rthroscopic evaluations of 98 wrists. However, isolated ligamentous injuries must be regarded with great care as Herbert et al (1990) found on arthrography of 60 patients that 74 % had injuries to the wrist ligaments on the contralateral ssymptomatic side. <b>Carpal</b> <b>instability</b> after radial fractures eems to be more frequent in the elderly population (Frahm et al, 1989). The average age of patients with carpal instabili-ties was 65 years compared to 46 years in these patients without carpal collapse (Tang, 1992). The need for treating carpal instabilities is debatable. It is generally agreed that treatment is only necessary if there is continuing pain, restricted motion by more than 80 % and a loss of grip strength of more than 80 % (Dobyns et al, 1975). To evaluate the necessity for treatment, a {{prospective study}} was undertaken to determine the clinical impor-tance of <b>carpal</b> <b>instability</b> following distal radial fractures...|$|E
