We have. considered it wise, therefore, to omit, for the present, detai. led consideration of particular media, and have studj 0 ed,Qniderable variety of solutions upon which we havema de more than 400 electrometric measurements and many more colorimetric comparisons. These comparisons between the colorimetric and electrometric meas-urements are given iwr tables 4 to 19. In these comparisons we shall consider the hydrogen electrode measurements as the standard, since they were made with an equipment and iui a manner which has proved accurate and reli-able.

In one or two other cases electrometric determinations with solutions in a P. region where their buffer effect is small have been somewhat uncertain.

40|$|A simple, sensitive, and {{selective}} spectrophotometric method {{has been developed}} for the determination of gabapentin (GBP) in capsules. The method {{is based on the}} reaction of GBP and sodium 1, 2 -naphthoquinone- 4 -sulfonate (NQS) in the presence of <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lubs</b> buffer of pH 11 to form an orange-coloured product which was measured at 495 nm. The parameters that affect the reaction were carefully optimized and under the optimized conditions, linear relationship was obtained in the concentration range of 7. 5 - 75 mu g ml(- 1) GBP. The molar absorptivity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) and Sandell sensitivity are also reported. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of GBP in capsules with good accuracy and precision and without detectable interference from common excipients. The reliability of the proposed method was further established by parallel determination by the reference method and also by recovery studies. The reaction mechanism is proposed and discussed.

40|$|We have a {{great deal}} of {{information}} on the influence of reac-tion upon the growth of microorganisms as well as on the changes of reaction of the medium which result from the growth of these organisms. But, unfortunately, the largest amount of work along this line has been done by merely titrating the medium, using a single indicator, with acid or alkali solutions. Very few at-tempts have been made actually to measure the concentration of the hydrogen-ions in solution and study the effect of the buffers upon these changes in reaction and thus obtain more definite data upon the changes in reaction produced by microorganisms. This has been recently pointed out by <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lubs</b> (1917) in a series of investigations. Another point to be considered is the fact that most of the studies of the changes of reaction of culture media produced by microtorganisms were conducted with protein and peptone rich media, where the buffer effect of the substances is very important, an effect which was usually not taken into consideration. Michaelis and Marcora (1912) stated that B. coli will produce in lactose bouillon, independent of the lactose content and initial alkalinity of the solution, a concentration of lactic acid equiva-lent to pH 5. 0 and thus approach a maimum acidity for the organism.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the {{investigation}} of various halophilic bacteria it became of interest to determine the magnitude of the sodium chloride error in the colorimetric estimation of pH. Various investigators (Clark, 1925) have estimated salt errors at low concentrations (1 M or less) while both Wells (1920) and Ramage and Miller (1925) have studied the salt errors of cresol red over fairly wide ranges of salt concentration. The object of this work was to ascertain the errors in measuring colorimetrically the pH of solutions 1, 2 and 3 M with respect to sodium chloride using the sulfon phthalein series of indicators. The general procedure consisted in buffering the salt solutions, adding indicator and adjusting to the same color as that given by an identical buffer containing no salt. The pH of each solu-tion was then measured electrometrically and {{the difference between the two}} readings taken as the salt error. The standard buffer solutions proposed by <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lubs</b> (Clark, 1925) were prepared in M/ 5 concentration from specially purified materials and preserved in glass stoppered Pyrex glass containers. The sodium hydroxide solution was prepared car-bonate free from sodium amalgam and preserved in an appro-priate manner. The buffer solutions were made up to the recommended M/ 20 concentration immediately before use. The following is given as an example of the method finally adopted.

40|$|In a {{work that}} soon will be {{published}} one of us, Blanc has extensively studied the biochemistry of certain anaerobes, especially Bacillus sporogenes and Bacillus histolyticus. It seemed to be of interest also to introduce in that work the methods, especially worked out in America by <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lubs</b> (1917) and their followers, for studying the influence of hydrogen ion concen-tration in its relation to growth and proteolytic activity. The other of us, Dernby, has already {{in a series of}} papers used these methods (Dernby 1918, Dernby and Avery 1918 and Dernby and David 1920), and as we have limited this paper to as short a communication as possible, we may for the description of methods refer to these papers mentioned above. What will follow are merely the main results of our work with some anaerobic micro-organisms. Some time ago, Wolf and Harris and Wolf and Telfer (1917) studied the biochemistry of the anaerobes, B. welchii (perfringens) and B. sporogenes (Metchnikoff), taking into consideration the influence of hydrogen ion concentration. It seems, however, that they, like many other authors at that time, paid too much attention to what is called "the limiting hydrogen ion concen-tration " and the influence of organic acids on the growth of the micro 6 rganisms. In our opinion the first thing to do, when studying the biochemistry of a given micro 6 rganism, is to deter-mine the limiting and the optimal pH values for the growth of this organism in a given medium.

40|$|In {{an article}} of the above title {{recently}} published in this jour-nal, Medalia (1920) presents a system of color standards some-what similar to one published by me a little before (Gillespie, 1920). The work is evidently independent of mine, but the proposed tables are in serious disagreement {{with the results of}} my work. The cause of the disagreement apparently does not lie in a con-flict of observations, but in the plan followed by Medalia in pre-paring the tables. It is stated that a test of this plan with the indicator, brom-thymol blue, "succeeded perfectly, i. e., the green color was found at (pair no. 4) pH 7; or slightly yellowish green at (pair no. 3) pH 6. 8 according to this range. (The change of color of this indicator was found by the writer to start with pH 6. 2 instead of pH 6 as given by <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lubs.)</b> " Unfortunately, this test is not sufficient to afford evidence in favor of the plan as against the method used by me to "smooth out " experimental errors for the preparation of tables, because the mass action equation used for this smoothing requires that such a limited test of the plan shall succeed perfectly, the error involved being only 0. 02 pH, well within the experimental error. In fact, the mass action equation requires that, if one is able to determine both limits, equally distant from the half-transfor- 1 Although there are practical limits to the useful range, there is of course no real point of pH where the indicator '"starts in " to change color, but only a sub-jective point "over the threshold " where it may appear to do so...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{contains}} {{high concentrations}} of calcium. It occurs in two forms, a free ionic form, and calcium associated with milk proteins (caseins). The latter association is called colloidal calcium phosphate. New Zealand Dairy Foods of Takanini is marketing a range of commercial milks in supermarkets. The company uses ultra filtration to concentrate milk proteins and calcium in different milk products. During ultra filtration, the fraction that is retained by the membrane is rich in calcium bound to proteins and the portion that passes through the membrane is richer in the free ionic form. The company wanted to develop a quick and an economical method {{that can be applied}} in industrial settings to determine calcium in both these fractions and in other milk products. This research aimed to develop a quick, wet chemistry method to measure calcium in milk fractions and to trial it in an industrial environment. Two methods, the so-called EDTA method and the atomic absorption spectrophotometric method (AA) were trialled as potential reference methods against which to compare results obtained by the method to be developed. The AA method was chosen due to its ease, accuracy and precision. (This could not be selected as the industrial method for a number of reasons.) A colorimetric method was favoured over other contenders. Two colorimetric dyes, Arsenazo I and o-cresolphthalein-complexone (CPC) were chosen to work with. Arsenazo I forms a purple complex with calcium in a suitable buffer at a range of pHs. o-Cresolphthalein-complexone also forms purple-coloured complexes at alkaline pHs. During method development with Arsenazo I, different buffers were trialled and a NaOH/ KCl buffer was selected for further development at pH 12. The method worked well during the development phase but with some inconsistent results at times. o-Cresolphthalein-complexone formed clear purple complexes with <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lubs</b> and 2 -amino- 2 -methylpropanol (AMP) buffers. The key advantage of the CPC dye with AMP buffer was that when 8 -hydroxyquinoline was included in the reaction mixture, it successfully masked coloured complex formation due to CPC with magnesium, which is present in milk at about 1 / 3 the calcium concentration. This effect did not work with Arsenazo I. However, the results obtained with the CPC method were lower than claimed values of most milks trialled during development. Both methods were compared for their precision and it was found that CPC method has better precision and was chosen for further development. To improve the accuracy and precision, various denaturing reagents were used to (hypothetically) release calcium from the caseins. Trichloroacetic acid at 25 % was more effective than the several other denaturing treatments tested. The finalised CPC method, using trichloroacetic acid, AMP and 8 -hydroxyquinoline, was then used to monitor calcium concentration over four months in three milk products, skim, Xtra (retentate) and permeate. For all milks, the CPC values were lower than the AA reference values, and the values reported by a commercial analytical laboratory. The reasons for this are discussed, as are other changes in calcium concentration in the three milks throughout the trial. The correlation between the CPC and AA values was poor for Xtra, better for skim, and best for permeate. A chemical model to explain this is discussed. The method developed is cheap and quick, and sample and reagent preparation is simple. The method could be applied in an industrial environment, but a proportionality factor would have to be applied to account for the difference in mean values between the CPC and AA methods...|$|E
