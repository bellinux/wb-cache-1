40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to control the mechanical properties of gellan through the addition of a secondary polymer network, for use as an alternative to <b>current</b> tissue <b>regeneration</b> techniques. Cartilage and skin are complex structures, and a complex structure would therefore be required in order to closely mimic their mechanical properties. In {{this research}}, the gellan gels were strengthened through the addition of Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), as the secondary polymer. Compressive strength and compressive stiffness were both increased with the addition on PVA, until 10 â 15 % (w/w). This research has shown that gellan and PVA are phase separated, and the decrease on mechanical strength and stiffness is strongly affected by the polymer overlap concentration, occurring at 14 % (w/w) ...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{system for}} in situ {{regeneration}} of reduced nicotinamide cofactors (NADH) is proposed: through {{a cascade of}} alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), formaldehyde dismutase (FDM) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) complete oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide (CO 2) is coupled to the regeneration of NADH. As a consequence, from one equivalent of methanol three equivalents of NADH can be obtained. The feasibility of this cascade is demonstrated at the examples of an NADH-dependent reduction of conjugated C[DOUBLE BOND]C-double bonds (catalysed by an enoate reductase) and the NADH-dependent hydroxylation of phenols (catalysed by a monooxygenase). The major limitation of the <b>current</b> <b>regeneration</b> system is the comparably poor catalytic efficiency of the methanol oxidation step (low kcat and high KM value of the ADH used) necessitating higher than theoretical methanol concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Major {{limitations}} of <b>current</b> tissue <b>regeneration</b> approaches using artificial scaffolds are fibrous encapsulation, lack of host cellular infiltration, unwanted immune responses, surface degradation preceding biointegration, and artificial degradation byproducts. Specifically, for scaffolds larger than 200 â 500 Î¼m, implants {{must be accompanied}} by host angiogenesis in order to provide adequate nutrient/waste exchange in the newly forming tissue. In the current work, we design a peptide-based self-assembling nanofibrous hydrogel containing cell-mediated degradation and proangiogenic moieties that specifically address these challenges. This hydrogel can be easily delivered by syringe, is rapidly infiltrated by cells of hematopoietic and mesenchymal origin, and rapidly forms an extremely robust mature vascular network. Scaffolds show no signs of fibrous encapsulation and after 3 weeks are resorbed into the native tissue. These supramolecular assemblies may prove a vital paradigm for tissue regeneration and specifically for ischemic tissue disease...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{have investigated the}} feasibility of granular activated carbon (GAC) regeneration via an electrochemical technique. GAC was loaded with phenol by batch adsorption tests, electrochemically regenerated and finally reloaded with phenol. Regeneration was conducted by placing GAC on a platinum elecotrode within a batch reactor filled with electrolyte (generally a 1 % NaCl solution), and applying a current to the reactor. Limited experiments show that cathodic regeneration is more efficient than anodic regeneration; the investigation concentrates on the former. Although anodic regeneration is more efficient in destroying residual phenol in the electrolyte, cathodic regeneration can also eliminate these residuals by using longer regeneration times and/or higher <b>currents.</b> Increasing the <b>regeneration</b> <b>current</b> and time could increase the regeneration efficiency (RE) up to 94 percent. Lower currents applied for longer regeneration times yield similar results with slightly lower energy consumption. REs are also significantly affected by the electrolyte type, electrolyte concentration, and GAC particle size, but not by the carbon loading. Multiple regenerations only reduced the REs by an additional 2 percent per cycle. Preliminary analysis indicates that electrochemical regeneration is less expensive than thermal regeneration as it has no obvious carbon losses. Since this electrochemical regeneration process is technologically feasible and probably more economical than thermal regeneration, it merits further investigation...|$|R

40|$|The {{applicability}} of deterministic models, {{and in particular}} the polar co-ordinate model of French, Bryant & Bryant (1976), to the regenerative process has been investigated by per-forming ipsilateral blastemal rotations of varying angle on the fore and hind limbs of the axolotl. The results show that the frequency of supernumerary production rises with in-creasing angle to reach a peak at 180 Â° and then falls off more rapidly, giving rise to an asymmetric distribution curve. The position of supernumerary outgrowth also suggests a probabilistic event, there being no consistent relationship between this parameter and the angle of rotation. The polar co-ordinate model is incapable of explaining these results and the work suggests that the determinism of <b>current</b> <b>regeneration</b> models may have to be abandoned in favour of a more stochastic theory...|$|E

Bioreactors are widely used {{in the field of}} bone {{tissue engineering}}, as they help support efficient nutrition of cultured cells with the possible combination of applying mechanical stimuli. Beneficial influencing parameters of in vitro cultures are difficult to find and are mostly determined by trial and error, which is associated with significant time and money spent. Mathematical simulations can support the finding of optimal parameters. Simulations have evolved over the last 20 years from simple analytical models to complex and detailed computational models. They allow researchers to simulate the mechanical as well as the biological environment experienced by cells seeded on scaffolds in a bioreactor. Based on the simulation results, it is possible to give recommendations about specific parameters for bone bioreactor cultures, such as scaffold geometries, scaffold mechanical properties, the level of applied mechanical loading or nutrient concentrations. This article reviews the evolution in simulating various aspects of dynamic bone culture in bioreactors and reveals future research directions...|$|R
40|$|Glasgow Harbour is a {{changing}} landscape.

The terms âforced relocationâ and âdisplacementâ are often too crude to describe what actually happens within processes of restructuring and the effects upon residents. Displacement in particular has important dimensions other than the physical one of moving. Evidence from a recent study of people who have moved out of restructured areas shows that although there is some evidence of physical displacement, there is little evidence of social or psychosocial displacement after relocation. Prior attitudes to moving and aspects of the process of relocationâthe degree of choice and distance involvedâare important moderators of the outcomes.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{the way in which}} <b>current</b> <b>regeneration</b> {{evaluation}} is often constructed is focused upon performance management, with far less emphasis placed upon innovative, creative and learning elements. It also argues that a key omission in current evaluation research is a lack of appreciation of the negotiation of evaluator roles, which has implications for {{the extent to which the}} evaluator is independent or integrated into the regeneration process. From the authors' collective experiences of local regeneration evaluation and involvement in national evaluation programme evaluation, a typology of evaluation roles is constructed. Four narratives are developed of different roles that an evaluator might play â a monitor, a facilitator, a broker and a critical friend â and the impact that regeneration evaluation has on practice is discussed. The paper concludes by drawing out a series of learning points to help inform the everyday experience of regeneration managers and evaluators, and to assist in developing more appropriate local regeneration evaluation, which promotes an increasingly reflective learning practice. ...|$|E
40|$|Focusing on the TarlabaÅÄ± {{urban renewal}} project in Istanbul, this paper {{examines}} Turkeyâs recent implementation of urban regeneration policies {{for the purpose}} of restructuring urban land markets. Turkeyâs <b>current</b> urban <b>regeneration</b> model is premised on demolishing the whole regeneration area, and rebuilding it, together with local governments and the private sector. The implementation of this model has led to the restructuring of property markets in low-income housing areas, through the regularization/legalization of tenure structures, and revalorization of the areas. It is claimed that this model solves economic and socio-spatial problems, and therefore places Istanbul in the so-called global city hierarchy. However, as the TarlabaÅÄ± urban renewal project demonstrates, the Turkish Stateâs regeneration model led to evictions, increasing the housing problems of the poor, deepening their poverty, and terminating the survival strategies they had developed over the years through informal economic and social networks. This paper aims to analyse the impacts this model has had, by illuminating socio-spatial aspects of the TarlabaÅÄ± neighbourhood such as labour market dynamics, income levels, and daily life practices...|$|R
