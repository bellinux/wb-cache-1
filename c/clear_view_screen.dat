A <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> <b>screen</b> is typically driven by an electric motor {{at the center of}} the disk, and is often heated to prevent condensation or icing.

5000|$|The {{drive-in}} {{theater was}} patented in Camden, New Jersey by chemical company magnate Richard M. Hollingshead, Jr., whose family {{owned and operated}} the R.M. Hollingshead Corporation chemical plant in Camden. In 1932, Hollingshead conducted outdoor theater tests in his driveway at 212 Thomas Avenue in Riverton. After nailing a screen to trees in his backyard, he set a 1928 Kodak projector {{on the hood of}} his car and put a radio behind the screen, testing different sound levels with his car windows down and up. Blocks under vehicles in the driveway enabled him to determine the size and spacing of ramps so all automobiles could have a <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> of the <b>screen.</b> Hollingshead applied for a patent of his invention on August 6, 1932, and he was given [...] on May 16, 1933.|$|R
40|$|Precise endograft {{placement}} in the thoracic aorta is challenging {{due to the}} special local anatomy and unique hemodynamic blood flow. We are employing many techniques together to launch the endograft precisely to the target location: various debranching techniques to extend the proximal landing zone, magnified imaging with full exposition of the supra-arch branches and the proximal landing area to achieve a <b>clear</b> and accurate <b>view,</b> <b>screen</b> markers of the landing target for guidance of deployment, 1 - 2 cm proximally to the cranial landing marker before launching in case of any displacement, steady deployment of the endograft in hypotensive status or within the temporary heart asystole period induced by intravenous adenosine administration. If a balloon angioplasty or a proximal cuff is inevitable, the abovementioned techniques should be repeated. Our single center results have proved the combined techniques for precise thoracic endograft placement reliable, effective, simple and practical...|$|R
5|$|The {{stage and}} {{associated}} props took twenty-four semi-trailer trucks to transport. The setup {{consisted of a}} main stage with three elevators and a turntable (which rose and lowered), a central runway with LED and strobe lights connected to a central stage with a LED <b>view</b> <b>screen</b> in the construction and an elevator. The two secondary runways were raised up into the stands and also had <b>view</b> <b>screens</b> inside the construction. Two projection screens were raised above the audience so those who couldn't get a <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> of the stage could still see the performance. There were also 3 LED screens that moved around during the performance, including one semicircular transparent screen lowered onto the stage during the video interludes.|$|R

50|$|Twin-lens reflex cameras used a pair {{of nearly}} {{identical}} lenses, one to form the image and one as a viewfinder. The lenses were arranged with the viewing lens immediately above the taking lens. The viewing lens projects an image onto a <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> which {{can be seen from}} above. Some manufacturers such as Mamiya also provided a reflex head to attach to the <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> to allow the camera to be held to the eye when in use. The advantage of a TLR was that it could be easily focussed using the <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> and that under most circumstances the view seen in the <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> was identical to that recorded on film. At close distances however, parallax errors were encountered and some cameras also included an indicator to show what part of the composition would be excluded.|$|R

30|$|Although Dinehart (2015) was an {{advocate}} {{against the use}} of technology in early learning, citing that it diminished children’s fine motor skills, she did not consider apps designed for early childhood education that fostered fine motor skills through writing letters and numbers. Other concerns {{against the use of}} technology in early learning focused on {{the amount of time spent}} <b>viewing</b> <b>screens.</b> Vanderloo (2014) reported that children between 4 and 7  years of age spent an average 1.5 to 7.0  h <b>viewing</b> <b>screens</b> each day. Unfortunately, there was no differentiation between <b>viewing</b> <b>screens</b> for different activities such as watching a movie, watching a lesson on the interactive whiteboard, or playing games on an iPad (Vanderloo 2014). The sedentary nature of <b>viewing</b> <b>screens</b> was the catalyst for Vanderloo’s work, which is undoubtedly a concern; however, moderation of <b>screen</b> <b>viewing</b> may better guide the use of technology in early learning rather than banning it all together. This position is more aligned with the National Association for Education of Young Children (2012) who differentiated between <b>screen</b> <b>viewing</b> for interactive activities (e.g., mathematical apps) and non-interactive activities (e.g., movies) to promote active learning using technology.|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] To {{compare the}} costs and effects of routine {{mammography}} screening by a single mediolateral-oblique view and two views (mediolateral-oblique plus craniocaudal) of each breast. DESIGN [...] A cost effectiveness analysis of a prospective non-randomised trial comparing one and two <b>view</b> mammography <b>screening</b> was carried out at St Margaret's Hospital, Epping. All women in the study had two view mammography. The mediolateral-oblique view was always the first image read by the radiologist. After reading the films for a clinic session, the same radiologist then went back and read both the mediolateral-oblique and craniocaudal views together. Each set of films was read by two radiologists. The main outcome measures were recall rates, number of cancers detected, screening and assessment costs, and cost effectiveness ratios. SUBJECTS [...] A total of 26, 430 women who attended for breast screening using both one and two view mammography participated. A sample of 132 women attending for assessment provided data on the private costs incurred in attending for assessment. RESULTS [...] There was {{a reduction in the}} recall rate from 9. 1 % (2404 of 26, 430) after one <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> to 6. 7 % (1760 of 26, 430) after two <b>view</b> <b>screening.</b> The results also suggest that for every 10, 000 women screened an additional five cancers would be detected earlier with two <b>view</b> <b>screening.</b> The additional health service screening cost associated with two <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> was estimated to be 3. 63 pounds: the costs associated with one and two <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> policies were estimated to be 41. 49 pounds and 32. 99 pounds respectively. Private costs incurred were estimated to be 0. 35 pounds per woman screened and 32. 75 pounds per woman assessed. Two cost effectiveness ratios were calculated: an incremental health service cost per additional cancer detected of 4129 pounds and an incremental health service plus private cost per additional cancer detected of 2742 pounds. The sensitivity analysis suggested that the results were sensitive to relatively large changes in a number of parameters. These included screening costs, assessment costs, equipment life, and recall rates. CONCLUSIONS [...] Use of two <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> increased early cancer detection and also costs. The reduction in the recall rate with two views was not sufficiently large to make the cost of two <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> neutral. While these results are not completely generalisable, a framework is provided to allow other centres to estimate the cost effectiveness of two <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> in their locality...|$|R
