By theoretical calculation,we got 6 groups of upper and lower height of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>roller.</b> Use ANSYS to simulate the working state of the corrugated rolle and establish finite element model to analyze force on the <b>corrugated</b> <b>roller</b> load, geometric constraints, thereby gaining the simulation status under 6 groups of height in {{the upper and lower}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>roller.</b> Compensate the results of theoretical calculation of the simulation conditions of convex curve and improve the contact performance of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>roller...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{pressure}} of the roller stimulates not only the forma¬tion of roots and improves access to water, but stimulates also the tiller of the grain increasing its stability and thus {{reducing the risk of}} falling over. Practical recommendation •	Rolling requires dry soil in order to prevent the soil from sticking to the roller and ripping out the plants (especially when using smooth <b>rollers).</b> •	The <b>corrugated</b> <b>roller</b> must not damage the plants too much. Take special care when using sharp-edged rollers. •	Every mechanical interference puts the plants under stress. For this reason, it is advised to go at a maximum rolling speed of 5 km/h. Notes •	Even in densely sown or strongly fertilized spelt crops, the rolling is recommended. It weakens the main shoot and increases growth on side shoots, which improves the stability of the plants at the expense of longitudinal growth. Spelt is often rolled later (up until the 1 -node stage) and more aggressively than winter wheat...|$|R

Introduction: Since this thesis will deal largely with the relative food value of different brands of flour made from the same wheat, a short discussion {{of the process of}} manufacturing flour will be in order before taking up in detail the results obtained by chemical analysis. Nearly all of the flour in the United States is now manufactured by {{what is known as the}} “gradual reduction process. ” In this process the wheat berry passes through several distinct stages of reduction before it is completely reduced to flour. The reduction is accomplished by means of rollers and each stage of the reduction is technically termed a “break”. Before the reduction process begins the wheat must be thoroughly cleansed from all foreign matter such as weed seeds, dirt, pieces of iron, etc. This is accomplished by means of various machines. Metallic bodies are removed by passing the wheat in a stream over large magnets. Adhering dirt is removed by means of scouring and brush machines, while foreign seeds may be removed by means of screens. In some cases the wheat is also passed through a set of “ending stones” which remove the fug from the end of the berry. After the wheat has thus been cleaned it is passed through <b>corrugated</b> <b>rollers</b> set so as to just split the berry along the crease...|$|R
50|$|Hudson was a {{major player}} in setting the {{standards}} for coal haulage. In the 1930s the introduction of practical locomotive haulage in coal mines demanded better wagons than the traditional plain bearing designs. Hudson introduced new designs with pressed steel <b>corrugated</b> bodies with <b>roller</b> bearing wheels. This style of vehicle was ultimately adopted by the National Coal Board as its standard coal haulage vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|A {{middlings}} purifier is {{a device}} {{used in the}} production of flour to remove the husks from the kernels of wheat. It was developed in Minnesota by Edmund LaCroix, a French inventor hired by Cadwallader C. Washburn and George Christian of the Washburn [...] "A" [...] Mill. It was developed to complement the emerging roller mill technique of the late 19th century, which used <b>corrugated</b> metal <b>rollers</b> instead of abrasive grindstones to grind wheat into flour. The middlings purifier was used in this process to separate the bran from the usable part of the flour. The machine developed by LaCroix passed the partially ground middlings over a screen, and a stream of air blew away the particles of bran.|$|R
5000|$|In woodworking, {{the ideal}} feed rate {{is one that}} is slow enough not to bog down the motor, yet fast enough to avoid burning the material. Certain woods, such as black cherry and maple are more prone to burning than others. The right feed rate is usually {{obtained}} by [...] "feel" [...] if the material is hand fed, or by trial and error if a power feeder is used. In thicknessers (planers), the wood is usually fed automatically through rubber or <b>corrugated</b> steel <b>rollers.</b> Some of these machines allow varying the feed rate, usually by changing pulleys. A slower feed rate usually results in a finer surface as more cuts are made for any length of wood.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Two food-grade sorghum hybrids, ATx 63 I *Tx 436 (non waxy), and B. BON 34, (waxy), were micronized and evaluated for their potential use in ready to eat breakfast cereals (RTE-BC). Whole and decorticated grains were exposed to infra-red burners and flaked between <b>corrugated</b> <b>rollers.</b> Whole B. BON 34 flakes had the lowest density, best flavor, good texture, and the greatest starch gelatinization. Decorticated B. BON 34 flakes were extremely thin and fragile. Based on flake characteristics, whole B. BON 34 and decorticated ATx 631 *Tx 436 flakes were selected for granola preparation. Whole ATx 631 *Tx 436 flakes (27. 4 % amylose) were used for the preparation of a flaked cereal with reduced rate of starch hydrolysis. Granolas were prepared by mixing, baking, and cooling sorghum flakes, wheat bran, sesame and sunflower seeds, raisins, sorghum molasses, oil, fructose and water. A control granola was prepared with rolled oats instead of sorg-hum flakes. All 9 granolas were crispy, sweet, and had a nutty flavor. Decorticated ATx 631 *Tx 436 granola had the hardest texture, and remained crispy in milk for the longest time. Whole B. BON 34 granola was preferred (p< 0. 05, N= 36) by a sensory panel over the decorticated ATx 631 *Tx 436 one. A flaked cereal was prepared by mixing, extruding, flaking, and baking ground, whole ATx 631 *Tx 436 flakes with high amylose starch, mono and diglycerides. sugar, salt, and water. Flaked cereal with the highest amylose content had the slowest rate of hydrolysis and the least starch gelatinization. Acceptable RTE-BC can be produced from food- grade sorghums with different endospen-n types using different technologies. Waxy sorg(hum produced the best flakes for granola preparation. Non-waxy sorghum produced the best flaked cereal with relatively slow rate of hydrolysis...|$|R
40|$|The Kelvin Helmholtz roll up {{of three}} dimensional, {{temporally}} evolving, plane mixing layers were simulated numerically. All simulations were begun {{from a few}} low wavenumber disturbances, usually derived from linear stability theory, {{in addition to the}} mean velocity profile. The spanwise disturbance wavelength was taken to be {{less than or equal to}} the streamwise wavelength associated with the Kelvin Helmholtz roll up. A standard set of clean structures develop in most of the simulations. The spanwise vorticity rolls up into a <b>corrugated</b> spanwise <b>roller,</b> with vortex stretching creating strong spanwise vorticity in a cup shaped region at the vends of the roller. Predominantly streamwise rib vortices develop in the braid region between the rollers. For sufficiently strong initial three dimensional disturbances, these ribs collapse into compact axisymmetric vortices. The rib vortex lines connect to neighboring ribs and are kinked in the opposite direction of the roller vortex lines. Because of this, these two sets of vortex lines remain distinct. For certain initial conditions, persistent ribs do not develop. In such cases the development of significant three dimensionality is delayed. When the initial three dimensional disturbance energy is about equal to, or less than, the two dimensional fundamental disturbance energy, the evolution of the three dimensional disturbance is nearly linear (with respect to the mean and the two dimensional disturbances), at least until the first Kelvin Helmholtz roll up is completed...|$|R
