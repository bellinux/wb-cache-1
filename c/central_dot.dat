25|$|For the {{introduction}} of the first British colour broadcasting service in 1967 there was no new ident, but a new logo: a 2 with a dot inside the figure. There was originally a test period where the original presentation was used with possible electronic colour added. However, it was rejected and a new ident used. This ident was formed from the 3 light spots that come together to make the <b>central</b> <b>dot.</b> From there, a 2 is drawn around the dot. Once complete, the colour legend appears below before the 2 starts rotating slowly. The blue 2 rotates to reveal a red 2, green 2 and a white 2. The ident would continually spin after this. In 1969, when BBC1 launched its own colour service, the ident was updated to match BBC1's presentation. The 2 was now all white on a blue background, with the BBC2 logo underneath the 2. The clock that went alongside this look was originally a traditional clock face with Roman numerals before it was changed to a light blue clockface on a dark blue background with BBC2 legend below. This clock also had the 'polo' mint centre and was filmed on BBC2's NODD, black and white camera filming the clock with colour added later on.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{visual cue}} to self-motion (egomotion) is optic flow, which is specified {{in terms of}} local 2 D velocities in the retinal image without reference to depth cues. However, in general, points {{near the center of}} expansion of natural flow fields are distant, whereas those in the periphery are closer, creating gradients of horizontal binocular disparity. To assess whether the brain combines disparity gradients with optic flow when encoding egomotion, stereoscopic gradients were applied to expanding dot patterns presented to observers during functional MRI scanning. The gradients were radially symmetrical, disparity changing as a function of eccentricity. The depth cues were either consistent with egomotion (peripheral dots perceived as near and <b>central</b> <b>dots</b> perceived as far) or inconsistent (the reverse gradient, <b>central</b> <b>dots</b> near, peripheral dots far). The BOLD activity generated by these stimuli was compared in a range of predefined visual regions in 13 participants with good stereoacuity. Visual area V 6, in the parieto-occipital sulcus, showed a unique pattern of results, responding well to all optic flow patterns but much more strongly when they were paired with consistent rather than inconsistent or zero-disparity gradients. Of the other areas examined, a region of the precuneus and parietoinsular vestibular cortex also differentiate between consistent and inconsistent gradients, but with weak or suppressive responses. V 3 A, V 7, MT, and ventral intraparietal area responded more strongly {{in the presence of a}} depth gradient but were indifferent to its depth-flow congruence. The results suggest that depth and flow cues are integrated in V 6 to improve estimation of egomotion...|$|R

40|$|A quadruple quantum-dot (QQD) cell is {{proposed}} as a spin filter. The transport {{properties of the}} QQD cell were studied in linear response regime {{on the basis of}} the equations of motion for retarded Green's functions. The developed approach allowed us to take into account the influence of both intra- and interdot Coulomb interactions on carriers' spin polarization. It was shown that the presence of the insulating bands in the conductance due to the Coulomb correlations results in the emergence of spin-polarized windows (SPWs) in magnetic field leading to the high spin polarization. We demonstrated the SPWs can be effectively manipulated by gate fields and considering the hopping between <b>central</b> <b>dots</b> in both isotropic and anisotropic regimes.

The spin $ 1 / 2 $ in the <b>central</b> quantum <b>dot</b> is Kondo screened first and at lower temperatures the antiferromagnetic coupling to the side coupled quantum dots leads to an underscreened $S=N/ 2 $ Kondo effect.

5000|$|Modern imaging {{techniques}} allow the diagnosis {{to be made}} more easily and without invasive imaging of the biliary tree. [...] Commonly, the disease {{is limited to the}} left lobe of the liver. Images taken by CT scan, X-ray, or MRI show enlarged intrahepatic (in the liver) bile ducts due to ectasia. Using an ultrasound, tubular dilation of the bile ducts can be seen. On a CT scan, Caroli disease can be observed by noting the many fluid-filled, tubular structures extending to the liver. A high-contrast CT must be used to distinguish the difference between stones and widened ducts. Bowel gas and digestive habits make it difficult to obtain a clear sonogram, so a CT scan is a good substitution. When the intrahepatic bile duct wall has protrusions, it is clearly seen as <b>central</b> <b>dots</b> or a linear streak. Caroli disease is commonly diagnosed after this “central dot sign” is detected on a CT scan or ultrasound. However, cholangiography is the best, and final, approach to show the enlarged bile ducts as a result of Caroli disease.|$|R
