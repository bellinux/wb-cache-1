5|$|All Supreme Court justices {{were white}} and of European {{heritage}} until the appointment of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Justice, in 1967. Since then, only two other non-white Justices have been appointed, Marshall's African-American successor, <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> in 1991, and Sonia Sotomayor in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{said that}} he would appoint federal judges in the mold of U.S. Supreme Court justices John Roberts, <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas,</b> Antonin Scalia, and Samuel Alito. He {{advocated}} judicial restraint and strict constructionism as judicial philosophies.|$|E
5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the Brown {{decision}} are still debated. Notably, Supreme Court Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas,</b> himself an African American, wrote in Missouri v. Jenkins (1995) that at the very least, Brown I has been misunderstood by the courts.|$|E

5|$|Tillman was {{the primary}} sponsor of the Tillman Act, the first federal {{campaign}} finance reform law, which was passed in 1907 and which banned corporate contributions in federal political campaigns. Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> has suggested that Tillman's motivation in introducing this legislation was to reduce the power of corporations which tended to favor Republicans and African Americans.|$|E
5|$|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion, which held that §8772 does not infringe on {{the separation of}} powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government, considering also that the law is an exercise of congressional authority regarding foreign affairs. Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas,</b> Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion (however, Justice Thomas did not join as to Part II-C of the opinion).|$|E

5|$|The Hobbs Act, the Travel Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) {{have been}} upheld under the Commerce Clause. The mail fraud statute has been {{justified}} under the Postal Clause. In Sabri v. United States (2004), the Supreme Court upheld {{the constitutionality of}} the program bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 666, under the Spending Clause (with Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> citing the Commerce Clause in concurrence). Prior to Sabri, several circuit courts had already so held.|$|E
5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas.</b> When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment charges by Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.|$|E
5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume the Vice Presidency in 2009. He was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991, but advocated U.S. and NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in 1994 and 1995. He voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led the legislative efforts for creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Violence Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas.</b>|$|E

5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that {{this was one of}} the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas,</b> who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E
5|$|Like Sherman Minton, <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> {{was not a}} Catholic at {{the time}} he was {{appointed}} to the Court. Thomas was raised Catholic and briefly attended Conception Seminary College, a Roman Catholic seminary, but had joined the Protestant denomination of his wife after their marriage. At some point in the late 1990s, Thomas returned to Catholicism. In 2005, John Roberts became the third Catholic Chief Justice and the fourth Catholic on the Court. Shortly thereafter, Samuel Alito became the fifth on the Court, and the eleventh in the history of the Court. Alito's appointment gave the Court a Catholic majority for the first time in its history. Besides Thomas, at least one other Justice, James F. Byrnes, was raised as a Roman Catholic, but converted to a different branch of Christianity prior to serving on the Court.|$|E
5|$|On February 20, 2010, Noriega's lawyers filed a {{petition}} with the Supreme Court of the United States to block his extradition to France, after the court refused {{to hear his}} appeal the previous month. Noriega's attorneys had hoped the dissenting opinion in that ruling, written by Justices <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> and Antonin Scalia, would convince the full court to take up his case, but on March 22, 2010, the Supreme Court refused to hear the petition. Two days after the refusal, the District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami lifted the stay that was blocking Noriega's extradition. Later that month Noriega's attorney stated that he would travel to France and try to arrange {{a deal with the}} French government.|$|E

5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that the department's belief was all that mattered, since the Court's precedent in this area holds it is unconstitutional for a government agency to discipline an employee (who does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) for engaging in partisan political activity, as long as that activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Samuel Alito, in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.|$|E
