40|$|International audienceSupply {{chains and}} more {{particularly}} supply chains networks {{are more and}} more subjected to extreme dynamic operations, where it is asked to each actor more flexibility and reactivity {{on the one hand and}} a specialization bringing more productivity on the other hand. Companies try to achieve the common goal of satisfying customers’ needs through partnership. Negotiation between partners is thus required involving each partner management and production organization. This situation makes difficult to obtain the best response with respect to the need of each customer. For that, a new approach is proposed for customer-supplier relationship control, in which the partnership is considered in the context of an association of potential suppliers within a network: an isoarchic control model for supply chains network based on a holonic architecture. The decision-making mechanism is produced thanks to the properties of a decision-making centre, <b>called</b> Autonomous <b>Control</b> <b>Entity</b> (ACE), associated to each actor of the logistic network, which makes it possible to quantify a multi-criteria evaluation. An implementation of the simulation of such a system is done via a distributed simulation environment HLA (High Level Architecture). A case study is presented...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} type of jointly <b>controlled</b> <b>entity</b> influences the management choice to report interests {{in this kind of}} joint venture using the equity method or proportionate consolidation. We address this gap in the accounting choice literature by exploiting the UK setting where, due to the transition to IFRS, firms had to change their reporting method for interests in jointly <b>controlled</b> <b>entities</b> from the gross equity method to a similar approach (equity method) or to proportionate consolidation. We support our analysis on the classification of jointly <b>controlled</b> <b>entities</b> proposed by Hennart (1988). We hypothesize that venturers are more likely to change their reporting method to proportionate consolidation when the majority of their jointly <b>controlled</b> <b>entities</b> are cases of Link instead of Scale cooperation. After controlling for several variables, our results are consistent with the predictions and thus suggest that {{the type of}} jointly <b>controlled</b> <b>entity</b> {{plays an important role in}} the management decision to report interests in jointly <b>controlled</b> <b>entities</b> using the equity method or proportionate consolidation. However, the results also provide empirical evidence supporting the importance of debt covenant costs and monitoring costs in the choice between alternative reporting methods. 1...|$|R

The existence of the control directly determines a consolidation unit and also form of the consolidated financial statements. The concept of control states a <b>controlling</b> <b>entity,</b> that is required to prepare consolidated financial statements. The evolution {{of the concept of}} control shows to differences in capture of some entities in consolidated financial statements due to the classification as a <b>controlled</b> <b>entity.</b> Non-inclusion of <b>controlled</b> <b>entities</b> in the consolidated unit have a direct impact on the explanatory role of the consolidated financial statements.

30|$|In this section, we {{investigate}} the signalling load at the <b>control</b> <b>entities</b> {{of a traditional}} LTE/EPC architecture, a reference architecture [14, 15], and our full OEPC architecture. These <b>control</b> <b>entities</b> are the MME, the Openflow controller, and a mobile controller, respectively. The signalling loads at these <b>control</b> <b>entities</b> caused by five aforementioned procedures are considered as the evaluation metric. For convenience, we called the proposed architecture described in [14, 15] as a partial OEPC architecture because this architecture was also designed by using Openflow technology but it only separated the control and data plane of the SGWs while keeping the PGW {{the same as that}} in the traditional LTE/EPC architecture. In contrast, our fully OEPC decoupled completely the control and data plane of SGW as well as PGW and put all the control functions of those gateways into the MC.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Firewalls are {{a crucial}} {{building}} block for secur-ing interconnections between networks of different security domains. Newer IP based {{applications such as}} IP telephony require that packet filters are configured dynamically by session-aware entities. Several architectures and protocols were proposed for firewall remote control (e. g., IETF MIDCOM and NSIS). However, on the nodes that could host the <b>control</b> <b>entity</b> no common local interface for managing packet filter rules exists. This forces developers of firewall <b>control</b> <b>entities</b> to use firewall specific interfaces and limits portability across operating systems and firewall implementations. This paper describes the design of an operating system independent interface, which allows the firewall <b>control</b> <b>entity</b> to modify firewall rules from user space. We implemented this interface for Netfilter chains of the Linux operating system kernel taking functional and security requirements into account. Based on measurements, we analyze the performance characteristics and conclude that the approach is feasible for small to medium network setups. I...|$|R

30|$|To {{solve the}} {{challenge}} of consistency, two different models can be adopted to implement the SDRAN architecture: “evolutionary” and “clean slate.” The evolutionary model allows for gradually deployment based in existing networks: legacy <b>control</b> plane <b>entities</b> from operators can connect to the core network without modifying the existing interfaces.

40|$|Internet based <b>call</b> <b>control</b> Web {{services}} enable {{telecommunications network}} operators to offerWeb developers a simplified method of controlling telecommunication resources. Web Services that expose telecommunication networks to third parties are highly abstracted. This abstraction allows Web developers to create applications that provide <b>call</b> <b>control</b> functionality without detailed {{knowledge of the}} underlying network. Functionality offered by network operators is usually of a simple nature, and does not provide developers with advanced <b>call</b> <b>control</b> functionality, similar to that found in operator services. Advanced <b>call</b> <b>control</b> requires the Web application to have detailed knowledge {{of the state of}} the telecommunication resources. In this research an Extended <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> <b>call</b> model and Extended <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> Web service are developed and demonstrated to provide Web applications with this knowledge. To develop the Extended <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> <b>call</b> model existing telecommunication call models were analysed for components suitable for Web <b>control.</b> The Extended <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> Web service was developed using advanced <b>call</b> <b>control</b> use cases. The proof of concept successfully demonstrates the use of the Extended <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> Web service and the value of the Extended <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> <b>call</b> model in proving asynchronous Web based advanced <b>call</b> <b>control</b> of telecommunications resources. This research has developed a novel call model for Web based <b>call</b> <b>control</b> of telecommunications networks. The Extended <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> <b>call</b> model and API fulfils a fundamental requirement for Web based advanced <b>call</b> <b>control,</b> namely knowledge {{of the state of the}} underlying network and asynchronous control of those resources. This research facilitates the development of advancedWeb applications <b>controlling</b> telecommunications <b>calls</b> within the network which previously was limited by the knowledge of the network state.
