40|$|The {{practical}} three-dimensional {{measurement system}} with a high resolution based on a space <b>code</b> <b>light</b> pattern projection and a phase-shifted light pattern projection is presented. Three-dimensional measurement device’s so-called, rangefinder, {{are expected to be}} applied in the apparel, medical and various fields. The performance of a rangefinder is evaluated by the measurements of time, depth, size, etc. The system using a space code technique can stably acquire the depth of an object although the resolution of the depth is not good because an object’s space is coded {{in the shape of a}} wedge. On the other hand, in a phase shift technique, the high resolution depth of an object is able to be theoretically acquired because the object’s space is divided finely by phase shifted light projection. But it is difficult to stably acquire the depth of an object because of the phase connection problem. In this paper, these problems (which are high resolution and phase connection problem) are able to be solved by both the space code technique and the phase shift technique.

40|$|Summary. Intracellular {{recording}} and staining techniques revealed new {{aspects of the}} anatomy and physiology of ocellar L-neurons in the honey-bee (Apis mellifera). Structural comparisons of homologous identi-fied L-neurons showed that their axon pathways and projection areas in the brain were similar, whereas omata location and terminal branching patterns differed. L-neuron responses to light ranged from graded reponses with fast on- and off-transients o inhibi-tion of spontaneous discharge. Since the same mor-phological type of L-neuron responded ifferently in different animals, response types could not be correlated systematically with morphology. How-ever, purely graded responses were not found in extrinsic LD-neurons, and lateral ocellar L-neurons never exhibited an inhibition of the tonic spike dis-charge without a graded component. L-neuron graded responses could be elicited only by light stimulation of the ocelli, but not by moving striped patterns, polarised white light, light stimuli to the compound eyes, airpuffs, or odor stimuli. Various parameters of the graded response <b>code</b> <b>light</b> intensity differently. Response/intensity functions rise over an intensity range of 5 log units to saturate at higher intensities.

40|$|Background: The olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN) {{is a small}} {{midbrain}} structure {{responsible for}} pupil constriction in response to eye illumination. Previous electrophysiological {{studies have shown that}} OPN neurons <b>code</b> <b>light</b> intensity levels and therefore are called luminance detectors. Recently, we described an additional population of OPN neurons, characterized by a slow rhythmic pattern of action potentials in light-on conditions. Rhythmic patterns generated by these cells last for a period of approximately 2 minutes. Methodology: To answer whether oscillatory OPN cells are light responsive and whether oscillatory activity depends on retinal afferents, we performed in vivo electrophysiology experiments on urethane anaesthetized Wistar rats. Extracellular recordings were combined with changes in light conditions (light-dark-light transitions), brief light stimulations of the contralateral eye (diverse illuminances) or intraocular injections of tetrodotoxin (TTX). Conclusions: We found that oscillatory neurons were able to fire rhythmically in darkness and were responsive to eye illumination in a manner resembling that of luminance detectors. Their firing rate increased together with the strength of the light stimulation. In addition, during the train of light pulses, we observed two profiles of responses: oscillationpreserving and oscillation-disrupting, which occurred during low- and high-illuminance stimuli presentation respectively.

40|$|By necessity, many {{language}} documentation projects {{focus on}} the language of older speakers, and information from younger speakers is often about processes of attrition. But in some contexts younger speakers may be the agents of language creation, as new codes are developed. The processes employed in language creation may offer surprising insights into mechanisms of language change and linguistic processing. In this paper I will use {{a case study of}} a complex language endangerment situation in a Warlpiri community in northern Australia to show how documentation of the speech of several generations contributes to linguistic understandings in previously unexpected ways. The Warlpiri community in focus is multilingual, with several languages and varieties spoken regularly – Warlpiri (a Pama-Nyungan language, with approximately 4, 000 speakers), varieties of English and Kriol (an English-lexified creole), and for speakers under approximately age 35, Light Warlpiri. Light Warlpiri is a newly emerged mixed language, which combines elements of Warlpiri and varieties of Aboriginal English and/or Kriol. It appears to have been formed through a two-part process. First, adults directed codeswitched speech to young children as part of a baby talk register. Next, the children analyzed the codeswitched speech as a single system, and added innovations. The structure of the code developed by the children closely resembles the structure of the codeswitched speech which was directed to them. The speakers of Light Warlpiri also speak Warlpiri, but Light Warlpiri is their primary <b>code.</b> <b>Light</b> Warlpiri represents partial language maintenance in the face of great pressure to shift to English, as well as being an index of the local community identity and of young people within that community. Light Warlpiri might also be endangered, because the pressure to shift to English is very strong. When maintenance of Warlpiri is in focus, Light Warlpiri {{can be seen as a}} bridge to learning Warlpiri, as Light Warlpiri retains mostly Warlpiri nominal morphology, and considerable Warlpiri lexicon. When contemporary language use is in focus, Light Warlpiri is one of the varieties of Warlpiri spoken by young people in a complex sociolinguistic environment. The overall structure of Light Warlpiri is a combination of nominal morphology from Warlpiri with some verbal morphology from English and/or Kriol. But within the verbal auxiliary system English and/or Kriol modal forms are reanalyzed, resulting in new forms and a new structure. The temporal elements have structure from English and Warlpiri but create a formal temporal distinction which differs from both Warlpiri and English and/or Kriol – future and nonfuture. This rapid grammaticalization during the transition from code-switching to Light Warlpiri shows processes which are also seen in pidgins and creoles, raising questions about the discreteness of these types of language. Documentation of the speech of several generations in the community was needed to uncover the creativity of Light Warlpiri speakers in this complex language endangerment situation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Positioning a robot {{with respect}} to objects by using data {{provided}} by a camera is a well known technique called visual servoing. In order to perform a task, the object must exhibit visual features which can be extracted from different points of view. Then, visual servoing is object-dependent as {{it depends on the}} object appearance. Therefore, performing the positioning task is not possible in presence of non-textured objets or objets for which extracting visual features is too complex or too costly. This paper proposes a solution to tackle this limitation inherent to the current visual servoing techniques. Our proposal is based on the <b>coded</b> structured <b>light</b> approach as a reliable and fast way to solve the correspondence problem. In this case, a <b>coded</b> <b>light</b> pattern is projected providing robust visual features independently of the object appearance. I...|$|R
