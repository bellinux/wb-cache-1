50|$|While the Bush {{administration}} opted against Kyoto-type {{policies to}} reduce emissions, the Obama administration and various state, local, and regional governments {{have attempted to}} adopt some Kyoto Protocol goals on a local basis.

5|$|The United States Clean Air Act, {{passed in}} 1990, put mercury {{on a list}} of toxic {{pollutants}} that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent.

In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> <b>trade</b> system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998. However newer data published in 2015 showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply, indicating that the Clean Air Act had its intended impact.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change has}} emerged as a leading {{environmental}} concern in recent years. The two widely discussed and debated options for abatement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a cap-and-trade system, at the level of producers, and an emissions tax. More interesting is the question of <b>capping</b> (<b>and</b> <b>trading)</b> at the level of individual households. Regardless of policy pursued, a key concern in implementing such policies relates to equity: stakeholders wish to understand the distributional or effects, whereby poorer households may be disproportionally impacted. In this paper, household expenditure data from the U. S. Consumer Expenditure Survey are used to anticipate the economic impacts of energy taxes versus household-level emissions caps (with buy-out permitted, for those who exceed their budget) across different income classes and different types of expenditures, including those on transport. A translog utility model was calibrated to estimate demand quantities under two different tax rates and four different cap-andtrade scenarios. While the 9 -category demand system does not allow for likely consumption shifts (toward less energy-intensive items) within each demand category, the model still provide...|$|R
40|$|California {{has again}} proved {{itself to be}} a pioneer in climate and energy policy. On 1 January it {{launched}} the first serious state cap-and-trade system in the USA designed to reduce greenhouse gases. A similar scheme already exists {{at the other end}} of the country – under their Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI or Reggie as the acronym is pronounced) nine New England states have been <b>capping</b> <b>and</b> <b>trading</b> CO 2 emissions from their power plants since 2008. But the RGGI cap only covers electricity generation, and is so loose – in its first phase of 2009 – 2014 it is only aimed at stabilising the level of emissions – that permits trade for less than $ 2 a tonne of carbon. By contrast, the California scheme’s cap will eventually cover almost the entire economy of the state; it tightens in its first year with a 2 percent reduction; and its minimum auction price is $ 10 a tonne. The cap-and-trade system is one of several measures in California’s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 which is aimed at returning the volume of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions to that of 1990 by 2020, a cut of around 15 percent from 2012 levels...|$|R
40|$|Clean {{development}} mechanism (CDM) is encountering many uncertainties due to {{the coming}} end of the commitment period and critically suggested reformation. As the largest participant in the CDM market, China shoulders the biggest proportion of market risk. Among the studies on CDM in China, few have focused upon the legal aspect of CDM, which is crucial in defending developers’ interests. To fill this research gap in {{making the transition from}} policy to law, this paper claims that carbon emission right, which is the basis of trade, should be attributed as a property right in Property Law of People’s Republic of China. The present study will discuss the characteristics of carbon emission, definition, and legal attribution of carbon emission right. The valid object of carbon emission right in the CDM market under Property Law should be certified emissions reductions (CERs). The usufructuary right could be specifically applied in practice to the owners’ property right on CERs in China. Although experience from the CDM is not fully applicable to the development of <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> <b>trading,</b> the success of CDM market provides a reasonable platform to study emission right in the view of legal science. Furthermore, the proposed research acts as the pioneer study that lay the theoretical foundations in legal science on emission right trading for other potential schemes, which in turn addresses international environmental issues. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5000|$|An {{emission}} <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> permit <b>trading</b> {{system is}} a quantity instrument because it fixes the overall emission level (quantity) and allows the price to vary. Uncertainty in future supply and demand conditions (market volatility) coupled with a fixed number of pollution permits creates an uncertainty in the future price of pollution permits, and the industry must accordingly bear the cost of adapting to these volatile market conditions. The burden of a volatile market thus lies with the industry rather than the controlling agency, which is generally more efficient. However, under volatile market conditions, {{the ability of the}} controlling agency to alter the caps will translate into an ability to pick [...] "winners and losers" [...] and thus presents an opportunity for corruption.|$|R

50|$|A third option, {{known as}} a safety valve, is a hybrid of the price and {{quantity}} instruments. The system is essentially an emission <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> permit <b>trading</b> system but the maximum (or minimum) permit price is capped. Emitters have the choice of either obtaining permits in the marketplace or buying them from the government at a specified trigger price (which could be adjusted over time). The system is sometimes recommended {{as a way of}} overcoming the fundamental disadvantages of both systems by giving governments the flexibility to adjust the system as new information comes to light. It can be shown that by setting the trigger price high enough, or the number of permits low enough, the safety valve can be used to mimic either a pure quantity or pure price mechanism.|$|R
