40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} profitability of milk production over several years in a herd of about 100 cows, taking into account changes in the housig system from the tethering to free stall in the “Przyszłość” Farming Cooperative. The study considered costs and income obtained from milk production and assessed profitability of this direction of agricultural activity. The profit being an equivalent of net income was adopted as the final financial result. Among milk productivity indexes the following were calculated: cost of direct production of 1 l milk, total production cost of 1 l milk, profit generated by 1 l milk, profit per 1 cow and per 1 milking cow, the ratio of sale price to production cost of 1 l milk and production profitability index. The above mentioned parameters of milk production efficiency were calculated for the analysed years and for the period of tethering and free stall housing. Level of profitability of milk production in the “Przyszłość” Farming Cooperative was varied, which was conditioned by decreasing production costs and the price of its sales each year. The most advantageous values of milk production profitability index were recorded in 2001 and 2005. With free <b>stall</b> housing <b>system</b> of cows milk production increased increasing the cost of its production at the same time. The main factors causing a reduction of milk production profitability in the free <b>stall</b> <b>system</b> in comparison to the tethering system were connected with significantly higher expenditure on fodder (mainly ready-purchased). The transition from the tethering management system to the free <b>stall</b> <b>system</b> resulted in relatively high values of milk production efficiency indexes at simultaneous reduction of labour consumption and considerable improvement of animal welfare...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the numerical analysis}} of a <b>stall</b> suppression <b>system</b> for helicopter rotors. The analysis employs a finite element method and includes advanced dynamic stall and vortex wake models. The <b>stall</b> suppression <b>system</b> {{is based on a}} transfer function matrix approach and uses blade root actuation to suppress stall directly. The rotor model used in this investigation is the UH- 60 A rotor. At a severe stalled condition, the analysis predicts three distinct stall events spreading over the retreating side of the rotor disk. Open loop results show that 2 P input can reduce stall only moderately, while the other input harmonics are less effective. The responses of the stall index, a measure of stall, to individual input harmonics are highly nonlinear. Such nonlinear stall behavior makes the closed-loop controller ineffective in suppressing stall and the combined effects of individual harmonics nonadditive. Also, stall reduction does not guarantee gains in rotor performance. 1...|$|R

50|$|The <b>stall</b> warning <b>system</b> {{utilizes}} a <b>stall</b> warning vane on {{each side}} of the nose. The vanes provide regulated voltage input to the angle-of-attack transducers, modified by a stall warning bias box to compensate for flap position. The angle-of-attack transducer supplies a proportional voltage to the angle-of-attack of the aircraft. When the aircraft speed is 7% above stall, the stall warning energizes a control column shaker that produces a low-frequency buffet signal through the control column to warn the crew. When both angle-of-attack transducer vanes increase to 5% above stall, the pitch servo commands an aircraft nose down attitude. The force applied in the nose down direction is 80 pounds at the control wheel. When the angle-of-attack transducer vanes decrease below the stall point, the nose down command is removed. An angle-of-attack indicator translates signals from the <b>stall</b> warning <b>system</b> into visual indications of the aircraft angle-of-attack and allows the crew to monitor the proximity of stall caution zone. The indicator face is divided into green (safe), yellow (caution) and red (danger) segments.|$|R
