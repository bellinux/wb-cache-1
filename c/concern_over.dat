40|$|With {{the rise}} of the far-right parties in the European {{parliamentary}} elections, <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> immigration and national identity have again come into the limelight. In this paper, we document the empirical relationships between immigration, native <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> the economic and cultural impact of immigration, and {{the rise of}} rightwing political parties in Europe. Empirical analysis first establishes the critical and distinct roles played by economic and cultural <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> immigration in determining citizen 2 ̆ 019 s rightward ideology and voting for right-wing parties. Second, we investigate the determinants of economic and cultural <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> immigration, finding strong and consistent evidence for the salience hypothesis, which suggests that immigrant share of a country 2 ̆ 019 s population shapes citizen <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> immigration. Thereafter, we document the roles of macro-level economic and cultural channels in determining the strength of salience effects. Finally, we investigate how the characteristics of the immigrant population affect native <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> immigration...|$|R

5|$|A Dutch {{proposal}} {{to build new}} battleships was originally tendered in 1912, after years of <b>concern</b> <b>over</b> {{the expansion of the}} Imperial Japanese Navy and the withdrawal of allied British warships from the China Station.

NEI), so a Royal Commission was formed in June 1912.|$|E

5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises <b>concern</b> <b>over</b> the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.|$|E
