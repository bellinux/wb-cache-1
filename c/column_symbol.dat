40|$|A $k$-plex of a {{latin square}} is a {{collection}} of cells representing each row, <b>column,</b> and <b>symbol</b> precisely $k$ times. The classic case of $k= 1 $ is more commonly known as a transversal. We introduce the concept of a $k$-weight, an integral weight function on the cells of a latin square whose row, <b>column,</b> and <b>symbol</b> sums are all $k$. We then show that several non-existence results about $k$-plexes can been seen as more general facts about $k$-weights and that the weight-analogues of several well-known existence conjectures for plexes actually hold for $k$-weights...|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} {{a connection between}} orthogonal arrays and pure states of finite-dimensional quantum systems having nonnegative integer entries. This identification allows us to develop a technique to represent the full set of orthogonal arrays with a given number of <b>columns,</b> <b>symbols</b> and strength {{in terms of a}} finite set of generators. The corresponding states turn out {{to play an important role}} in quantum theory: they exhibit a high degree of multipartite entanglement and include the full set of maximum distance separable codes. We provide a simple construction of the generators and show explicit solutions for orthogonal arrays with two symbols composed of two, three and four <b>columns</b> and two <b>symbols,</b> which correspond to pure quantum states of two, three and four qubits, respectively.

40|$|AbstractLatin squares can be {{classified}} as odd or even according to {{the signs of the}} permutations given by their rows and columns. In this paper, the behaviour of the parities of a latin square under the action of the isotopy group (permuting rows, <b>columns,</b> and <b>symbols)</b> and the transformation group (interchanging rows, <b>columns,</b> and <b>symbols)</b> is analyzed. A rule is given that shows that the behaviour of parities under the action of the transformation group is completely determined, and only depends on the order n. Also, we give a short proof of the equivalence of the conjectures of Alon-Tarsi and Huang-White and present the results of a computer calculation that show that the number of even and odd latin squares of order 8 are not equal, thus proving the Alon-Tarsi conjecture for this particular order...|$|R

40|$|A finite {{latin square}} is an n × n matrix whose entries are {{elements}} of the set { 1, [...] .,n} and no element is repeated in any row or column. Given equivalence relations {{on the set of}} rows, the set of columns, and the set of symbols, respectively, we can use these relations to identify equivalent rows, <b>columns</b> and <b>symbols,</b> and obtain an amalgamated latin square. There is a set of natural equations that have to be satisfied by an amalgamated latin square. Using these equations we can define the notion of anoutline latinsquare and it follows easily that anamalgamated latinsquare is anoutline latin square. Hilton(Math. Programming Stud. 13 (1980) 68) proved that the opposite implicationholds as well, that is, every outline latinsquare is anamalgamated latinsquare.

The control extent as well as columns with capitals and various examples of eccentricity at punching shear were analyzed. Punching reinforcements and theirs inappropriate use were described. A comparative analysis of contemporary devices for punching shear prevention was given. The inner forces used for examination of punching shear, were calculated with equivalent frame analysis.

40|$|We {{define a}} cover of a Latin square to be a set of entries that {{includes}} at least one representative of each row, <b>column</b> and <b>symbol.</b> A cover is minimal {{if it does not}} contain any smaller cover. A partial transversal is a set of entries that includes at most one representative of each row, <b>column</b> and <b>symbol.</b> A partial transversal is maximal if it is not contained in any larger partial transversal. We explore the relationship between covers and partial transversals. We prove the following: (1) The minimum size of a cover in a Latin square of order n is n+a if and only if the maximum size of a partial transversal is either n- 2 a or n- 2 a+ 1. (2) A minimal cover in a Latin square of order n has size at most μ_n= 3 (n+ 1 / 2 -√(n+ 1 / 4)). (3) There are infinitely many orders n for which there exists a Latin square having a minimal cover of every size from n to μ_n. (4) Every Latin square of order n has a minimal cover of a size which is asymptotically equal to μ_n. (5) If 1 5 then there is a Latin square of order n with a maximal partial transversal of size n-k. (6) For any ϵ> 0, asymptotically almost all Latin squares have no maximal partial transversal of size less than n-n^ 2 / 3 +ϵ...|$|R

40|$|Two latin squares are {{orthogonal}} if, {{when they}} are superimposed, every ordered pair of symbols appears exactly once. This definition extends naturally to `incomplete' latin squares each having a hole on the same rows, <b>columns,</b> and <b>symbols.</b> If an incomplete latin square of order n has a hole of order m, then it is an easy observation that n > 2 m. More generally, if a set of t incomplete mutually orthogonal latin squares of order n have a common hole of order m, then n > (t+ 1) m.

40|$|A proper {{coloring}} of a Latin {{square of}} order n is an assignment of colors to its elements triples such that each row, <b>column</b> and <b>symbol</b> is assigned n distinct colors. Equivalently, a proper coloring of a Latin square is a partition into partial transversals. The chromatic index of a Latin square {{is the least}} number of colors needed for a proper coloring. We study the chromatic index of the cyclic Latin square which arises from the addition table for the integers modulo n. We obtain the best possible bounds except for the case when n= 2 is odd and divisible by 3.

40|$|A {{latin square}} of order n is an n× n array of n symbols {{in which each}} symbol occurs exactly once in each row and column.
