5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running <b>community</b> <b>education</b> campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and define competencies for community college <b>community</b> services/continuing <b>education</b> directors;A review of literature on community college <b>community</b> services/continuing <b>education,</b> <b>community</b> services leadership, community college presidential competencies, and business management/leadership was conducted. The review of literature yielded little literature on <b>community</b> services/continuing <b>education</b> research and writings. Literature on community college presidential competencies and business management/leadership was more prevalent which provided competencies appropriate for <b>community</b> service/continuing <b>education</b> directors. A doctoral dissertation conducted in 1989 provided a set of 43 identified competencies for community college presidents. The competencies served as the foundation for this study;Data were gathered for the competency identification through the use of a three round Delphi process. This process was conducted by a team of nominated experts representing ten geographic regions of the United States;The major conclusions of this study were: A list of 50 competencies with definitions was identified for community college <b>community</b> services/continuing <b>education</b> directors; 18 reached consensus; 25 reached stability; five reached neither consensus nor stability; and two were identified too late to receive full consideration. These competencies were those that were initially identified from the dissertation; identified in rounds one, two, or three; or suggested by the expert panel;Conclusions of this study were: (1) literature in <b>community</b> services/continuing <b>education</b> is not readily available; (2) a set of 43 competencies has been developed for <b>community</b> services/continuing <b>education</b> directors; (3) staff development activities can be designed to reinforce and improve competencies of directors; (4) competencies can be used in developing position descriptions for directors; and (5) graduate programs for community college professionals may offer courses that may enhance or strengthen competencies for community college <b>community</b> services/continuing <b>education</b> directors...|$|R
