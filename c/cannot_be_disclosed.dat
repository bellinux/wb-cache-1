Members of the Academy and former laureates are also authorised to nominate candidates." [...] All proposals and their supporting evidence must be received before February 1. The proposals are reviewed by the Prize Committee and specially appointed experts. Before the end of September, the committee chooses potential laureates. If there is a tie, {{the chairman of the}} committee casts the deciding vote. Next, the potential laureates must be approved by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Members of the Ninth Class (the social sciences division) of the Academy vote in mid-October to determine the next laureate or laureates of the Prize in Economics.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} DStress, {{a system that}} can {{efficiently}} perform computations on graphs that contain confidential data. DStress assumes that the graph is physically distributed across many participants, and that each participant only knows a small subgraph; it protects privacy by enforcing tight, provable limits on how much each participant can learn {{about the rest of}} the graph. We also study one concrete instance of this problem: measuring systemic risk in financial networks. Systemic risk is the likelihood of cascading bankruptcies – as, e. g., during the financial crisis of 2008 – and it can be quantified based on the dependencies between financial institutions; however, the necessary data is highly sensitive and <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> safely <b>disclosed.</b> We show that DStress can implement two different systemic risk models from the theoretical economics literature. Our experimental evaluation suggests that DStress can run the corresponding computations in about five hours, whereas a na¨ıve approach could take several decades...|$|R
