Voltaire left Paris' as the monarchy decided the construction of two monumental projects : the Place Louis XV and the Ecole Militaire. In the following years, despite the lack of an urban plan, young architects produced a series of modern public buildings : the <b>Corn</b> Market, the <b>Mint,</b> Saint Philippe du Rouie, the Surgery School, the Vauxhiall. In 1778, on balance, we see that urbanism was subjected to speculation and the greed of shareholders. But finally, with the comte d'Angiviller, an era of reforming projects seems to be beginning, and in 1778 the new plan for the construction of the Odeon was accepted. Rabreau Daniel, Mosser Monique.

40|$|Peppermint and {{spearmint}} {{are high}} value essential oil crops in Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Although the mints are profitable alternatives to <b>corn</b> and soybeans, <b>mint</b> production efficiency must improve {{in order to}} allow industry survival against foreign produced oils and synthetic flavorings. Weed control is the major input cost in mint production and tools to increase efficiency are necessary. Remote sensing-based site-specific weed management offers potential for decreasing weed control costs through simplified weed detection and control from accurate site specific weed and herbicide application maps. This research showed the practicability of remote sensing for weed detection in the mints. Research was designed to compare spectral response curves of field grown mint and weeds, and to use these data to develop spectral vegetation indices for automated weed detection. Viability of remote sensing in mint production was established using unsupervised classification, supervised classification, handheld spectroradiometer readings and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs). Unsupervised classification of multispectral images of peppermint production fields generated crop health maps with 92 and 67 % accuracy in meadow and row peppermint, respectively. Supervised classification of multispectral images identified weed infestations with 97 % and 85 % accuracy for meadow and row peppermint, respectively. Supervised classification showed that peppermint was spectrally distinct from weeds, but the accuracy of these measures was dependent on extensive ground referencing which is impractical and too costly for on-farm use. Handheld spectroradiometer measurements of peppermint, spearmint, and several weeds and crop and weed mixtures were taken over three years from greenhouse grown plants, replicated field plots, and production peppermint and spearmint fields. Results showed that mints have greater near infrared (NIR) and lower green reflectance and a steeper red edge slope than all weed species. These distinguishing characteristics were combined to develop narrow band and broadband spectral vegetation indices (SVIs, ratios of NIR/green reflectance), that were effective in differentiating mint from key weed species. Hyperspectral images of production peppermint and spearmint fields were then classified using SVI-based classification. Narrowband and broadband SVIs classified early season peppermint and spearmint with 64 to 100 % accuracy compared to 79 to 100 % accuracy for supervised classification of multispectral images of the same fields. Broadband SVIs have potential for use as an automated spectral indicator for weeds in the mints since they require minimal ground referencing and can be calculated from multispectral imagery which is cheaper and more readily available than hyperspectral imagery. This research will allow growers to implement remote sensing based site specific weed management in mint resulting in reduced grower input costs and reduced herbicide entry into the environment and will have applications in other specialty and meadow crops. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.) oil {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and widely used {{essential}} oils, mostly because of its main components menthol and menthone. Peppermint oil is used for flavouring pharmaceuticals and oral preparations. <b>Corn</b> <b>mint</b> is the richest source of natural menthol. Carvone-scented mint plants, such as spearmint (M. spicata), are rich in carvone and are widely used as spices, and they are cultivated in several countries. Studies were made into the yield and essential oil content of several mint species and the original. The general aim of the work was to examine the optimal conditions for cultivating mint in Northern Finland. The specific aims of the study were (first) to investigate the differences in the oil content for several mint species and (secondly) to compare the effect of various factors such as plant spacing (10, 20 and 30 × 50 cm), liming (0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 tons ha- 1), propagation methods (micropropagated and conventionally propagated plants) and harvest date (once at the end of August in comparison with first cut at the beginning of August and second cut in mid September) on the cultivation success, quality and quantity of the plants. The constituents of the essential oil were analysed from leaf samples using GC-MS. Among the peppermints of different origins studied, peppermint of USA and Egypt origin ('Black Mitcham') contain the highest menthol and optimum oil yield. <b>Corn</b> <b>mint</b> and Sachalin mints both had high menthol content. Due to several reasons, such as no significant differences between the different densities and oil composition, markedly higher amount of weeds at 30 × 50 cm than at 10 × 50 and 20 × 50 cm spacing and the high seedling costs and the danger of fungi and disease at a 10 × 50 cm spacing, a plant optimum of 20 × 50 cm spacing is recommended for Northern Ostrobothnia. If the pH value is lower than 6, or levels of Mg and Ca are low, liming at a rate of 4 – 8 t ha- 1 for sandy soils in Finland is recommended in order to achieve higher fresh and oil yields. In the first year, there were no differences in the dry leaf yield of micropropagated and conventionally propagated plants, but the menthol content was significantly higher in conventionally than in micropropagated plants. In the second year, only the dry leaf yield of micropropagated plants was higher than that of their conventionally propagated counterparts. Cutting peppermint only once during full bloom (the end of August) gives the maximum oil yield of good quality. In conclusion, it is possible to achieve as high as or even higher oil quality and dry yield in North Ostrobothnia than it is in central Europe or south Asia. However, this requires observing certain cultivation factors such as having the right type of mint, soil pH, planting density, harvesting time and propagation method In addition, mints must be cultivated in the same place for only two and a maximum for three years...|$|E
40|$|Paenibacillus larvae {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{bacterial}} pathogens of honey bee broods and the causative agent of American foulbrood disease. The factors responsible for the pathogenesis of American foulbrood disease are still not fully understood, and the increasing resistance of P. larvae to commonly used antibiotics necessitates a search for new agents to control this disease. The in vitro antibacterial activities of 28 plant essential oils against P. larvae ATCC 9545 were evaluated. Out of the 28 plant essential oils tested, 20 were found to be effective in killing P. larvae. Based on their minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values, the effective oils were grouped into three categories: highly effective, moderately effective and minimally effective. Jamaica pepper oil, mountain pepper oil, ajwain oil, <b>corn</b> <b>mint</b> oil, spearmint oil, star anise oil, nutmeg oil and camphor oil were highly effective, with MBC values between 162. 0 and 375. 0 µg/mL. Jamaica pepper oil was the most effective essential oil, with an MBC value of 162. 0 µg/mL. The results of the time-response effect assays showed that no viable P. larvae cells were observed after 24  h of treatment with Jamaica pepper oil (162. 0 µg/mL), 36  h of treatment with mountain pepper oil (186. 0 µg/mL), 48  h of treatment with ajwain oil (224. 8 µg/mL) or 48  h of treatment with oxytetracycline (5. 89 µg/mL). The tested essential oils exhibited significant antimicrobial activities against P. larvae, and they may contain compounds that could play an important role in the treatment or prevention of American foulbrood disease...|$|E
