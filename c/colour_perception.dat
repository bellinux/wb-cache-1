Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{stage of}} the insect is the winged adult or imago. The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, {{each of which is}} an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but not for clearly viewing distant objects. <b>Colour</b> <b>perception</b> is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are designed for sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{recurrent}} {{themes of}} these painstakingly detailed new theories {{was the idea}} that humans may not perceive colours in isolation but rather, that one colour may be seen to interfere with another colour neighbouring it.

An online experiment revealed that f 0 influenced brightness and colour associations with the voice for all groups and showed some idiosyncratic patterns for synaesthetes and others for phoneticians. Synaesthetes, for example, were less influenced by f 0 in their colour associations than others and phoneticians used scales for high-low and tense-relaxed according to the perceived f 0 and VQ more systematically than others. A steeper spectral tilt triggered smoother, softer and more relaxed associations with the voice.

2500|$|Early {{studies of}} alcoholics who {{underwent}} LSD treatment reported a 50% success rate after a single high-dose session. However, {{the studies that}} reported high success rates had insufficient controls, lacked objective measures of genuine change, and failed to conduct rigorous follow-up interviews with subjects. The lack of conclusive evidence notwithstanding, individual case reports are often dramatic. Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous conducted medically supervised experiments in the 1950s {{on the effects of}} LSD on alcoholism. Bill is quoted as saying [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and where we are going—well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be of some value to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced." [...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos. In 1957 Wilson wrote a letter to Heard saying: [...] "I am certain that the LSD experiment has helped me very much.

While we point {{on the benefits of}} the method with help of some special worksheets we analyse the process of solution, step by step, looking at the working of the colouring lanes, as the essence of the method. It stems from Berlyne’s motivation theory relating to the active inference theory, especially predictive coding and free energy principle. Through this method as a map, children can map their way between each and every level of the hierarchical brain system and cortical microcircuits. The colouring process includes two ways in parallel with each other in a top-down system; by creative, independent problem solving. According to the motivation theory the goal of this process is the optimal arousal level, which depend on the stimuli of the environment; in this case, children colour the task with the aid of the colouring lanes.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine previous experiences with injury and personality factors as predictors of rugby players' perceived susceptibility to injury. In line with an individual-based approach, it was hypothesized that neuroticism and global self-esteem would be related to perceived susceptibility to sport injuries over and above previous experiences with injuries. Rugby players (N = 235) were asked to report about previous experiences with injury and were administered measures of neuroticism and global selfesteem. Multiple regression analysis revealed that previous experiences with injury were positively related to perceived susceptibility to sport-related injuries. Analyses also supported that neuroticism and global self-esteem are of crucial importance in <b>colouring</b> <b>perceptions</b> of susceptibility to sport-related injury, while statistically controlling for previous injuries. Of particular interest, neuroticism predicted perceived susceptibility, over and above global self-esteem and previous experiences with injury.

40|$|ABSTRACT. One of {{the main}} targets of Barry Strouds {{criticism}} {{in his recent book}} ‘The Quest for Reality. Subjectivism and the Metaphysics of Colour are eliminativist theories of colour which he regards as a version of the metaphysical project of the unmasking of colours (Stroud, 2000). According to this view, no physical objects have any of the colours we see them or believe them to have. However, although this error theory describes all our <b>colour</b> <b>perceptions</b> as illusory, and all our colour beliefs as false, it cannot deny that we actually perceive colours and that we do believe that physical objects are coloured. Therefore, it has to account for these psychological facts without relying on any assumptions about the colours of things. Thus, the central question for the unmasking project is whether it is possible to acknowledge someones perceiving a certain colour or having beliefs about the colours of things without holding that anything anywhere has any colour at all. Contrary to Stroud, this paper defends the view that we can acknowledge that people believe in colours without having ourselves to accept their existence. 1...|$|R

40|$|Researchers must assess {{similarities}} and differences in colour from an animal's eye view when investigating hypotheses in ecology, evolution and behaviour. Nervous systems generate <b>colour</b> <b>perceptions</b> by comparing the responses of different spectral classes of photoreceptor through colour opponent mechanisms, {{and the performance of}} these mechanisms is limited by photoreceptor noise. Accordingly, the receptor noise limited (RNL) colour distance model of Vorobyev and Osorio (Vorobyev & Osorio 1998 Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 265, 351 ? 358 (doi: 10. 1098 /rspb. 1998. 0302)) generates predictions about the discriminability of colours that agree with behavioural data, and consequently it has found wide application in studies of animal colour vision. Vorobyev and Osorio (1998) provide equations to calculate RNL colour distances for animals with di-, tri- and tetrachromatic vision, which is adequate for many species. However, researchers may sometimes wish to compute RNL colour distances for potentially more complex colour visual systems. Thus, we derive a simple, single formula for the computation of RNL distance between two measurements of colour, equivalent to the published di-, tri- and tetrachromatic equations of Vorobyev and Osorio (1998), and valid for colour visual systems with any number of types of noisy photoreceptors. This formula will allow the easy application of this important colour visual model across the fields of ecology, evolution and behaviour. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
