40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} <b>compacted</b> <b>and</b> reconstituted soils in terms of microstructure, and hydraulic and mechanical response. It is commonly assumed that reconstituted <b>and</b> <b>compacted</b> soils exhibit a fundamentally different behaviour due to different microstructures. However, the variety of pore size distributions observed in both <b>compacted</b> <b>and</b> reconstituted/natural soils suggests that the boundary between <b>compacted</b> <b>and</b> reconstituted states is more blurred. In the paper, an attempt is made to recognize similarities <b>and</b> differences between <b>compacted</b> <b>and</b> reconstitutes states based on a number of recent experimental studies where the microstructure and the hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils in <b>compacted</b> <b>and</b> reconstituted states have been investigated. This exercise will also offer the opportunity to gain a better insight into the microstructure of compacted soils...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{investigated}} changes in dielectric properties, electrical conductivity and complex impedance of Fe 2 TiO 5 nanopowder <b>compacts</b> <b>and</b> bulk samples {{as a function}} of elevated temperature (room to 423 K compacts, to 443 K bulk samples), frequency (100 Hz– 1 MHz) and composition (starting molar ratio of Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 1 : 1 —PSB 11 and 1 : 1. 5 —PSB 115). XRD, SEM and TEM analysis of PSB 11 and PSB 115 powders obtained by a simple solid state process from starting hematite and anatase nanopowders confirmed the formation of nanostructured orthorhombic pseudobrookite with small amounts of excess hematite and rutile. The dielectric constant decreased with frequency and temperature for both <b>compacts</b> <b>and</b> bulk samples. Higher values were determined for bulk samples also reflecting the influence of sample composition. Change in the dielectric loss also reflected the influence of sample composition showing one maximum at high frequencies for <b>compacts,</b> <b>and</b> two maxima at room temperature for bulk samples. Complex impedance was analyzed using equivalent circuits and showed in the case of compacts the influence of both grain and grain boundary components, while in the case of bulk samples the dominant influence of grain boundaries. The temperature dependence of the determined grain and grain boundary resistance for <b>compacts</b> <b>and</b> grain boundary resistance for bulk samples was analyzed using the adiabatic small polaron hopping model enabling determination of activation energies for conduction, while the temperature dependence of relaxation times enabled determination of activation energies for relaxation. Changes in electrical conductivity for <b>compacts</b> <b>and</b> bulk samples followed Jonscher’s power law. The change of the determined frequency constant with temperature showed that at elevated temperatures the quantum mechanical-tunneling model for the case of small polaron hopping explains the conduction mechanism occurring in both <b>compacts</b> <b>and</b> bulk samples...|$|R

5|$|Blore's {{new plan}} for the corps de logis of house was {{constrained}} by Vorontsov's wish to use the footings and foundations which had been built for Harrison's original design; this severely restricted the shape, size and layout of the palaces principal rooms. However, rather than erect a <b>compact</b> <b>and</b> low classical villa, as Harrison had designed, Blore's plan was radically different, with strong English Tudor Renaissance features on the northern side, and an eclectic medley of western and Islamic features on the southern. The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi's Jummah Masjid mosque, which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison's design to be incorporated, once given an Islamic makeover, harmoniously into the design.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944, the M3 {{had fallen}} out of favor even with {{airborne}} troops, despite their strong preference for <b>compact</b> <b>and</b> lightweight weapon systems. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57mm M1 in the summer of 1943 claiming its unfitness for airlifting and the Table of Organisation and Equipment (TO) of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37mm guns. Nevertheless, the 82nd and the 101st, were reequipped with British-manufactured 6-pounder gun (57mm) on carriage Mk III (designed to fit into the British Horsa glider) for the Normandy airdrops. This change was officially introduced in the TO of December 1944.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{fragmentary nature}} of known Paraceratherium fossils, the animal has been reconstructed in several {{different}} ways since its discovery. In 1923, W. D. Matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of the skeleton based on the even less complete P. transouralicum specimens known by then, using the proportions of a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too squat and <b>compact,</b> <b>and</b> Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard to the underlying skeleton. Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the P. transouralicum skeleton from the Aral Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae.|$|E
