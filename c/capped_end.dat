Extending the density functional model to allow for a two dimensional order-parameter profile, we then study the adsorption as the chemical potential is reduced to capillary evaporation but now in a capillary-slit that is capped at one end. The equilibrium density profiles obtained show that, sufficiently close to the phase boundary, a meniscus separating liquid-like and vapour-like phases forms near the <b>capped</b> <b>end,</b> and that as capillary evaporation is approached, continuously unbinds from the <b>capped</b> <b>end.</b> Our numerical results indicate that the divergence of the adsorption due to the unbinding of the meniscus is logarithmic and is the same as for the complete wetting transition in systems with short-ranged forces...|$|E

If the bottom wall has a weaker wall-fluid attraction than the side walls, then θ^ cap> 0 even though all the isolated walls are themselves completely wet.

Solvation free energies of oligoglycine models of varying lengths in pure water and in the osmolyte solutions, 2 M urea and 2 M trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), were calculated from simulations of all atom models, and ΔGtr values for peptide backbone transfer from water to the osmolyte solutions were determined. The results show that the transfer free energies change linearly with increasing chain length, demonstrating the principle of additivity, and provide values in reasonable agreement with experiment. The peptide backbone transfer free energy contributions arise from van der Waals interactions in the case of transfer to urea, but from electrostatics on transfer to TMAO solution. The simulations used here allow for the calculation of the solvation and transfer free energy of longer oligoglycine models to be evaluated than is currently possible through experiment.

The initial application {{was triggered by}} challenges with mechanical and pressure integrity after expansion of casing connections. Creating a strong bond between the pin and the box could resolve this. Brazing was selected because of the combination of ductility and high bond strength and the relatively fast process to create the bond. The brazing process or temperature-torque-time process (TTT) is performed using regular casing connections, a filler material deposited by flame spray and a flux. Two processes were developed, one for expandable (VM 50) grade material and one for quenched and tempered grade material.

The assembly is formed by two concentric capsule-like carbon nanotubes, the smaller of which located {{in the interior of}} the larger one, which has a partially open end. The carbon nanotubes have radii such that the distance between their cylindrical walls, though keeping attrition negligible, does not permit the passage of chemical species {{from one side of the}} inner capsule to the other. CH(4) molecules in liquid phase are confined between the <b>capped</b> <b>end.</b> of the outer nanotube and the inner capsule. On the other side, CF(4) molecules can access the volume available between the inner capsule and the outer nanotube through its open end. When temperature is raised, the confined CH(4) molecules undergo the liquid-gas transition. The consequent volume expansion pushes the inner capsule in the direction of the open end of the outer nanotube, which determines the rapid ejection of the CF(4) molecules. This generates a thrust that allows the motion of the whole assembly in the direction opposite to ejection. When temperature is decreased and CH(4) molecules return in the liquid phase, the system slowly recovers the initial configuration. The whole cycle of operation is fully reversible and allows the assembly to directionally move into the liquid phase...|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} in the {{replication}} of influenza virion RNAs is the synthesis of full-length transcripts of these RNAs. The synthesis of these transcripts, or template RNAs, requires: unprimed initiation rather than the capped RNA-primed initiation used during viral mRNA synthesis, and antitermination at the polyadenylylation site used during mRNA synthesis. To determine the mechanism of template RNA synthesis, we prepared nuclear extracts from infected cells that were active in the synthesis of both template RNAs and viral mRNAs. By providing the dinucleotide ApG as primer, we circumvented the inefficient unprimed initiation catalyzed by these extracts and, as a consequence, were able to focus on the antitermination step. Antitermination, and hence template RNA synthesis, occurred when ApG but not a capped RNA was used as primer, indicating that the presence of a 5 ' <b>capped</b> <b>end</b> blocked antitermination at the 3 ' end of the transcript. Ultracentrifugation of the nuclear extract yielded a pellet fraction that contained viral nucleocapsids active in viral mRNA synthesis but not template RNA synthesis and a supernatant fraction that contained the antitermination factor. When the supernatant, which had essentially no activity by itself, was added to the pellet in the presence of ApG, template RNA synthesis was restored. Depletion experiments in which this supernatant was incubated with protein A-Sepharose containing antibodies to individual viral proteins demonstrated that the viral nucleocapsid protein was required for antitermination.
