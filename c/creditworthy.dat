25|$|Stiglitz {{complains}} bitterly {{that the}} IMF has done great damage through the economic policies it has prescribed that countries must follow {{in order to}} qualify for IMF loans, or for loans from banks and other private-sector lenders that look to the IMF to indicate whether a borrower is <b>creditworthy.</b> The organization and its officials, he argues, have ignored the implications of incomplete information, inadequate markets, and unworkable institutions all of which are especially characteristic of newly developing countries. As a result, Stiglitz argues, the IMF has often called for policies that conform to textbook economics but do not make sense for the countries to which the IMF is recommending them. Stiglitz seeks to show that these policies have been disastrous for the countries that have followed them.|$|E

2500|$|Fitch and S use (from {{the most}} <b>creditworthy</b> to the least) AAA, AA, A, and BBB for investment-grade {{long-term}} credit risk and BB, CCC, CC, C, and D for [...] "speculative" [...] long-term credit risk. Moody's long-term designators are Aaa, Aa, A, and Baa for investment grade and Ba, B, Caa, Ca, and C for speculative grade. Fitch and S use pluses and minuses (e.g., AA+ and AA-), and Moody's uses numbers (e.g., Aa1 and Aa3) to add further gradations.|$|E
2500|$|After Derry v Peek it {{was thought}} that negligent {{misrepresentation}} was not actionable in tort. However, in Nocton v Lord Ashburton a claim was allowed where parties were in a fiduciary relationship and in Candler v Crane, Christmas and Co Denning LJ delivered a blistering dissent against the bar to recovery for negligent words. His dissent was approved in the leading case, Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd, where Heller & Partners Ltd (a bank) warranted to Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd (an advertising company) that its prospective client, Easipower Ltd, was <b>creditworthy.</b> When Easipower Ltd could not in fact pay for the advertising services, Hedley Byrne sued the bank for misrepresentation. This is a tort action, so the question did not actually involve a claim for misrepresentation inducing a contract. But the principle was the same. Could one sue for losses after being told negligent, rather than fraudulent, statements? The House of Lords answered [...] "yes" [...] if there was a special relationship between the parties showing that one had [...] "assumed responsibility" [...] to the other. In the instant case this would have worked, except that Heller & Partners had said in their warrant that they disclaimed any responsibility for their statement's accuracy. They had an exclusion clause (see below, and Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 3). So in absence of the exclusion clause, Heller & Partners would have been liable for negligent misstatement.|$|E
50|$|Most bond {{indices are}} {{weighted}} by market capitalization. This {{results in the}} bums problem, in which less <b>creditworthy</b> issuers {{with a lot of}} outstanding debt constitute a larger part of the index than more <b>creditworthy</b> ones.|$|E

50|$|The {{terms on}} which a {{government}} can sell bonds depend on how <b>creditworthy</b> the market considers it to be. International credit rating agencies will provide ratings for the bonds, but market participants will {{make up their own}} minds about this.|$|E
50|$|Deceit {{dates in}} its modern {{development}} from Pasley v. Freeman. Here the defendant {{said that a}} third party was <b>creditworthy</b> to the claimant, knowing he was broke. The claimant loaned the third party money and lost it. He sued the defendant successfully.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>creditworthy</b> {{borrower}} {{adds the}} third party as an authorized user of his lines of credit, {{but does not}} actually provide the third party with materials (credit cards, account numbers, etc.) that would permit the third party to make charges against that account.|$|E
50|$|A student loan, for example, {{could be}} granted to an {{unemployed}} consumer, {{who might not}} have a credit record (so that the credit provider does not know his payment history). The consumer might not be <b>creditworthy,</b> {{and there is no}} security. The nature of these agreements excludes them from being reckless lending.|$|E
50|$|VA Loans - All {{mortgages}} executed after March 1, 1988 {{require that}} the buyer be <b>creditworthy</b> to assume a seller’s mortgage. If a VA Loan is being assumed by a veteran with a home loan eligibility, the seller may also request to have their eligibility be re-instated {{upon completion of the}} assumption.|$|E
50|$|Under certain {{conditions}} and fund limitations, the Veterans Administration (VA) makes direct loans to <b>creditworthy</b> veterans in housing credit shortage areas {{designated by the}} VA's administrator.

50|$|Due to the {{financial}} crisis of 2007-2009, the App-o-Rama has become more difficult as issuers have tightened credit and restricted approvals to only the most <b>creditworthy</b> customers.

Inactive lines are being eliminated, zero percent balance transfer offers are shortened, and credit limits have been reduced.|$|E
5000|$|MRU Holdings {{introduced}} its [...] "Preprime" [...] loans in May 2006. MRU Holdings advertised that its Preprime loan could qualify {{a student who}} lacked credit history or a <b>creditworthy</b> co-borrower, for a loan based on student-oriented criteria. MRU Holdings advertised upfront interest rate cuts on federal student loans when they launched their portfolio of federal loan products in June 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Sanders {{proposed}} {{these reforms}} of the Fed: [...] "Banking industry executives must no longer be allowed {{to serve on the}} Fed’s boards...The Fed should charge (banks) a fee that would be used to provide direct loans to small businesses...As a condition of receiving financial assistance from the Fed, large banks must commit to increasing lending to <b>creditworthy</b> small businesses and consumers." ...|$|E
50|$|The 2000s {{were the}} decade of {{subprime}} borrowers; no longer was this a segment left to fringe lenders. The relaxing of credit lending standards by investment banks and commercial banks drove this about-face. Subprime did not become magically less risky; Wall Street just accepted this higher risk. During a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share, and when the supply of <b>creditworthy</b> borrowers was limited, mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less <b>creditworthy</b> borrowers. In the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003. However, as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined GSE power, mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated. The worst loans were originated in 2004-2007, {{the years of the}} most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the GSEs.|$|E
5000|$|Utility {{financing}}. Loan {{financing to}} PDAMs faces numerous challenges. For example, the Ministry of Finance requires its loans to be channeled through regional governments whose legislatures have to pledge future central government transfers as collateral. Since regional legislatures {{are reluctant to}} do so, central government lending to utilities {{is not likely to}} re-emerge even after the issue of old debt would be settled. Two efforts at promoting the issuing of corporate bonds by <b>creditworthy</b> utilities, one supported by partial guarantees by USAID and the other by KfW, have failed [...] "because of the risk-averse culture which is so pervasive in Indonesian central and regional governments", according to a USAID report. Under a 2009 Presidential decree, however, state banks can provide partial credit guarantees of 70% of loans to <b>creditworthy</b> PDAMs plus an interest subsidy. As for direct lending by the Ministry of Finance, regional governments have to provide partial guarantees for these loans, which they are reluctant to provide.|$|E
50|$|The NPL ratio {{decreased}} by 0.48 percentage points to 1.12%, and the NPL coverage ratio increased by 42.43 percentage points to 148.92%, with loans to <b>creditworthy</b> borrowers making {{up most of}} the increase in total loans. Hana Bank's delinquency ratio also decreased, to 0.48%. HFG reached 13.22% in BIS ratio and 9.43% in Tier 1 ratio. Corresponding indices at the Group's subsidiaries hovered above government-set requirements.|$|E
50|$|As {{noted by}} Sachs J in Coetzee, the small debtor without means {{will no longer}} be faced with imprisonment, from which he can only be rescued by family or friends. Further, {{creditors}} {{will no longer be}} able to extend credit on the basis that the debt can be exacted through fear of imprisonment. Credit should be extended only to those who are <b>creditworthy,</b> and to those who provide proper security.|$|E
50|$|Moore {{emphasizes}} {{the mechanics of}} credit creation, particularly lines of credit extended by banks to large corporations on the money supply. He argues that the ability of commercial banks to extend credit is limited only by demand for money by <b>creditworthy</b> borrowers, as central banks are compelled to act to ensure {{there is always a}} sufficient supply of money for demand to be met (at their target interest rate).|$|E
50|$|Lines {{of credit}} are often {{extended}} by banks, {{financial institutions and}} other licensed consumer lenders to <b>creditworthy</b> customers (though certain special-purpose lines of credit may not have creditworthiness requirements) to address liquidity problems; such {{a line of credit}} is often called a personal line of credit. The term is also used to mean the credit limit of a customer, that is, the maximum amount of credit a customer is allowed.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} {{helps to}} prevent credit providers from taking shortcuts by simply accepting seemingly <b>creditworthy</b> debtors at face value. A credit provider may use its own assessment mechanisms, provided these are fair and objective. The consumer, in turn, must fully and truthfully provide the requested information. Failure {{by the consumer}} to do so could provide the credit provider with a complete defence to an allegation of reckless credit granting.|$|E
50|$|As the {{government}} represents the people, government debt {{can be seen}} as an indirect debt of the taxpayers. Government debt can be categorized as internal debt, owed to lenders within the country, and external debt, owed to foreign lenders. Governments usually borrow by issuing securities such as government bonds and bills. Less <b>creditworthy</b> countries sometimes borrow directly from commercial banks or international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{mortgage}} {{assumption of}} most types of mortgages is restricted by including a due-on-sale clause. This type of provision permits the lender to require payment {{of the full}} loan balance if the property is transferred to a new owner without the lender's consent. However, all FHA insured loans and VA loans (dated after March 1, 1988) are assumable {{as long as the}} buyer is <b>creditworthy</b> because they intentionally lack due on sale clauses.|$|E
