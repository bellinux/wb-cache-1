5|$|Chadwick did {{not believe}} that there was any {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E

25|$|The {{business}} {{is no longer}} just a place where people <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> For most of the employees, the firm confers on them that sense of belonging and identity –– the firm has become their “village”, their community.

25|$|The most voluminous legal {{material}} written {{after the}} 8th century {{takes the form}} of notes upon that earlier material. There have been numerous questions about the degree to which such glossators understood the material they worked on.

25|$|The rolling blackouts {{brought on}} by the crises at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima had a {{profound}} effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major railways began running trains at 10–20minute intervals, rather than the usual 3–5minute intervals, operating some lines only at rush hour and completely shutting down others; notably, the Tōkaidō Main Line, Yokosuka Line, Sōbu Main Line and Chūō-Sōbu Line were all stopped for the day. This led to near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many people unable to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or get home. Railway operators gradually increased capacity over the next few days, until running at approximately 80% capacity by 17 March and relieving the worst of the passenger congestion.|$|E
25|$|Michel Callon's {{concept of}} framing {{provides}} a useful schema: each economic act or transaction occurs against, incorporates and also re-performs a geographically and cultural specific complex of social histories, institutional arrangements, rules and connections. These network relations are simultaneously bracketed, so that persons and transactions may be disentangled from thick social bonds. The character of calculability is imposed upon agents as they <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in markets and are “formatted” as calculative agencies. Market exchanges contain a history of struggle and contestation that produced actors predisposed to exchange under certain sets of rules. Therefore, for Challon, market transactions can never be disembedded from social and geographic relations {{and there is no}} sense to talking of degrees of embeddedness and disembeddeness. An emerging theme is the interrelationship, inter-penetrability and variations of concepts of persons, commodities, and modes of exchange under particular market formations. This is most pronounced in recent movement towards post-structuralist theorizing that draws on Michel Foucault and Actor Network Theory and stress relational aspects of person-hood, and dependence and integration into networks and practical systems. Commodity network approaches further both deconstruct and show alternatives to the market models concept of commodities.|$|E

500|$|Gum-diggers {{worked in}} the old kauri fields, {{most of which were}} then covered by swamp or scrub, digging for the gum. Much of the {{population}} was transient, moving from field to field, and they lived in rough huts or tents (which were called [...] "whares", after the Maori for 'house'). It was extremely hard work and not very well paid, but it attracted many Maori and European settlers, including women and children. There were many Dalmatians, who had first <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> the South Island goldfields in the 1860s. They were transient workers, rather than settlers, and much of their income was sent out of the country, resulting in much resentment from the local workforce. In 1898, the [...] "Kauri Gum Industry Act" [...] was passed, which reserved gum-grounds for British subjects, and requiring all other diggers to be licensed. By 1910, only British subjects could hold gum-digging licences.|$|E

Megami Tensei II was Kaneko's first work on the series, having played the first game and <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at Atlus without knowing they were its developers. When creating the demon designs, Kaneko {{was inspired by the}} monsters featured in the Godzilla series, wanting to put his own design twist on creatures both from Japanese folklore and world mythology. For each design, he took their main mythical characteristics and the wide differences between creatures from different cultures, and incorporated them into the game. His demons' attitudes drew inspiration from North American mythology with their wish to feed on the negative emotions of humans. Commenting later, he felt his early designs were [...] "forced", and said that Nintendo were concerned about the mature aspects of his demon designs to the point of asking him to remove the nipples from a naked female figure.|$|E

500|$|After the {{production}} of the song was deemed unsuitable for Lavigne's album, the song was passed to several artists including Samantha Moore before finally being recorded by Kelly Clarkson. Benenate also added that it was Mitchell Leib, the President of Music and Soundtracks for Walt Disney Pictures and Television/Buena Vista Music Group, who secured [...] "Breakaway" [...] as one of the soundtracks of [...] In an interview with MTV, Clarkson said that she recorded [...] "Breakaway" [...] to tide fans over until September that year before she released the first single from her second album. Nevertheless, the song's huge success prompted its inclusion on the album, which Clarkson decided to name Breakaway. Clarkson expressed that [...] "Breakaway" [...] was different from everything she has done, saying that it [...] "is a simple song, and I think that its simplicity is what's beautiful about it. Whenever writers or producers <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice." [...] The song was officially released to radio stations on July 20, 2004 as the first single of [...] Lavigne's original demo of the song leaked onto the internet nearly a decade later in April 2014.|$|E
500|$|From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was {{a member}} of The Credibility Gap, a radio comedy group that {{included}} David Lander, Richard Beebe and Michael McKean. The group consisted of [...] "a bunch of newsmen" [...] at KRLA 1110, [...] "the number two station" [...] in Los Angeles. They wanted {{to do more than just}} straight news, so they hired comedians who were talented vocalists. Shearer heard about it from a friend so he brought over a tape to the station and nervously gave it to the receptionist. By the time he got home, there was a message on his answering machine asking, [...] "Can you <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> tomorrow?" [...] The group's radio show was canceled in 1970 by KRLA and in 1971 by KPPC-FM, so they started performing in various clubs and concert venues. While at KRLA, Shearer also interviewed Creedence Clearwater Revival for the Pop Chronicles music documentary. In 1973, Shearer appeared as Jim Houseafire on How Time Flys, an album by The Firesign Theatre's David Ossman. The Credibility Gap broke up 1976 when Lander and McKean left to perform in the sitcom Laverne & Shirley. Shearer started working with Albert Brooks, producing one of Brooks' albums and co-writing the film Real Life. Shearer also started writing for Martin Mull's television series Fernwood 2 Night. In the mid-1970s, he started working with Rob Reiner on a pilot for ABC. The show, which starred Christopher Guest, Tom Leopold and McKean, was not picked up.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on six {{songs from}} Breakaway. [...] "Breakaway" [...] was {{included}} as the album's opening and title track. She {{described it as}} a simple song, and further explained, [...] "I think that it's simplicity is what's beautiful about it. Whenever writers or producers <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice. I've done country music, I've done pop, I've done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different. But this song was different from everything I've done; people didn't even know it was me!" [...] Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track [...] "Since U Been Gone", as [...] "not as [...] "smooth" [...] as pop or R Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, [...] "It's very emotional. Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live." [...] Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, [...] "I wrote 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' about my last boyfriend. It's the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn't make the deadline." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Because of You", was originally intended for Thankful. Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. [...] "Gone", the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, [...] "Addicted", was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album Fallen (2003). She remarked, [...] "I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. And then I heard that Evanescence record... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.|$|E
