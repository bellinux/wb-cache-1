5|$|<b>Clonazepam,</b> a {{benzodiazepine}} is used {{to treat}} many forms of parasomnia. Rapid eye movement behavior disorder responds well to low doses of <b>clonazepam.</b> Restless legs syndrome can be treated using <b>clonazepam</b> as a third line treatment option {{as the use of}} <b>clonazepam</b> is still investigational.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous <b>clonazepam,</b> lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, <b>clonazepam</b> due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Intermediate-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 12–40 hours. They {{may have some}} residual effects {{in the first half}} of the day if used as a hypnotic. Rebound insomnia, however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer-acting benzodiazepines. Examples are alprazolam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, <b>clonazepam,</b> lormetazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, and temazepam.|$|E
5|$|The coroner {{reported}} that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol {{were found in}} Smith's system {{at the time of}} his death but did find prescribed levels of antidepressant, anxiolytic, and ADHD medications, including <b>Clonazepam,</b> Mirtazapine, Atomoxetine, and Amphetamine. There were no hesitation wounds, which are typical of suicide by self-infliction. However, the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by <b>clonazepam,</b> lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but <b>clonazepam</b> is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, <b>clonazepam,</b> or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> {{is largely}} bound to plasma proteins. <b>Clonazepam</b> {{passes through the}} blood–brain barrier easily, with blood and brain levels {{corresponding}} equally with each other. The metabolites of <b>clonazepam</b> include 7-aminoclonazepam, 7-acetaminoclonazepam and 3-hydroxy <b>clonazepam.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> {{decreases}} {{the levels of}} carbamazepine, and, likewise, clonazepam's level is reduced by carbamazepine. Azole antifungals, such as ketoconazole, may inhibit the metabolism of <b>clonazepam.</b> <b>Clonazepam</b> may affect levels of phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin). In turn, Phenytoin may lower <b>clonazepam</b> plasma levels by increasing the speed of <b>clonazepam</b> clearance by approximately 50% and decreasing its half-life by 31%.|$|E
25|$|Restless legs {{syndrome}} can {{be treated}} using <b>clonazepam</b> as a third-line treatment option {{as the use of}} <b>clonazepam</b> is still investigational. Bruxism also responds to <b>clonazepam</b> in the short-term. Rapid eye movement behavior disorder responds well to low doses of <b>clonazepam.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> passes rapidly {{into the}} central nervous system, with levels in the brain {{corresponding}} with levels of unbound <b>clonazepam</b> in the blood serum. <b>Clonazepam</b> plasma levels are very unreliable amongst patients. Plasma levels of <b>clonazepam</b> can vary as much as tenfold between different patients.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to the {{anticonvulsant}} {{effects of}} <b>clonazepam</b> occurs in both animals and humans. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of <b>clonazepam</b> occurs frequently. Chronic use of benzodiazepines {{can lead to}} the development of tolerance with a decrease of benzodiazepine binding sites. The degree of tolerance is more pronounced with <b>clonazepam</b> than with chlordiazepoxide. In general, short-term therapy is more effective than long-term therapy with <b>clonazepam</b> for the treatment of epilepsy. Many studies have found that tolerance develops to the anticonvulsant properties of <b>clonazepam</b> with chronic use, which limits its long-term effectiveness as an anticonvulsant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> {{has been}} found {{effective}} in treating epilepsy in children, and the inhibition of seizure activity seemed to be achieved at low plasma levels of <b>clonazepam.</b> As a result, <b>clonazepam</b> is sometimes used for certain rare childhood epilepsies; however, it {{has been found}} to be ineffective in the control of infantile spasms. <b>Clonazepam</b> is mainly prescribed for the acute management of epilepsies. <b>Clonazepam</b> {{has been found to be}} effective in the acute control of non-convulsive status epilepticus; however, the benefits tended to be transient in many of the people, and the addition of phenytoin for lasting control was required in these patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>clonazepam</b> {{in the short-term}} treatment of panic disorder has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Some long-term trials have suggested a benefit of <b>clonazepam</b> {{for up to three}} years without the development of tolerance but these trials were not placebo-controlled. <b>Clonazepam</b> is also effective in the management of acute mania.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> is not {{recommended}} for patients with chronic schizophrenia. A 1982 double-blinded, placebo-controlled study found <b>clonazepam</b> increases violent behavior in individuals with chronic schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Abrupt or over-rapid {{withdrawal}} from <b>clonazepam</b> {{may result in}} the development of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, causing psychosis characterised by dysphoric manifestations, irritability, aggressiveness, anxiety, and hallucinations. Sudden withdrawal may also induce the potentially life-threatening condition, status epilepticus. Anti-epileptic drugs, benzodiazepines such as <b>clonazepam</b> in particular, should be reduced in dose slowly and gradually when discontinuing the drug to mitigate withdrawal effects. Carbamazepine has been tested in the treatment of <b>clonazepam</b> withdrawal but was found to be ineffective in preventing <b>clonazepam</b> withdrawal-induced status epilepticus from occurring.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> is not {{recommended}} for use in those under 18. Use in very young children may be especially hazardous. Of anticonvulsant drugs, behavioural disturbances occur most frequently with <b>clonazepam</b> and phenobarbital.|$|E
25|$|The {{safety profile}} of <b>clonazepam</b> during {{pregnancy}} {{is less clear}} than that of other benzodiazepines, and if benzodiazepines are indicated during pregnancy, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam may be a safer choice. The use of <b>clonazepam</b> during pregnancy should only occur if the clinical benefits are believed to outweigh the clinical risks to the fetus. Caution is also required if <b>clonazepam</b> is used during breastfeeding. Possible adverse effects of use of benzodiazepines such as <b>clonazepam</b> during pregnancy include: miscarriage, malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, functional deficits, floppy infant syndrome, carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines include hypertonia, hyperreflexia, restlessness, irritability, abnormal sleep patterns, inconsolable crying, tremors or jerking of the extremities, bradycardia, cyanosis, suckling difficulties, apnea, risk of aspiration of feeds, diarrhea and vomiting, and growth retardation. This syndrome can develop between 3 days to 3 weeks after birth and can have a duration of up to several months. The pathway by which <b>clonazepam</b> is metabolized is usually impaired in newborns. If <b>clonazepam</b> is used during pregnancy or breast feeding, {{it is recommended that}} serum levels of <b>clonazepam</b> are monitored and that signs of central nervous system depression and apnea are also checked for. In many cases, non-pharmacological treatments, such as relaxation therapy, psychotherapy and avoidance of caffeine, can be an effective and safer alternative to the use of benzodiazepines for anxiety in pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> may {{aggravate}} hepatic porphyria.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> {{increases}} {{the levels of}} primidone and phenobarbital.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines do {{not have}} any effect on the levels of GABA in the brain. <b>Clonazepam</b> has no effect on GABA levels and has no effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase. <b>Clonazepam</b> does, however, affect {{glutamate}} decarboxylase activity. It differs from other anticonvulsant drugs it was compared to in a study.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> is lipid-soluble, rapidly {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier, and penetrates the placenta. It is {{extensively}} metabolised into pharmacologically inactive metabolites. <b>Clonazepam</b> is metabolized extensively via nitroreduction by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C19 {{and to a}} lesser extent CYP3A4. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, cimetidine, and grapefruit juice are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and can affect the metabolism of benzodiazepines. It has an elimination half-life of 19–60 hours. Peak blood concentrations of 6.5–13.5ng/mL were usually reached within 1–2 hours following a single 2mg oral dose of micronized <b>clonazepam</b> in healthy adults. In some individuals, however, peak blood concentrations were reached at 4–8 hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{of choice}} in North America for initial treatment is lorazepam due to its relatively long duration of action (2–8 hours) when injected, and its rapid onset of action, which {{is thought to be}} due to its high affinity for GABA receptors and to its low lipid solubility, which causes it to remain in the vascular compartment. If lorazepam is not available, or intravenous access is not possible, then diazepam should be given. In several countries outside North America, intravenous <b>clonazepam</b> is regarded as the drug of first choice. For instance a guideline from the Netherlands recommends <b>clonazepam.</b> Cited advantages of <b>clonazepam</b> include a longer duration of action than diazepam and a lower propensity for the development of acute tolerance than lorazepam. The use of <b>clonazepam</b> for this indication has not caught on in North America, as it is not available as an intravenous formulation there.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} effects of <b>clonazepam</b> can include depression, disinhibition, and sexual dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> is a {{chlorinated}} derivative of nitrazepam {{and therefore a}} chloro-nitro benzodiazepine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> is {{prescribed}} for epilepsy and panic disorder {{with or without}} agoraphobia.|$|E
25|$|Coma can be cyclic, {{with the}} {{individual}} alternating from a comatose state to a hyper-alert state of consciousness, which occurred in a 4-year-old boy who suffered an overdose of <b>clonazepam.</b> The combination of <b>clonazepam</b> and certain barbiturates, e.g. amobarbital, at prescribed doses {{has resulted in a}} synergistic potentiation of the effects of each drug, leading to serious respiratory depression.|$|E
25|$|Many {{forms of}} parasomnia and other sleep {{disorders}} {{are treated with}} <b>clonazepam.</b>|$|E
25|$|Caution {{is to be}} {{used with}} children. Of {{anticonvulsant}} drugs, behavioural disturbances occur most frequently with <b>clonazepam</b> and phenobarbital.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines such as <b>clonazepam</b> {{can be very}} {{effective}} in controlling status epilepticus, but, when used {{for longer periods of}} time, some potentially serious side-effects may develop, such as interference with cognitive functions and behavior. Many individuals treated on a long-term basis develop a dependence. Physiological dependence was demonstrated by flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal. Use of alcohol or other CNS depressants while taking <b>clonazepam</b> greatly intensifies the effects (and side-effects) of the drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> {{has also}} been found {{effective}} in treating other anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, {{but this is an}} off-label use.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam,</b> {{like other}} benzodiazepines, may impair a person's ability to drive or operate machinery. The {{central nervous system}} {{depressing}} effects of the drug can be intensified by alcohol consumption, and therefore alcohol should be avoided while taking this medication. Benzodiazepines {{have been shown to}} cause dependence. Patients dependent on <b>clonazepam</b> should be slowly titrated off under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional to reduce the intensity of withdrawal or rebound symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> is {{available}} as tablets and orally disintegrating tablets (wafers) an oral solution (drops), {{and as a}} solution for injection or intravenous infusion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonazepam</b> was {{approved}} in the United States as a generic drug in 1997 {{and is now}} manufactured and marketed by several companies.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines, {{including}} <b>clonazepam,</b> bind to mouse glial {{cell membranes}} with high affinity. <b>Clonazepam</b> decreases release of acetylcholine in the feline brain and decreases prolactin release in rats. Benzodiazepines inhibit cold-induced {{thyroid stimulating hormone}} (also known as TSH or thyrotropin) release. Benzodiazepines acted via micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites as Ca2+ channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive calcium uptake in experimentation on rat brain cell components. This has been conjectured as a mechanism for high-dose effects on seizures in the study.|$|E
25|$|When {{patients}} are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus {{and treatment of}} metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most people respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes {{this leads to the}} mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, <b>clonazepam,</b> the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. Dosages of <b>clonazepam</b> usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of <b>clonazepam</b> may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.|$|E
