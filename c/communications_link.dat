The IAF command post in Tel Aviv provided Ivry a real-time command {{picture of the}} air battle through various data links. E-2Cs with airborne surveillance radar down-linked their pictures to the command post. A squadron of Tadiran Mastiff and IAI Scout Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV) kept at least two vehicles in the air all the time, providing constant location of the SAM batteries. A two-way voice <b>communications</b> <b>link</b> between Ivry and his pilots was set up, allowing for real-time command.|$|E

40|$|There are {{significant}} activities taking place {{to establish the}} procedures and requirements for safe and routine operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in the National Airspace System (NAS). Among the barriers to overcome in achieving this goal {{is the lack of}} sufficient frequency spectrum necessary for the UAS control and air traffic control (ATC) <b>communications</b> <b>links.</b> This shortcoming is {{compounded by the fact that}} the UAS control <b>communications</b> <b>links</b> will likely be required to operate in protected frequency spectrum, just as ATC <b>communications</b> <b>links</b> are, because they relate to "safety and regularity of flight. " To support future International Telecommunications Union (ITU) World Radio Conference (WRC) agenda items concerning new frequency allocations for UAS <b>communications</b> <b>links,</b> and to augment the Future Communications Study (FCS) Technology Evaluation Group efforts, NASA Glenn Research Center has sponsored a task to estimate the UAS control and ATC communications bandwidth requirements for safe, reliable, and routine operation of UAS in the NAS.

25|$|Following {{his capture}} of Egersund, Rittmeister Eckhorn {{initially}} placed the telegraph cable to Scotland under armed guard, before later severing the <b>communications</b> <b>link</b> {{in accordance with}} his orders. The German beachhead at Egersund was initially isolated from other German forces, due to defective radio equipment and Norwegian efforts to cut the telephone lines in the area. Contact with the German units at Stavanger was eventually achieved by despatching a motorcycle-mounted officer disguised as a civilian. Before the Germans managed to establish control over the areas surrounding the town centre of Egersund, the mobilization depot at Årstaddalen was evacuated by the Norwegians.|$|E

Knowledge about Jupiter benefited from the fact that New Horizons instruments were built using the latest technology, especially in the area of cameras, representing a significant improvement over Galileo cameras, which were modified versions of Voyager cameras, which, in turn, were modified Mariner cameras. The Jupiter encounter also served as a shakedown and dress rehearsal for the Pluto encounter. Because Jupiter is much closer to Earth than Pluto, the <b>communications</b> <b>link</b> can transmit multiple loadings of the memory buffer; thus the mission returned more data from the Jovian system than it was expected to transmit from Pluto.|$|E

500|$|The {{accident}} caused controversy at {{the time}} and in the years since. It highlighted the risks Thule Air Base posed to Greenlanders from nuclear accidents and potential superpower conflicts. The accident, which occurred two years after the Palomares crash, signaled the immediate end of the airborne alert program, which had become untenable because of the political and operational risks involved. Scott Sagan, a political science academic and anti-nuclear writer, postulated that if the HOBO 28 monitoring aircraft had crashed into the BMEWS early warning array instead of Baffin Bay, it would have presented NORAD with a scenario (radio link to [...] "Hard Head" [...] aircraft and BMEWS both dead, no nuclear detonation detected) that also matched that of a surprise conventional missile attack on Thule, leaving the unreliable submarine telecommunications cable between Thule and the US mainland as the only source of information to the contrary.

500|$|One of {{the main}} motivations for {{studying}} book embedding cited by [...] involves an application in VLSI design, to the organization of fault-tolerant multiprocessors. In the DIOGENES system developed by these authors, the CPUs of a multiprocessor system are arranged into a logical sequence corresponding to the spine of a book (although this sequence {{may not necessarily be}} placed along a line in the physical layout of this system). Communication links connecting these processors are grouped into [...] "bundles" [...] which correspond to the pages of a book and act like stacks: connecting one of the processors to {{the start of a new}} <b>communications</b> <b>link</b> pushes all the previous links upward in the bundle, and connecting another processor to the end of a communication link connects it to the one at the bottom of the bundle and pops all the other ones down. Because of this stack behavior, a single bundle can handle a set of communications links that form the edges of a single page in a book embedding. [...] By organizing the links in this way, a wide variety of different network topologies can be implemented, regardless of which processors have become faulty, as long as enough non-faulty processors remain to implement the network. [...] The network topologies that can be implemented by this system are exactly the ones that have book thickness at most equal to the number of bundles that have been made available.|$|E
