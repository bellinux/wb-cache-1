Formation of credit ratings is specified by the inherent asymmetry of financial market information and general interest in the transformation of a large amount of diverse and segmented financial information in a simple and clear assessment of the <b>credit</b> <b>surveillance</b> of borrowers that is credit rating. The world financial crisis started in 2008 has again put on the agenda the question of rating assessment accuracy and the factors influencing the rating migration. The activity of rating agencies, until recently, has had little regulation, allowing rating agencies to avoid responsibility for inaccuracies in assigned ratings, while investors were suffering huge losses. Therefore there is an actual question of trust in a rating assessment and the necessity of introduction of elements of control...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Face {{recognition}} {{is a process}} of identifying people from their face images. Face recognition technology has many applications such as ATM access, verification of <b>credit</b> card, video <b>surveillance</b> etc. In this paper, we propose a novel face recognition algorithm which exploits both local and global features for feature extraction. Local features are extracted by Gabor wavelets and for global feature extraction, contourlet transform is applied. Then statistical parameters for local and global features are calculated and both the features are combined. Finally face {{recognition is}} performed using distance classifier. This proposed algorithm is implemented using MATLAB. The experimental results on ORL face database demonstrate the efficiency of proposed method as 98. 5 % as against non-fusion face recognition schemes...|$|R
40|$|A face {{recognition}} {{system based on}} 2 -D DCT features and pseudo- 2 D Hidden Markov Models is presented. The system achieves a recognition rate of 99. 5 % on the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) face database. This recognition rate {{is much better than}} the recognition rate of a previous pseudo 2 -D HMM approach. It represents also the best rate ever reported on this database. In fact, only one single face out of the 200 available test faces was not correctly recognized. The superiority of our approach against the previous approach is analyzed, and the recognition rates are compared to other {{face recognition}} systems evaluated on the ORL database. categories: Face recognition techniques, Head and face modelling techniques 1 Introduction Face recognition {{is one of the major}} topics in the image processing and pattern recognition research area.

40|$|Face {{detection}} and recognition {{is becoming increasingly}} important in the contexts of <b>surveillance,</b> <b>credit</b> card fraud detection, assistive devices for visual impaired, etc. A number of face recognition algorithms have been proposed in the literature. The availability of a comprehensive face database is crucial to test the performance of these face recognition algorithms. However, while existing publicly-available face databases contain face images {{with a wide variety}} of poses angles, illumination angles, gestures, face occlusions, and illuminant colors, these images have not been adequately annotated, thus limiting their usefulness for evaluating the relative performance of face detection algorithms. For example, many of the images in existing databases are not annotated with the exact pose angles at which they were taken. In order to compare the performance of various face recognition algorithms presented in the literature there is a need for a comprehensive, systematically annotated database populated with face images that have been captured (1) at a variety of pose angles (to permit testing of pose invariance), (2) {{with a wide variety of}} illumination angles (to permit testing of illumination invariance), and (3) under a variety of commonly encountered illumination color temperatures (to permit testing of illumination color invariance). In this paper, we present a methodology for creating such an annotated database that employs a novel set of apparatus for the rapid capture of face images from a wide variety of pose angles and illumination angles. Four different types of illumination are used, including daylight, skylight, incandescent and fluorescent. The entire set of images, as well as the annotations and the experimental results, is being placed in the public domain, and made available for download over the worldwide web. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} {{to check for}} consistency between the IMF''s standard country surveillance tool, namely medium-term projections of the macroeconomic framework (including the real, fiscal, external, and monetary sectors), and the financial sector. Consistency here entails that the financial sector remain solvent in the medium term under the assumptions of the macroeconomic framework and that the macroeconomic framework is fine-tuned should threats to financial sector solvency arise {{as a result of}} assumptions underlying the medium-term macroeconomic framework projections. The proposed framework {{can also be used to}} conduct sensitivity analysis of the aggregated financial sector to various types of risks, including foreign exchange, interest rate, and <b>credit</b> risk. For <b>surveillance</b> purposes, this framework can easily be integrated into one of the standard sectoral files so that any update to the macroeconomic framework automatically feeds into the financial sector medium-term projections. We anticipate the proposed framework to be of interest to IMF economists as well as outside analysts.

40|$|The way crossed by the Romanian {{banking system}} until {{the present time}} is one governed by {{profound}} reforms which {{have been made in}} regards to the European Union. The strategies embraced by Romanian banks, in 1990 and until the present time, are meant to develop and to improve the performances so that they can compete with European banks and they can respond in an efficient manner to the customersâ€™ needs. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to underline the main stages of evolution of the Romanian banking system since 1990 and to lay emphasize the perspectives on its evolution in the context of the actual economic crisis. By going through the stages previously mentioned in this paper, we can see that the Romanian banking system evolved positively, from the moment of the transition to the market economy, but in order for it to be functional and to contribute to the development of the economy as a whole, aspects related to the the supervision of the financial stability should be taken into consideration and in order to assure the stability of the financial system, the increase of the administrative capacity of the Central Bank should be considered, as well as balancing the structure of the creditation process, on coins, the improvement of the banking assetsâ€™ quality, the qualitative study of the NBRâ€™s surveillance process, managing the contagion risk, etc. In order to achieve these objectives, the documentation by the investigation of a significant volume of works has been done, by scientifically acknowledged publications, analysis being applied, by deduction method and a significant volume of quantitative information was submitted to professional judgment. Concerns regarding this subject have been found in various paper works and in specialized books. We mention here the doctoral thesis of Elena Teodorescu Georgescu â€œThe evaluation pattern of <b>credit</b> institutionsâ€™ prudential <b>surveillance</b> efficacyâ€, the author of this work David Delia, with the work â€œContributions regarding the improvement of the banking accountancy dealing with credits granted to non-financial clientsâ€ and so on. An outstanding attention payed to this subject was the one of the governor of the National Bank of Romania, Mugur Isarescu, who issued a series of articles and books on this subject. Also, Silviu Cerna, Aurelian Paul Berea, Vasile Dedu, Nicolae Danila approached in their books the problem regarding the evolution of the Romanian banking system. The National Bank of Romania offers to its users, information regarding the evolution of the banking industry through the Reports of Financial Stability and The Annual Report. The results of the research and the general conclusions regarding the concern on the evolution of the Romanian banking system are presented at the end of the work...|$|R
