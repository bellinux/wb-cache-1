25|$|The {{dominant}} power(s) of {{the world}} is/are fluid, the initial period of US unilateralism can be loosely pinpointed to their interventions during the world wars. Following this period of rising US dominance on the world stage, “there have been no shortage of people who, from {{the rise of the}} USSR’s space programme in the 1950s, through to the third world revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam, Iran and elsewhere, and to the emergence of Japan, Europe and now China as major economic powers, have predicted that US dominance, predominance, hegemony or, in more recent, post-Cold War terms, ‘unipolarity’, are ebbing away.” The predictions of these individuals represent the fluidity of power over time, through the idea that, during the period where the US was unequivocally dominant, people <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the inevitable future, of a change in power and authority, on the world stage.|$|E

The ATroop section having finished off the pillboxes, set out for Orange one beach, ambushing a German patrol on route.

The men from BTroop approached from behind the anti-aircraft tower, as they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> some Germans moving about on it, they detached three men to deal with them. At the same time they stumbled across and captured a machine gun post. At 06:15 the assault started, FTroop discovered a group of Germans forming up to put in their own assault on the fire base.

The troop continued their advance, moving between some buildings and an orchard, when they were themselves caught in the open by heavy gun fire. Two men in the lead the troop commander Captain Pettiward and Lieutenant McDonald were killed while Troop Sergeant Major Stockdale was wounded.

2500|$|The men in {{the newly}} created small ghetto were sent out to their work {{stations}} that Sunday, {{as they had been}} the day before. On the way, they saw the columns formed up for the march to Rumbula, and they heard weeping, screaming, and shooting, but they could learn no details. The men asked some of the German soldiers with whom they were acquainted to go to the ghetto to see what happened. These soldiers did go, but could not gain admission to the ghetto itself. From a distance, they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> [...] "many horrible things". [...] They reported these facts to the Jews of the work detachments, who asked them to be released early from work to see to their families. At 14:00 hours this request was granted, at least for a few of the men, and they returned to the ghetto. [...] They found the streets scattered with things, which they were directed to collect and carry to the guardhouse. They also found a small bundle {{which turned out to be}} a living child, a baby aged about four weeks. A Latvian guard took the child away.
