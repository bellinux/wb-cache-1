5|$|In the infancy of the hacker {{subculture}} and {{the computer}} underground, criminal convictions were rare because there was an informal code of ethics {{that was followed by}} white hat hackers. Proponents of hacking claim to be motivated by artistic and political ends, but are often unconcerned about the use of criminal means to achieve them. White hat hackers break past computer security for non-malicious reasons and do no damage, akin to breaking into a house and looking around. They enjoy learning and working with <b>computer</b> <b>systems,</b> and by this experience gain a deeper understanding of electronic security. As the computer industry matured, individuals with malicious intentions (black hats) would emerge to exploit <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> for their own personal profit.|$|E

5|$|<b>Computer</b> <b>systems</b> {{make use}} of caches—small and fast {{memories}} located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> have difficulties with caches that may store the same value {{in more than one}} location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping {{is one of the most}} common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.|$|E

5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In a {{heterogeneous}} parallel <b>computer</b> <b>system,</b> the computational power {{of each of}} the processors differs from one another. Furthermore, with distributed memory, the capacity of the memory, which is distributed to each of the processors, differs from one another. Using queuing system to describe a distributed memory heterogeneous parallel <b>computer</b> <b>system,</b> each of the heterogeneous processors will have its own heterogeneous queue. The variation of waiting time of heterogeneous parallel <b>computer</b> <b>system</b> with distributed memory needs to be modeled because it will help designers of parallel <b>computer</b> <b>system</b> {{to determine the extent of}} variation of the waiting time. It will also help users to know when to realize minimum variation of the waiting time.

These methods can be used to help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E
