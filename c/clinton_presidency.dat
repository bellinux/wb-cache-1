5|$|For the sub-plot {{about the}} morning-after pill, former Clinton {{economic}} advisor Gene Sperling {{was brought in}} for consultation. Such a drug, called Mifepristone, was in fact approved in the United States in September 2000; {{one of the last}} months of the <b>Clinton</b> <b>presidency.</b> Also the political issues related to Haiti have close parallels to an episode in the Clinton presidency: the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power by the United States in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton {{proposed}} a new initiative {{to provide health}} coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in {{the years of the}} <b>Clinton</b> <b>Presidency.</b> That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E

Similarly, the Japan Self-Defense Forces, when being asked about their policy toward gays and lesbians following the U.S. debate during the <b>Clinton</b> <b>presidency,</b> answered that it was not an issue, and individuals within the forces indicated that as long as same-sex relations did not lead to fights or other trouble, there were few, if any, barriers to their inclusion in the armed services.|$|E
25|$|Harkin ran for President in 1992 as {{a populist}} with labor union support. He criticized George H. W. Bush for {{being out of}} touch with working-class Americans. Harkin was an early {{favorite}} in a small field of five candidates. Harkin won the Iowa caucus and those in Idaho and Minnesota (with help from Senator Paul Wellstone), but he ran poorly in New Hampshire and other primaries and ultimately lost the Democratic Party nomination to Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Harkin was the first Democratic primary contender to drop out and throw his support behind Clinton — a favor that led to a close relationship throughout the <b>Clinton</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E

Our analysis of a corpus of press briefings ranging across five <b>presidencies,</b> from Bill <b>Clinton</b> to Barack Obama, will focus on the lexical item security from a modern diachronic corpus-assisted discourse studies perspective (Partington 2010). The analysis of the collocational profile of security across time will enable us to assess the phraseological evolution of the senses of the term and its conceptualisation in US political debate, from “social security” (during Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>presidencies)</b> to “homeland security” (especially during the first George W.

500|$|During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with {{a number}} of {{industry}} groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies. [...] She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations. [...] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator {{in the history of the}} agency, staying through both terms of the <b>Clinton</b> <b>presidency</b> – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years. [...] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as [...] "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," [...] and wrote that she was [...] "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues."

500|$|Going {{into the}} early stages of her presidential {{campaign}} for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled [...] "Love Her", [...] "Hate Her", while Mother Jones titled its profile of her [...] "Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary". Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates, while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>presidency</b> not so bad after all. An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled [...] "The Waning Power of Hillary Hate". By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation. She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton's laugh, that [...] "We know that there's language to condemn female speech that doesn't exist for male speech. We call women's speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton's laugh was being described as a cackle." [...] The [...] "bitch" [...] epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics, flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well. Following Clinton's [...] "choked up moment" [...] and related incidents {{in the run-up to the}} January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse. Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events [...] "brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics." ...|$|E

40|$|Economists {{often use}} Gallup Poll data on presidential {{performance}} {{to analyze the}} interaction between politics {{and the state of}} the macroeconomy. The household survey undertaken by the Survey Research Center (SRC) of the University of Michigan provides an alternative data base. The SRC asks respondents about the government's performance specifically with respect to inflation and unemployment. We compare whether the Gallup or SRC data are the more useful for estimating the public's social preference function between inflation and unemployment for the Carter, Reagan, Bush and <b>Clinton</b> <b>presidencies.</b> The estimates that use Gallup Poll data are unsatisfactory because for two of the periods the coefficients of inflation and unemployment are not well estimated and for one period there is serial correlation of the residuals. The estimates using the SRC data set are satisfactory and the results are consistent with economic theory. We conclude that a researcher using survey data to estimate the public's reaction to varying rates of inflation and unemployment should prefer the SRC series when it is available.
