The expanded trade between Byzantium and the Caliphate established several trades routes which ran across Armenia. The most important route began from Trebizond, in Byzantium, and from there it connected to the cities of Ani, Kars, and Artsn. The city of Kars allowed trade to move north, to ports on the Black Sea and to Abkhazia; other routes were connected to cities in Anatolia and Iran; and the main route leading from the Caliphate to Kievan Rus {{was known as the}} [...] "Great Armenian Highway." [...] Ani did not lie along any previously important trade routes, but because of its size, power, and wealth it became an important trading hub. From Ani, Armenia exported textiles, metalwork, armor, jewelry, horses, <b>cattle,</b> <b>salt,</b> wine, honey, timber, leather, and furs. Its primary trading partners were the Byzantine Empire, the Arabs but also traded with Kievan Rus and Central Asia. Armenian-populated Dvin remained an important city on par with Ani, as evidenced in a vivid description by the Arab historian and geographer al-Mukadasi: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, farmers formed the {{majority}} of the city population. The group of craftsmen was mainly formed by shoemakers, tailors, blacksmiths, weavers, carpenters and potters. The stream-mill and the stream-sawmill contributed significantly {{to the development of the}} local industry. There was also an alcohol distillery, a brewery and a standard brick-yard. The local sawmill (with the power of 30 horses) produced pine-, oak- and ash- boards and flooring blocks. It used 2300 cubic meters of wood for 1500 cubic meters of the final product. There used to be a famous tan-yard in the beginning of the 19th century. Later, the tanning industry was not so common. In the 16th century, they used to make swords in this city. In the same century, there used to be a famous weaving-mill here. We can learn from the book of rights granted to the city in 1589 by the king of Poland, Sigismund III Vasa, that the following guilds operated in Kamianka Strumilowa: the guild of furriers, shoemakers, weavers, blacksmiths, tinsel-makers, locksmiths, coopers, fishermen, armourers, paper-mill workers, haberdashers, carpenters and turners. In the late 19th century, some of these guilds did not exist, some deteriorated. Actually, the entire local industry deteriorated. The residents used to make a lot of money from fishery. They fished for eels in the Bug River. The fishermen were granted special privileges by the city government. Those days, there were not any local fish-breeding ponds so the city ceased to make profits on this branch. People used to put rafts into the Bug river. Those days, people did not engage themselves in this activity. They did not engage much in trade either. Local fairs and markets were modest and insignificant. Those days, trade was carried on mainly by Jews. They sold <b>cattle,</b> <b>salt,</b> grain, lumber in the main. They sold also a small amount of fish. Markets were held every Tuesday and Friday. Fairs were held on January 19; on May 8; on September 10. The city assets equalled 162.148 Polish zloty and the liabilities 233 Polish zloty. The city revenue was 7740 Polish zloty in the year of 1881.|$|E
40|$|In 1932, a {{nitrogen}} fertilizer trial was initiated on a loamy Oxyaquic Eutrochrept near Munich (Germany). After 45 years, the sodium nitrate plots showed {{a much stronger}} slaking of the soil surface compared to the calcium nitrate plots in 1976. Sampling of the experimental plots to 1 m depth {{in order to determine}} bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil moisture characteristic, slaking resistance and exchangeable cations was only possible after termination of the experiment in 1998. Comparison of the laboratory results of both plots showed increased contents of exchangeable Na, but no decrease of exchangeable Ca for the sodium nitrate plots. Bulk density at depths > 50 cm increased and the slaking resistance decreased on those plots. The other soil structural properties determined were not significantly affected. The reason behind these unexpected findings is the change from sodium nitrate to calcium nitrate + <b>cattle</b> <b>salt</b> as the sodium nitrate fertilizer in 1984, 15 years prior to sampling. The resulting additional supply of Ca 2 + was able to remediate the formerly visible deterioration of the soil structure by Na+. The adverse structural effects of an unfavourable fertilizer type (based on monovalent cations) can therefore be reversed by a change to a more appropriate type (based on bivalent cations, preferentially Ca 2 +) ...|$|E

It is transported to the sub-humid zone {{of the country where}} it is sold to Peuhl Pastoralists who use it to supplement their cattle feed. According to a recent study of the International Livestock Centre for Africe (ILCA), ' Kanwa ' can also be used as a fertilizer. It contains a wide variety of elements, such as phosphorus and copper, which are missing in certain Nigerian soils. ILCA researchers have also analysed its effect on plant growth. Trials with plots of Stylosanthes hamata, a nitrogen-fixing forage, have been quite encouraging. Another point in favour of kanwa is its low price: between 8 - 10 naira (about US $ 10 - 12. 50) per 100 kilos (220 pounds). Used in conjunction with phosphorus to fertilize nitrogen-fixing crops, it could improve agricultural productivity at less cost than commercial nitrogen fertilizers. Before promoting the use of kanwa as an inorganic fertilizer, however, research must be continued to estimate Nigeria's reserves of kanwa, to determine the optimum doses for different crops and soils, and to compare {{the costs and benefits of}} this new use of a mineral salt traditionally used to supplement cattle feed.

40|$|Cattlemen {{are aware}} of the impact high cost labor has on profit; thus, {{management}} procedures which reduce labor requirements are important. One management tool frequently used is regulating feed intake with salt. In addition, self-feeding supplements tend to allow timid, slow-eating cows to get their share and it is an easy method of providing Vitamin A, phosphorus and other feed additives. However, there are disadvantages to feeding salt-concentrate mixes. Salt is not a precise regulator of intake since certain individuals will tolerate more salt than others and abundant water is essential. Daily salt requirement for mature cattle is less than 1 oz/head/day; however, voluntary intake often exceeds minimum needs. Because there are practical limits to the amount of <b>salt</b> <b>cattle</b> eat, <b>salt</b> can be used to restrict the consumption of highly palatable feeds such as grain and supplement.
