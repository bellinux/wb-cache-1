The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E

Meanwhile, Andy and Erin chat backstage, and Erin states how happy she is that they are spending time together outside of the Office. However, Erin's boyfriend calls and she leaves to meet him.

40|$|AbstractWe study some {{counting}} and enumeration {{problems for}} chordal graphs, especially concerning independent sets. We first provide the following efficient algorithms for a chordal graph: (1) a linear-time algorithm for <b>counting</b> <b>the</b> number of independent sets; (2) a linear-time algorithm for <b>counting</b> <b>the</b> number of maximum independent sets; (3) a polynomial-time algorithm for <b>counting</b> <b>the</b> number of independent sets of a fixed size. With similar ideas, {{we show that}} enumeration (namely, listing) of the independent sets, the maximum independent sets, and the independent sets of a fixed size in a chordal graph {{can be done in}} constant time per output. On the other hand, we prove that the following problems for a chordal graph are #P-complete: (1) <b>counting</b> <b>the</b> number of maximal independent sets; (2) <b>counting</b> <b>the</b> number of minimum maximal independent sets. With similar ideas, we also show that finding a minimum weighted maximal independent set in a chordal graph is NP-hard, and even hard to approximate...|$|R

5|$|Each of the valid Band1 {{permutations}} can {{be expanded}} (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations.

Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each equivalence class and then multiply the number of solutions {{by the size of the}} equivalence class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and <b>count)</b> <b>the</b> permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, {{former coach}} and quarterback William Skinner {{helped lead the}} {{formation}} of the Maryland Intercollegiate Football Association (MIFA) in order to improve the process of naming the state champions. Other teams involved included Baltimore City College, Gallaudet, Johns Hopkins, Washington College, and Western Maryland. The game against St. John's once again aroused controversy, and the MAC accused their opponent of hiring s from Lehigh. When Johns Hopkins canceled their game, Maryland arranged to play Georgetown instead. The Maryland team called the game with a 6–4 lead as darkness fell. However, the referee, Georgetown halfback Mike Mahoney, ruled it a forfeiture and awarded the win to Georgetown. Today, Maryland and Georgetown both <b>count</b> <b>the</b> game as a Maryland Agricultural win in their records.|$|E
