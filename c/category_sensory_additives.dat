40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an {{evolutionary}} framework for categorization. Evolution needs an evaluation mechanism to work, and it is argued that primary values that the organism needs for its survival [...] such as food, mates for reproduction, and shelter [...] can drive the evolution of <b>categories.</b> <b>Sensory</b> stimulation is needed to build up the cognitive apparatus, but cannot in itself provide the evaluation mechanism for evolution. Categorization constrained by values will be dependent on the availability of sensory information, and its power as predictive of values. As perception and categorization are tied to the actions of the organism, it is argued that the unit of perception should be seen as larger than the usual singledimension stimulus, and evidence is reviewed to support this claim. Covarying stimuli will also provide a much greater predictive power than single-dimension stimuli alone...|$|R

Although some studies have investigated {{the internal consistency of}} eyetracking, data are scarce on the test–retest reliability and agreement of eyetracking to investigate attentional bias. This study reports the test–retest reliability, measurement error, and internal consistency of 12 commonly used outcome measures thought to reflect the different components of attentional bias: overall attention, early attention, and late attention. Healthy participants completed a preferential-looking eyetracking task that involved the presentation of threatening (sensory words, general threat words, and affective words) and nonthreatening words. We used intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to measure test–retest reliability (ICC 3 ̆e. 70 indicates adequate reliability). The ICCs(2, 1) ranged from –. 31 to. 71.

40|$|Carotenoids {{are used}} in animal {{nutrition}} mainly as <b>sensory</b> <b>additives</b> that favourably affect the colour of fish, birds and food of animal origin. Various analytical methods exist for their quantification in compound feed, reflecting the different physico-chemical characteristics of the carotenoid and the corresponding feed additives. They may be natural products or specific formulations containing the target carotenoids produced by chemical synthesis. In this study a multi-analyte method was developed {{that can be applied}} to the determination of all 10 carotenoids currently authorised within the European Union for compound feedingstuffs. The method functions regardless of whether the carotenoids have been added to the compound feed via natural products or specific formulations. It is comprised of three steps: (1) digestion of the feed sample with an enzyme; (2) pressurised liquid extraction; and (3) quantification of the analytes by reversed-phase HPLC coupled to a photodiode array detector in the visible range. The method was single-laboratory validated for poultry and fish feed covering a mass fraction range of the target analyte from 2. 5 to 300 mg kg– 1. The following method performance characteristics were obtained: the recovery rate varied from 82 % to 129 % and precision expressed as the relative standard deviation of intermediate precision varied from 1. 6 % to 15 %. Based on the acceptable performance obtained in the validation study, the multi-analyte method is considered fit for the intended purpose. JRC. F. 5 -Food and Feed Complianc...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} age, gender and {{production}} region on the sensory characteristics of springbok M. longissimus dorsi (LD) were investigated in 19 springbok, which originated from two Nature Reserves in the Free State Province of South Africa and {{were divided into}} age (adult, sub-adult) and gender <b>categories.</b> The <b>sensory</b> characteristics evaluated were game meat aroma, juiciness, residual tissue, tenderness and game meat flavour. Age, gender and production region had an effect (P < 0. 05) on different sensory ratings of the meat. Whereas production region influenced (P < 0. 05) the game meat aroma, initial juiciness, sustained juiciness and residual tissue ratings of the meat, gender and age {{had a significant effect}} on only the residual tissue rating of the meat. An interaction (P < 0. 01) between age, gender and production region was observed for the tenderness attribute where the males from the Gariep Nature Reserve were the only gender that showed a significantly higher tenderness rating in the sub-adult than in the adult <b>category.</b> <b>Sensory</b> ratings were linearly correlated with certain physical and chemical attributes. Warner-Bratzler shear force (kg/ 1. 27 cm diameter) values were inversely correlated with the sensory attributes of tenderness (r = - 0. 70, P < 0. 01), residual tissue (r = - 0. 68, P < 0. 01) and sustained juiciness (r = - 0. 43; P < 0. 05). Age-related effects on perceived tenderness were minor in comparison with pH effects. As the pH 24 of the meat increased, tenderness (r = - 0. 46, P < 0. 05) and sustained juiciness (r = - 0. 54, P < 0. 05) decreased significantly. No significant linear correlations were observed between the intramuscular fat (IMF) content and the sustained juiciness ratings of the meat. It can be concluded that production region had some influence on sensory characteristics of springbok meat, whilst the influence of age and gender were negligible. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This study aims to {{contribute}} to the knowledge of the commercial, sensory, and analytical characteristics of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) from the Marche region (Italy), renowned since ancient times. The chemical composition of all the most typical monovarietal oils collected in four crop seasons, was studied in relation to the year of harvesting (from 2004 - 2007) and the genotype. In order to obtain a complete description of oil samples, free acidity, peroxide value, fatty acid composition, ultraviolet indices, carotenoids, chlorophylls, and phenols were determined. The main characteristics of these oils are large total phenol content, low acidity and peroxide values, low oxidative susceptibilities. All the chemical parameters fell within the limits established for the maximum olive oil <b>category.</b> <b>Sensory</b> evaluation showed that the total score of all the monovarietal extra virgin olive oils was always much higher than the 6. 5 limit established for the 'extra-virgin' category. The overall quality indices support claims of excellence for monovarietal EVOOs from this geographical area.

Motivation for the study: Even though the use of the senses such as sight, sound and smell is a popular sensory marketing tool in the field of experiential marketing, applying such marketing techniques is a challenging and costly exercise for marketers, and researchers have called for more studies on senses and consumer experience. Research design, approach and method: A full factorial laboratory experiment (2 x 2 x 2) was conducted where 240 spirits consumers indicated the tastiness of a brandy sample under certain conditions.

40|$|International audienceFood {{behavior}} {{has been shown}} to be influenced by top-down processes such as expectations generated from the mental representations of product. Investigating how a product is represented in consumers' mind is therefore essential to a better understanding of food behavior. As traditional and typical products are particularly prone to expectation effects, these products are well suited to explore consumer's mental representations. Among traditional products, beers are certainly of interest for both product development and marketing. A free association task was conducted in two evaluation conditions. Participants were asked to state what came to their mind while evaluating 14 bottles of beers with the full packaging information provided (packaging condition) and while tasting the same 14 beers in blind (tasting condition). A total of 67 participants took part in this study. Results showed that different mental representations were activated in the two evaluation conditions. The elicited terms refer to eight semantic <b>categories</b> (<b>Sensory,</b> Description, Affect, Consumers, Nature, Moment, Character, and Culture). Elicited terms are of three types: Affective, sensory/analytical, and semantic/experience-based. Affective terms were elicited in both conditions but more negative terms were reported in the tasting condition. Sensory/analytical terms were differently elicited according to the evaluation condition (e. g. color and design of the label for the packaging condition and taste and flavor in the tasting condition). The semantic/experience-based representations set contains terms linked to general knowledge about beers and experience-based knowledge such as contextual information collected from personal experience with the product. Semantic/experience-based terms were elicited in both evaluation conditions but differences were found according to the level of familiarity with the beers: Unfamiliar beers are more linked to general knowledge whereas familiar beers are more linked to experience-based knowledge. Finally, results highlighted that although perceptual characteristics of beers remain an important component of consumers' representations, semantic and experience-based associations are a key component to explain organization of mental representation in consumers' minds...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{posterior}} {{parietal cortex}} (PPC) of rhesus monkeys {{has been found}} to encode the behavioral meaning of <b>categories</b> of <b>sensory</b> stimuli. When animals are instructed with sensory cues to make either eye or hand movements to a target, PPC cells also show specificity depending on which effector (eye or hand) is instructed for the movement. To determine whether this selectivity retrospectively reflects the behavioral meaning of the cue or prospectively encodes the movement plan, we trained monkeys to autonomously choose to acquire a target in the absence of direct instructions specifying which effector to use. Activity in PPC showed strong specificity for effector choice, with cells in the lateral intraparietal area selective for saccades and cells in the parietal reach region selective for reaches. Such differential activity associated with effector choice under identical stimulus conditions provides definitive evidence that the PPC is prospectively involved in action selection and movement preparation...|$|R
40|$|When {{exposed to}} a novel diet during food transition, pigs often {{decrease}} voluntarily their food intake, {{which can lead to}} impaired growth. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the palatability of eight unknown food additives (mixture of various essential oils and other plant extracts) and to identify among them the additives that were likely to improve food preferences, intake and weight gain in juvenile pigs. In Experiment 1, 12 juvenile female pigs were subjected to one- and two-way choice tests to investigate their spontaneous preferences between a standard grower diet and nine experimental diets composed of the familiar grower diet added with the sensory functional ingredients (N 1 –N 8) at predefined concentrations. As the control diet was preferred over the N 5, N 6, N 7 and N 8 diets, only the N 1, N 2, N 3 and N 4 additives were selected for Experiment 2. In Experiment 2, 12 juvenile female pigs were subjected to two-choice feeding tests to investigate their relative preferences between the four remaining experimental diets. Overall, the analysis of individual and collective consumption and preferences suggests that some additives might be more palatable than others, at the tested concentrations, and that preferences are subjected to a great inter-individual variability. Experiment 2 enabled to identify the N 1 and N 3 additives as the best candidates for Experiment 3. In Experiment 3, the spontaneous food intake of 24 juvenile female pigs was assessed during a food transition. After nine days during which they were fed a familiar starter diet, the pigs were divided into three experimental groups and fed an unfamiliar grower diet added with either the N 1 additive, the N 3 additive, or with no additive (control). Albeit the adjunction of the functional ingredients in the novel diet did not increase food intake or weight gain in these particular experimental conditions, it might enable to maintain a normal consumption the day of the food transition, contrary to the control diet, although the results were not significant. Further studies using complementary tests where a unique food is provided in controlled conditions, in addition to two-choice tests, might enable to investigate more accurately the efficiency of the <b>sensory</b> <b>additives</b> to improve food palatability, preferences and intake in pigs...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Many herbal {{products}} (herbs {{and essential}} oils) are currently used as feed additives by the feed {{industry in the}} European Union and elsewhere. These phytogenic substances which increase feed aroma or palatability of feeds are classified as <b>sensory</b> <b>additives</b> by European Council. However, several publications show that some essential oils may have beneficial effects on animal performance and health status because of other properties except their sensory characteristics. These claimed properties are stimulation of digestive secretions; antimicrobial, coccidiostat, anthelmintic, and anti-inflammatory activities; and antioxidant properties. Most research revealed that supplementing herbal essential oils to diets resulted in reducing blood cholesterol, increasing palatability of feed and stimulating the immune system in poultry, while different results obtained by ruminants because of rumen microbial population and ruminal fermentation conditions. The use of large and repeated quantities of antibiotics in animal feed may cause to eliminate beneficial intestinal microflora and innate immune system and subsequently cause to antibiotic resistance and remains antibiotics in animal products.

His work will be a stimulating resource {{for a wide range of}} scholars and students across philosophy and psychology. ([URL]...|$|R
40|$|The 'variety effect' {{describes}} the greater consumption that is observed when multiple foods with different sensory characteristics are presented either simultaneously or sequentially. Variety increases {{the amount of}} food consumed in test of ad libitum intake. However, outside the laboratory, meals are often planned in advance and then consumed in their entirety. We sought to explore {{the extent to which the}} variety effect is anticipated in this pre-meal planning. Participants were shown two food images, each representing a first or a second course of a hypothetical meal. The two courses were either, i) exactly the same food, ii) different foods from the same <b>sensory</b> <b>category</b> (sweet or savoury) or, iii) different foods from a different <b>sensory</b> <b>category.</b> In Study 1 (N = 30) these courses comprised typical ‘main meal’ foods and in Study 2 (N = 30) they comprised snack foods. For each pair of images, participants rated their expected liking of the second course and selected ideal portion sizes, both for the second course and the first and second course, combined. In both studies, as the difference between the courses (from (i) same to (ii) similar to (iii) different) increased, the second course was selected in a larger portion and it was rated as more pleasant. To our knowledge, these are the first studies to show that the variety effect is evident in the energy content of self-selected meals. This work shows that effects of variety are learned and anticipated. This extends our characterisation beyond a passive process that develops towards the end of a meal...|$|R
