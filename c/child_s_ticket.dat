40|$|This thesis {{determined}} {{the prevalence of}} overweight and obesity among children enrolled in Merced County Head Start during the 2010 _ 2011 school year, assessed maternal figures perceptions in regards to their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> weight status, and examined {{the factors that influence}} maternal figures perceptions and misperceptions of their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> weight status. Anthropometric measures were collected to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity of children enrolled in Merced County Head Start. To assess maternal figures perceptions of their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> weight status, maternal figures were asked to complete a self- administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included items that examined maternal figures perception of their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> weight status, their concern regarding their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> weight status and physical activity, and their feeling of degree of control over their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> dietary habits and physical activity. Maternal figures perceptions were then compared to their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> actual weight status. Factors that influence maternal figures perceptions were examined through focus groups discussions with maternal figures at four Merced County Head Start Centers. Recurrent themes were identified and a list supporting comments was generated. The collection and analysis of the data was intended to provide valuable information for the enhancement and development of obesity prevention efforts for Head Start children and families in Merced County...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: {{review the}} literature, {{exploring}} {{factors that contribute}} to the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior such as the role of learning and social context. Methods: the review of the literature was done using Medline, Psyclit, and Lilacs as resources for assessing international and national research articles on child nutrition, with an emphasis on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior. These articles were revised and grouped together according to the topic. Results: family is responsible for the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior through social learning. Parents are <b>children</b> <b>s</b> first nutritional educators. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> eating experiences are influenced by cultural and psychosocial factors. Social context plays a relevant role in this process, especially through the strategies used by parents to encourage children to have a balanced diet and to eat specific foods. These strategies may contain adequate and inadequate stimuli as to the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food preference and food intake self-control. Conclusion: the learning process is a determining factor for <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior, and is associated with three factors: food flavor conditioning, food postingestional consequences, and social context. Parents are deeply concerned with the amount of food their children eat and not with the development of more adequate habits and attitudes related to dietary quality. J. pediatr.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services offer children a means of developing their reading skills through the provision of books and other resources. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services might be operated by public libraries, school library services or schools. A small proportion of public library authorities in the UK choose to operate specialist mobile libraries which cater for children alone. Such vehicles deliver a library service to children {{across a range of}} geographic and socioeconomic areas with the stated aims of promoting reading and a love of books, and accessing children who would not otherwise use library services. This study evaluated whether <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile libraries (CMLs) across the UK reach those aims and examined the methods by which the aims were targeted. It was decided that the most appropriate research method was to take an inductive perspective and qualitative approach forming a constructivist methodology. The evaluation was achieved by the use of grounded theory as a general method together with ethnographic techniques, in order to observe and understand the interactions of social actors, and identify the processes used to encourage reading. Interviews with key individuals were primarily held to gain access into the field and inform the scope of the research. Participant observations were conducted on 12 of the 26 <b>children</b> <b>s</b> libraries operating in the UK and further interviews with <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile library (CML) operators and CML service managers were also carried out. Extensive field notes were taken, then coded and analysed by the grounded theory method in order to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> and adults perceptions of the value of a CML to their lives. A model of the influences on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> reading was developed to understand the place of a CML in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> literacy. Existing published research was used initially to set the context of the study, and then as data throughout the project. Published and recognised theories about literacy development, learning, and well-being were consulted at relevant points during the research. Analytical reports of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> library services, practitioner handbooks and professional magazines were searched along with unpublished documents provided by library authorities. Issues that were raised from these sources included: the role of untrained library staff; supplying library services to the socially excluded; working with other agencies and the use of reading intervention schemes. The history, function, purpose and definition of CMLs were outlined. Five theories of event, reach, resource, process and well-being emerged from the data and examples of best practice were identified. The daily operation of a CML was modelled using those five theories to create a transferable standard against which to judge similar <b>children</b> <b>s</b> provision. It was found that <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile libraries promote reading because of their transient nature; through the relationships of children with the staff who work on the vehicles; {{by the nature of the}} learning environment and specialist stock of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile library, and because they access children who would otherwise not use any other library service...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{right to}} {{adequate}} food is protected in {{international human rights}} law, yet {{millions of people are}} suffering from malnutrition worldwide. Children and adolescents living in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes are considered a vulnerable group. Malnutrition in the girl child is of particular concern since it has intergenerational consequences. Little is known about the nutritional status of adolescent girls living in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City, Uganda. A cross-sectional study is an important first step to identify the main nutritional challenges in order to intervene appropriately. Aim: The main aim {{of the study was to}} assess the nutritional status of adolescent girls in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City, by evaluating anthropometric indicators, assessing body composition and investigating dietary patterns. Subjects and methods: A total of 44 girls aged 10 – 19 years living at five <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes participated in the study. A reference group consisted of 27 adolescent girls from three boarding schools in Kampala City. Height and weight were measured to assess the proportion of girls who were stunted, thin, overweight or obese. Body composition data was obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Dietary intake was evaluated with a Food Frequency Questionnaire, calculation of dietary diversity score (DDS) and a 24 -hour dietary recall. Results: Adolescent girls in selected <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City suffered from stunting, overweight or obesity, and were at risk of insufficient intakes of multiple micronutrients and essential fatty acids. Dietary diversity was low with a median score of 3 out of 9 food groups. Animal products were rarely consumed. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> home participants appeared especially at risk of inadequate intake of vitamins A, B 12, C, D, E and calcium. Median estimated intake of vitamins B 12 and D were zero. The adequacy of the diet in terms of energy, macronutrients and micronutrients varied among the different <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes, and within the various homes. At two of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes the girls consumed a more adequate diet compared to the reference group, whereas three homes consumed a less adequate diet compared to the reference group. Conclusion: Malnutrition was apparent among <b>children</b> <b>s</b> home participants, manifested as stunting, overweight or obesity.

40|$|Five {{spontaneous}} narratives from 10 12 -year-olds conversations are analysed to {{show how}} they contribute to the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> ongoing construction of knowledge and identity. A Labovian analysis of the evaluative function of narrative is supplemented with ethnographic research and Bakhtin and Volosinov s work, to demonstrate more dynamic and complex processes in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> talk.

The <b>children</b> <b>s</b> reproduction and framing of other people s and their own voices enables them to explore the different perspectives of characters within the story, and also to comment on and evaluate these perspectives. The stories are orientated towards listeners and previous conversational turns, and they also set up intertextual connections with other stories and other conversations, to create additional connotations and layers of meaning. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> narratives revisit particular themes and preoccupations, for example toughness and gentleness, their emerging new gendered identities and relationships, and their changing relations with parents and other authority figures.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis is to extend the knowledge and deepen the understanding of care-givers management of child allergy, especially of suspected food allergy. This is done by describing and exploring how parents with children who have exclusion diets at school discover and responds to their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> allergy-related problems. The first study focuses on the whole group of children (n 230) with special diets at school {{from the viewpoint of}} parents knowledge and management of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems. It addresses questions regarding (1) whether or not the children have had contact with health care, (2) {{whether or not they were}} diagnosed with food allergy, (3) to what extent they had other allergies, (4) what characterized their food-related symptoms, (5) if these symptoms were consistent with the clinical experience of food allergy (6) and any differences in parents reports of the extent of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food-related problems in regard to whether they had sought health care or not. The results showed that the majority of parents had consulted doctors for their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems, and most children had been diagnosed by a doctor. Most children also had other allergies or asthma in addition to their food-related problems. The <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food-related problems were consistent with the clinical experience of food allergy. Parents who had sought medical aid for their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems described more extensive and potentially life-threatening (e. g. anaphylactic) symptoms than did the parents who had not sought professional help. Overall, the characteristics of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> symptoms were similar in both groups and were considerable enough to explain why they avoided certain foods and had exclusion diets at school. The second study addresses the question of how parents discovered developing bodily symptoms when the children were young, how they interpreted and responded to the problems before they decided to seek professional medical help and how they came to the decision to seek help. Nineteen parents were interviewed about the problem-solving process consisting of two temporal phases: (1) the pre-problem phase, or the period before the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> problems had emerged, (2) and the emerging phase where bodily problems were discovered and managed differently depending on the emerging nature of the problem that were either (2. a) acute (airway problems) or (2. b) more gradually appearing (stomach problems and eczema) in the families everyday lives. To understand and manage the time period before the child was born, before he/she had developed any symptoms and the phase when the symptoms emerged, parents used different self-diagnostic techniques and methods. They experimented with different temporal and situational clues that eventually led them to explain their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> symptoms as indicating something wrong, and not as normal <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems, as they had first thought. Only when parents could not fully explain the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> symptoms or make the problems disappear or improve, did they often seek medical advice or care at the child health care centre. The wide-ranging knowledge and experience parents have of their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> allergies are a result of their active strategies and by reinforcing themselves as active and in control they also demonstrated their moral responsibility as parents. The fact that the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> whole lifetime and different temporal contexts are used by the parents in their decisions about seeking professional help, eating habits and exclusion diet at school is an important factor that has to be considered in clinical practice. Health care professionals have to listen to what parents have done before seeking medical help, who they are and how they want to be seen by others because this would improve the communication between parents and health professionals as well as the parents satisfaction with health care...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This PhD thesis explored the experiences of dependent children and children care-givers facing challenges with their parent s cancer. The aim was to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> information experience including their perception of cancer and information culture; information needs, information seeking behaviour, barriers and enablers. The research used a six-stage process. This was informed by an extensive literature review and discussions with cancer specialists, psychologists and researchers from United Kingdom, United States, Australia and Malaysia. This study used a three-cycle, eight-step process of Participative Action Research (PAR) with participation from ten Malay breast cancer patients and their dependent children. Three bilingual (English and Bahasa Malaysia) instruments were developed; 1) An Inquiry to Participate Form to select participants who had dependent children, 2) Three opened-ended questions to obtain <b>children</b> <b>s</b> cancer experience and information needs where drawing was used to encourage <b>children</b> <b>s</b> responses and, 3) A 15 -question questionnaire to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> experience and information preference. Cancer affected parenting abilities and challenging experiences identified the lack of culturally relevant information and the shift in caregiving responsibilities to dependent <b>children.</b> <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> understanding of cancer was influenced by their experiences and observations, many of which resulted in misconceptions about cancer, its causes, treatment and preventative measures. <b>Children</b> participant <b>s</b> reaction to a health situation triggered their information behaviour.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} set of {{longitudinal}} studies was to explore 3 - 7 -year-old <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> Spontaneous FOcusing on Numerosity (SFON) {{and its relation to}} early mathematical development. The specific goals were to capture in method and theory the distinct process by which children focus on numerosity as a part of their activities involving exact number recognition, and individual differences in this process that may be informative in the development of more complex number skills. Over the course of conducting the five studies, fifteen novel tasks were progressively developed for the SFON assessments. In the tasks, confounding effects of insufficient number recognition, verbal comprehension, other procedural skills as well as working memory capacity were aimed to be controlled. Furthermore, how <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> individual differences in SFON are related to their development of number sequence, subitizing-based enumeration, object counting and basic arithmetic skills was explored. The effect of social interaction on SFON was tested. Study I captured {{the first phase of the}} 3 -year longitudinal study with 39 children. It was investigated whether there were differences in 3 -year-old <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> tendency to focus on numerosity, and whether these differences were related to the <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> development of cardinality recognition skills from the age of 3 to 4 years. It was found that the two groups of children formed on the basis of their amount of SFON tendency at the age of 3 years differed in their development of recognising and producing small numbers. The children whose SFON tendency was very predominant developed faster in cardinality related skills from the age of 3 to 4 years than the children whose SFON tendency was not as predominant. Thus, <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> development in cardinality recognition skills is related to their SFON tendency. Studies II and III were conducted to investigate, firstly, <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> individual differences in SFON, and, secondly, whether <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> SFON is related to their counting development. Altogether nine tasks were designed for the assessments of spontaneous and guided focusing on numerosity. The longitudinal data of 39 children in Study II from the age of 3. 5 to 6 years showed individual differences in SFON at the ages of 4, 5 and 6 years, as well as stability in <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> SFON across tasks used at different ages. The counting skills were assessed at the ages of 3. 5, 5 and 6 years. Path analyses indicated a reciprocal tendency in the relationship between SFON and counting development. In Study III, these results on the individual differences in SFON tendency, the stability of SFON across different tasks and the relationship of SFON and mathematical skills were confirmed by a larger-scale cross-sectional study of 183 on average 6. 5 -year-old children (range 6; 0 - 7; 0 years). The significant amount of unique variance that SFON accounted for number sequence elaboration, object counting and basic arithmetic skills stayed statistically significant (partial correlations varying from. 27 to. 37) when the effects of non-verbal IQ and verbal comprehension were controlled. In addition, to confirm that the SFON tasks assess SFON tendency independently from enumeration skills, guided focusing tasks were used for children who had failed in SFON tasks. It was explored whether these children were able to proceed in similar tasks to SFON tasks once they were guided to focus on number. The results showed that these <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> poor performance in the SFON tasks was not caused by their deficiency in executing the tasks but on lacking focusing on numerosity. The longitudinal Study IV of 39 children aimed at increasing the knowledge of associations between <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> long-term SFON tendency, subitizing-based enumeration and verbal counting skills. Children were tested twice at the age of 4 - 5 years on their SFON, and once at the age of 5 on their subitizing-based enumeration, number sequence production, as well as on their skills for counting of objects. Results showed considerable stability in SFON tendency measured at different ages, and that there is a positive direct association between SFON and number sequence production. The association between SFON and object counting skills was significantly mediated by subitizing-based enumeration. These results indicate that the associations between the <b>child.</b> <b>s</b> SFON and sub-skills of verbal counting may differ on the basis of how significant a role understanding the cardinal meanings of number words plays in learning these skills. The specific goal of Study V was to investigate whether it is possible to enhance 3 -year old <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> SFON tendency, and thus start <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> deliberate practice in early mathematical skills. Participants were 3 -year-old children in Finnish day care. The SFON scores and cardinality-related skills of the experimental group of 17 children were compared to the corresponding results of the 17 children in the control group. The results show an experimental effect on SFON tendency and subsequent development in cardinality-related skills during the 6 -month period from pretest to delayed posttest in the children with some initial SFON tendency in the experimental group. Social interaction has an effect on <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> SFON tendency. The results of the five studies assert that within a <b>child.</b> <b>s</b> existing mathematical competence, it is possible to distinguish a separate process, which refers to the <b>child.</b> <b>s</b> tendency to spontaneously focus on numerosity. Moreover, there are significant individual differences in <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> SFON at the age of 3 - 7 years. Moderate stability was found in this tendency across different tasks assessed both at the same and at different ages. Furthermore, SFON tendency is related to the development of early mathematical skills. Educational implications of the findings emphasise, first, the importance of regarding focusing on numerosity as a separate, essential process in the assessments of young <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> mathematical skills. Second, the substantial individual differences in SFON tendency during the childhood years suggest that uncovering and modeling this kind of mathematically meaningful perceiving of the surroundings and tasks could be an efficient tool for promoting young <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> mathematical development, and thus prevent later failures in learning mathematical skills. It is proposed to consider focusing on numerosity as one potential sub-process of activities involving exact number recognition in future studies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores how I {{improved}} my portfolios assessment {{practices by}} making <b>children</b> <b>s</b> portfolios freely available to children, {{their parents and}} whānau in the early childhood care and education centre where I worked. As the teacher researcher I present an insider perspective, my world view on how I improved my pedagogical practices {{in order to gain}} a deeper understanding of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning, and my role in supporting <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning. This study has two components, a) the writer as the teacher researcher and, b) accessibility of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> portfolios and the involvement of children in the portfolio process. This study uses a qualitative research design, a mixed methodology of self-study action research and case study. Three theories, ecological, sociocultural, and Donald Schön s (1983) theory of learning and practice have informed and guided this research. This eclectic mix of theoretical frameworks provided me with some valuable insights on ways of examining and using portfolios with children, and understanding <b>children</b> <b>s</b> views on their portfolios. The findings in this study are particular to the centre where I worked and they may not be generalisable to other early childhood care and education centres. Nonetheless, my experiences highlight the potential importance of the process and issues that arise from making portfolios accessible. The findings revealed that my experiences of engaging in self-study action research promoted within the centre a community of learners, and an enquiry approach to teaching and learning. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} making portfolios freely available provides children with an understanding of the purpose, contents and ownership of their portfolios. When children frequently use and share their portfolios with peers and teachers it can promote critical self-reflection and self-assessment of their learning. Involving children in the portfolio process makes visible to children the value of their contributions to their learning. Overall, this study has significantly improved my pedagogical practices. It has enhanced teachers learning which has in turn, benefited the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning. Beyond that, making the portfolios accessible has strengthened parental understanding of their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> experiences at the centre...|$|R

40|$|Background: More than 14 {{percent of}} {{children}} in Uganda are orphaned, {{and many of them}} live in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes. Very little information exists regarding how these homes are operated and what the conditions in these homes are like. A baseline study conducted in forty <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes revealed however that diet was very limited, and residents were looking malnourished. Ugandan authorities have targeted adolescent girls as a priority group for nutrition interventions as safeguarding nutritional health before pregnancy can reduce the chance of passing on malnutrition to the offspring, and thus, future generations. By being State Party to relevant international and regional human rights instruments, Ugandan authorities have obligations under international human rights law to progressively realise the rights to adequate food, health and care (the underlying conditions for achieving good nutrition) for all Ugandan children, female adolescent <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes residents included. Objectives: Two objectives guided this study: 1) To examine female adolescent residents experiences, attitudes and views regarding: i) eating patterns and food, ii) health conditions; iii) care practices in the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> home they are living in. 2) On the basis of the findings under 1), to consider if the conditions in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes comply with human rights standards and principles for the rights to adequate food, health and care. Methodology: A human rights-based approach has guided the planning and conduct of this study, which also resulted in using focus group discussions as the method for data collection. Five <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala were selected for inclusion. At each home, two focus group discussions were held with girls aged 12 - 14 years, and girls aged 15 - 17, respectively. Issues discussed during the focused discussions included the ones under Objective 1. The focus group discussions were analysed through a phenomenological approach. The conditions of food, health and care, as experienced by female adolescent residents, were further compared with international standards for the realisation of the human rights to adequate food, health and care. Results: Results of Objective 1 demonstrated that food, health and care conditions varied greatly across the five <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala. Some residents consume only one meal per day, and have no access to clean drinking water, soap, toilet paper and sanitary napkins. Residents at one home explained how caretakers act discriminatory and mentally abuse them. This was in large contrast with conditions in two other homes where residents described great satisfaction with food and meal frequency, had a constant availability of basic necessities including clean drinking water, and where care is promoted through participatory activities where both residents and caretakers are equalised. Results of Objective 2 demonstrated that the full realisation of the right to adequate food is not met by the residents at three homes, the full realisation of the right to health is not met by the residents at two homes, and the realisation of the right to care is not met by the residents at one home. Conclusion: Human rights standards for food, health and care were not met in three of the selected <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes. The results from this study indicated that care in the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes was an important contributing factor for whether or not standards for the rights to adequate food and health were met. Ugandan authorities should put in all efforts possible to improve the conditions. As an immediate response, they can revise and enhance regulations for operation of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Uganda to include more specific provisions relevant for food, health and care...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedProfessional music {{organizations}} {{around the}} world strongly advocate the inclusion of world musics {{at all levels of}} instruction. Scholars and practitioners in the field recognize the profound benefits of a multicultural music education, and policies and practices on behalf of such education have been adopted in numerous countries. One of the greatest challenges teachers face in implementing a multicultural curriculum is finding good quality materials.; To evaluate {{the quantity and quality of}} the material from the Argentine musical culture available to music educators, the author elected to investigate a range of resources published by the International Society for Music Education, the American National Association for Music Education, and four popular American elementary music series textbooks (Share the Music, 1995, 2000; The Music Connection, 1995; Making Music, 2008). The results of this preliminary survey indicated very few examples of Argentine music in these publications, many of which were marred by flaws.; Taking into consideration the need for quality resources that would make it possible for teachers to include Argentine music in their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> choral programs, the purpose of this study was to provide arrangements of nine songs representative of the Argentine musical culture for the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> choir. In preparation towards achieving that goal, the following research areas were investigated: 1. Characteristics of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> choir sound; 2. Potential and limitations of the child voice; 3. Suitability for performance by the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> choir; 4. Criteria for the selection of choral compositions for the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> choir; 5. Recommendations by experts for arranging music for the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> choir; 6. Contemporary educational expectations and considerations for presenting and teaching world musics.; A review of the literature relevant to these questions was conducted, as well as an analysis of repertoire recommended by a number of experts in the field, for the beginning, intermediate, and advanced children's choirs. The results of the analysis and the recommendations from the reviewed literature guided the author in the arrangement of the songs, the preparation of accompanying cultural and musical information, and the production of an audio recording of the spoken pronunciation followed by a vocal demonstration of the songs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in understanding the role that lifestyle behaviors play in relation to children's weight status. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the association between <b>children</b> <b>s</b> BMI and dietary practices and maternal BMI. Methods 330 students (168 M) aged 8. 9 + 2 y from 4 suburban Buenos Aires elementary schools, and their mothers aged 36. 2 + 7 y were examined between April and September 2007. Mothers were asked about their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> lifestyle. Data included parental education levels socioeconomic status, mothers and <b>children</b> <b>s</b> BMI, and Tanner stage. Results All families were in the low socio-economic class. 79 % of parents had an elementary education or less. 61 (18. 5 %) of children were obese (OB) (BMI> 95 %ile per CDC norms), and 53 (16. 1 %) overweight (OW) (BMI> 85 30 kg/m 2), and 102 (30. 9 %) OW (BMI> 25 Conclusion Our results suggest that TV viewing, drinking sweet beverages, skipping breakfast, and maternal BMI are important predictive variables for childhood OW/OB. </p...|$|R

The work with colours, lines, form and predefined images builds combining talents, develops the aesthetic taste and stimulates the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> thinking and imagination. Which colours and shapes are most often used by children? To answer this question we provide the following experiment. We create an environment in Logo to calculate the colours, drawing tools and predefined figures used by children. The experiment was done on children grade 3 rd to 6 th from one and the same school and lasted for 5 months. In our calculations we also took into account the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> age and sex.

Similar to the discussed Logo environment, other environments could be developed by Logo teachers to investigate other aspects of <b>child</b> <b>s</b> behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Theory of Mind (ToM) {{research}} demonstrated 3 - to 4 -year old {{children to}} show false belief (FB) understanding in forced-choice or anticipatory looking behavior. While anticipation is claimed to reflect implicit ToM knowledge which develops early {{and is not}} consciously accessible, <b>children</b> <b>s</b> forced choice behavior is believed to represent explicit ToM which allows for conscious access and is seems {{to be associated with}} linguistic competence. The present thesis tested the association of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> implicit and explicit ToM in a three-response options FB task, an informant parental questionnaire, and the relation to linguistic competence (224 children, 2 - 6 years). Data analysis revealed FB task complexity to affect anticipatory looking behavior and forced-choice responses. Differential effects due to choice of coding method highlight the sensitivity issues. Older <b>children</b> <b>s</b> FB forced choice performance was associated with language measures, while youngest children seemed to be capable to apply implicit ToM reasoning strategies. Findings of the present thesis led to the formulation of an integrative dual process model of ToM development and reasoning...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Children are a unique and highly diverse group of people within society. However, engaging with <b>children</b> <b>s</b> voices has only recently become prominent in academic and international discourses. This thesis contributes to this engagement with <b>children</b> <b>s</b> voices by focusing on their experiences as shaped by oil extraction activities in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. While there is a vast body of literature on the implications of oil exploration activities in the region, {{little attention has been}} paid to children's lives. To counterbalance this tendency, this study aims to explore children's perceptions, experiences, and coping strategies in relation to the challenging circumstances of oil exploration operations in their communities. Adopting a critical perspective that views children as social actors with basic rights, this study also examines children's access to basic needs within the context of these oil industry operations. This research has used a quantitative and multi-qualitative methodological approach to data collection. Although <b>children</b> <b>s</b> voices are the study's focal point, the perceptions of adult stakeholders such as parents/carers, community leaders and oil company representatives were also used to explore <b>children</b> <b>s</b> lives and synthesize the discussions in the study. The results reveal that, while the Nigerian government has adopted the vocabulary enshrined in the UNCRC to enhance <b>children</b> <b>s</b> access to basic rights, in reality, the actions of the federal government and oil companies appear to be inconsistent with the fundamental principles of children's rights. Specifically, findings reveal that the adverse impacts of oil extraction activities have severely hampered <b>children</b> <b>s</b> lives and that, as a result, children have adopted harmful coping strategies. Additionally, by presenting the voices of children and adults separately, results show that children's views differed significantly from adult's perceptions on matters concerning children. The findings of this study relate the research to some of the key debates in children's geographies about children and childhood, especially within the context of the global South. This thesis argues that children are an integral part of society and that any meaningful strategy for development in the Niger Delta region must take into account their roles as social actors. Moreover, it must fully acknowledge the specific impacts that oil exploration activities have had on the lives of children in the communities affected and examine how these might be addressed...|$|R
