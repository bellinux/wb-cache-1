5|$|Emanuel's mayoral {{campaign}} was {{the inspiration for}} a satirical Twitter account called MayorEmanuel, which received over 43,000 followers, more popular than Emanuel's actual Twitter account. Emanuel announced on February 28 that if the author would reveal himself, he would donate $5,000 to the charity of the author's <b>choice.</b> <b>When</b> Chicago journalist Dan Sinker revealed himself, Emanuel donated the money to Young Chicago Authors, a community organization which helps young people with writing and publishing skills.|$|E
5|$|Given that Gadge is {{revealed}} {{to actually be}} a witch, Howick asked Shearsmith whether the former's character, Thomas, truly had witnessed Gadge engaging {{in some kind of}} supernatural activity. Shearsmith suggested that Thomas was motivated by greed. However, he begins to regret his <b>choice</b> <b>when</b> he witnesses Gadge being tortured. Pemberton, though, noted that the real-life accusations of witchcraft must have been based on some level of belief.|$|E
5|$|At {{work one}} day, Esquire meets John Garnett (Keith David), a millionaire {{who heads a}} {{successful}} business venture called the United Express. The two quickly become friends, with Garnett's admiration for Esquire's ambition and Esquire's respect for Garnett's success driving the relationship. Esquire sees an opportunity to obtain the letter of recommendation that would bring about his acceptance to his primary college <b>choice.</b> <b>When</b> Esquire goes to Garnett's house {{to pick up the}} letter, he meets his daughter Erin, who, to his surprise, turns out to be New-New, whose real name is Erin. Erin says that she will reveal where Esquire is really from (something he lied to her father about) if he tells Rashad about her.|$|E

40|$|What are the {{differences}} in exerting self-control in sequential <b>choices</b> <b>when</b> consumers choose for others (family or friends) rather than for themselves? Sequential choices represent an opportunity to manage the pursuit of one's multiple personal goals. Consumers typically manage these personal goals by combining indulgent and virtuous <b>choices.</b> <b>When</b> choosing for others, however, {{this is not the}} case. Consumers then focus on a pleasure-seeking goal, which leads to indulgent choices for others. Six experiments demonstrate this phenomenon and uncover conditions that encourage more virtuous choices for others. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc [...] ...|$|R
5|$|Foliot was Becket's rival for the Archbishopric of Canterbury. He {{objected to}} the king's choice {{on the grounds that}} Becket was too worldly, the only bishop or magnate known to have opposed the king's <b>choice.</b> <b>When</b> the newly elected {{archbishop}} was presented to the court before his consecration, Foliot remarked that the king had performed a miracle by turning a layman and a knight into an archbishop. Soon after Becket's consecration the king wrote to the pope asking for permission to make Foliot the royal confessor. This may have been a conciliatory move to appease Foliot after the loss of Canterbury, or it may have been that the king and the new archbishop were already having differences of opinion and the king wished Foliot to be a counter-weight to Becket's influence.|$|E
5|$|In May 1162, Hilary {{was part}} of the {{deputation}} sent to the monks of Christ Church Priory by King Henry II to secure the election of Thomas Becket as the next Archbishop of Canterbury. When Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of Hereford, objected to Becket's candidacy, Hilary took the position that the king desired the election, so the bishops and electors should elect the king's <b>choice.</b> <b>When</b> it was suggested that a monk should hold Canterbury, as had been the custom previously, Hilary asked if the questioners thought that only one way of life was satisfactory to God.|$|E
5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one <b>choice</b> <b>when</b> recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult judgment call where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|E

5|$|The {{first wave}} of forced {{conversions}} in the Crown of Aragon happened during the Revolt of the Brotherhoods. Rebellion bearing an anti-Muslim sentiment broke out among the Christian subjects of Valencia in the early 1520s, and those active in it forced Muslims to become Christians in the territories they controlled. Muslims joined the Crown in suppressing the rebellion, playing crucial roles in several battles. After the rebellion was suppressed, the Muslims regarded the conversions forced by the rebels as invalid and returned to their faith. Subsequently, King Charles I (also known as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) started an investigation to determine {{the validity of the}} conversions. The commission tasked with this investigation started working in November 1524. Charles ultimately upheld the conversions, putting the forcibly converted subjects under the authority of the Inquisition. Supporters of this decision argued that the Muslims had a <b>choice</b> <b>when</b> confronted by the rebels: they could have chosen to refuse and die, but did not, indicating that the conversions happened out of free will and must remain in effect.|$|E

However, the AMHS is often the mode of transportation of <b>choice</b> <b>when</b> the schedule proves convenient because of its much cheaper cost.|$|E
25|$|The book, co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 {{article and}} Weaver's popularization of it, which is {{accessible}} to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of <b>choice</b> <b>when</b> one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two major}} SPI flash types. The first type is {{characterized}} by small pages and one or more internal SRAM page buffers allowing a complete page to be read to the buffer, partially modified, and then written back (for example, the Atmel AT45 DataFlash or the Micron Technology Page Erase NORFlash). The second type has larger sectors. The smallest sectors typically found in an SPI flash are 4kB, {{but they can be}} as large as 64kB. Since the SPI flash lacks an internal SRAM buffer, the complete page must be read out and modified before being written back, making it slow to manage. SPI flash is cheaper than DataFlash and is therefore a good <b>choice</b> <b>when</b> the application is code shadowing.|$|E

Shakespeare may later have disapproved of this <b>choice</b> <b>when</b> {{it was discovered that}} Quiney had made another girl pregnant; also, Quiney had failed to obtain a special wedding licence needed during Lent, leading to Judith and Thomas being excommunicated on 12 March. Soon afterwards, on 25 March 1616, Shakespeare modified his will for Judith to inherit £300 in her own name, leaving Quiney out of the will and giving most of his property to Susanna and her husband.|$|E
25|$|Gödel {{very quickly}} resumed his {{mathematical}} work. In 1940, he published his work Consistency of the {{axiom of choice}} and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory, which is a classic of modern mathematics. In that work he introduced the constructible universe, a model of set theory in which the only sets that exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets. Gödel showed that both the axiom of choice (AC) and the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) are true in the constructible universe, and therefore must {{be consistent with the}} Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory (ZF). This result has had considerable consequences for working mathematicians, as it means that they can assume the axiom of <b>choice</b> <b>when</b> proving the Hahn–Banach theorem. Paul Cohen later constructed a model of ZF in which AC and GCH are false; together these proofs mean that AC and GCH are independent of the ZF axioms for set theory.|$|E

25|$|The Nets {{were founded}} as WTT's charter {{franchise}} for Cincinnati, Ohio in 1973, by Bill DeWitt, Jr. and Brian Heekin. Within weeks of being established, {{and before the}} team ever had a name in Cincinnati, DeWitt and Heekin sold it to Cleveland radio executive Joseph Zingale who paid them the same $50,000 as the franchise fee they had paid to WTT. Zingale relocated the team to Cleveland {{with a plan to}} have it play its home matches at the Cleveland Public Hall starting with the league's inaugural 1974 season and name it the Cleveland Nets. Before the draft, Zingale spoke to Clark Graebner, a native of Cleveland, about playing for the team as well as to being its coach and general manager. Graebner insisted his wife, Carole, had to be drafted by the team as well. The Nets selected them both as a pair in the fourth round of the draft. No other WTT team objected to the Nets selecting two players with one draft <b>choice.</b> <b>When</b> Clark and Carole Graebner separated, Clark traded Carole to the Pittsburgh Triangles. The couple never divorced, and Carole Graebner died in 2008. Peaches Bartkowicz was a key women's doubles player for the 1974 Nets but quit the team during the season. Through all the drama, the Nets finished with 21 wins and 23 losses, third in the Atlantic Section and snuck into the playoffs.|$|E
