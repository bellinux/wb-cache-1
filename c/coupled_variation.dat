Only one class I molecule in the chicken MHC is highly expressed, leading to strong genetic associations with infectious pathogens. Here, we report two structures of the MHC class I molecule BF 2 * 2101 from the B 21 haplotype, which is known to confer resistance to Marek's disease caused by an oncogenic herpesvirus. The binding groove has an unusually large central cavity, which confers substantial conformational flexibility to the crucial residue Arg 9, allowing remodeling of key peptide-binding sites. The <b>coupled</b> <b>variation</b> of anchor residues from the peptide, utilizing a charge-transfer system unprecedented in MHC molecules, allows peptides with conspicuously different sequences to be bound. This promiscuous binding extends our understanding of ways in which MHC class I molecules can present peptides to the immune system and might explain the resistance of the B 21 haplotype to Marek's disease...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Fixed coupled {{ventricular}} premature depolarizations (VPDs) {{are usually}} considered reentrant; recent experimental models {{have demonstrated that}} parasystolic rhythms may also appear in fixed coupled patterns. To analyze the mechanisms of fixed coupled VPDs, 60 exercise tests were chosen to evaluate the response of VPD coupling intervals to changes in cycle length of the dominant supraventricular rhythm. Selec-tion criteria included the presence of frequent, unifocal VPDs that were fixed <b>coupled</b> (<b>variation</b> 0. 9) of coupling intervals to cycle length; 2) 16 patients with coupling intervals fixed, independent of cycle length; and 3) 12 patients with no consistent relation {{over a wide range}} of cycle lengths. Two patients in group 2 and four in group 3 fulfilled criteria for parasystole with interectopic intervals that remained constant at different cycle lengths. These results suggest that VPDs in group I are reentrant, while some patients with group 2 or 3 responses have evidence for parasystolic rhythms. We conclude that 1) fixed coupling of VPDs is not diagnostic of reentry, and 2) changes in cycle length induced with exercise may be useful in the analysis of mechanisms of VPDs.

We employed diverse biogeochemical techniques on a highresolution sediment record from a subarctic lake in northern Finland (70 °N) to examine the direction, magnitude and mechanism of change in aquatic carbon pools prior to and under the anthropogenic warming. <b>Coupled</b> <b>variation</b> in the elemental and isotopic composition of the sediment and a proxybased summer air temperature reconstruction tracked changes in aquatic production, depicting a decline during a cool climate interval between ~ 1700 – 1900 C.

OC accumulation rates displayed similar coeval variation with temperature, mirroring both changes in aquatic production and terrestrial carbon export. Increase in sediment organic content over the 20 th century together with high inferred aquatic UV exposure imply that the 20 th century increase in OC accumulation is primarily connected to elevated lake production rather than terrestrial inputs.

40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests of}} propulsion-integrated {{aircraft}} models have identified inlet flow distortion {{as a major}} source of compressor airflow measurement error in turbine-powered propulsion simulators. Consequently, two Compact Multimission Aircraft Propulsion Simulator (CMAPS) units were statically tested at sea level ambient conditions to establish simulator operating performance characteristics and to calibrate the compressor airflow against an accurate bellmouth flowmeter in the presence of inlet flow distortions. The distortions were generated using various-shaped wire mesh screens placed upstream of the compressor. CMAPS operating maps and performance envelopes were obtained for inlet total pressure distortions (ratio of the difference between the maximum and minimum total pressures to the average total pressure) up to 35 percent, and were compared to baseline simulator operating characteristics for a uniform inlet. Deviations from CMAPS baseline performance were attributed to the <b>coupled</b> <b>variation</b> of both compressor inlet-flow distortion and Reynolds number index throughout the simulator operating envelope for each screen configuration. Four independent methods were used to determine CMAPS compressor airflow; direct compressor inlet and discharge measurements, an entering/exiting flow-balance relationships, and a correlation between the mixer pressure and the corrected compressor airflow. Of the four methods, the last yielded the least scatter in the compressor flow coefficient, approximately + or - 3 percent over the range of flow distortions...|$|E

40|$|Many factors {{influence}} the seasonal changes in δC levels in coral skeletons; consequently, the climatic and environmental significance of such changes is complicated and controversial. However, {{it is widely}} accepted that the secular declining trend of coral δC over the past 200 years reflects {{the changes in the}} additional flux of anthropogenic CO from the atmosphere into the surface oceans. Even so, the centennial-scale variations, and their significance, of coral δC before the Industrial Revolution remain unclear. Based on an annually resolved coral δC record from the northern South China Sea, the centennial-scale variations of coral δC over the past millennium were studied. The coral δC and total solar irradiance (TSI) have a significant positive Pearson correlation and <b>coupled</b> <b>variation</b> during the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, when natural forcing controlled the climate and environment. This covariation suggests that TSI controls coral δC by affecting the photosynthetic activity of the endosymbiotic zooxanthellae over centennial timescales. However, there was a decoupling of the coral skeletal δC and TSI during the Current Warm Period, the period in which the climate and environment became linked to anthropogenic factors. Instead, coral δC levels have a significant Pearson correlation with both the atmospheric CO concentration and δC levels in atmospheric CO. The correlation between coral δC and atmospheric CO suggests that the oceanic C Suess effect, caused by the addition of increasing amounts of anthropogenic CO to the surface ocean, has led to the decoupling of coral δC and TSI at the centennial scale...|$|E
40|$|The {{riparian}} zone is a narrow corridor where hillslopes (and their associated hydrobiogeochemical processes) interface with the river system. As such, the {{riparian zone}} {{serves as the}} last piece of landscape with which water interacts as it transitions from being water flowing primarily through the landscape (i. e., shallow groundwater) to water flowing primarily on the landscape (i. e., stream water). This study investigates the spatiotemporal variability in riparian-zone soil water total organic carbon (TOC) and its relation to the shallow groundwater table using observations from the recently instrumented riparian observatory in the Krycklan catchment study area located in boreal northern Sweden. In general, there is a decrease in TOC concentration with depth down through the soil profile. The rate of this decrease was variable among the six monthly samplings used in this study. The spatial variability of soil water TOC in the riparian zone was connected to the spatial variability of the shallow groundwater levels. This demonstrated the importance of the temporal variation of flow pathways and the mixing of waters from different sources of TOC moving into and through the riparian zone. The <b>coupled</b> <b>variation</b> of the hydrologic and biogeochemical systems raised questions about the ability of simple lumped approaches to accurately predict how in-stream TOC concentrations will change with climate and/or land use.

40|$|The Early Mississippian K–O (Kinderhookian-Osagean) δ 13 C {{excursion}} or TICE (mid-Tournaisian carbon isotope excursion) {{is characterized}} by an anomalous carbonate carbon isotope value of ≥ 5 ‰ that has been documented from numerous stratigraphic sections across the globe. This δ 13 C excursion coincides with global cooling and sea-level fall and predicts {{a significant change in}} seawater chemistry. However, sulfate sulfur isotope data across the K-O δ 13 C excursion reported in previous studies seem not to be responsive to the carbon cycle. Likewise, a recent study has documented a unidirectional increase in nitrogen isotopes across this excursion, which is not anticipated considering the amount of organic carbon burial required to form the prominent positive δ 13 C excursion and its resultant oxygen increase and global cooling. This study aims to understand the coupling between carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen cycles at this critical transition. This research uses Early Mississippian carbonate successions from Star Range (SR), Mountain Home Range (MH), and Pahranagat Range (PR) that indicate peritidal, shallow subidal to deep subtidal depositional environment in the Great Basin of western USA. Samples from these sections are analyzed for carbon isotopes (δ 13 C), sulfur isotopes (δ 34 S), nitrogen isotopes (δ 15 N) and oxygen isotopes (δ 18 O). Additionally, SR samples are analyzed for fluid inclusions, REEs, major and trace element concentrations. Stratigraphic records from PR and MH sections indicate that the outer shelf section (PR) may be more representative of seawater isotope record. The δ 34 SCAS records a ≥ 7 ‰ positive anomaly near the peak of the K-O δ 13 C excursion. Numerical modeling suggests that pyrite burial rates 5 – 10 times higher than that of the modern ocean are required to produce the observed δ 34 SCAS anomaly in a sulfate-rich Early Mississippian ocean. The aerial and volumetric expansion of sulfate reduction and pyrite burial was likely fused by abundantly available organic matter {{at the peak of the}} K-O δ 13 C excursion when oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the ocean has substantially expanded. At the falling limb of the K-O δ 13 C excursion, coupled negative shifts in δ 34 SCAS and δ 18 OCAS imply increase of sulfide reoxidation in the ocean and pyrite-derived riverine sulfate input, in response to global cooling, sea-level fall, and oxygenation resulted from enhanced organic carbon and pyrite burial, resulting in gradually decreasing the volume of OMZ. Such a change in ocean redox is reflected in the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Stratigraphic records indicate that the deeper-water outer shelf section (PR) show double spikes in both δ 13 Ccarb and δ 13 Corg with a magnitude up to 7 ‰ and a negative shift down to 4 ‰ between the peaks which is more representative of the seawater isotope record. However, considering the sensitivity of δ 15 N to redox conditions of depositional environments, the coupled δ 13 Ccarb – δ 15 N pattern from the MH section may better record the isotope signature of the oceanic nitrate (NO 3 –) reservoir, while the decoupled δ 13 Ccarb – δ 15 N in the PR section reflects involvement of local N-biochemical cycling in periodically developed suboxic-euxinic environments. The increase of δ 15 N toward the peak of the K-O δ 13 C excursion may record the expansion of oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the ocean that promotes water-column denitrification and 15 N enrichment in the marine nitrate (NO 3 –) reservoir. The decrease of δ 15 N at the falling limb of the K-O δ 13 C excursion reflects the shrink of the OMZ and reduces the water-column denitrification in response to more oxygenated and cooler oceans resulting from enhanced organic carbon burial. The significant amount of organic carbon burial during Early Mississippian results global cooling and possibly glaciation which is partly supported by the presence of highly depleted δ 18 O values, down to – 34 ‰, in SR samples. Block samples from SR and PR are studied for carbon and oxygen isotopes, fluid inclusion, REEs, major and trace elements to investigate the origin and processes involved during carbonate diagenesis. These geochemical data suggest that the carbonate diagenesis took place from a diagenetic fluid originated form freshwater. Importantly, SR samples are from close to or below the unconformity surfaces which may have been altered by glacial melt water with δ 18 O values of ≤ – 15 ‰. Then, it could have been further modified by a burial diagenesis with geothermal temperature 3 ̆c 200 °C to produce the highly depleted δ 18 O values down to – 34 ‰.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} the <b>coupled</b> <b>variations</b> of fundamental constants on the nucleon magnetic moment. The nucleon g-factor enters into the interpretation of the measurements of variations in the fine-structure constant, alpha, in both the laboratory (through atomic clock measurements) and in astrophysical systems (e. g. through measurements of the 21 cm transitions). A null result can be translated into a limit on the variation of a set of fundamental constants, that is usually reduced to alpha. However, in specific models, particularly unification models, changes in alpha are always accompanied by corresponding changes in other fundamental quantities such as the QCD scale, Lambda_QCD. This work tracks the changes in the nucleon g-factors induced from changes in Lambda_QCD and the light quark masses. In principle, these <b>coupled</b> <b>variations</b> can improve the bounds on the variation of alpha by an order of magnitude from existing atomic clock and astrophysical measurements.
