40|$|A {{biological}} {{model of}} elementary particles with many resemblances with DNA. More precisely, with a circular supercoiled DNA, or as supercoiled rods. The model is isomorphic with the quark model. It justifies all the elementary particles, and only these. A particle is a closed wire, a single strand, a helix. Quarks are twisted pieces of this helix, having its own charge Q, but also isospin projection I 3 and hypercharge Y. I put charge Q, isospin projection I 3 and hypercharge Y in {{one-to-one correspondence with}} a physical model, in which each quark, each piece of helix, has its own Linking number Lk, Twist Tw and Writhe Wr. As a consequence, any elementary particle is modelled by a closed wire, with its own internal Twist, Writhe Wr and Linking number (charge). For any <b>closed</b> <b>cord</b> Lk is invariant, so the alteration of the Twist will absorbed as Writhe and viceversa. Each couple Tw / Wr corresponds to different conformation.

The spire is elevate, later whorls becoming subscalar. The colour is a uniform dull brick-red, except a brilliant cadmium-orange ring round the aperture. The sculpture : the earlier whorls are strongly radiately plicate below the sutures. The periphery is armed with short, broad, downwardly directed spines becoming obsolete towards the aperture. On the penultimate whorl they number sixteen. <b>Close</b> spiral <b>cords</b> densely beset with imbricating scales cover {{the surface of the}} shell. Above there are ten cords carrying more distant hooded scales obliquely connected with those above and below. On the base there are also ten cords with more crowded scales. The base of the shell is flattened. The aperture is very oblique, subcircular, within and upon the columella pearly. A narrow inner margin to the lip continuous with an axial callus pad is bright cadmium-orange. The operculum is pale orange, oblong. Its nucleus is subterminal, hollow medially between two ribs, one of which rises proximally into a heavy callus mound.|$|R

40|$|Study design: Cross-sectional study. Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{importance}} of proprioceptive and vision information on different types of wheelchair seats with regard to postural control in paraplegic individuals during static posture. Setting: Centre of Rehabilitation at the University Hospital/FMRP-USP and Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic at University Hospital/UNICAMP, Brazil. Methods: This study involved 11 individuals with paraplegia. All individuals were submitted to an evaluation of static balance with their eyes open and closed in three different types of seats: wheelchair seat, foam seat and gel seat. Balance evaluation was performed by using the Polhemus system, in which body displacements and anteroposterior and mediolateral speeds were assessed in a static seated position in {{the different types of}} seats. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. The differences were considered at P 0. 05). However, it was observed that body displacements were more prominent toward an anteroposterior than a mediolateral direction. Conclusion: This study suggests that individuals with paraplegia tend to exhibit a more anteroposterior body displacement than a mediolateral one, with {{no significant differences between the}} types of seats in both situations of eyes open and <b>closed.</b> Spinal <b>Cord</b> (2010) 48, 825 - 827; doi: 10. 1038 /sc. 2010. 30; published online 30 March 201...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} ways to produce murmured sounds such as [...] One is to hold the vocal cords apart, so that they are lax as they are for , but to {{increase}} the volume of airflow so that they vibrate loosely. A second is to bring the vocal <b>cords</b> <b>closer</b> together along their entire length than in voiceless , but not as close as in modally voiced sounds such as vowels. This results in an airflow intermediate between [...] and vowels, and is the case with English intervocalic /h/. A third is to constrict the glottis, but separate the arytenoid cartilages that control one end. This results in the vocal cords being drawn together for voicing in the back, but separated to allow the passage of large volumes of air in the front. This is the situation with Hindi.|$|R

40|$|Sensory {{changes and}} lower limb {{reflexes}} {{were observed in}} 35 patients receiving segmental epidural analgesia in the mid-thoracic region. Sensory blockade was con-fined to the thoracic and upper lumbar segments. The lower limb reflexes changed to an "upper motor neurone " pattern, with the onset and development of segmental blockade. The sequence of changes observed was hypertonic tendon reflexes, then the onset of ankle clonus, and finally the plantar response changed to a positive Babinski sign. With regression of analgesia the reflexes returned to normal in the reverse order. The significance of these findings is discussed {{in relation to the}} anatomy of descend-ing spinal pathways, and to the pattern of penetration of local anaesthetics into the substance of the spinal cord.

50|$|To cast on, the yarn is {{put through}} the hole in the lucet from the front, and the yarn in front of the lucet is wound around the prongs twice in a figure-of-eight. The two lower loops are then lifted over the two upper loops using either the fingers or a stick until they come over the horns, and the thread behind the lucet is pulled to tighten the knot. The process is then repeated, but this time only winding the yarn once around the prongs, as there is already a figure-of-eight on the fork. When the desired length is reached, the lucet can be cast off by {{carefully}} lifting the loops off the prongs, passing the remaining thread through them and pulling the knot tight.

40|$|Locomotor {{training}} {{on a treadmill}} is a therapeutic strategy used for several years in human paraplegics in whom it was shown to improve functional recovery mainly after incomplete spinal cord lesions. The precise mechanisms underlying its effects are not known. Experimental studies in adult animals were chiefly performed after complete spinal transections. The objective of this experiment {{was to assess the}} effects of early treadmill {{training on}} recovery of spontaneous walking capacity after a partial spinal cord lesion in adult rats. Following a compression-injury by a subdurally inflated microballoon, seven rats were trained daily on a treadmill with a body weight support system, whereas six other animals were used as controls and only handled. Spontaneous walking ability in an open field was compared weekly between both groups by two blinded observers, using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale. Mean BBB score during 12 weeks was globally significantly greater in the treadmill-trained animals than in the control group, the benefit of training appearing as early as the 2 nd week. At week 7, locomotor recovery reached a plateau in both animal groups, but remained superior in trained rats. Daily treadmill training started early after a partial spinal cord lesion in adult rats, which accelerates recovery of locomotion and produces a long-term benefit. These findings in an animal model mimicking the <b>closed</b> spinal <b>cord</b> injury occurring in most human paraplegics are useful for future studies of optimal locomotor training programs, their neurobiologic mechanisms, and their combination with other treatment strategies.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{fields are}} able to promote axonal {{regeneration}} in vitro and in vivo. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used routinely in neuropsychiatric conditions and as an atraumatic method to activate descending motor pathways. After spinal cord injury, these pathways are disconnected from the spinal locomotor generator, resulting {{in most of the}} functional deficit. We have applied daily 10 Hz rTMS for 8 weeks immediately after an incomplete high (T 4 - 5; n = 5) or low (T 10 - 11; n = 6) thoracic <b>closed</b> spinal <b>cord</b> compression -injury in adult rats, using 6 high- and 6 low-lesioned non-stimulated animals as controls. Functional recovery of hindlimbs was assessed using the BBB locomotor rating scale. In the control group, the BBB score was significantly better from the 7 th week post-injury in animals lesioned at T 4 - 5 compared to those lesioned at T 10 - 11. rTMS significantly improved locomotor recovery in T 10 - 11 -injured rats, but not in rats with a high thoracic injury. In rTMS-treated rats, there was significant positive correlation between final BBB score and grey matter density of serotonergic fibres in the spinal segment just caudal to the lesion. We propose that low thoracic lesions produce a greater functional deficit because they interfere with the locomotor centre and that rTMS is beneficial in such lesions because it activates this central pattern generator, presumably via descending serotonin pathways. The benefits of rTMS shown here suggest strongly that this non-invasive intervention strategy merits consideration for clinical trials in human paraplegics with low spinal cord lesions.

40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 51 - 72. Chapter 1. Introduction [...] Chapter 2. Methods [...] Chapter 3. Results [...] Chapter 4. Discussion. The {{activation}} of the SLN produces a strong inhibitory response to stop central breathing (apnoea). The neuronal mechanism underlying this apnoeic response, however, remains unknown. A characteristic, non-respiratory burst activity in the expiratory laryngeal motoneurons plays {{a critical role in}} producing the apnoeic response. The potential burst-relaying neurons were predicted in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), with simultaneous projections to the Botzinger complex (BotC) to stop central breathing and to the laryngeal motoneurons in the caudal nucleus ambiguus (NA) to <b>close</b> vocal <b>cords.</b> The aim of this project was to provide anatomical evidence to support the existence of such dual-projecting neurons in the NTS. Experiments were performed on 25 anaesthetised Sprague Dawley rats. Four to five days after microinjection of the fluorescent conjugates of cholera toxin B into BotC and unconjugated CTB into the caudal NA, the rats were perfused transcardially with 4 % paraformaldehyde. Unconjugated CTB visualized using Goat anti CTB tagged to Alexa-fluor 488 using immunohistochemistry protocol and sections were visualized on Ziess fluorescence microscope. Retrograde labelled neurons in the NTS projecting to BotC and NA were found in the caudal NTS. A small number of double labelled neurons with simultaneous projections to BotC and NA were found ~ 360 um rostral to ~ 360 um caudal to the obex mainly in interstitial and ventrolateral NTS. The study provided anatomical evidences for dual projecting neurons involved in production of apnoeic response and vocal cords adduction.
