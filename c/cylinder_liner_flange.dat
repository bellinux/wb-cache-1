40|$|Previous work {{of authors}} {{indicated}} the wear of <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> in marine engines of RNLI lifeboats {{due to the}} intense lubricant degradation identified by inductively coupled plasma and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy techniques. In this paper, further analysis carried out to evaluate the effects of lubricant degradation on the actual <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> installed in the Trent Class Lifeboat engines is presented. Surface characterisation of actual <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner’s</b> bore surface showed maximum wear near the top dead centre region compared to rest of the piston stroke. Wear in this region of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> surface is controlled primarily by the protective film forming anti-wear additives in the lubricant which limit the direct surface contact between the piston rings and <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner.</b> The condition of zinc dialkyldithiophosphates anti-wear additives was analysed using the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Tribology analysis was conducted to evaluate the tribological and boundary film forming performance of zinc dialkyldithiophosphates additives by simulating cylinder liner–piston ring contact near the top dead centre. To further understand the wear mechanisms of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner,</b> wear debris analysis (Analytical Ferrography) of lubricant samples was performed. Results revealed the depletion of phosphorus containing zinc dialkyldithiophosphates anti-wear additives {{as a function of}} the lubricant’s duty cycle within the marine engines and its effect on the tribological and boundary film forming performance of lubricants. Wear debris analysis showed the generation of ferrous debris potentially from the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> as a result of reduced anti-wear protection from the depleted zinc dialkyldithiophosphates additives during the tribological contact with piston rings and piston skirt region. These findings are useful to understand the lubricant degradation mechanisms which affect the functionality of <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners,</b> therefore allowing to plan the engine maintenance strategies...|$|R

The specimens of oil ring were rubbed against cast iron engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> under boundary lubrication conditions. The ring and liner surfaces were examined by optical, scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy. The elemental analysis of surfaces was performed by using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Surface observations showed that coating was removed from the ring surface.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{simulations}} {{already exist}} {{to model the}} piston ring–cylinder liner contact; however, very few models {{have been used to}} investigate the optimum surface texture. An axi-symmetric, time-dependent two-dimensional semi-deterministic texture-roughness model of the piston ring to <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> contact with periodic boundary conditions and mass preserving global cavitation has been developed. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> texture, generated by honing, was con-sidered deterministically on the global scale, after an investigation comparing deterministic and homogenized solutions. The surface texture of a real <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> was measured with white light interferometry and an algorithm developed to generate an artificial periodic texture representative of the real sur-face. The effect of <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> plateau roughness has been incorporated on the local scale by homogenization of the Reynolds equation and calculation of flow factors from real surface topog-raphy. Using the homogenization technique to incorporate the effect of surface roughness leads to a more efficient solution than mesh refinement of the deterministic problem as the roughness {{does not need to be}} resolved on the global solution domain, allowing for significantly less degrees of freedom in the global problem. The lubricant boundary pressures have been calculated using results from a numerical ring-pack model and the lubricant viscosity has been adjusted based on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> wall temperature. It was found from the result of a comparison between deterministic and homogenized solutions that surface texture should be modelled on the global and not on the averaged roughness scale as is the case with many previous investigations...|$|R
