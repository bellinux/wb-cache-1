5|$|The Colliers Way (NCR24) {{national}} cycle route passes landmarks {{associated with}} the coalfield, and other roads and footpaths follow tramways developed during the coal mining years. The <b>cycleway</b> runs from Dundas Aqueduct to Frome via Radstock, and is intended to provide part of a continuous cycle route to Southampton and Portsmouth.|$|E
5000|$|Bremen, Germany has near-perfect {{surfaces}} on its footways, <b>cycleways,</b> and streets, {{with virtually}} no visible repairs or disturbances. This is achieved by an absence of vehicles on footways or <b>cycleways,</b> and utility ducts that make it is unnecessary to disturb the surfaces in order to access the networks. Utility networks are housed in a cluster of pipes which are located under footways and <b>cycleways.</b>|$|R
25|$|At present {{there are}} around 75km of {{off-road}} <b>cycleways</b> in the Edinburgh area, {{with a similar}} length on on-road <b>cycleways</b> in the city. Greenways, which are the car-free bus corridors on the main radial routes into the city centre double up as cycle lanes.|$|R
50|$|The Volcano and Southern Railway <b>Cycleways</b> are tarmacked and {{may also}} be used by inline skaters. There is a large network of signposted <b>cycleways</b> {{in and around the}} Vogelsberg Nature Fitness Park around the highest summits and also 70 km of signed {{mountain}} bike routes.|$|R
5|$|After {{environmental}} {{studies on the}} White Slough, Caltrans widened and elevated that section {{of the road and}} converted it to a freeway. To accommodate bicycles and pedestrians, a <b>cycleway</b> was built along the eastbound side of the freeway. Finally, Caltrans completed the overpass which crossed SR 29, Broadway, and Mini Drive (bypassing Marine World Parkway, three traffic signaled intersections, and a railroad grade crossing). The project was completed in the summer of 2005, and fully open to traffic on August 20.|$|E

50|$|The Sydney City Council is {{progressively}} {{building an}} increasing network of 220 km separated <b>cycleways,</b> shared paths and other infrastructure in and {{adjacent to the}} central business district. , 12.5 km of separated <b>cycleways,</b> 60 km of shared paths and 40 km of other infrastructure were complete.|$|R
50|$|Hamilton has {{extensive}} <b>cycleways</b> which {{link the}} city centre with the outlying suburbs. These <b>cycleways</b> {{consist of a}} mixture of dedicated cycle lanes, which are 1-metre-wide strips either coloured green or with a painted outline of a cycle and mixed use cycle/walk ways which are mainly located alongside the Waikato River. The City's design guide says the preferred width for <b>cycleways</b> is 3 m. A $6.7m, 2.7 km Western Rail Trail opened in 2017 linking Glenview, Melville, and Deanwell, Hamilton Girls’ High School, Wintec and the city centre.|$|R

25|$|The {{related works}} also {{included}} widening of approximately 4km of associated motorway {{to ensure the}} new bridge capacity would be utilised. Existing pedestrian and cyclist links on the old 1914 bridge closed to motor vehicles were retained and are connected to a shared path along the Mangere Bridge waterfront reserve via a new walking/cycling bridge over Onehunga Harbour Road – linking Onehunga to Mangere Bridge suburb and to the Waikaraka <b>Cycleway.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{idea has}} been {{advocated}} by the campaign group Sligo-Mayo Greenway, who argue that the funding for a Greenway on this section would be minimal in infrastructural terms and would not hinder the eventual reinstatement of the Railway should the funding for that ever become available, unlike {{the closure of the}} Foyle Valley Railway by Derry City Council after the parallel installation of a <b>cycleway.</b> The campaign for the Greenway on this section of the track, point {{to the success of the}} recently opened Great Western Greenway.|$|E
25|$|Construction of a {{footpath}} and <b>cycleway</b> {{beside the}} canal from Lincoln to Saxilby {{has been carried}} out by the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership, a joint initiative by Lincolnshire County Council, the Environment Agency and British Waterways. For much of its route it runs {{along the top of the}} northern floodbank, but drops down to a new crossing of the A57 road and a new bridge across the River Till near Saxilby. The route was officially opened on 26 July 2011. Extending the path to Torksey is a longer term aim.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the other}} parts of the route have been {{converted}} into <b>cycleways.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Crab and Winkle Line finally {{closed in}} 1953, but {{about a third}} of the line was reopened as a {{footpath}} and <b>cycleway</b> in 1999 under the stewardship of a local charity, the Crab and Winkle Line Trust. One of the main developments to the town in recent years was the Horsebridge project. Completed in 2005, it was designed to regenerate a dilapidated area of the town with the construction of new shops and houses, a town square, and a community centre with a performance space and art gallery.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009 KiwiRail leased the Rotorua Branch line (Putaruru - Koutu) to the Rotorua Ngongotaha Rail Trust, which {{intends to}} turn the unused {{corridor}} and track into a tourism venture. The trust is currently working to restore part {{of the line and}} is working with the Rotorua District Council to assist with its plans to continue the national <b>cycleway</b> system in the District. Once the track is repaired, the trust hopes that it will be possible for freight and passenger services to resume, with steam enthusiast operators from around New Zealand, able to bring their own excursion trains to Rotorua.|$|E
25|$|Connection to the River Witham at Brayford was {{hampered}} by the small bore and depth of High Bridge, a medieval structure just below the pool. The channel through it was made deeper in 1795, but John Rennie's plans to demolish it in 1803 were not adopted. The canal was leased to several generations of the Ellison family, who profited from the tolls but failed to maintain it. Although cargos of coal and wool moved to the railway, the carriage of grain continued, and the last commercial operation was in 1972. The Brayford Mere Trust have turned Brayford Pool from a rubbish-filled eyesore into an attractive marina, and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership are opening a footpath and <b>cycleway</b> from Lincoln to Torksey; the section to Saxilby was officially opened on 26 July 2011.|$|E

500|$|The {{first known}} survey for a {{permanent}} roadway through the Arroyo was made by T.D. Allen of Pasadena in 1895, and in 1897 two more proposals were made, one for a scenic parkway {{and the other for}} a commuter <b>cycleway.</b> The latter was partially constructed and opened by Horace Dobbins, who incorporated the California <b>Cycleway</b> Company and bought a six-mile (10km) right-of-way from downtown Pasadena to Avenue 54 in Highland Park, Los Angeles. Construction began in 1899, and about [...] of the elevated wooden bikeway were opened on January 1, 1900, starting near Pasadena's Hotel Green and ending near the Raymond Hotel. The majority of its route is now Edmondson Alley; a toll booth was located near the north end, in the present Central Park. Due {{to the end of the}} bicycle craze of the 1890s and the existing Pacific Electric Railway lines connecting Pasadena to Los Angeles, the <b>cycleway</b> did not and was not expected to turn a profit, and never extended beyond the Raymond Hotel into the Arroyo Seco. In the 1900s (decade), the structure was dismantled, and the wood sold for lumber, and the Pasadena Rapid Transit Company, a failed venture headed by Dobbins to construct a streetcar line, acquired the right-of-way.|$|E
500|$|Construction of the South Island Main Trunk railway {{south of}} Dunedin {{that began in}} 1871 led to the {{construction}} of a [...] tunnel beneath Lookout Point, connecting Caversham with Green Island. A second parallel [...] tunnel [...] the first double-track tunnel in the country [...] was built starting in 1907, and all rail traffic moved to the new tunnel in 1910. Caversham was served by its own railway station until its closure in 1962. There has been a long-running campaign to have the older tunnel converted into a <b>cycleway,</b> though this scheme has never gained wholehearted council support.|$|E
