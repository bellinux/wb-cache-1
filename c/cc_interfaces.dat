40|$|Objectives: This study {{evaluated}} {{the percentages of}} continuous margins (%CM) and fracture strength (FS) of crowns made out from blocs of leucite-reinforced ceramic (IPS Empress CAD) and luted with a representative self-adhesive cement (RelyX Unicem) under four contaminating agents: saliva, water, blood, a haemostatic solu-tion containing aluminium chloride (pH = 0. 8) and a control group with no contamination. Study Design: %CM at both tooth-cement (TC) and cement-crown (<b>CC)</b> <b>interfaces</b> were determined before and after a fatigue test consisting of 600 ’ 000 chewing loads and 1 ’ 500 temperature cycles changing from 5 º C to 50 º C. Load to fracture was recorded on fatigued specimens. Kruskal-Wallis {{test was used to}} compare %CM and FS between the five groups with a level of confidence of 95 %. Results: At the TC interface, no significant differences in marginal adaptation before loading could be detected between groups. After loading, a significant marginal degradation was observed in the group contaminated with aluminium chloride (52 ± 22 %CM) in respect to the other groups. No significant differences in %CM could be detected between the groups contaminated with saliva, water, blood and the control. At the CC interface, no sig...|$|E

The TJA 1085 is compliant with the FlexRay electrical physical layer specification V 3. 0. 1 (see Ref. 1). Several TJA 1085 devices can be connected via their TRXD 0 / 1 interfaces {{to increase the number}} of branches in the network. A dedicated Communication Controller (<b>CC)</b> <b>interface</b> allows for integration into an ECU. The TJA 1085 supports low-power management by offering bus wake-up capability along with battery supply and voltage regulator control. The TJA 1085 meets industry standards for EMC/ESD performance and provides enhanced bus error detection, low current consumption and unmatched asymmetric delay performance. The TJA 1085 also fulfills the JASPAR requirements as defined by the Japanese car industry. 2. Features and benefit...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} the Sprint AERCam, a beachball sized robotic camera that floats around in the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle, allowing the astronauts and ground mission control to have an additional view of the task they are trying to accomplish. It has a self contained propulsion system, giving it the capability to maneuver with six degrees of freedom. We present {{a model for the}} AERCam written in Hybrid cc, an extension of cc programming for modeling continuous/discrete systems. We modeled both the dynamics and control of the AERCam in Hybrid <b>cc,</b> and <b>interfaced</b> this model with an animation interface which allows a user to interact with the model in real-time. 1 Introduction This paper {{presents a}} model for the Sprint AERCam, an Autonomous EVA Robotic Camera[Phi 97]. The AERCam is a beachball sized camera (see Figure 1), that floats around in the shuttle bay, allowing the astronauts inside and outside the shuttle and ground mission control to have an additional view of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The second MAGIC telescope, a clone of {{the first}} 17 m {{diameter}} MAGIC telescope, has entered the final commissioning phase and will soon start to take data, preferentially in the so-called stereo-mode. The control system for both telescopes is assigned {{to a number of}} autonomous functional units called subsystems. The control hardware and software components of the second telescope subsystems have been modified with respect to their counterparts {{of the first}} telescope. A new Central Control (CC) program has been developed to communicate with all the subsystems of both telescopes and to coordinate their functionality thus easing the stereo data taking procedure. We describe the whole control system in detail: all the subsystems and their communication with the Central Control, the <b>CC</b> graphic user <b>interface</b> that grants operators the full control over the two telescopes, and the automatic checking procedures, which guarantee the safety and 'health' of the apparatus.

40|$|The {{equilibrium}} equations and the {{compatibility conditions}} are {{fundamental to the}} analyses of structures. However, anyone who undertakes even a cursory generic study of the compatibility conditions can discover, with little effort, that historically this facet of structural mechanics had not been adequately researched by the profession. Now the compatibility conditions (CC's) have been researched and are understood to a great extent. For finite element discretizations, the CC's are banded and {{can be divided into}} three distinct categories: (1) the <b>interface</b> <b>CC's,</b> (2) the cluster or field CC's, and (3) the external CC's. The generation of CC's requires the separating of a local region, then writing the deformation displacement relation (ddr) for the region, and finally, the eliminating of the displacements from the ddr. The procedure to generate all three types of CC's is presented and illustrated through examples of finite element models. The uniqueness of the CC's thus generated is shown. The utilization of CC's has resulted in the novel integrated force method (IFM). The solution that is obtained by the IFM converges with a significantly fewer number of elements, compared to the stiffness and the hybrid methods...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCombining {{observation}} and simulation, radiohalos formed around urano-thorianite (UTh) from the Tranomaro granulitic skarns (SE-Madagascar) were studied. These structures consist of UTh grains surrounded by both aluminous diopside (Cpx) and calcite (Cc 1) crystals. Optical microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images revealed (1) {{the presence of}} radiating cracks around the UTh probably due to swelling of the metamict UTh, (2) a diffuse optical halo at the <b>Cc</b> 1 /UTh <b>interface,</b> and (3) a wide "reaction zone" at the Cpx/UTh interface, composed of "secondary calcite" (Cc 2) with low temperature sheet silicate from the smectite (φ) group. Samples prepared across various interfaces using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) were investigated by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). In contrast to SEM observations, {{there is no direct}} contact between Cc 1 and UTh. From Cc 1 to UTh, we found: (1) a large (~ 200 - 300 nm) amorphous zone (A), enriched in U, Th and Ca, but without Si; (2) a chain (B) of very small (~ 20 nm) ThO 2 crystals; (3) another amorphous zone (C), which, in contrast to zone A is enriched in Si; and (4) another zone (D) made of small amorphous Si-rich "bubbles". The organization is similar for the UTh-Cc 2 interface. The presence of hydrous minerals (smectite) and carbonate (calcite) in reaction zone and in cracks, the presence of Pb-rich inclusions in secondary calcite, the abundance of fluid inclusions in the porous layer in calcite, the dissociation of U and Th in the calcite-uranothorianite layer, and the ThO 2 chains along interfaces, are strong indications that low-temperature crystallization was promoted by a fluid phase. SRIM simulation was used to calculate the effect of α and recoil particles of the three decay chains, in Cpx, Cc and UTh. The thickness of the damaged area calculated for α in Cpx and Cc are similar to the widths of the recrystallized areas observed in thin section (~ 30 µm). Corrected with the ''wandering recoil effect'', the size of the damaged area calculated for recoil nuclei in Cc (~ 50 - 60 nm) is ~multiplied by 3 and is in rather good agreement with the thickness of the totally amorphous layer at the Cc-UTh interface (~ 200 nm). Finally, it is emphasized that radiohalos are a point of chemical and physical weakness in a rock and probably a starting point for alteration...|$|R
