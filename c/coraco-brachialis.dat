40|$|The muscular {{anatomical}} {{variations of}} the thoracic member are recorded {{in a series of}} 180 subjects. Two muscles are supernumerary: a bilateral accessory <b>coraco-brachialis</b> and a unilateral accessory palmaris longus. Two muscles have additional tendons: the extensor carpi radialis brevis and the extensor digitorum...|$|E
40|$|In the {{recurrent}} dislocation of {{the shoulder}} the Bankart operation {{has proved to be}} one of the best salvage procedures. Unfortunately, it leaves a disgracious scar. The authors have therefore adopted the axillary approach to perform the Bankart operation. Of course it is not so easy. The neuromuscular bundle is left aside. The <b>coraco-brachialis</b> muscle is either divided transversally or divided partially on its lateral border and is sutured at the end of the operation. The subcapularis is divided vertically. In some instances, capsule and muscle be adherent, than both are divided simultaneously. The anatomical reconstruction is performed exactly as described in the Bankart technic. Surgical details are reported. In the first ten cases, the recovery has been excellent :no limitation of the mobility, no recurrence and of course no visible scar.

40|$|Seventeen {{consecutive}} {{cases of}} recurrent dislocation {{of the shoulder}} joint have been operated upon, using the antero-medial approach. This approach gives the operator an opportunity not only to discover in each case {{the cause of the}} recurring dislocation, but also to deal with such lesions in the appropriate manner. The superficial muscle plane is split in the delto-pectoral cleft for six to seven inches. The intermediate muscle plane is dealt with by detaching the distal half-inch of the coracoid process with the origins of the <b>coraco-brachialis</b> and short head of the biceps and, having severed the lateral fascial extension, turning these downwards and inwards. The third muscle plane consists of the subscapularis and its tendon; this is incised vertically for two inches, and, with it, the underlying and adherent anterior capsule of the shoulder joint. A good anterior view of the head of the humerus and glenoid is then secured. To view the posterior surface of the head it is necessary to incise some of the anterior fibres of the supraspinatus; with full external rotation, adequate inspection can be made. This is particularly easy when there is a pronounced groove or notch on this surface. The information obtained in these seventeen cases revealed that the cause of recurrin...|$|E
40|$|A woman aged fifty {{was first}} seen {{fourteen}} hours after injury, having fallen and injured her right shoulder. A {{few minutes after}} the injury she had noticed numbness, coldness and inability to move the arm and hand. Examination revealed an anterior dislocation of the shoulder with a large haematoma filling the axilla. The upper limb was cold, blue and pulseless, with complete flaccid paralysis of the whole arm and hand. Anaesthesia was present in the sixth, seventh and eighth cervical dermatomes. The first thoracic supply was unaffected. Treatnient-The dislocation was easily reduced under general anaesthesia by Kocherâ€™s method. But {{since there was no}} change in the condition of the limb in the next two hours the shoulder was explored through a delto-pectoral incision, the pectoralis major muscle being divided at its humeral attachment and reflected upwards. The short head of the biceps and the <b>coraco-brachialis</b> were divided at their coracoid attachment. A large haematoma was cleared out, and when the axillary artery was exposed a complete rupture of the second part was found. Both ends of the artery were filled with thrombus. There was no evidence of previous disease of the vessel. The vein and that part of the brachial plexus which was exposed were uninjured. It was decided to ligature the two ends of the artery because it was thought tha...|$|E
