5|$|Groves' class entered West Point on 15 June 1916, but the United States {{declaration}} of war on Germany in April 1917 led to the course being shortened to what {{was known as the}} War Emergency Course (WEC), which graduated early on 1 November 1918. Groves came fourth in his class, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the United States Army <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers.</b> The <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> was the usual appointment for the highest-ranking cadets in a class.|$|E

5|$|The Rampart Dam's {{large size}} had a {{correspondingly}} large price tag. The <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> anticipated spending $618.4million (1970 dollars) on {{construction of the}} physical dam alone, another $492million for power-generating equipment, and $1.39billion in total. That total included $15.59million for relocating Alaskans from the area to be flooded, $56million for fish and wildlife facilities to mitigate the anticipated losses, and $39.7million for roads and bridges to access the area. After completion of the dam, the <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> estimated that operation and maintenance of the project would cost $6.5million annually, including $570,000 for replacement power equipment and $2million {{for the maintenance of}} fish and wildlife facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{power station}} is {{regulated}} by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), under the Federal Power Act, with the current license issued in 1992 and set to expire in 2022.

When the reservoir's elevation exceeds , control of the dam's discharges are transferred to the U.S. Army <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> (USACE) who manage flood control in the larger basin.

5|$|Despite the Interior Department's {{rejection}} of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> continued its engineering feasibility study on the project. That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> projected that several decades {{would be needed to}} build the dam and associated structures.|$|E

5|$|In February 2000, the Turnpike Authority {{gave in to}} {{the orders}} from the U.S. Army <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> to have Route 92 undergo an {{environmental}} impact study, which could go up to two years, to help see if they should award the contract for construction. Opponents of the Route 92 project hailed this decision for {{the thought that the}} environmental impact statement (EIS) would back up their beliefs. Four months later, the Army <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> held a meeting to decide what to take into account for the impact statement and held opinions from both the supporters and opponents of the freeway. Around this time, locals sent an editorial to News 12 New Jersey to say that Middlesex County Route 522, already a four-lane freeway, should become the primary freeway across the portion of Middlesex County. However, the Turnpike Authority replied citing that Route 522 would be inadequate to handle the amount of traffic by 2015 that Route 92 was to handle. In December 2003, the Army <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> approved the statement and although agencies still disagreed on the wetlands issues, held public hearings in 2004.|$|E

5|$|The {{first serious}} {{consideration}} of a dam project {{was made in}} a 1954 U.S. Army <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> assessment of {{the resources of the}} Yukon and Kuskokwim River basin. Engineers considered Rampart Canyon to be a prime site for a hydroelectric dam. In April 1959, four months after President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed Alaska's declaration of statehood, junior U.S. Senator from Alaska Ernest Gruening passed a resolution calling for the <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> to begin an official study of the project, and $49,000 was allocated by the federal government for that purpose. Preliminary estimates said the project would cost $900 million (1959 dollars) and generate 4.7 million kilowatts of electricity. At the time, the largest hydroelectric project in Alaska was the Eklutna Dam, which produced just 32,000 kilowatts.|$|E
