As {{an important component of}} the active vibration isolation platform, the maglev actuator has a large stroke and exhibits excellent isolating performance benefiting from its noncontact characteristic. A maglev actuator with good linearity was designed in this paper. Fundamental features of the maglev actuator were obtained by finite element simulation. In order to minimize the <b>coil</b> <b>weight</b> and the heat dissipation of the maglev actuator, parametric design was carried out and multiobjective optimization based on the genetic algorithm was adopted. The optimized actuator has better mechanical properties than the initial one. Active vibration isolation platforms for different-scale payload were designed by changing the arrangement of the maglev actuators. The prototype to isolate vibration for small-scale payload was manufactured and the experiments for verifying the characteristics of the actuators were set up. The linearity of the actuator and the mechanical dynamic response of the vibration isolation platform were obtained. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed design...|$|E

The Central Solenoid Insert (CSI) project will allow ITER validation the appropriate lengths of the conductors {{to be used in the}} full-scale CS coils under relevant conditions. The ITER Program plans to build and test a CSI to verify the performance of the CS conductor. The CSI is a one-layer solenoid with an inner diameter of 1. 48 m and a height of 4. 45 m between electric terminal ends. The <b>coil</b> <b>weight</b> with the terminals is approximately 820 kg without insulation. The major goal of the CSI is to measure the temperature margin of the CS under the ITER direct current (DC) operating conditions, including determining sensitivity to load cycles. Performance of the joints, ramp rate sensitivity, and stability against thermal or electromagnetic disturbances, electrical insulation, losses, and instrumentation are addressed separately and therefore are not major goals in this project. However, losses and joint performance will be tested during the CSI testing campaign. The USIPO will build the CSI that will be tested at the Central Solenoid Model Coil (CSMC) Test Facility at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), Naka, Japan. The industrial vendors (the Suppliers) will report to the USIPO (the Company). All approvals to proceed will be issued by the Company, which in some cases, as specified in this document, will also require the approval of the ITER Organization. Responsibilities and obligations will be covered by respective contracts between the USIPO, called Company interchangeably, and the industrial Prime Contractors, called Suppliers. Different stages of work may be performed by more than one Prime Contractor, as described in this specification. Technical requirements of the contract between the Company and the Prime Contractor will be covered by the Fabrication Specifications developed by the Prime Contractor based on this document and approved by the Company and ITER. The Fabrication Specifications may reflect some national requirements and regulations that are not fully provided here. This document presents the ITER CSI specifications...|$|E

For this purpose, a navigator-gated and cardiac-triggered point-resolved spectroscopy sequence was implemented, and data obtained in 11 healthy volunteers using 32 - and 5 -element coil arrays were compared. For combination of the individual coil element signals, four strategies were evaluated differing in the manner of estimation of the complex <b>coil</b> <b>weights</b> and the amount of additional information required for coil combination. In all volunteers, and with both the 32 - and 5 -channel coil arrays, triglyceride-to-water (0. 44 [*]±[*] 0. 19 % and 0. 45 [*]±[*] 0. 17 %) and total creatine-to-water (0. 05 [*]±[*] 0. 02 % and 0. 05 [*]±[*] 0. 01 %) contents were computed.

40|$|Portable {{transient}} electromagnetic (TEM) {{systems can}} be well adapted to various terrains, including mountainous, woodland, and other complex terrains. They are widely used {{for the detection of}} unexploded ordnance (UXO). As the core component of the portable TEM system, the sensor is constructed with a transmitting coil and a receiving coil. Based on the primary field of the transmitting coil and internal noise of the receiving coil, the design and testing of such a sensor is described in detail. Results indicate that the primary field of the transmitting coil depends on the diameter, mass, and power of the coil. A higher mass–power product and a larger diameter causes a stronger primary field. Reducing the number of turns and increasing the clamp voltage reduces the switch-off time of the transmitting current effectively. Increasing the cross-section of the wire reduces the power consumption, but greatly increases the <b>coil’s</b> <b>weight.</b> The study of the receiving coil shows that the internal noise of the sensor is dominated by the thermal noise of the damping resistor. Reducing the bandwidth of the system and increasing the size of the coil reduces the internal noise effectively. The cross-sectional area and the distance between the sections of the coil have little effect on the internal noise. A less damped state can effectively reduce signal distortion. Finally, a portable TEM sensor with both a transmitting coil (constructed with a diameter, number of turns, and transmitting current of 0. 5 m, 30, and 5 A, respectively) and a receiving coil (constructed with a length and resonant frequency of 5. 6 cm and 50 kHz, respectively) was built. The agreement between experimental and calculated results confirms the theory used in the sensor design. The responses of an 82 mm mortar shell at different distances were measured and inverted by the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to verify system performance.

However, due to the large size of the equipment, this therapy has not been widely adopted. In particular, the rotating gantries used to irradiate patients with the heavy-ion beams from any direction may be as heavy as 600 tons in our estimation.

Snails which occurred near to sewage outfalls in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary, are compared with those which occurred In an area with similar salinity and exposure conditions but isolated from possible effects of sewage. Sediment silt and organic carbon content were higher near to the outfalls. Shell morphology, described by shell dimensions, geometrical parameters of <b>coiling,</b> linear <b>weight</b> relationships and shell deposition patterns, showed {{no significant difference between}} the two areas. A predominantly juvenile population which occurred near to the sewage outfalls was the result of an annual cycle of settlement and sub-sequent population loss. A predominantly adult population occurred in the area unaffected by the outfalls. In laboratory experiments, animals from each area preferred sediment from their own particular area. Size frequency and sculpture distribution showed no regular zonation patterns for other areas of the estuary. Seasonal changes in the ovotestis were not significantly different between animals collected from the two areas. Tissue levels of heavy metals in A. crenata collected from near to the sewage outfalls were lower per unit tissue dry weight but higher in total metal per individual than in those from the other area. Tissue and sediment levels of metals were relatively low in both areas compared with levels reported in studies of polluted conditions. Isolated areas of elevated metal levels occurred in the Avon River. Exceptionally long survival times for A. crenata exposed to copper(ii) ion concentrations in the laboratory, are attributed to pulmonary respiration, the operculum, and high mucous production. Salinities below 8 % seawater and increase in temperature affected the toxicity of copper to adults. Veliger larvae were sensitive to much lower concentrations of ionic copper(ii) (0. 5 ppm) than those which affected egg development (5 ppm) or survival of adults (2. 5 ppm).

One concept of such an aircraft is a hybrid helicopter that uses highly efficient diesel engines and electrical propulsion motors. The feasibility of this concept is greatly determined by the feasibility of its main propulsion motor. The very challenging specifications of such a motor means that new technologies have to be used. One of these possible technologies is superconductivity. In this thesis a first technical feasibility study on a direct drive superconducting propulsion motor for a hybrid helicopter concept is performed. Superconductors are special materials that have virtually no electrical resistance when cooled down below a certain critical temperature. This property makes it possible to build high field and low <b>weight</b> <b>coils</b> for electrical machines. A helicopter’s electrical propulsion motor requires a very high torque density. Conventional electrical machines like permanent magnet designs are too heavy for this application.

After that all the results are combined and the complete machine parameters, like the power density, are defined.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated {{the importance of the}} 3 (10) -helix/ alpha-helix/coil equilibrium for the structure and folding of peptides and proteins. One way to perturb this equilibrium is to introduce side-chain interactions that stabilize or destabilize one helix. For example, an attractive i, i + 4 interaction, present only in the alpha-helix, will favor the alpha-helix over 3 (10), while an i, i + 4 repulsion will favor the 3 (10) -helix over alpha. To quantify the 3 (10) /alpha/coil equilibrium, it is essential to use a helix/coil theory that considers the stability of every possible conformation of a peptide. We have previously developed models for the 3 (10) -helix/coil and 3 (10) -helix/alpha-helix/ coil equilibria. Here we extend this work by adding i, i + 3 and i, i + 4 side-chain interaction energies to the models. The theory is based on classifying residues into alpha-helical, 3 (10) -helical, or nonhelical (<b>coil)</b> conformations. Statistical <b>weights</b> are assigned to residues in a helical conformation with an associated helical hydrogen bond, a helical conformation with no hydrogen bond, an N-cap position, a C-cap position, or the reference coil conformation plus i, i + 3 and i, i + 4 side-chain interactions. This work may provide a framework for quantitatively rationalizing experimental work on isolated 3 (10) -helices and mixed 3 (10) -/alpha-helices and for predicting the locations and stabilities of these structures in peptides and proteins. We conclude that strong i, i + 4 side-chain interactions favor alpha-helix formation, while the 3 (10) -helix population is maximized when weaker i, i + 4 side-chain interactions are present...|$|R

Both cationic and anionic flocculants have been synthesized based on information from the in literature. To increase cellulose reactivity, it was applied cellulose alkalization with NaOH aqueous solution and oxidation by sodium periodate. The cationization of cellulose was performed by using CHPTAC (3 -chloor- 2 -hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride) as reagent. The anionization was performed by using sodium metabisulfite as reagent. Some reaction variables have been changed in order to synthesize flocculants with different characteristics. Once the water soluble flocculants were obtained, they have been characterized according to several techniques {{in order to determine}} the effective cellulose modification and other characteristic of the flocculants synthesized. To detect the modification spectroscopy techniques such as FTIR and 1 H NMR were used. To characterize the flocculants techniques like like DLS (Dynamic Light Scattering), SLS (Static Light Scattering) and ELS (Electrophoretic Light Scattering) were used, to determine, respectively, the average hydrodynamic diameter of the <b>coils,</b> the molecular <b>weight</b> and the zeta potential. Moreover, from the elemental analysis measurements the degree of substitution (DS) was calculate. The characterization has shown a certain variability of the flocculants obtained in terms of charge and DS as a confirmation that their characteristic can be modulated by tuning the reaction variables. The industrial application of the obtained cellulose-based flocculants was verified in wastewater treatment, in particular in the color removal from model effluents. The dyes selected for the performance test are among the ones frequently industrially used: Crystal Violet (liquid), Malachite Green (liquid) and Duasyn Direct Red 8 BLP (liquid) and Flora red 4 bs, Orange 2, Acid Black 2, Basic Green 1 and Brilliant Yellow in the solid state. The performance has been evaluated calculating the percentage of color removed as a function of time, based on the decrease of absorbance of the supernatant water. The results show that both for CC (cationized cellulose) and ADAC (anionic dialdehyde cellulose) color removal percentages over 90 % can be obtained for most dyes. Thus, these natural based polyelectrolytes can constitute good alternatives to the use of synthetic non- biodegradable flocculants in the treatment of very common and industrially frequent colored effluents...|$|R
