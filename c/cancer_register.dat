40|$|Radiofrequency {{emissions}} in the frequency range 30 kHz– 300 GHz were evaluated to be Group 2 B, i. e., “possibly”, carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) at WHO in May 2011. The Swedish <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register</b> has not shown increasing incidence of brain tumours {{in recent years and}} has been used to dismiss epidemiological evidence on a risk. In this study we used the Swedish National Inpatient Register (IPR) and Causes of Death Register (CDR) to further study the incidence comparing with the <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register</b> data for the time period 1998 – 2013 using joinpoint regression analysis. In the IPR we found a joinpoint in 2007 with Annual Percentage Change (APC) + 4. 25 %, 95 % CI + 1. 98, + 6. 57 % during 2007 – 2013 for tumours of unknown type in the brain or CNS. In the CDR joinpoint regression found one joinpoint in 2008 with APC during 2008 – 2013 + 22. 60 %, 95 % CI + 9. 68, + 37. 03 %. These tumour diagnoses would be based on clinical examination, mainly CT and/or MRI, but without histopathology or cytology. No statistically significant increasing incidence was found in the Swedish <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register</b> during these years. We postulate that a large part of brain tumours of unknown type are never reported to the <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register.</b> Furthermore, the frequency of diagnosis based on autopsy has declined substantially due to a general decline of autopsies in Sweden adding further to missing cases.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that cancer registries in England are too dependent on processing of information from death certificates, and consequently that cancer survival statistics reported for England are systematically biased and too low. METHODS: We have linked routine cancer registration records for colorectal, lung, and breast cancer patients with information from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database for the period 2001 – 2007. Based on record linkage with the HES database, records missing in the <b>cancer</b> <b>register</b> were identified, and dates of diagnosis were revised. The effects of those revisions on the estimated survival time and proportion of patients surviving for 1 year or more were studied. Cases that were absent in the <b>cancer</b> <b>register</b> and present in the HES data with a relevant diagnosis code and a relevant surgery code were used to estimate (a) the completeness of the <b>cancer</b> <b>register.</b> Differences in survival times calculated from the two data sources were used to estimate (b) the possible extent of error in the recorded survival time in the <b>cancer</b> <b>register.</b> Finally, we combined (a) and (b) to estimate (c) the resulting differences in 1 -year cumulative survival estimates. RESULTS: Completeness of case ascertainment in English cancer registries is high, around 98 – 99 %. Using HES data added 1. 9 %, 0. 4 % and 2. 0 % to the number of colorectal, lung, and breast cancer registrations, respectively. Around 5 – 6 % of rapidly fatal cancer registrations had survival time extended by more than a month, and almost 3 % of rapidly fatal breast cancer records were extended by more than a year.

The cases with brain tumor of unknown type lack morphological examination. Brain tumor diagnosis was based on cytology/histopathology in 83 % for men and in 87 % for women in 1980. This frequency increased to 90 % in men and 88 % in women in 2015. During the same time period CT and MRI imaging techniques were introduced and morphology is not always necessary for diagnosis. If all brain tumors based on clinical diagnosis with CT or MRI had been reported to the <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register</b> the frequency of diagnoses based on cytology/histology would have decreased in the register.

All prostate cancer cases diagnosed before the age of 51 years from 1958 to 1994 were identified in the population-based Swedish <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register.</b> The first-degree relatives of clinical cases were identified through parish data. Their vital status and cancer incidence were studied in the Swedish <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register,</b> the Cause of Death Register and the Census Register. The expected incidence of malignant tumours for the first-degree relatives were calculated using regional <b>cancer</b> <b>register</b> data. Cause-specific standardised incidence ratios (SIR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The study included 423 first-degree relatives of 89 men with clinical prostate cancer. The first-degree relatives' SIR for malignant tumours was 0. 99 (95 % CI 0. 78 - 1. 23). The SIR for prostate cancer diagnosed at any age was 1. 43 (95 % CI 0. 82 - 2. 33), and 3. 37 for first-degree relatives diagnosed before the age of 70 years (95 % CI 1. 36 - 6. 94). There was no significantly increased risk of any non-prostatic malignant tumour. Only in five of the families did the pedigree show a pattern of hereditary prostate cancer. The first-degree relatives of men with early onset prostate cancer had more than a 3 -fold increase in the risk of developing prostate cancer before the age of 70 years, but their total cancer risk was not increased.

40|$|BACKGROUND Relatively {{few studies}} {{published}} {{to date have}} investigated IVF and cancer risk. In this study we compared the occurrence of cancer in women who gave birth after IVF with all other women who gave birth in the study period. METHODS All women who were treated with IVF and gave birth during the years 1982 - 2006 in Sweden were identified from all IVF clinics, and the occurrence of cancer in these women was identified by linkage with the nationwide Swedish <b>cancer</b> <b>register.</b> Comparison was made with Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for year of delivery and maternal age, parity and smoking. Cancer before IVF was only studied in first parity women. Specific cancer forms were also studied. RESULTS Among 24058 {{women who had been}} treated with IVF, 1279 appeared in the <b>cancer</b> <b>register.</b> The total number of women studied in the population was 1 394 061, and 95 775 of these were registered in the <b>cancer</b> <b>register.</b> The risk for cancer before IVF was increased [OR 1. 37, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 27 - 1. 48] and was especially high for ovarian cancer (3. 93). The risk for cancer after IVF was significantly lower (OR 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 67 - 0. 82), mainly due to a lower than expected risk for breast and cervical cancer. The risk for ovarian cancer was increased but lower than the risk before IVF (2. 13). CONCLUSIONS Cancer or cancer treatment may increase the risk for infertility leading to IVF. After IVF, in most cases with treatment with fertility hormones, a significantly low cancer risk was found. Ovarian cancer showed an increased risk, although lower than before IVF.

40|$|Aim: To {{characterize}} familial {{prostate cancer}} including hereditary prostate cancer {{and assess the}} disease-free survival following radical prostatectomy. Methods: A self-administered written questionnaire was forwarded to 709 prostatectomized patients from the Aarhus Prostate Cancer Study containing questions about cases of prostate cancer (PC), age at diagnosis, vital status, and age at death for all first-degree relatives. Patients were then divided into groups according to their family history: hereditary prostate cancer (HPC), familial prostate cancer (FPC), and sporadic prostate cancer (SPC) groups. The information from a subset of both FPC (n = 17) and SPC (n = 17) groups were validated in the Danish <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register</b> and the Civil Registration System. Between groups, we described the association of age, prostatespecific antigen (PSA), postoperative Gleason score and T Stage. A Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated postoperative disease-free survival in each group. Results: The response rate was 81 % (574 / 709). About 21 % of the patients were categorized in the FPC group, of which 7 % were identified as having HPC. The median follow-up time was 63 months for HPC, 65 months for FPC and 88 months for SPC. Overall, {{there was no significant}} difference between groups in clinical features and disease-free survival except that patients with HPC were significantly associated with younger age than sporadic cases (p = 0. 02).

40|$|Biliary tract cancer, {{including}} {{cancer of}} the extra-hepatic bile ducts, {{cancer of the}} Ampulla of Vater and gallbladder cancer, is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The incidence of biliary tract cancer is decreasing worldwide, for unknown reasons. One of two aims of this thesis was to evaluate the Swedish <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register</b> regarding biliary tract cancer and to assess the incidence of biliary tract cancer in Sweden. Secondly, an association between sex hormone exposure, particularly estrogen, and biliary tract cancer has been suggested. Thus, the second aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of sex hormone exposure on biliary tract cancer risk. Study I and II were {{based on data from}} the Swedish <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register,</b> the Swedish Patient Register and the Swedish Causes of Death Register. Study I was a validation study of biliary tract cancer diagnoses in the <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register,</b> using data from the Patient Register and the Cause of Death Register as comparison. Overall, 44 % of patients diagnosed with biliary tract cancer between 1990 and 2009 were not found in the <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register.</b> The underreporting increased with increasing patient age and later time period. Study II indicated a decreasing incidence trend of biliary tract cancer. However, the mortality rates were higher than the incidence rates after the mid 1980 ’s and onwards. Moreover, the incidence trends based on data from the Patient Register suggested a more stable or only slightly decreasing trend. Thus, even though the incidence of biliary tract cancer may be decreasing, the extent of the decline is likely over-estimated. Study III investigated the association between reproductive factors and biliary tract cancer. Women and men were included in the study, but analyzed separately, to enable differentiation between hormone exposure and other factors. The risk of cancers of the extrahepatic bile ducts (including the Ampulla of Vater) is likely not influenced by reproductive factors because similar associations were seen in women and men. However, an association between reproductive factors and gallbladder cancer was observed in women, but not as clearly in men. Study IV investigated the risk of biliary tract cancer in a cohort of men with prostate cancer, a proxy for estrogen exposure (prostate cancer treatment). There was no clear association, although a slightly decreased risk was indicated. However, men with the highest presumed estrogen exposure had an increased risk of biliary tract cancer, though the association was not statistically significant. Study V investigated the association between menopausal hormone therapy and biliary tract cancer. A slightly reduced risk of gallbladder cancer was suggested for users of menopausal hormone therapy compared to non-users, but the association was not statistically significant. However, an increased risk of gallstone disease was noted however. In conclusion, there is substantial under-reporting of biliary tract cancer to the Swedish <b>Cancer</b> <b>Register,</b> especially in the elderly and in the later time period. The decreasing incidence trends of biliary tract cancer in Sweden are likely over-estimated, as a consequence of under-reporting. Furthermore, the role of sex hormones in the etiology of biliary tract cancer is uncertain. Sex hormone exposure may influence the risk of gallbladder cancer specifically but not biliary tract cancer as a whole. Future etiological research should separate gallbladder cancer from other extra-hepatic cancer...|$|E
