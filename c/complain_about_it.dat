On Super Astros Ortiz was known under the ring name Rey [...] "Pirata" [...] Ortiz and {{wrestled}} without his mask on. He later stated that he wished the WWF had more respect for the mask, but that a paycheck was a paycheck so he did not <b>complain</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> His stint on Super Astros ended in early 1999.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen's July 2009 {{review for}} The A.V. Club in July 2009 gave the episode a grade of A. Cyrano Jones was Handlen's least {{favorite}} part of the episode, and with the exception of that character, {{it was one of the}} better scripts seen in The Original Series. He thought that despite the lack of a sense of real danger, the plot all comes together neatly and praised the story's effects on Kirk, saying [...] "The way the episode unfolds means Kirk's constantly dealing with things he does not really want to deal with, and there's a surprising amount of enjoyment to be had in seeing him <b>complain</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to Spock." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{read-through}} of {{the episode}} was held on January 23, 1991, the same night the second season premiered. [...] "The Statue" [...] was filmed {{in front of a}} live audience six days later. A few scenes were changed prior to filming; in an early draft of the script Elaine sat next to George eavesdropping on Jerry and Ray's conversation. She would wear a floppy hat to look inconspicuous and would <b>complain</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> stating that she looks like one of the Cowsills, a singing group that was active between the 1960s and 1970s. The same scene initially featured George admitting that he spied on Ray a day earlier, showing Ray pictures of him in a bar. Ray would reply that it was his day off and asks why George is not at work, to which George replies that he should be getting back and leaves. In the original script, Elaine and Rava would argue over who is a better person: Jerry or Ray.|$|E

500|$|After {{stuffing}} {{themselves with}} turkey on Thanksgiving, {{it is time}} to take the annual Christmas card family photo, and when Bart and Lisa <b>complain</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Marge notes that they will grow to appreciate the photos when they become older and have children of their own. Lisa questions why Marge would assume they will even have children in the first place, and the episode jumps thirty years into the future via a series of Simpsons Christmas cards. The photos finally settle on a future where Bart is a deadbeat, divorced father with two sons whom he does not see often; Lisa is a successful businesswoman who is married to Milhouse and has a rebellious daughter named Zia; and Maggie is the lead singer of a famous band and in the late stages of pregnancy. In his apartment at the former Springfield Elementary, Bart is visited by his sons, who inform him that their mother Jenda teleported them to his place because she wants him to act like a proper father by having him spend time with them. However, he plans on dropping them off at his parents' house instead. Meanwhile, Lisa fears that Zia is spending too much of her time going into the [...] "Ultranet", a digital world that people enter with their consciousness by plugging themselves into a laptop. Milhouse suggests to Lisa that she spend time with Zia {{in order for them to}} have a better connection, so Lisa decides to take Zia to her parents' house, too. Meanwhile, Maggie flies home from London to Springfield to also celebrate Christmas with her parents.|$|E
500|$|AOL TV's Jason Hughes {{was more}} negative, criticizing the episode {{for taking a}} [...] "soft approach" [...] to the {{television}} industry when it [...] "had a chance for some sharp satire". He elaborated that the writers [...] "had {{a little bit of}} fun talking about networks meddling in shows – as well as agents trying to control content as when Joan Rivers booted Janeane Garofalo for being funnier than Krusty – and the differences between cable original programming and broadcast programming. But they had the potential they had to make some bold statements about television and how the industry works throughout, and simply didn't." [...] Hughes did, however, like the King of the Hill appearance, which he described as a [...] "fun nod". Further criticism came from the conservative Parents Television Council (PTC), which named The Simpsons the [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] because [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] contains [...] "content inappropriate for the Family Hour". The group wrote that the [...] "frank sexual dialogue warranted a TV-14 rating, but the episode was rated TV-PG. Fox network executives surely know that almost nothing that comes out of Joan Rivers’ mouth is rated PG; but they chose to rate the program inappropriately anyway, thus blindsiding parents and children with crude content." [...] PTC cited examples such as Annie saying that every night in his early days, Krusty [...] "had [...] rolling in the aisles, followed by a roll in the hay with me," [...] and that [...] "Today's kids are less sensitive than an Army condom. They see more on TV than my mother did on her wedding night. And they don't <b>complain</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for the next 50 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time as the Goodwins were {{planning}} to dramatically expand the Market, the farmers began increasingly to <b>complain</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> They wanted the per-day stall rental fee cut from $0.20 to $0.10, which they were granted. [...] They complained about having to haul produce up the bluff from Western Avenue, and unsuccessfully demanded a mechanical conveyor. Complaints about overcrowding were constant. The farmers also wanted a wooden planked floor set up directly below the Main Arcade for storage. [...] Quickly having grown unhappy with a lack of progress on the part of the city, the farmers used Washington State's then new ballot initiative system to obtain a $150,000 municipal bond issue for their desired improvements.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "“The Bear and the Bow” {{is a really}} {{compelling}} episode for Once Upon a Time, and I admit that I wasn’t necessarily expecting it to be. However, the separate trajectories towards heroism and self-confidence for both Merida and Gold were genuinely engrossing... The plot (The deception from Arthur) thickens, and it didn’t feel like {{part of the same}} episode {{as the rest of the}} story, considering how singularly focused it is on the Gold/Merida arcs. But it was necessary if next week’s episode is going to kick off the search for this mysterious person. So I can’t really <b>complain</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> All in all, I thought “The Bear and the Bow” delivered, as Once Upon a Time continues what is gradually becoming one of my favorite first-halves of any season in some time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the offseason, the Celtics' Big 3 {{was broken}} up {{following}} Ray Allen's joining of the Heat. When {{asked about their}} immediate reactions to their teammate leaving for their rival, Kevin Garnett claimed that he deleted Allen's phone number, while Paul Pierce admitted that it [...] "hurt", though he still considers Allen [...] "a brother to me" [...] for their 2008 championship run. Although the two teams would not meet in the playoffs, the animosity continued in their four regular season games. The season opener – a Heat victory – included Rondo clothes-lining Wade's neck, Garnett snubbing a handshake from Allen pre-game, and Garnett throwing an elbow at Mario Chalmers. During Miami's 2013 Streak, Paul Pierce went on record {{to say that he}} wished for Miami to lose all of its remaining games by that point. When James voiced his displeasure over the Chicago Bulls' physicality against him, Boston's general manager Danny Ainge called it [...] "embarrassing" [...] for LeBron to <b>complain</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Pat Riley, the Heat team president, retorted that [...] "Danny should shut the fuck up." [...] The teams met during the Streak, where it was five years to the day that the Celtics' stopped the Houston Rockets' own 20+-game winning streak. It ended in a Heat victory, one that featured James dunking on Jason Terry; he received a technical foul for staring down at Terry post-dunk. When asked about it after the game by reporters, James stated that he was [...] "glad it happened to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 2, 1981, Stern {{began his}} third morning job at WWDC, a rock station in Washington, D.C. He was {{determined}} to become a success, and noticed the importance of news segments for satire. He wished for a news person to riff {{with him in the}} studio. Management paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a news anchor and consumer reporter from WFBR in Baltimore, who agreed to meet Stern after hearing him interview a prostitute on the air. Quivers at first [...] "thought I would come in and do the news...but it wasn't that way...he wanted someone to play off of...he wanted a real live person there with him". The show began to break format, and Stern held a lesbian edition of [...] "Dial-a-Date" [...] in May 1981. He formed the Think Tank, a cohesive trio of male listeners who conversed with Stern and played along with quizzes and routines, which helped the show sound more natural. By January 1982, Stern had the second highest-rated morning program in the city. On January 14, one day after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90, Stern made believe he asked Air Florida the price of a one-way ticket to the 14th Street Bridge, the location of the disaster. [...] "Is that going to be a permanent stop?" [...] asked Stern. On June 29, 1982, Stern's contract at WWDC was terminated. He writes that the Air Florida segment was not the reason for his departure, nor did anyone <b>complain</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He had signed a contract with WNBC in March, and began to berate management and other DJ's on the air. Quivers, who left the show early on June 17, worked at WCBM in Baltimore until rejoining with Stern on October 18, 1982. Stern presented a farewell show two weeks later on competing station WAVA-FM. He had more than tripled the station's ratings during his stay.|$|E

No doubt, however, he is criticising the performance for your benefit; but, as he never speaks loud enough for me to hear, of course I could not guess that.
