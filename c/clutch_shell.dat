So these growing needs demand a new design methodology based on metal forming simulation. With the help of metal forming simulation we can identify the problem areas and solutions can be validated. The aim {{of this research is}} to develop techniques that would reduce {{the amount of time spent}} during the tool qualifying stage. In this paper the draw tools on Automobile outer <b>clutch</b> <b>shell</b> surface are designed by the precise die surface at different dimensions and draw processes is analyzed with appropriate simulation parameters. From this we got the most reliable results. The compression with the tryout part shows that the simulation process can accurately predict the formability problems...|$|E

This document shows the decline in production to one sixth of the 1884 yield in 1929 - 1930. Observations over the course of the last decade have indicated two major factors responsible for the decline in oyster production. Reduction of brood stock stands first, while failing to provide <b>clutch</b> (<b>shells)</b> for the setting purposes has been a close second. (PDF contains 29 pages...|$|R

The shadows of that shell went down, down, down, until it made him sick to look at it. He drew back quickly, <b>clutched</b> the <b>shell</b> with his arms, and shut his eyes.

40|$|Interval between {{reproductive}} {{events is}} an important factor for iteroparous animals because it determines the number of clutches throughout life. This study examined whether female size, <b>clutch</b> size, <b>shell</b> size and prenuptial molting affected the clutch interval in the hermit crab Pagurus nigrivittatus. Precopulatory guarding pairs of P. nigrivittatus were sampled in the field and kept in the laboratory until the female extruded eggs. The clutch interval of each female was assessed as one of two types of relatively "short" and "long" intervals by checking whether the guarded female had eggs and/or egg cases from the preceding brood or not when the guarding pair was collected. The clutch interval was longer in females with prenuptial molting than those without molting and these females usually grew larger at the prenuptial molt. This suggests that female P. nigrivittatus with a long interval might allocate energy into growth {{at the expense of the}} number of clutches during the current reproductive season. The allocation to growth is theoretically predicted to decrease with female size. Gastropod shell size is also known to affect the reproductive activity in hermit crabs. However, female size did not significantly affect the clutch interval in P. nigrivittatus, and the effect of gastropod <b>shell</b> size on <b>clutch</b> interval was not consistent with previous empirical studies. These results may be caused by differences in the gastropod species of shell occupied by the females of P. nigrivittatus...|$|R

In this paper, we explored potential causes of variation in eggshell colour and structure (shell thickness and porosity) in the Collared Flycatcher (). We analysed if eggshell colour is affected by shell structure or pigment level, and whether female traits, laying date, local breeding density, and <b>clutch</b> size affect <b>shell</b> thickness and pore density. We found that eggshell blue-green and UV colours were unrelated to shell thickness, pore density and egg size. Eggs with higher concentration of biliverdin showed lower UV reflection and higher reflection in the blue-green part of the spectrum. We found that females in better nutritional condition, indicated by their higher mass controlled for tarsus length, laid eggs with thicker shells. It is possible that females in better condition have more time available for searching calcium-rich food, and thus could produce eggs with stronger shells. However, female physical characteristics had no significant relationships with shell porosity. In contrast to our expectation, shell thickness and pore density were unrelated to local breeding density and laying date, though very late and repeat clutches were not sampled in our study. However, we found that eggs in larger clutches had lower pore density than eggs in smaller clutches, which may be expected if the rate of water loss and nest humidity are to remain constant in clutches of different egg numbers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The tribe Lamprologini is {{the major}} {{substrate}} breeding lineage of Lake Tanganyika's cichlid species flock. Among several different life history strategies found in lamprologines, the adaptation to live and breed in empty gastropod shells {{is probably the most}} peculiar. Although shell-breeding arose several times in the evolutionary history of the lamprologines, all obligatory and most facultative shell-breeders belong to the so called "ossified group", a monophyletic lineage within the lamprologine cichlids. Since their distinctive life style enables these species to live and breed in closest vicinity, we hypothesized that these cichlids might be particularly prone to accidental hybridization, and that introgression might have affected the evolutionary history of this cichlid lineage. Results Our analyses revealed discrepancies between phylogenetic hypotheses based on mitochondrial and nuclear (AFLP) data. While the nuclear phylogeny was congruent with morphological, behavioral and ecological characteristics, several species – usually highly specialized shell-breeders – were placed at contradicting positions in the mitochondrial phylogeny. The discordant phylogenies strongly suggest repeated incidents of introgressive hybridization between several distantly related shell-breeding species, which reticulated the phylogeny of this group of cichlids. Long interior branches and high bootstrap support for many interior nodes in the mitochondrial phylogeny argue against a major effect of ancient incomplete lineage sorting on the phylogenetic reconstruction. Moreover, we provide morphological and genetic (mtDNA and microsatellites) evidence for ongoing hybridization among distantly related shell-breeders. In these cases, the territorial males of the inferred paternal species are too large to enter the shells of their mate, such that they have to release their sperm over the entrance of the shell to fertilize the eggs. With sperm dispersal by water currents and wave action, trans-specific fertilization of <b>clutches</b> in neighboring <b>shells</b> seem inevitable, when post-zygotic isolation is incomplete. Conclusion From the direct observation of hybrids we conclude that hybridization between distantly related gastropod-shell-breeding cichlids of Lake Tanganyika follows inevitably from their ecological specialization. Moreover, the observed incongruence between mtDNA and nuclear multilocus phylogeny suggests that repeated hybridization events among quite distantly related taxa affected the diversification of this group, and introduced reticulation into their phylogeny. </p...|$|R
6000|$|Over the camp-fires Drank I with heroes, Under the Donau bank, Warm in {{the snow}} trench: Sagamen heard I there, Men of the Longbeards, Cunning and ancient, Honey-sweet-voiced. Scaring the wolf cub, Scaring the horn-owl, Shaking the snow-wreaths Down from the pine-boughs, Up to the star roof Rang out their song. Singing how Winil men, Over the ice-floes Sledging from Scanland Came unto Scoring; Singing of Gambara, Freya's beloved, Mother of Ayo, Mother of Ibor. Singing of Wendel men, Ambri and Assi; How to the Winilfolk Went they with war-words,-- 'Few are ye, strangers, And many are we: Pay us now toll and fee, Cloth-yarn, and rings, and beeves: Else at the raven's meal Bide the sharp bill's doom.' Clutching the dwarfs work then, <b>Clutching</b> the bullock's <b>shell,</b> Girding gray iron on, Forth fared the Winils all, Fared the Alruna's sons, Ayo and Ibor. Mad at heart stalked they: Loud wept the women all, Loud the Alruna wife; Sore was their need. Out of the morning land, Over the snow-drifts, Beautiful Freya came, Tripping to Scoring. White were the moorlands, And frozen before her: Green were the moorlands, And {{blooming}} behind her. Out of her gold locks Shaking the spring flowers, Out of her garments Shaking the south wind, Around in the birches Awaking the throstles, And making chaste housewives all Long for their heroes home, Loving and love-giving, Came she to Scoring. Came unto Gambara, Wisest of Valas,-- 'Vala, why weepest thou? Far in the wide-blue, High up in the Elfin-home, Heard I thy weeping.' 'Stop not my weeping, Till one can fight seven. Sons have I, heroes tall, First in the sword-play; This day at the Wendels' hands Eagles must tear them. Their mothers, thrall-weary, Must grind for the Wendels.' Wept the Alruna wife; Kissed her fair Freya:-- 'Far off in the morning land, High in Valhalla, A window stands open; Its sill is the snow-peaks, Its posts are the waterspouts, Storm-rack its lintel; Gold cloud-flakes above Are piled for the roofing, Far up to the Elfin-home, High in the wide-blue. Smiles out each morning thence Odin Allfather; From under the cloud-eaves Smiles out on the heroes, Smiles on chaste housewives all, Smiles on the brood-mares, Smiles on the smiths' work: And theirs is the sword-luck, With them is the glory,-- So Odin hath sworn it,-- Who first in the morning Shall meet him and greet him.' Still the Alruna wept:-- 'Who then shall greet him? Women alone are here: Far on the moorlands Behind the war-lindens, In vain for the bill's doom Watch Winil heroes all, One against seven.' Sweetly the Queen laughed:-- 'Hear thou my counsel now; Take to thee cunning, Beloved of Freya. Take thou thy women-folk, Maidens and wives: Over your ankles Lace on the white war-hose; Over your bosoms Link up the hard mail-nets; Over your lips Plait long tresses with cunning;-- So war-beasts full-bearded King Odin shall deem you, When off the gray sea-beach At sunrise ye greet him.' ...|$|R
