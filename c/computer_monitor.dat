5|$|HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a {{proprietary}} audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant source device, {{such as a}} display controller, to a compatible <b>computer</b> <b>monitor,</b> video projector, digital television, or digital audio device. HDMI is a digital replacement for analog video standards.|$|E
5|$|Hardware {{requirements}} for the product depend on the operating system; on a computer running Windows Vista or Windows 7, it requires a 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, a <b>computer</b> <b>monitor</b> with a display resolution of at least 800 Ã— 600 pixels, 200MB of free hard disk space and an Internet connection.|$|E

Watson, represented by a <b>computer</b> <b>monitor</b> display and artificial voice, responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category, a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible. Watson's guess at the Daily Double location was correct. At {{the end of the}} first round, Watson was tied with Rutter at $5,000; Jennings had $2,000.|$|E
50|$|The term is {{primarily}} used for CRTs, especially televisions in 50 Hz countries (PAL or SECAM) and <b>computer</b> <b>monitors</b> from the 1990s and early 2000s - the 50 Hz rate of PAL/SECAM video (compared with 60 Hz NTSC video) {{and the relatively}} large <b>computer</b> <b>monitors</b> and close viewing distances of 1990s/2000s <b>computer</b> <b>monitors</b> (hence making more of the screen in the viewer's peripheral vision) make flicker most noticeable on these devices.|$|R

25|$|The HDMI {{interface}} is {{a compact}} audio/video interface for transferring uncompressed video data and compressed/uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant device to a compatible <b>computer</b> <b>monitor,</b> video projector, digital television, or digital audio device. It is mainly {{used in the}} consumer area, but increasingly used in professional devices including uncompressed video, often called clean HDMI.|$|E
25|$|A {{video game}} is an {{electronic}} game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback {{on a video}} device such as a TV screen or <b>computer</b> <b>monitor.</b> The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.|$|E

25|$|The {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube that {{contains}} one or more electron guns and a phosphorescent screen, and is used to display images. It modulates, accelerates, and deflects electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television, <b>computer</b> <b>monitor),</b> radar targets, or others. CRTs have also been used as memory devices, {{in which case the}} visible light emitted from the fluorescent material (if any) is not intended to have significant meaning to a visual observer (though the visible pattern on the tube face may cryptically represent the stored data).|$|E

50|$|Until about 2003, most <b>computer</b> <b>{{monitors}}</b> had a 4:3 {{aspect ratio}} and some had 5:4. Between 2003 and 2006, monitors with 16:10 aspect ratio became commonly available, first in laptops and later also in standalone <b>computer</b> <b>monitors.</b> Reasons for this transition was productive uses for such monitors, i.e. besides widescreen movie viewing and computer game play, are {{the word processor}} display of two standard letter pages side by side, as well as CAD displays of large-size drawings and CAD application menus at the same time. 16:10 became the most common sold aspect ratio for widescreen <b>computer</b> <b>monitors</b> until 2008.|$|R

Road bicycles have their frames measured in centimetres, while off-road bicycles have their frames measured in inches. The size (diagonal) of television and <b>computer</b> <b>monitor</b> screens is always denominated in inches. Food sold by length or width e.g. pizzas or sandwiches, is generally sold in inches. Clothing is always sized in inches, with the metric equivalent often shown as a small supplementary indicator. Gas is usually measured by the cubic foot or cubic metre, but is billed like electricity by the kilowatt hour.|$|E
25|$|A {{photograph}} of Zehaf-Bibeau {{was taken by}} a tourist at the war memorial during the shootings. It shows him holding the rifle and wearing a scarf over part of his face, with part of the War Memorial behind him. Ottawa police seized the camera and then took their own {{photograph of}} the image using a cellphone. French-Canadian journalist William Reymond received {{a copy of the}} photograph via the Internet, anonymously, apparently a copy of a tweet originating from the Ottawa Police of the cellphone picture. Reymond then took a picture of the image as it was displayed on his <b>computer</b> <b>monitor</b> and posted it to Twitter a few hours later after confirming the image. The image was re-tweeted by an ISIL sympathizer, leading to erroneous media reports that the image originated from an ISIL Twitter account.|$|E
25|$|If {{passwords}} {{are written}} down, they {{should never be}} kept in obvious places such as address books, Rolodex files, under drawers or keyboards, or behind pictures. Perhaps the worst, but all too common, location is a Post-It note on the <b>computer</b> <b>monitor.</b> Better locations are a safe deposit box or a locked file approved for information of sensitivity comparable to that protected by the password. Most locks on office file cabinets are far from adequate. Software is available for popular hand-held computers that can store passwords for numerous accounts in encrypted form. Another approach is to encrypt by hand on paper and remember the encryption method and key. And another approach {{is to use a}} single password or slightly varying passwords for low-security accounts and select distinctly separate strong passwords for a smaller number of high-value applications such as for online banking.|$|E

Common {{controllers}} include gamepads, joysticks, mouse devices, keyboards, the touchscreens of mobile devices, and buttons, or even, with the Kinect sensor, a person's hands and body. Players typically view {{the game on}} a video screen or television or <b>computer</b> <b>monitor,</b> or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles. There are often game sound effects, music and, in the 2010s, voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones. Some games in the 2000s include haptic, vibration-creating effects, force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets. In the 2010s, the video game industry is of increasing commercial importance, with growth driven particularly by the emerging Asian markets and mobile games, which are played on smartphones. As of 2015, video games generated sales of USD 74 billion annually worldwide, and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable TV.|$|E
25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and <b>computer</b> <b>monitor</b> where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows {{everything there is to know}} about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E
25|$|When {{the primary}} {{electron}} beam {{interacts with the}} sample, the electrons lose energy by repeated random scattering and absorption within a teardrop-shaped volume of the specimen known as the interaction volume, which extends from less than 100nm to approximately 5Âµm into the surface. The size of the interaction volume depends on the electron's landing energy, the atomic number of the specimen and the specimen's density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample results in the reflection of high-energy electrons by elastic scattering, emission of secondary electrons by inelastic scattering and the emission of electromagnetic radiation, each {{of which can be}} detected by specialized detectors. The beam current absorbed by the specimen can also be detected and used to create images of the distribution of specimen current. Electronic amplifiers of various types are used to amplify the signals, which are displayed as variations in brightness on a <b>computer</b> <b>monitor</b> (or, for vintage models, on a cathode ray tube). Each pixel of computer video memory is synchronized with the position of the beam on the specimen in the microscope, and the resulting image is therefore a distribution map of the intensity of the signal being emitted from the scanned area of the specimen. In older microscopes images may be captured by photography from a high-resolution cathode ray tube, but in modern machines they are digitised and saved as digital images.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology {{relies on the}} rotation of the axis of linear polarization by the liquid crystal array. Light from the backlight (or the back reflective layer, in devices not including or requiring a backlight) first passes through a linear polarizing sheet. That polarized light passes through the actual liquid crystal layer which may be organized in pixels (for a TV or <b>computer</b> <b>monitor)</b> or in another format such as a seven-segment display or one with custom symbols for a particular product. The liquid crystal layer is produced with a consistent right (or left) handed chirality, essentially consisting of tiny helices. This causes circular birefringence, and is engineered so that there is a 90 degree rotation of the linear polarization state. However, when a voltage is applied across a cell, the molecules straighten out, lessening or totally losing the circular birefringence. On the viewing side of the display is another linear polarizing sheet, usually oriented at 90 degrees from the one behind the active layer. Therefore, when the circular birefringence is removed by the application of a sufficient voltage, the polarization of the transmitted light remains at right angles to the front polarizer, and the pixel appears dark. With no voltage, however, the 90 degree rotation of the polarization causes it to exactly match the axis of the front polarizer, allowing the light through. Intermediate voltages create intermediate rotation of the polarization axis and the pixel has an intermediate intensity. Displays based on this principle are widespread, and now are used {{in the vast majority of}} televisions, computer monitors and video projectors, rendering the previous CRT technology essentially obsolete. The use of polarization in the operation of LCD displays is immediately apparent to someone wearing polarized sunglasses, often making the display unreadable.|$|E
500|$|Animation for {{the film}} began in January 2006, with the Itchy & Scratchy short being the first scene to be storyboarded. Groening {{rejected}} making either a live-action or a CGI film, calling the film's animation [...] "deliberately imperfect" [...] and [...] "a tribute {{to the art of}} hand-drawn animation". The film was produced in a widescreen [...] aspect ratio, to distinguish it from the look of the television series, and colored with the largest palette the animators had ever had available to them. A lot of the animation was produced using Wacom Cintiq tablets, which allowed images to be drawn directly onto a <b>computer</b> <b>monitor</b> to facilitate production. Animation production work was divided among four studios around the world: Film Roman in Burbank, California, Rough Draft Studios in Glendale, California, and AKOM and Rough Draft's division in Seoul, South Korea. As with the television series, the storyboarding, characters, background layout, and animatic parts of production, were done in America. The overseas studios completed the inbetweening, digital ink and paint, and rendered the animation to tape before being shipped back to the United States.|$|E
500|$|Unlike older {{game shows}} whose sets are or were {{designed}} to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, Millionaires set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show. The floor is made of Plexiglas beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper. Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs {{in the center of}} the stage, known as [...] "Hot Seats"; these measured [...] high, were modeled after chairs typically found in hair salons, and each seat featured a <b>computer</b> <b>monitor</b> directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to Millionaire, Vieira stated in an interview with her Millionaire predecessor on his morning talk show that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.|$|E
