One <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> the processes that might occur in the future, but one is really always writing about the present {{because that is what}} we know. It's largely an image of television as I know it". Sean Day-Lewis, writing in The Daily Telegraph, hailed the programme as a [...] "highly original play written with great force and making as many valid points about the dangers of the future as any science fiction I can remember—including 1984!". The Year of the Sex Olympics was watched by 1.5 million viewers. Audience Research Report indicated that many viewers found the play impenetrable. It was repeated on BBC1 in 1970 with 15 minutes cut from the running time, as part of The Wednesday Play strand.|$|E

U2's manager Guy Oseary also indicated that the group had future collaborations with Apple planned dealing with [...] "how music is heard and innovation". He said the band wants to support albums as an [...] "art form of artwork and lyrics and video content" [...] that will engage listeners more so than digital audio. In a 29 September 2014 cover story for Time, U2 revealed they are working with Apple to develop a new digital music format they hope will sway consumers' interest in purchasing music again. Bono described it as [...] "an audiovisual interactive format for music that can't be pirated and will bring back album artwork in the most powerful way, where you <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> the lyrics and get behind the songs". He said the format was 18 months from completion and that the group hopes it will financially benefit lesser-known music artists.|$|E
500|$|... "Circus" [...] {{was written}} by Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco and Claude Kelly, while {{produced}} by Luke and Blanco. Luke and Kelly were initially commissioned {{to work on a}} new track for Spears, and entered the studio with no concept prepared, as Kelly explained, [...] "just knowing her style and knowing what she does." [...] After Luke came up with the music, they based the song on the public's perception of her life at the time. Spears explained that after listening to [...] "Circus" [...] for the first time, she felt inspired and imagined a story behind it. She also stated, [...] " [...] put the whole album together as far as what I wanted my show to be like. You <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> a circus in so many different ways". [...] "Circus" [...] was recorded at Conway Recording Studios and Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, and at Glenwood Place Studio in Burbank, California. Background vocals were provided by Cathy Dennis, Kelly and Myah Marie. Main instrumentation was done by Luke and Blanco. The song was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia.

500|$|The game {{includes}} a two-player cooperative mode. Two players {{can use the}} same console with a split screen, or can use a separate computer or console; Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and PlayStation 3 users <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> each other regardless of platform; a patch provided in late 2012 added split-screen support for Windows and Mac OS X users under [...] "Big Picture" [...] mode. Both player-characters are robots that control separate portal guns and can use the other character's portals. Each player's portals are of a different color scheme, whereof one is blue and purple {{and the other is}} orange and red. A calibration chamber separates the characters to teach the players to use the communication tools and portals. Most later chambers are less structured and require players to use both sets of portals for laser or funnel redirection, launches, and other maneuvers. The game provides voice communication between players, and online players can temporarily enter a split-screen view to help coordinate actions. Players can [...] "ping" [...] to draw the other player's attention to walls or objects, start countdown timers for synchronized actions, and perform joint gestures such as waving or hugging.

500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. PopMatters {{described it as}} [...] "dripping with sexual energy and cool" [...] and is [...] "sexy as hell, but contains a pretty unmistakable edge of hostility, macho swagger, and thunderous chest thumping." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote {{that it was an}} [...] "appealing throwaway single" [...] and lyrics such as [...] "after you work up a sweat, you <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> the stick" [...] are not seductions; [...] "they're orders". MusicOMH wrote that the chemistry between 50 Cent and Olivia [...] "is almost as explicit as the lyrics ... the bass line is made for grinding to". Author Ethan Brown, in a review of The Massacre, called the track [...] "uninspiring" [...] and [...] "nearly identical" [...] to his previous collaboration with Lil' Kim on [...] "Magic Stick". He stated that 50 Cent seemed too content with his [...] "hypersexual image" [...] among other things and [...] "not inspired enough to work beyond the same old attention-getting schemes." [...] Pitchfork Media listed [...] "Candy Shop" [...] as a reprise of [...] "Magic Stick" [...] both [...] "in beats and in timbre", and Stylus magazine said it was [...] "more of the same" [...] as his previous collaboration. Billboard wrote that 50 Cent [...] "shows little growth lyrically" [...] with the song being [...] "typical playa-friendly fodder". The song was nominated at the 2006 Grammy Awards for Best Rap Song, but lost to Kanye West's [...] "Diamonds from Sierra Leone".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was not universally affirmative, but Richard Corliss of Time stated that Spielberg [...] "has energized each frame with allusive legerdemain and an intelligent density {{of images and}} emotions." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called the film [...] "a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable." [...] Julie Salamon of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film as [...] "an edgy, intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard's extraordinary war experience." [...] J. Hoberman from The Village Voice decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg's [...] "shamelessly kiddiecentric" [...] approach. Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction, [...] "Despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me. Maybe, like the kid, I decided that no world where you <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> airplanes can be all that bad." [...] On his TV show with Gene Siskel, Ebert said that the film [...] "is basically {{a good idea for}} a film that never gets off the ground." [...] Siskel added, [...] "I don't know what the film is about. It's so totally confused and taking things from different parts. On one hand, if it wants to say something about a child's-eye view of war, you got a movie made by John Boorman called Hope and Glory that was just released that is much better, and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children's view of war is. On the other hand, this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film, so you've got like Indiana Jones with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war. I don't know what Spielberg wanted to do." ...|$|E

String players <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> just intonation, that is, they can play specific intervals (such as fifths) exactly in tune. Moreover, string and wind players can use expressive intonation, changing the pitch of a note to create a musical or dramatic effect.

2500|$|One of Radwańska's main {{weaknesses}} is {{her lack}} of power in her serve. Her serve, especially her second serve, is generally slow and vulnerable to attack. Her shots sometimes lack penetration on court, posing little threat to power hitters. [...] "I don't think I can ever serve 200 kilometers per hour, it's just not my body," [...] Radwańska said. [...] "I {{have to do something}} else. I was just born to play like this. I have so many ideas. In your mind it's like, 'OK, I go down the line, then crosscourt, maybe drop shot.' But you have just one second, or even not one second, it just has to be automatic." [...] Radwańska merely exhales when she strikes the ball, rather than loudly grunting like many of her peers. She bounces the ball no more than four times before serving. She says she <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> any racket and likes to use one for an entire match, unlike most players, who routinely grab frames with fresh strings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{critically}} acclaimed, receiving an average rating of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on nine reviews. Q magazine regarded the album as [...] "a dramatic, wide-screen, expertly executed, even genuinely thrilling rock record worthy {{of an audience}} way beyond nu-prog's regular constituency." [...] AllMusic, which gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 score, assured that [...] "While there is no [...] "radio single" [...] on the disc most songs transcend their complex structure and feel as provocative as any traditional rock tune". David Fricke from Rolling Stone perceived Porcupine Tree had evolved into [...] "an aggressively modern merger of Rush’s arena art rock, U.K. prog classicism —especially Pink Floyd’s eulogies to madness and King Crimson’s angular majesty— and the post-grunge vengeance of Tool". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune defined the music in the album as [...] "stellar in its serpentine mood-shifting". Sound and Vision praised that [...] "Porcupine Tree is {{at the height of}} its powers" [...] and voted it #3 CD of 2007. Decibel lauded: [...] "Porcupine Tree prove they <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> the best of ’em". The Phoenix newspaper stated [...] "Fear of a Blank Planet is not only their most vintage-sounding album, it’s also their best.", Jim DeRogatis from the Chicago Sun-Times thinks the album is [...] "easily as strong as any of the band's previous eight releases, and the most timely" [...] and Revolver magazine proclaimed [...] "England’s prog princes return at their most limber and conceptually relevant". PopMatters placed it at #5 of [...] "The Best Metal Albums of 2007". Reason magazine chose it as one of the [...] "Best Albums of 2007" [...] though they were more severe than other critics about the lyrical content saying that [...] "Lyrically, it's ridiculous" [...] and [...] "if your grandma was theming a prog rock album, it'd come out something like this". Dan LeRoy from Alternative Press announced it [...] "as heavy as P-Tree have ever been" [...] but [...] "wistfully, sprawlingly melodic as well-sometimes in the same tune" [...] and concluded that [...] "if Wilson's vision of today's kids as overmedicated, overstimulated robots seems like a blatant appeal to the over-30 crowd, it's still worth setting the Xbox aside to listen".|$|E
