25|$|Food {{stocking}} can {{be viewed}} potentially as an animal planning for the future. One example of short-term stocking involves <b>climbing</b> <b>perch</b> (Anabas testudineus). Individuals were kept singly in aquaria and fed with pellets dropped at the surface. When the pellets were dropped {{one after the other}} at 1-s intervals, the fish took them as they reached the surface and stocked them inside the mouth. On average, the fish placed 7 pellets in their mouth before moving away to consume them. When starved for 24-h before the feeding test, they doubled the number of pellets stocked (14 on average); the underside of their heads bulged under the load. The behaviour may be an indication that competition for food is normally severe in this species and that any adaptation to secure food would be beneficial.|$|E

50|$|Labyrinth fish (Anabantoidei). This {{suborder}} of fish {{also use}} a labyrinth organ to breathe air. Some species from this group can move on land. Amphibious fish from this family are the <b>climbing</b> <b>perches,</b> African and Southeast Asian fish {{that are capable of}} moving from pool to pool over land by using their pectoral fins, caudal peduncle and gill covers as a means of locomotion.

50|$|The Anabantidae are {{a family}} of perciform fish {{commonly}} called the climbing gouramies or <b>climbing</b> <b>perches.</b> The family includes about 34 species. As labyrinth fishes, they possess a labyrinth organ, a structure in the fish's head which allows it to breathe atmospheric oxygen. Fish of this family are commonly seen gulping at air at {{the surface of the}} water. The air is held in a structure called the suprabranchial chamber, where oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream via the respiratory epithelium covering the labyrinth organ. This therefore allows the fish to move small distances across land.|$|R
60|$|Of all land-frequenting fish, however, by far {{the most}} famous is the {{so-called}} <b>climbing</b> <b>perch</b> of India, which not only walks bodily out of the water, but even climbs trees by means of special spines, near the head and tail, so arranged as to stick into the bark and enable it to wriggle its way up awkwardly, something after the same fashion as the 'looping' of caterpillars. The tree-climber is a small scaly fish, seldom more than seven inches long; but it has developed a special breathing apparatus to enable it to keep up the stock of oxygen on its terrestrial excursions, which may be regarded as to some extent the exact converse of the means employed by divers to supply themselves with air under water. Just above the gills, which form of course its natural hereditary breathing apparatus, the <b>climbing</b> <b>perch</b> has invented a new and wholly original water chamber, containing within it a frilled bony organ, which enables it to extract oxygen from the stored-up water during the course of its aërial peregrinations. While on shore it picks up small insects, worms, and grubs; but it also has vegetarian tastes of its own, and does not despise fruits and berries. The Indian jugglers tame the climbing perches and carry them about with them as part of their stock in trade; their ability to live for a long time out of water makes them useful confederates in many small tricks which seem very wonderful to people accustomed to believe that fish die almost at once when taken out of their native element.|$|E

500|$|The {{origin of}} bird flight itself is still hotly debated. It {{is clear that}} {{feathers}} {{must have been a}} prerequisite for flight in birds (though flight may have not been a prerequisite for feathers). There has yet to be a consensus on whether flight involved from the ground up or the trees down, and Heilmann was largely responsible for popularizing the trees-down idea early on. The modern idea of the arboreal (or trees-down) hypothesis has changed little since Heilmann's time, and it states that bird flight would have originated by climbing birds gliding down from the tops of trees, making gliding a precursor to flapping or powered flight. As these early birds became more efficient gliders, they would have begun to extend their range and capability by developing more powerful flight. In this proposed mode of bird evolution, Heilmann's [...] "Proavis" [...] is strongly implicated, which would have probably been a <b>climbing,</b> <b>perching,</b> early-stage gliding quadruped. This hypothesis for the origin of bird flight has had many adherents, including Walter J. Bock and Alan Feduccia.|$|R

40|$|Insect jumping as a {{means of}} escape or rapid {{movement}} involves several different mechanisms. The most prodigious jumpers are orthopterans such as locusts, which use large, specialised hind legs to generate and then store the 9 – 11 mJ of energy needed to propel the body off the ground in 30 ms at a take-off velocity of 3. 2 m s– 1 and to displace the body by as much as 1 m (Bennet-Clark, 1975; Brown, 1967). Fleas store the energy developed by large depressor muscles in the hind legs (Bennet-Clark and Lucey, 1967; Rothschild et al., 1972), springtails rapidly extend an abdominal appendage (Brackenbury and Hunt, 1993) and click beetles jack-knife their body at the junction between the pro- and mesothorax (Evans, 1972, 1973). The ant Gigantiops destructor jumps by rapidly extending both the middle and hind pairs of legs while simultaneously moving the gaster (part of the abdomen) forwards and holding it there during a jump (Baroni et al., 1994; Tautz et al., 1994). This moves the centre of mass, thereby ensuring that the body does not spin during a jump, and may also provide kinetic energy to propel the body forward (Tautz et al., 1994). Stick insects usually have an elongated body shape that closely resembles the branches of plants on which they <b>climb,</b> <b>perch</b> and feed. They respond to a threat by freezing their body position – catalepsy (Bassler, 1983; Bassler and Foth, 1982; Bassler et al., 1982; Driesang and Büschges, 1993; Godden, 1974) – enabling them to remain motionless for long periods and, therefore, to become difficult for predators to detect amongst vegetation. Nevertheless, some stick insects have active defensive displays and active escape responses. In some, the hind wings and the modified front wings are raised to increase the apparent size of the insect and to reveal previously hidden patches of colour (Bedford, 1978). These movements may be accompanied by buzzing (Rehn, 1957) or swishing (Bedford and Chinnick, 1966) sounds generated by rubbing the front and hind wings together or by rubbing the two antennae together (Henry...|$|R

50|$|Dwarf bitterns feed solitarily or in pairs, hunting {{by night}} and, {{especially}} if it is cloudy, by day. This it does silently and unobtrusively by standing and by walking slowly. This daily schedule overlaps availability of frogs (Tarboton 1980, Hustler and Williamson 1985). Dwarf bitterns sometimes prefer to sneak through vegetation and reeds rather than <b>climb</b> or <b>perch</b> on them. When disturbed, they stay put at the water's edge in an exaggerated version of the bittern posture or it often fly up into trees moving only short distances. It is likely that individuals defend feeding territory, and its use of a forward display has been described (Riddell 1987).

40|$|Tunable {{adhesion}} is {{the ability}} for the same surface to have high adhesion under one set of conditions and low adhesion under another. It {{has a variety of}} applications, including transfer printing of micro- and nano-scale components, <b>climbing</b> and <b>perching</b> robots, and material handling in manufacturing. Approaches to tunable adhesion, including the work in this dissertation, often rely on van der Waals forces to achieve dry adhesion. Previous strategies for dry tunable adhesives have generally exploited complex fibrillar structures that are inspired by nature. The work in this dissertation investigates a different strategy for enhanced and tunable adhesion based on composite structures with simple geometries. ^ This dissertation examines the use of composite posts, consisting of stiff insets surrounded by a compliant shell, as an approach for achieving enhanced and tunable adhesion. This composite structure has a high effective adhesion strength under normal loading and low adhesion when shear is applied. Experiments as well as finite element (FE) analysis are used to understand the mechanics of these posts under both types of loading. The adhesion of composite posts is affected by the stress distribution at the contacting surface. Homogeneous posts have concentrated stress near the edge, facilitating crack initiation, while the composite post can result in a redistribution of this stress towards the center, resulting in higher adhesion. The basic mechanics of these posts are demonstrated through experiments on mm-scale posts. The composite mm-scale composite posts have 3 x higher adhesion than homogeneous posts under normal loading and shear displacement was shown to significantly decrease the effective adhesion strength. Micro-scale posts are studied and used in micro-transfer printing applications. These posts have an effective adhesion strength of 1. 5 MPa, and the pull-off force of the composite post is 9 x that of a homogeneous post. In both the mm-scale and micro-scale studies, the experimental results are supported by FE simulations. Arrays of micro-scale posts were fabricated and their adhesion behavior characterized. In an array, the contact of each individual post becomes less critical and can contact diverse surfaces. This work established the mechanics of composite posts for achieving enhanced and tunable adhesion. ...|$|R

He would run up the bare boughs, and give a jump, expecting to catch and swing, but the lame tail wouldn't hold him, and down he'd go, bounce on to the straw. At first he'd sit and stare about him, as if much amazed to find himself there; then he'd scratch his little round head and begin to scold violently, which seemed to delight the other monkeys; and, finally, he'd examine his poor little tail, and appear to understand the misfortune which had befallen him. The funny expression of his face was irresistible, and I enjoyed seeing him very much, and gave him a bun to comfort him when I went away.|$|R
