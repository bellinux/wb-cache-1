50|$|The E.164 {{standard}} of the International Telecommunications Union {{is an international}} numbering plan and establishes a country calling <b>code</b> (<b>country</b> code) for each member organization. Country codes are prefixes to national telephone numbers that denote call routing to the network of a subordinate number plan administration, typically a country, or group of countries with a uniform numbering plan, such as the NANP. E.164 permits a maximum length of 15 digits for the complete international phone number consisting of the country code, the national routing code (area code), and the subscriber number. E.164 does not define regional numbering plans, however, it does provide recommendations for new implementations and uniform representation of all telephone numbers.|$|E

40|$|We use {{the history}} of private limited {{liability}} companies (PLLCs) to challenge two pervasive assumptions in the literature: (1) Anglo-American legal institutions were better for economic development than continental Europe 2 ̆ 019 s civil-law institutions; and (2) the corporation was the superior form of business organization. Data on the number and types of firms organized in France, Germany, the UK, and the US show that that the PLLC became the form of choice for small- and medium-size enterprises wherever and whenever it was introduced. The PLLC's key advantage was its flexible internal governance rules that allowed its users to limit the threat of untimely dissolution inherent in partnerships without taking on the full danger of minority oppression that the corporation entailed. The PLLC was first successfully introduced in Germany, a <b>code</b> <b>country,</b> in 1892. Great Britain, a common-law country followed in 1907, and France, a <b>code</b> <b>country,</b> in 1925.

The core theorem shows that a binary classification regret of r on the induced binary problem implies an AUC regret of at most 4 r. (The binary problem is to predict, given a random pair of elements being ranked, whether the first element should be ordered before the second.) This is a large improvement over naive approaches such as ordering according to regressed scores, which has a regret transform of r → nr where n is the number of elements. ...|$|E
40|$|Address City, State/Province, Postal <b>Code,</b> <b>Country</b> email We view a dataset {{as having}} an {{underlying}} unknown tree structure and exploit this assumption in learning. This tree dependent identically distributed or tdid assumption preserves exchangeability and naturally generalizes iid assumptions. Each datum is sampled sequentially after being conditioned on an unknown parent. The resulting tdid likelihood of data is the determinant of a Laplacian of pairwise conditional distributions evaluations. Variants of tdid likelihood cover undirected and directed trees and can also reduce to iid likelihood (a simple product) when conditionals become independent. These build upon the graph Laplacian, a sufficient statistic that captures a distribution over tree structures for improved inference over standard point-estimates of structure. The tdid assumption leads to novel maximum likelihood estimators and inference methods. ...|$|E

It requires that the output of a clustering function is independent of the labels of the data points. Definition 1. A clustering function F is isomorphism invariant if whenever (X, d) ∼ (X ′, d ′), then, for every k, F (X, d, k) and F (X ′, d ′, k) are isomorphic clusterings. 1. 2 Scale invariance Scale invariance, proposed by Kleinberg [8], requires that the output of a clustering be invariant to uniform scaling of the data. Definition 2. A clustering function F is scale invariant if for any data sets d and d ′, if there exists a real number c> 0 so that for all x, y ∈ X, d(x, y) = c ˙ d ′(x, y) then for every 1 � k � |X|...|$|E
40|$|Address City, State/Province, Postal <b>Code,</b> <b>Country</b> email The {{problem of}} {{discovering}} low dimensional representations arises in such diverse fields of engineering as robot navigation, protein clustering, shape recognition, and sensor localization. Recently, researchers {{in all these}} areas have converged on common solutions using methods from convex optimization. In particular, many results have been obtained by constructing semidefinite programs (SDPs) with low rank solutions. While the rank of matrix variables in SDPs cannot be directly constrained, {{it has been observed}} that low rank solutions emerge naturally by computing high variance or maximal trace solutions that respect local distance constraints. In this paper, we show how to solve very large problems of this type by a matrix factorization that leads to much smaller SDPs than those previously studied. The matrix factorization is derived by expanding the solution of the original problem in terms of the bottom eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian. The smaller SDPs obtained from this matrix factorization yield very good approximations to solutions of the original problem. Moreover, these approximations can be further refined by conjugate gradient descent. We illustrate the approach on localization in large scale sensor networks, where optimizations involving tens of thousands of nodes can be solved in just a few minutes. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{challenges}} {{the idea that}} the corporation is a globally superior form of business organization and that the Anglo-American common-law is more conducive to economic development than the code-based legal systems characteristic of continental Europe. Although the corporation had important advantages over the main alternative form of organization (partnerships), it also had disadvantages that limited its appeal to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As a result, when businesses were provided with an intermediate choice, the private limited liability company (PLLC) that combined the advantages of legal personhood and joint stock with a flexible internal organizational structure, most chose not to organize as corporations. This article tracks the changes that occurred in the menu of business organizational forms in two common-law countries (the UK and the US) and two countries governed by legal codes (France and Germany) and presents data showing the rapidity with which firms in each country responded to enabling legislation for PLLCs. We show that the PLLC was introduced first and most easily in a <b>code</b> <b>country</b> (Germany) and last and with the most difficulty in a common-law country (the US). Late introduction was associated with prolonged use of the partnership form, suggesting that the disadvantages of corporations did indeed weigh heavily on SMEs. ...|$|E

40|$|A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, {{a menace}} to the {{availability}} of resources and service to the intended user, is usually by augmenting the traffic in the communication medium. These attacks originate in either ways, internal or external to a network with the aim to suspend the legitimate user from getting his/her service. The DoS attacks have been countered through various approaches, yet this problem remains stable in field. The traceback mechanisms of the attacker necessitate {{a large amount of}} valuable information which is usually hidden by the attacker or not documented in the network. Moreover the network has strict constraints over the usage of memory resources by the nodes and routers, equivalent to an empty memory nature. The amount of data reasonably required for computation would increase the processing delay which is usually unexpected. The counter measures proposed tried to detect the network under attack or to track the attacker with some degree of information available. Nowadays these attacks have evolved to break out from all those detection approaches with greater immunity to not reveal their identity. This study works with the physical zone addresses to detect and traceback the identity of the attacker. The packet sent from the attacker carries merely the part of its identity. Yet the Provincial Assessment Attributes (PAA) possesses the geographical locality aspects in terms of Continent <b>Code,</b> <b>Country</b> Code, State Codes and the Area Codes along with its IP address. Accepting the factor that IP is spoofed in most cases, the routers in the path are still able to keep track of these PAA prospects irrespective of the faked IP. Hence this mechanism could be implemented with minimal computation, leading to the attacker with considerable and fruitful results in identifying the same. Besides, this method takes deep care to authenticate and not to affect the traffic of legitimate users...|$|E
