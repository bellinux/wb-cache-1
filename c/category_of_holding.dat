40|$|The {{scope of}} Supreme Court {{precedent}} is capacious. Justices of the Court commonly defer to sweeping rationales and elaborate doctrinal frameworks articulated by their predecessors. This practice infuses judicial precedent with the prescriptive power of enacted constitutional and statutory text. The lower federal courts follow suit, regularly abiding by the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s broad pronouncements. These phenomena cannot be explained by—and, indeed, oftentimes subvert—the classic distinction between binding holdings and dispensable dicta. This Article connects {{the scope of}} precedent with recurring and foundational debates about the proper ends of judicial interpretation. A precedent 2 ̆ 7 s forward-looking effect should {{not depend on the}} superficial <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> and dictum. Instead, it should reflect deeper normative commitments that define the nature of adjudication within American legal culture. The account that emerges is one in which the scope of precedent is inextricably linked to interpretive theory and constitutional understandings. Divergent methods of interpretation, from originalism to common law constitutionalism and beyond, carry distinctive implications for describing a precedent 2 ̆ 7 s constraining effect. So, too, do various methods of interpretation in the statutory and common law contexts. Ultimately, what should determine the scope of precedent is the set of premises—regarding the judicial role, the separation of powers, and the relevance of history, morality, and policy—that informs a judge 2 ̆ 7 s methodological choices...|$|R

In this paper we consider rational curves with no restrictions on the normalization map pi. If U is an open affine subset of X, it is well-known that D(U) has a unique, minimal non-zero ideal J(U). And so the ring structure of D(U) {{is determined by the}} factor F(U) = D(U) /J(U) as described by K. A. Brown (Math. Z. 206, 1991, 424 - 442). If we let U 0 be an open affine subset of X containing all the singular points, we have the following: THEOREM A. If L has sufficiently high degree, then[formula], where JL(X) is the unique minimal non-zero ideal of DL(X) and F(U 0) = DU 0) / J(U 0) is as described above.

40|$|Neurotrophic {{factors are}} {{proteins}} that promote the survival and differentiation of specific neuronal popula-tions. With the successful cloning and large-scale production {{of many different}} neurotrophic factors, it has become practical to consider their application {{in the treatment of}} neurological disease. Several <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> neurotrophic factors <b>hold</b> particular promise for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy in the near future. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential utility of factors like nerve growth factor for the treatment of small-fiber peripheral neuropathy and, possibly, compressive sensory neuropathies. Brain-derived neu-rotrophic factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and insulin-like growth factor-I are likely to be applied in the treatment of motor neuropathy. Neurotrophin- 3 has particular promise for the treatment of large-fiber sensory neuropathy. Although, for the most part, neurotrophic factors do not appear to have major toxicity, they represent a new class of drugs and clinical trials must proceed with caution.

40|$|The {{integration}} of huge, disparate information sources {{has been an}} outstanding issue {{for more than a}} decade. Having realized that the dissimilarity of sources even with the same or related subject is manifold and difficult to tackle, constructing mediators and wrappers has become the common practice. Although under certain circumstances this approach delivers satisfactory results, it lacks the most important property: scalability. Furthermore, it gives no support for discovering similarity, which is often needed whenever no exact match can be returned for a particular search condition. For these reasons we address the problem of true unification of data sources in the present paper. We assume that the sources share a common schema, i. e. the main objective is the identification of compatible or identical entities. Our novel method accomplishes this task by automatically establishing a catalogue of data elements. Each <b>category</b> <b>of</b> the catalogue <b>holds</b> a set <b>of</b> compatible or identical items. This organization structure has two advantages: there is an intrinsic, fast lookup method, and similarity among data elements can be defined.

40|$|Minnie Bruce Pratt {{describes}} what femme means {{to her when}} she says “For me, femme is a place of resistance to [that] degradation, a place to divest femininity of limiting stereotypes, and a place to assert the power and dignity of femaleness” (Pratt 197). Femme has often been charged with reinforcing outdated and un-feminist stereotypes of women, especially when femme is paired with butch. A femme/butch pairing has been accused of imitating heterosexuality, or at best, heteronormativity. These ways of understanding femme are predicated on the idea of the femme as the butch’s other half, but femme exists on its own. Pratt, like many self-identified femmes, finds a queer femme identity to be empowering: “a place of resistance. ” How, then does a woman who is performing femininity do this? To brush aside a queer femme as imitative of straight women, as ‘passing’ in order to access heterosexual privilege at the expense of a butch counterpart is overly simplistic. Furthermore, if we continue to locate the subversion of femininity on butch dykes or masculine lesbians, we reify the old <b>category</b> <b>of</b> ‘woman’ while <b>holding</b> up ‘woman’ as weak and a natural, fixed category. This occurs when we look at visibly butch lesbians and call their femininity subversive because it is not concerned with stereotypically feminine ways of being like submissiveness or weakness thus relegating traits like these to the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> woman. This way of thinking reproduces the patriarchal discourse that exists in the dominant culture within queer communities. It is problematic in that it leads to the devaluing of queer femmes as a result of reading feminine appearance without a critical eye through the lens of misogyny...|$|R
