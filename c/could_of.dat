5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was a problem at the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water <b>could</b> <b>of</b> course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E
5|$|Ranked wing {{commander}} at {{the outbreak of}} World WarII, Wackett immediately faced major supply challenges {{in his role as}} Director of Technical Services. Spare parts for the RAAF's mainly British-built equipment were now in short supply, a fact complicated by the infancy of the local aircraft industry and a US arms embargo. His directorate made whatever use it <b>could</b> <b>of</b> civilian repair facilities, setting up central recovery depots to salvage spares from damaged aircraft and other equipment. He also drew on the advice and support of his brother Lawrence, who had established the RAAF's technical services organisation in the 1920s and now, having retired from the Air Force, headed the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC). By late 1940, Wackett had been promoted temporary group captain, and joined the Flying Personnel Research Committee. Its members, drawn from the aviation, medical, scientific and technical disciplines, were to study and report upon such factors as aircrew safety, comfort, fatigue, survival, motion sickness, decompression and hypoxia.|$|E

5|$|Shaw {{explored}} what he <b>could</b> <b>of</b> {{the western}} workings, before {{he and some}} of the survivors began tackling the fire. The water pipes from the surface in the Lancaster shaft were all fractured, and hand-extinguishers were used. Shaw returned to the surface at 9:30am to arrange for rescue and fire-fighting teams from neighbouring collieries. From 11:00am the specialist mines rescue teams began arriving at the colliery from the Rhymney and Rhondda Valleys, as did Red Cross workers and local ambulance services; a police detachment was sent from Cardiff in a special train. Members of the Inspectorate of Mines were quickly on the scene, and an inspector descended to view the mine the same morning.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} image {{gave the}} first hint that comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was an unusual comet, as it appeared to show multiple nuclei in an elongated region about 50arcseconds long and 10arcseconds wide. Brian G. Marsden of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams noted that the comet lay only about 4degrees from Jupiter as seen from Earth, and that although this <b>could</b> <b>of</b> course be a line of sight effect, its apparent motion in the sky suggested that it was physically close to it. Because of this, he suggested that the Shoemakers and David Levy had discovered the fragments of a comet that had been disrupted by Jupiter's gravity.|$|E

25|$|Eugene Nagel {{became aware}} of Pantridge's work in 1967. He {{believed}} that the physician-staffed model of prehospital care {{was not going to}} work for the United States in general or for Miami in particular. Physicians were too expensive to sit around fire stations waiting for calls, and if they had to be picked up in hospitals, it would take too long to arrive at the scene. When Nagel or his colleague James Hirschman, rode on the ambulance themselves they <b>could,</b> <b>of</b> course, defibrillate and provide medications, but they could not be present on all shifts. Nagel became convinced {{it was time to move}} away from a program using physicians to one staffed by paramedics.|$|E
25|$|For {{nine weeks}} Riou and his small crew navigated the Guardian, by now {{little more than}} a raft, across the 400 leagues to the Cape of Good Hope. The Cape of Good Hope was sighted on 21 February 1790, and whalers were {{despatched}} from Table Bay to help the battered ship to safety. On 15 March Riou sent a letter from Table Bay expressing his intent to try reach Saldanha Bay, there to moor close to the shore to preserve what he <b>could</b> <b>of</b> the vessel and cargo. The letter also included a list of the 61 men and one woman (Elizabeth Schafer, daughter of one of the Superintendents of Convicts) on board Guardian.|$|E

Madame Esmit had rightly decided {{that she could be}} more useful in Copenhagen than in St. Thomas and had started on her journey before Milan arrived. By this time, matters had grown rather beyond her power of control despite all her influential friends and her genius for intrigue, so she confined herself to taking measures to save what she <b>could</b> <b>of</b> the family property. She returned to St. Thomas in December to share the hardships of prison life with her husband.|$|E

25|$|Robert's son Sir Harry Munro, 7th Baronet, {{who served}} as an officer in Loudon's Highlanders, had been {{captured}} at the Battle of Prestonpans in September 1745. He returned home to find Foulis Castle had been partially destroyed by Jacobites after the Battle of Falkirk. A few months after Falkirk the Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden by government forces. After the rising was suppressed, a Munro Independent Company under Harry continued to police the Highlands but was disbanded in 1748. Harry set about rebuilding the castle as it is today, incorporating what he <b>could</b> <b>of</b> the original building which now appears as a mansion house built in a formal Georgian style rather than the defensive fort it once was.|$|E
25|$|Parma {{ordered a}} redoubt thrown {{up on the}} closest margin of the river. On the {{opposite}} bank he constructed another and planted artillery with a force of eight hundred Flemish soldiers under the Count of Bossu in the one and {{an equal number of}} Walloons in the other. He collected all the flatboats, ferries and rafts that could be found and at Rouen and then under cover of his forts he transported all the Flemish infantry and the Spanish, French and Italian cavalry during the night of 22 May to the opposite bank of the Seine. At the same time batteries were erected along the banks to keep off the Dutch fleet. Next morning he sent up all the artillery together with the Flemish cavalry to Rouen making use of what he <b>could</b> <b>of</b> the broken arches of the destroyed bridge in order to shorten the distance from shore to shore. With this he managed to convey his whole army with all its trains across the river. A force was left behind up to the last moment to engage in skirmishes and to display themselves as largely as possible for the purpose of distracting the King's force. The young Prince of Parma Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma had command of this rearguard and the escape was successful.|$|E

500|$|Since he {{was working}} with a largely non-professional cast, Forman's {{operating}} procedure was never to share the script with any of the performers, because if he had given them the screenplay, [...] "they’ll take it home to read, and their wives will end up directing your movie". [...] Instead, he chose to explain each scene in great detail just before starting to shoot takes, reciting the dialog from memory only one time, so that when the camera was rolling the actors had to try to remember as much as they <b>could</b> <b>of</b> what he had told them and then improvise {{to the best of their}} ability what they had forgotten or only half-understood. His cameraman was later to say that, as a result, all the performers were playing Miloš Forman playing their roles.|$|E
500|$|Espenson {{said that}} this was one of their most love-centered episodes; when they {{realized}} {{it was going to be}} airing near Valentine's Day, they decided to [...] "lean into" [...] this theme. Unusual for Once Upon a Time, the theme of this episode changed during the writing process. It was initially meant to center on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love. However, as Espenson went through drafts and discussed them with others, she decided that Rumpelstiltskin might think he is doing this, but really his actions are motivated by not believing that he is worthy of love at all. In the interest of time, Espenson was forced to edit out many plot points, including a failed escape attempt by Belle. Despite this, she sought to trim down more time from the Storybrooke scenes and [...] "preserve as much as we <b>could</b> <b>of</b> the fairy tale side," [...] as the Belle-Rumpelstiltskin relationship was a love story that needed time to grow in order to be believable.|$|E

The salvage party found the Alder Creek tents empty except for the body of George Donner, who had died only days earlier. On {{their way back to}} Truckee Lake, they found Lewis Keseberg alive. According to him, Mrs. Murphy had died a week after the departure of the third relief. Some weeks later, Tamsen Donner had arrived at his cabin on her way over the pass, soaked and visibly upset. Keseberg said that he put a blanket around her and told her to start out in the morning, but she died during the night.|$|E
