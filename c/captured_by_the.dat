5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Medusa and Arcona were converted into floating anti-aircraft batteries and defended German ports from 1940 {{to the end of}} the war, when they were scuttled by their crews on 3 May 1945. Amazone meanwhile remained in service as a barracks ship through the end of the war. Dalmacija was <b>captured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Italians after the Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, renamed Cattaro, and pressed into service with the Italian Navy. She was then <b>captured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Germans after the Italian surrender in September 1943, and returned to her original name, Niobe. The ship ran aground in the Adriatic in December 1943 and was destroyed by a pair of British Motor Torpedo Boats. Niobe, Medusa, and Arcona were broken up for scrap in the late 1940s, but Amazone lingered on as a barracks ship until 1954, when she too was sold for scrapping.|$|E

Two were scuttled by their crews {{at the time of the}} Italian capitulation in September 1943, and the remaining four were <b>captured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Germans and renamed.

5|$|The Japanese military's {{efforts to}} defend Singapore from air attack were unsuccessful. Due to the weak {{state of the}} island's air defences, only nine B-29s were shot down during the American campaign, all of them during {{daylight}} raids. Minesweeping operations were also slow, and it took three weeks to declare the port safe after each Allied minelaying raid. The surviving crew members of the American bombers that were shot down met varying fates; a small number linked up with resistance movements such as the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army, while others were <b>captured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Japanese and held in harsh conditions. Those who were <b>captured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> IJN and held at the Naval Base were beheaded. After the war, the Japanese personnel believed responsible for atrocities against these prisoners were tried during the Seletar War Crimes Trials and those found guilty were executed or served long prison sentences.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{influence}} gradually penetrated {{into the}} region by the early 19th century. The Erivan Khanate, in which Etchmiadzin was located, became an arena for rivalry between the Russian and Persian empires. During the Russo-Persian War (1804–13), Etchmiadzin was twice <b>captured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Russian troops led by General Pavel Tsitsianov, first in 1804 and then again in 1806. However, Russia returned it to Persia by the 1813 Treaty of Gulistan. On 13 April 1827, during the Russo-Persian War (1826–28), Etchmiadzin was <b>captured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Russian General Ivan Paskevich's troops without fight and was formally annexed by Russia, with the Persian-controlled parts of Armenia, roughly corresponding to {{the territory of the}} modern Republic of Armenia (also known as Eastern Armenia), according to the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay.|$|E
