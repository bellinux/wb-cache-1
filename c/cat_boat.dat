5000|$|A Beetle Cat is a 12 ft catboat first {{built in}} 1920 in New Bedford, Massachusetts {{by members of}} the Beetle family. Over 4,000 have been built. Beetle, Inc., now in Wareham, Massachusetts, is the sole builder of Beetle <b>Cat</b> <b>boats.</b> [...] Famous owners include or have {{included}} Senator John Kerry, Jacqueline Onassis, who had one shipped to Greece in 1969 for John F.

50|$|A catboat (or <b>cat</b> <b>boat),</b> is a sailboat, with {{a single}} sail on a single mast set well forward in {{the bow of the}} boat. Most have a shallow draft, with centreboards, {{although}} some have a keel.|$|E
50|$|The Beetle Cat {{is named}} after its designer, John Beetle, who drew the lines for the {{pleasure}} boat in 1920. The 12 ft, gaff-rigged boat's design {{was based on the}} 20 to 30 ft catboats used for shallow water fishing along Cape Cod. With interest in the Beetle Cat and the demise of the whaling industry, the family shifted production to the Beetle <b>Cat</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|E

The regatta schedule augments the local racing schedules of individual yacht clubs. There is also a fleet on Georgica Pond, in the Hamptons, where half the fleet consists of Barnstable <b>Cat</b> <b>Boats.</b> Seymour Ingraham introduced the first Beetle Cat, the Hispaniola, to Georgica Pond {{in the summer of}} 1966. Center Harbor Yacht Club in Brooklin, Maine has a fleet of Beetle Cats.|$|R

50|$|Inland Cat is a {{class of}} one- or two-man sailboats, almost {{exclusively}} found on Lake George, Indiana/Michigan. The craft is approximately 14.5 feet in length, with a 4.5 foot beam. The sail is a Marconi rig (aka Bermuda rig), with the mast far forward on the hull, as is the norm for a <b>cat</b> <b>boat.</b> The boat has a retractable galvanized steel centerboard, and a shallow-draft aluminum rudder similar in shape to New England-style cat boats. The design was created by Norm Bell and John Larimore in the mid-1950s and used then-current polyester resin and fiberglass construction techniques. The boat was perhaps over-engineered, and is quite robustly built. Many examples, including hull #2 (the second production boat) continue to race every Saturday during the summer months.|$|E
50|$|In 1925, {{two local}} bankers, Bruce Sharpe and Charlie Towne, {{purchased}} a 14-foot <b>cat</b> <b>boat</b> and began sailing it on Monterey Bay out of Santa Cruz, California. Their sailing enthusiasm was noticed {{and they were}} soon joined by local merchant Sam Leask Jr. after which they joined the nearest yacht club, the San Francisco Yacht Club, which was located at Sausalito Cove. Soon after they joined, the overcrowded conditions in the cove led to a movement to relocate the clubhouse. The membership, however, was deeply divided as to whether to move the club to Belvedere Cove or to a site on the San Francisco waterfront. A majority favored the Marin site and the clubhouse was relocated. The remainder of the members split from the club and formed the St. Francis Yacht Club on the Marina. The trio from Santa Cruz had friends {{on both sides of}} the schism and rather than choose sides, Sharpe put forth the idea of starting a yacht club closer to home.|$|E
5000|$|In 1924 what is {{believed}} to be the first Women’s Championship in the world, certainly in North America, was sailed at the Hull Station of the Boston YC. Teams of 2 women sailed in 14’ Marconi rigged <b>cat</b> <b>boats.</b> The winner received the Hodder Cup, donated by Rear Commodore James R Hodder. By 1928 this cup was retired and Charles F. Adams donated a new cup, the Adams Cup in honor of his mother. The Adams Cup is still awarded today by US Sailing to the top US Women’s Team ...|$|R
50|$|The TriFoiler is {{the fastest}} {{production}} sailboat ever created, with Russel Long sailing a TriFoiler to a Class A world sailing speed record in 1992 that remains unbroken. This sailing hydrofoil stands as the most unusual of Hobie <b>Cat's</b> <b>boats.</b> Designed by the brothers Greg and Dan Ketterman, this trimaran has two sails, one on each ama, and hydrofoils that lift the hulls {{out of the water}} at wind speeds of 10 to 11 mph, allowing the boat to reach speeds up to 45 mph and pull over 2 G in gybe turns. The TriFoiler is based on Longshot, a trimaran designed by the Kettermans and used by Russell Long to set the A class speed sailing record in 1992.|$|R
50|$|Yachting has a {{long and}} {{prolific}} history in the area. New Silver Anchorage was dredged from Wild Harbor in the 1920s to shelter Beetle <b>Cat</b> <b>boats</b> which had become popular among the Cape Cod elite. Prior to the Second World War organized sailing flourished out of Wild Harbor, however U-Boat hysteria during the war led to dwindling popularity. On August 30, 1953, the Wild Harbor Yacht Club was formed on Wickertree Road to primarily serve New Silver and its constituent communities. The Club was incorporated by the United States Sailing Association the following year. A Widgeon fleet was organized in 1979 which brought the sport of sailing back into regional popularity. The club clinched the Southern Massachusetts Beetle Cat championship in 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1989. In 1990 the club focused its junior sailing on the new 420 class racing vessels which were already popular in Europe and Australia. Wild Harbor is a regional powerhouse and dominates {{the north shore of}} Buzzards Bay and competes competitively in the Southern Massachusetts Sailing Grand Prix. Wild Harbor has produced three collegiate all-Americans {{and a member of the}} 2000 US International 470 team.|$|R
5000|$|The Getaway is {{marketed as}} a [...] "social boat" [...] and is {{designed}} with room for up to 6 people, more than Hobie <b>Cat's</b> other <b>boats.</b> The boat has a trampoline both forward and aft of the mast, {{and is the only}} rotomolded Hobie to come stock with a jib and have an available trapeze. At 16'7", the Getaway is the same length as the Hobie 16; the beam is 7'8" [...] and the mast is 25' tall. It has a D-PN of 83.3.|$|R
50|$|The Byte is 12 ft long, 4 ft {{wide and}} roughly 100 lb. The hull is {{composed}} of glass reinforced polyester and foam sandwich. The Byte is designed for sailors weighing 120 to 145 lb although most sailors weighing 90 to 160 lb should have no problems sailing this boat on a recreational basis. The Byte sail size is only 58 ft2 m2 making it the ideal boat for those sailors who enjoy the independence and simplicity of a <b>cat</b> rigged <b>boat,</b> such as the Laser, but who are not strong or heavy enough to control a large sail.|$|R
50|$|Hobie Alter will {{be remembered}} for {{creating}} the process of the foam-and-fiberglass surfboard & his subsequent creation of the Hobie <b>Cat</b> catamaran sailing <b>boat</b> line. His label, Hobie, remains one of the top-selling surfboard brands of all time. He is also the creator of the Hobie 33 ultralight-displacement sailboat and a mass-produced radio-controlled glider, the Hobie Hawk.|$|R
50|$|Arctic Cat, Inc. {{can trace}} its roots to former Polaris Industries founder Edgar Hetteen who left Polaris in 1960 and started Polar Manufacturing in Thief River Falls. Shortly after {{changing}} name to Arctic Enterprises, {{the new company}} produced snowmobiles. Arctic <b>Cat</b> purchased several <b>boat</b> manufacturers including Spirit Marine which produced the first Wetbike in 1978. A few snowless winters in the early 1980s bankrupted the 20-year-old company, which closed their facilities by 1982. In 1984, Arctic Cat was reborn under a new company name, Arctco, which was changed to Arctic Cat in 1996.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{reviewer}} Peter Yan,'Life of Pi' is {{told from}} two alternating points of view, {{the main character}} Pi in a flashback and Yann Martel himself, who is the [...] "visiting writer" [...] (Martel 101) interviewing Pi many years after the <b>cat</b> in the <b>boat</b> story. This technique of the intrusive narrator adds the documentary realism to the book, setting up, like a musical counter-point, the myth-making, unreliable narrator, Pi. The reader is left to ponder at the end whether Pi's story is an allegory of another set of parallel events.|$|R
50|$|In {{the title}} sequence, {{a man can}} be heard singing the first verse of the song Moonlight Bay. The cartoon then opens with a feline couple boating in a bay. The boy <b>cat</b> paddles the <b>boat</b> while the girl cat sings the chorus of the {{aforementioned}} song. The boy cat tells his partner that the moon is made of cheese. But the girl cat objects and says it is made of desserts and other sweet stuff. Appreciating their views, the moon becomes animated, and therefore conjures a stairway to it. The cats then walk up the steps.|$|R
5000|$|The Sol Cat 18 is {{the most}} common of the Sol <b>cat</b> family of <b>boats,</b> with the 15 and 20 foot models having very similar design. Rigging and support {{structure}} is aluminum with hulls constructed symmetrically of molded fiberglass with vacuum foam sandwich throughout. The primary difference between the Hobie 18 and the Sol Cat is the straight hull design with daggerboards, giving the Sol Cat faster speeds given better sea conditions. A number of minor differences exist between the two boats to include the centerline support beam running between the two aluminum hull supports, and the rudder spar extending forward of the mainsheet. http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=4399 ...|$|R
5000|$|Designed by Greg Goodall And Jim Boyer in {{the early}} 1980s the 4.9 meter Taipan was a {{development}} of the Mosquito catamaran, lighter than the Hobie 16, and more similar to the A class in hull design. The sail plan had a higher aspect, and it was lighter overall weight than most North American designs. Rigged and ready to sail the 4.9 weighs a minimum of 231 lb (105 kg). Other features include a wing mast, and later on a spinnaker. Like the Mosquito and Cobra class rules to sail the <b>boat</b> <b>cat</b> rigged (mainsail & more recently with spinnaker for solo sailing) or sloop rigged (Main, Jib & spinnaker for two up sailing). A modified Taipan, with some modifications such as a wider beam and a self-tacking jib, {{has become one of}} the foundation boats for the Formula 16 racing class.|$|R
60|$|And {{the hope}} was quickly fulfilled, for {{scarcely}} had another half-hour elapsed when he observed a sail--the high-peaked sail peculiar to some Mediterranean craft--rise, ghost-like, {{out of the}} driving foam and spray. The vessel was making almost straight for him; {{he knew that it}} would pass before there could be time to heave a rope. At the risk of being run down he rowed the punt in front of it, as if courting destruction, {{but at the same time}} guided his little craft so skilfully that it passed close to leeward, where the vessel's bulwarks were dipping into the water. Our middy's aim was so exact that the vessel only grazed the boat as it flew past. In that moment young Foster sprang with the agility of a <b>cat,</b> capsized the <b>boat</b> with the impulse, caught the bulwarks and rigging of the vessel, and in another moment stood panting on her deck.|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program that {{can understand the}} meaning of written English must be tremendously complex. It would break the spirit of any programmer to try to code such a program by hand; the range of meaning we can express in natural language is far too broad, too nuanced, too filled with exception. So I present UNDERSTAND, a program you can teach by example. Learning by example is an engineering expedient: it is much easier for us to come up with specific examples of a concept than some sort of perfect Platonic model. UNDERSTAND uses a technique I call Lattice-Learning to generalize accurately from just a few examples: "Robins, bees and helicopters can fly, but <b>cats,</b> worms and <b>boats</b> cannot," is enough for UNDERSTAND to narrow in on our concept of flying things: birds, insects and aircraft. It takes only 8 positive and 4 negative examples to teach UNDERSTAND how to interpret sentences as complicated as "The cat ran from the yard because a dog appeared. " UNDERSTAND is implemented in 2300 lines of Java. by Michael Tully Klein, Jr. Thesis (M. Eng.)

50|$|Arctic Cat {{was formed}} by {{snowmobile}} pioneer Edgar Hetteen in 1960 due to his departure from his previous self-started business, Polaris Industries. Like Polaris, Arctic Cat grew to become a major manufacturer of snowmobiles, watercraft, and all-terrain vehicles (ATV's). The company's first name was Polar Manufacturing but was soon changed to Arctic Enterprises. The company made their first snowmobile in 1960 and in 1970, started the Boss <b>Cat</b> line. Various <b>boat</b> manufacturers, including Silver Line, Lund and Spirit Marine, were bought to attempt to expand the company. However, Arctic Cat went bankrupt in 1982. Two years later, a new company Arctco was created to continue the production of Arctic Cat snowmobiles. The company was successful in keeping the Arctic Cat alive and in 1996 the company {{changed its name to}} Arctic Cat. The company continues to make snowmobiles as well as all-terrain vehicles and side-by-sides. Over the years, the company has attempted many other product lines including snowblowers, generators, mini bikes, and two-wheel drive vehicles. Arctic Cat relocated its headquarters, certain corporate executives, general managers, and sales and marketing personnel to Plymouth MN from Thief River Falls in 2007. In 2016, the headquarters was relocated again to a more prominent location in downtown Minneapolis. Also in 2016, most of the ATV/UTV engineering was moved to St. Cloud, MN, in the same facility that produces the Arctic Cat engines. Arctic Cat continues the majority of their manufacturing, along with snowmobile engineering, in Thief River Falls, Minnesota.|$|R
50|$|The movie {{starts with}} three dogs in a storm. The father sends his {{children}} to a safety boat while he stays on his ship. In the morning, Salty the Seagull and Echo the Dolphin notice the dogs and bring them aboard the deck. Echo goes looking for Captain Dogwood, {{the father of the}} pups. The pups introduce themselves as Andy and Tina. Salty agrees to help find their father because he knows him. The only way to get to him is with Little Toot, a tugboat who used to be the busiest and proudest until the boats got too big for him and he sat in the docks looking sorry for himself and then got all dirty and messy and become home for three cats, who make anything miserable. They plan get the rid of them by scaring them, since cats are scared of dogs. At first they got scared, but then when they realize they're just puppies, they got less impressed. They want them off Toot, but they refuse saying they need him to collect sardines. They also fret to put them overboard where a shark is, until Salty gives Toot the encouragement needs {{to get rid of the}} dogs. Toot uses his hose on the cats since they also hate water. It works and the cats runaway. They then start to clean Toot up until he was ship shape. Echo returns and tells them he's on an island shipwrecked. As Salty goes to collect his most favorite food Percy's Pelican Pickles, while the rest gets bubble gum and ice cream. Claude, the cat leader, vows to get to Little Toot get the sardines. As Salty aboards Toot, the gang travels many miles and destinations until they meant the weather lady. She proclaims that she knows what happen Dogwood, saying she made the storm because it's her job to create the weather. She warns them that she must her job to make sure the weather changes. She soon starts her weather storm and the gang battles through the weather. Meanwhile, the <b>cats</b> try to <b>boat</b> to Toot, but it was difficult to battle the weather. They call out to them, and swims back to help them. When Salty points that they're towards Skull Rocks, the cats beg to return to their boat, only for it to sink. Lucky, Echo calls out to Toot to surf. By the time they it out safely, the weather stops. The pups congraduate Toot, while Salty orders the cats to clean up Toot, much to their charging. They make it to the island and find Dogwood's ship partly wrecked but safe. While Salty and the pups go find Dogwood, Toot falls asleep and the cats use the rope to tie the captain's ship to Toot, because they think that there's sardines in the kitchen. They find Dogwood and wakes up, happy to see his kids and Salty. Suddenly the volcano starts to erupt and they get on Toot and sail out, whiles the cats manage to tie the ship and get toadded away. Lava blocks their way, but Toot has an idea. They put all the bubblegum in his mouth and he starts to blow a humongous bubble. They fly over the lava just in time. As they float back down, they all congraduate Little Toot saying there's still lots more for Little Toot and he replies that he'll never feel sorry for himself again. As for the cats, they try to find the sardines, only Dogwood to reveal that he threw them overboard to lighten the boat, much to the cats dismay. When Toot compromise that they might like the pickles they, Salty throws a fit refusing to share the pickles because he loves them then starts to talk out of control until he starts to laugh. Everyone begins to have a good laugh, except for the cats who decide eat what ever is let on the ship and depress that they don't have any sardines. As rest of gang laughs, they all head back to harbor to get ready for more adventures.|$|R
