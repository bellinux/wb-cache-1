50|$|MacRae {{was also}} {{popular in the}} game-show genre, {{appearing}} in numerous shows including: Funny You Should Ask, Match Game (60's 70's and 90's versions), What's My Line?, I've Got a Secret, Personality, Snap Judgement, He Said, She Said (with then-husband Greg Mullavey), Tattletales (also with Mullavey), Hollywood Squares, The Dating Game, To Tell the Truth, Password (ABC version), $10,000 Pyramid, $25,000 Pyramid, Break the Bank, Celebrity Whew!, Beat the <b>Clock,</b> <b>Card</b> Sharks, The Cross-Wits and Family Feud. She had even hosted an unsold game show pilot called $50,000 a Minute alongside Geoff Edwards in 1985.|$|E
50|$|Todman {{teamed up}} with Mark Goodson for radio shows. According to radio {{historian}} J. David Goldin, among their early work together was the show Treasury Salute, a program syndicated by the Treasury Department which honored military members. They later collaborated in producing game shows for radio, then moved into television, where they produced some of the longest-running game shows in history. Their many shows included Beat the <b>Clock,</b> <b>Card</b> Sharks, Family Feud, Match Game, Password, Tattletales, The Price Is Right, To Tell the Truth and What's My Line?.|$|E
50|$|The Time Master H.O. <b>clock</b> <b>card</b> from Applied Engineering was {{possibly}} the most advanced system clock ever designed for any Apple II. The card utilized an onboard VIA 6522 and was capable of emulating all other system clocks which preceded it. The Timemaster H.O. was powered by a GE Datasentry rechargeable Ni-cad battery which had a lifespan rating of 20 years. It was capable of 24&#8209;hour format or 12&#8209;hour with AM/PM format, millisecond timekeeping with an accuracy of 0.00005%, and an onboard timer which could time down any interval up to 48 days. It also maintained an internal calendar, separate of the 7&#8209;year cycle which ProDOS mapped. The Timemaster H.O. was 100% ProDOS and DOS 3.3 compatible.|$|E

50|$|The Univac 1830, Navy {{designated}} CP-823/U, was {{a digital}} electronic computing machine which received problems and data and processed answers in numerical form. It used parallel binary arithmetic and logic operations; word length was 30 bits. All of the Central Processor (C.P.) logic and I/O logic control was microelectronic circuitry, constructed of integrated, monolithic semiconductor elements (resistors, {{diodes and transistors}} contained within a single chip of silicon). Logic cards that were not microelectronic are the Master <b>Clock</b> <b>cards</b> in the C.P and the Input amplifier and output data driver cards in the I/O units.|$|R

5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of modern production control and standard cost accounting in the 1920s the traditional time books became obsolete, as Herman M. Grasselt (1925), an authority in the Paper Making trade, explained: The old- fashioned time-book {{has no place in}} modern industry; time-recorder and individual weekly In-and-Out Clock Cards are the only proficient means to obtain accurate data. Each department is to be assigned a certain [...] "block" [...] of employees' clock numbers, with sufficient allowance for additions, according to the flow of operations. Within the respective departments, each employee receives a definite <b>clock</b> <b>card</b> number, which remains with him as long as he is in a certain department or with the company. The time cards are placed in [...] "In and Out" [...] racks beside the time.|$|E
5000|$|B.P.R.D. - Released on April 4, 2007, this Action Pack {{features}} 7 figures representing {{characters from}} the Dark Horse comic book series Hellboy and the B.P.R.D. (Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense): Hellboy, Liz Sherman, Abe Sapien, Hellbaby, Johann Kraus, Ben Daimio, and Roger the Homunculus. This {{was the first}} officially [...] "dual-branded" [...] set released under the HorrorClix label, being designed for use in both HeroClix and HorrorClix. The dials feature HeroClix symbols and powers, as well as monster cards that make the figures usable in HorrorClix games. The action pack was released with numerous errors including missing numbers and Johann Kraus mistakenly having a flight stand; although WizKids eventually put forth a program for exchanging the defective Johann for a corrected version and included a new ticking <b>clock</b> <b>card</b> for HorrorClix and a new battlefield condition card for HeroClix.|$|E
5000|$|FremantleMedia has {{a library}} of game shows, {{spanning}} 154 series and an estimated 40,000 episodes overall, but {{only a small amount}} of shows form BUZZR's core programming. The network's claimed initial lineup - with series produced from the 1950s to 2000 - includes such programs as To Tell the Truth, Password, Family Feud (encompassing episodes beginning with Richard Dawson as host and dating up to John O'Hurley's tenure), Let's Make a Deal (from Monty Hall's runs as host), What's My Line?, I've Got a Secret, Beat the <b>Clock,</b> <b>Card</b> Sharks, Body Language, and Match Game. The Price Is Right could also be included as part of the schedule. [...] Most of the original episodes' content is intact (including product plugs), though in addition to the actual closings (which usually say either [...] "A Mark Goodson/Bill Todman Production" [...] or [...] "A Mark Goodson Television Production"), the FremantleMedia logo is also seen {{at the end of its}} shows.|$|E
5000|$|Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game (2012) {{released}} {{under the}} Clue brand in North America. The first standard English language Cluedo game to feature a bedroom and bathroom (as {{well as an}} upstairs), it marks {{a return to the}} classic formula of 6 traditional weapons, and classic locations, albeit with a younger cast of characters. However, most notably absent are the <b>clock</b> <b>cards</b> introduced with Discover the Secrets in 2008, which could result in the eventual elimination of a player during the game. Players now start {{in the center of the}} board, rather than dedicated starting spaces, similar to Cluedo Master Detective. The rooms have slightly different names and are arranged differently around the game board. The victim and owner of the mansion is named Samuel Black in this version. This edition also has a different back story of why the guests came to the mansion. The game also features 2 player rules, which is also a first in the standard edition US game.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} system for {{measuring}} network performance {{as part of the}} feasibility studies for locating the ATLAS third level trigger, the event filter (EF), in remote locations. Part of the processing power required to run the EF algorithms, the current estimate is 2000 state off the art processors, can be provided in remote, CERN-affiliated institutes, if a suitable network connection between CERN and the remote site could be achieved. The system is composed of two PCs equipped with GPS systems, CERN-designed <b>clock</b> <b>cards</b> and Alteon gigabit programmable network interface cards. In the first set of measurements we plan to quantify connection in terms of end-to-end latency, throughput, jitter and packet loss. Running streaming tests and study throughput, IP QoS, routing testing and traffic shaping follows this. Finally, we plan to install the event filter software in a remote location and feed it with data from test beams at CERN. Each of these tests should be preformed with the test traffic treated in the network on the "best effort" basis and also when the traffic is sent via a 'dedicated' channel. The description of the system initially deployed in CERN-Geneva/Switzerland and Cracow/Poland is followed by results from the first measurements. (4 refs) ...|$|R

50|$|Clock Speeds: With {{respect to}} {{everything}} but <b>clock</b> speed, 'XL' <b>cards</b> {{are very similar}} to their 'XT' counterparts. However, they are clocked much lower. Both the X800XL and X1800XL have a memory clock of 1000 MHz. Their respective core clock speeds are 400 MHz and 500 MHz; over 100 MHz slower than the top speed found in their respective lines.|$|R
25|$|During the show's first run, {{merchandise}} including novels, records, {{and board}} games was generated for the juvenile market. With the show's renaissance in popularity decades later, merchandise produced was aimed toward the adult babyboomer/nostalgia collectors market and included pinback buttons, <b>clocks,</b> greeting <b>cards,</b> calendars, non-fiction {{books about the}} show's production, memoirs, and miscellaneous items. In 1983, Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow appeared on boxes of Kellogg's Corn Flakes. In 2007, one of the cereal boxes fetched $300 at auction. Promotional photographs from the studio, autographs, original scripts, copies of TV Guide and other magazines from the period featuring articles about the show are all collectibles. Props and costumes from the show with documentation establishing provenance are highly prized.|$|R

50|$|Time <b>clocks</b> used punched <b>cards</b> {{to record}} workers {{in and out}} times. Subtracting these two gave hours worked on each day, and adding them all up gave total work time. This was easily {{automated}} by mechanical machines. However, to compute wages, the hours must be multiplied by salary per hour. Bryce invented {{one of the first}} electromechanical multipliers using relays for this application, and became IBM's chief engineer. In 1937 Bryce was approached by Howard Aiken of Harvard University, who persuaded IBM to fund a programmable calculator which became the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (ASCC), better known as the Harvard Mark I.|$|R
50|$|For each cycle when GNT# is {{asserted}} and {{the status}} bits have the value , write data {{is scheduled to be}} sent across the bus. At the next available opportunity (typically the next <b>clock</b> cycle), the <b>card</b> will assert IRDY# (initiator ready) and begin transferring the data portion of the oldest request in the indicated write queue. If the data is longer than four clock cycles, the motherboard will indicate its ability to continue by asserting TRDY# on the third cycle. Unlike reads, there is no provision for the card to delay the write; if it didn't have the data ready to send, it shouldn't have queued the request.|$|R
5000|$|The RSA SecurID {{authentication}} mechanism {{consists of a}} [...] "token" [...] — either hardware (e.g. a key fob) or software (a soft token) — which is assigned to a computer user and which generates an authentication code at fixed intervals (usually 60 seconds) using a built-in <b>clock</b> and the <b>card's</b> factory-encoded random key (known as the [...] "seed"). The seed is different for each token, and is loaded into the corresponding RSA SecurID server (RSA Authentication Manager, formerly ACE/Server) as the tokens are purchased. On-demand tokens are also available, which provide a tokencode via email or SMS delivery, eliminating the need to provision a token to the user.|$|R
50|$|A {{scoreboard}} {{is a large}} {{board for}} publicly displaying the score in a game. Most levels of sport {{from high school and}} above use at least one scoreboard for keeping score, measuring time, and displaying statistics. Scoreboards in the past used a mechanical <b>clock</b> and numeral <b>cards</b> to display the score. When a point was made, a person would put the appropriate digits on a hook. Most modern scoreboards use electromechanical or electronic means of displaying the score. In these, digits are often composed of large dot-matrix or seven-segment displays made of incandescent bulbs, light-emitting diodes, or electromechanical flip segments. An official or neutral person will operate the scoreboard, using a control panel.|$|R
5000|$|Besides sensors, the Wiegand {{effect is}} used for {{security}} keycard door locks. [...] The plastic keycard has a series of short lengths of Wiegand wire embedded in it, which encodes the key by {{the presence or absence}} of wires. A second track of wires provides a <b>clock</b> track. The <b>card</b> is read by pulling it through a slot in a reader device, which has a fixed magnetic field and a sensor coil. As each length of wire passes through the magnetic field, its magnetic state flips, which indicates a 1, and this is sensed by the coil. The absence of a wire indicates a 0. The resulting Wiegand protocol digital code is then sent to a host controller to determine whether to electrically unlock the door.|$|R
30|$|Real-time {{multimedia}} data access {{plays an important}} role in electronic systems; as time goes by, with decrease in data processing speed and increase in communication time, storage time, and retrieval time, the overall response time increases for real-time applications. Therefore, in this paper, a novel real-time, fast, low-cost, system-on-chip (SoC) controller has been proposed and implemented where large volume of data can be efficiently stored and retrieved from flash memory cards. It is being implemented only using hardware description language (HDL) on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip without using any other on-board or external hardware resources or high-level languages. The entire controller architecture, in a single chip, contains five different modules and is designed using finite state machine (FSM)-based approach. The modules are card initialization module (CINM), idle module (IM), card read module (CRM), card write module (CWM), and decision module (DM). The architecture is completely synthesized for Spartan 3 E xc 3 s 500 e- 4 -fg 320 FPGA with only 5 % of the total logic utilization. The experimental results tested for microSD, SD, and SDHC cards of different size, and these show that the architecture uses less hardware and <b>clock</b> cycles for <b>card</b> initialization and single/multiblock read/write procedure.|$|R
