40|$|Background Mental {{functioning}} {{is reported}} {{as an important}} outcome measure in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Patients show lower mental functioning scores {{than the general population}} (1). A factor that has great impact on the overall health outcomes is <b>comorbidity</b> (2). Both somatic and depression <b>comorbidity</b> are common in patients with RA. Investigating the influence of <b>comorbidity</b> on mental functioning provides clinicians long term information for a particular patient. Objectives To asses the long term association of somatic and depression <b>comorbidity</b> and mental functioning in patients with RA. Methods Longitudinal data over a period of eleven years were collected among 882 patients with RA of varying disease duration. Patient reported outcomes were collected in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2008. Mental functioning was measured with the Mental Component Scale of the Short Form- 36 Health Survey. Somatic <b>comorbidity</b> was measured by a self administered questionnaire including 13 chronic diseases. Depression <b>comorbidity</b> was measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale. We distinguished four groups of patients based on <b>comorbidity</b> at baseline: patients 1) without <b>comorbidity</b> 2) with only somatic <b>comorbidity</b> 3) with only depression <b>comorbidity</b> and 4) with both somatic and depression <b>comorbidity.</b> The influence of <b>comorbidity</b> at baseline on mental functioning over time was investigated in a longitudinal analysis. Results 882 patients responded to the questionnaire, of whom 78 % were women. The mean age of the patients at baseline was 59. 3 (SD 14. 8) years and the mean disease duration was 8. 9 (SD 9. 9) years. For the total group of patients with RA mental functioning stayed stable over time. There was no difference in mental functioning between patients without <b>comorbidity</b> and patients with somatic <b>comorbidity.</b> Patients without <b>comorbidity</b> at baseline had better mental functioning at all time points than patients with depression <b>comorbidity</b> and patients with both somatic and depression <b>comorbidity</b> (p< 0. 01). However, the difference in mental functioning between patients without <b>comorbidity</b> and patients with both somatic and depression <b>comorbidity</b> decreased between baseline and eleven years follow up (p< 0. 01). Conclusions Depression <b>comorbidity</b> and the combination of both somatic and depression <b>comorbidity</b> was negatively associated with mental functioning and this association was present during eleven years follow up. Because of its long term consequences, early screening for depression <b>comorbidity</b> in RA would be recommended, so additional intervention can start early in the disease process to reduce the negative effects of this <b>comorbidity...</b>|$|R
40|$|Patients {{with head}} and neck cancer are prone to develop {{significant}} <b>comorbidity</b> {{mainly because of the}} high incidence of tobacco and alcohol abuse, both of which are etiologic and prognostic factors. However, to the authors' knowledge little is known regarding the prognostic relevance of <b>comorbidity</b> in patients with salivary gland cancer. A retrospective cohort of 666 patients with salivary gland cancer was identified within the Dutch Head and Neck Oncology Cooperative Group database. For multivariate analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to study the effect of <b>comorbidity</b> on overall survival and disease-specific survival. According to the Adult <b>Comorbidity</b> Evaluation- 27 (ACE- 27) index, 394 patients (64 %) had grade 0 <b>comorbidity,</b> 119 patients (19 %) had grade 1 <b>comorbidity,</b> 71 patients (12 %) had grade 2 <b>comorbidity,</b> and 29 patients (5 %) had grade 3 <b>comorbidity.</b> In multivariate analysis for overall survival, the ACE- 27 <b>comorbidity</b> grade was a strong independent prognostic variable.

The HR was 1. 7 (95 % CI, 1. 2 - 2. 5) for grade 2 <b>comorbidity</b> (P =. 003) and 2. 7 (95 % CI, 1. 5 - 4. 7) for grade 3 <b>comorbidity</b> versus grade 0 <b>comorbidity</b> (P =. 001).

25|$|Although many {{patients}} experience aHUS {{as a single}} disease, <b>comorbidities</b> are common. In one study, 25% (47/191) of patients with no known family history of aHUS {{were found to have}} a coexisting disease or condition. <b>Comorbidities</b> in this study included malignant hypertension (30%), TMA with a history of transplant (23%), TMA associated with pregnancy (21%), glomerulopathy (17%), systemic disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) (6%), and malignancy (1%). The presence of mutations in complement regulatory proteins, or of disease-associated variations in the genes encoding these proteins (i.e., in most patients with comorbid conditions as well as in patients with aHUS as a single disease), suggests that deviations from the normal genetic coding of these factors could result in a genetic predisposition to TMA. Individuals so predisposed could have aHUS episodes precipitated by one of the known disease triggers (e.g., infection, pregnancy, surgery, trauma) as well as by other systemic diseases (e.g., malignant hypertension, SLE, cancer).|$|E

40|$|<b>Comorbidity,</b> the {{presence}} of additional illnesses unrelated to the tumor, has {{a significant impact on}} the prognosis of patients with head and neck cancer. In these patients, tobacco and alcohol abuse contributes greatly to <b>comorbidity.</b> Several instruments have been used to quantify <b>comorbidity</b> including Adult <b>Comorbidity</b> Evaluation 27 (ACE 27), Charlson Index (CI) and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. The ACE 27 and CI are the most frequently used indices. Information on <b>comorbidity</b> at the time of diagnosis can be abstracted from patient records. Self-reporting is less reliable than record review. Functional status is not a reliable substitute for <b>comorbidity</b> evaluation as a prognostic measure. Severity as well as {{the presence}} of a condition is required for a good predictive instrument. <b>Comorbidity</b> increases mortality in patients with head and neck cancer, and this effect is greater in the early years following treatment. In addition to reducing overall survival, many studies have shown that <b>comorbidity</b> influences disease-specific survival negatively, most likely because patients with high <b>comorbidity</b> tend to have delay in diagnosis, often presenting with advanced stage tumors, and the <b>comorbidity</b> may also prompt less aggressive treatment. The impact of <b>comorbidity</b> on survival is greater in younger than in older patients, although it affects both. For specific tumor sites, <b>comorbidity</b> has been shown to negatively influence prognosis in oral, oropharyngeal, laryngeal and salivary gland tumors. Several studies have reported higher incidence and increased severity of treatment complications in patients with high <b>comorbidity</b> burden. Studies have demonstrated a negative impact of <b>comorbidity</b> on quality of life, and increased cost of treatment with higher degree of <b>comorbidity.</b> Our review of the literature suggests that routine collection of <b>comorbidity</b> data will be important in the analysis of survival, quality of life and functional outcomes after treatment as <b>comorbidity</b> has an impact on all of the above.

25|$|The {{progression}} of SPS {{depends on whether}} it is a typical or abnormal form of the condition and the presence of <b>comorbidities.</b> Early recognition and neurological treatment can limit its progression.

About ten percent of SPS patients require intensive care at some point; sudden death occurs in about the same number of patients. These deaths are usually caused by metabolic acidosis or an autonomic crisis.|$|E
25|$|Staging is {{generally}} by the UICC/AJCC TNM (Tumour, Nodes, Metastases) system. HPV+OPC {{has been treated}} similarly to stage-matched and site-matched HPV unrelated OPC, but its unique features, which contrast smoking-related HPV-OPC head and neck cancers, for which patients' demographics, <b>comorbidities,</b> risk factors, and carcinogenesis differ markedly, suggest that a distinct staging system be developed to more appropriately represent {{the severity of the}} disease and its prognosis. Standard AJCC TNM staging, such as the seventh edition (2009) while predictive for HPV-OPC has no prognostic value in HPV+OPC. The 8th edition of the AJCC TNM Staging Manual (2016) incorporates this specific staging for HPV+OPC. Current treatment guidelines do not account for the different outcomes observed in HPV+OPC. Consequently, less intensive (de-intensification) use of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, as well as specific therapy, is under investigation, enrolling HPV+OPC in clinical trials to preserve disease control and minimise morbidity in selected groups based on modified TNM staging and smoking status.|$|E
25|$|Causes of {{disturbed}} {{blood flow}} include stagnation of blood flow {{past the point}} of injury, or venous stasis which may occur in heart failure, or after long periods of sedentary behaviour, such as sitting on a long airplane flight. Also, atrial fibrillation, causes stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA), or left atrial appendage (LAA), and can lead to a thromboembolism. Cancers or malignancies such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by possible activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances (paraneoplastic syndrome), by external compression on a blood vessel when a solid tumor is present, or (more rarely) extension into the vasculature (for example, renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins). Also, treatments for cancer (radiation, chemotherapy) often cause additional hypercoagulability. There are scores that correlate different aspects of patient data (<b>comorbidities,</b> vital signs, and others) to risk of thrombosis, such as the POMPE-C, which stratifies risk of mortality due to pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer, who typically have higher rates of thrombosis.|$|E

This study aimed {{to assess the impact of}} <b>comorbidity</b> on colon cancer patient survival, the effect of <b>comorbidity</b> on treatment choices for these patients, and the impact of this on survival among those with <b>comorbidity.</b> Methods This retrospective cohort study reviewed 589 New Zealanders diagnosed with colon cancer in 1996 – 2003, followed until the end of 2005. Clinical and outcome data were obtained from clinical records and the national mortality database.
