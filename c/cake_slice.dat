50|$|At {{a certain}} point in the stage, a food item will drop down that is worth several hundred (or {{thousand}} in the later stages) bonus points. These are different and of increasing value, until a 48,000-point <b>cake</b> <b>slice</b> is reached; thereafter the bonuses are all cake slices, alternating between 48,000 and 50,000 points.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliography. In {{this thesis}} tile {{transient}} flow of water, during tile drainage process in saturated-unsaturated soil profiles, was studied. Drainage experiments {{were performed on}} two different soil profiles. The first experiment undertaken was tile drainage of a vertical column of sand. This experiment was performed on two sands of differing grain size and grading. The second experiment undertaken was the drainage towards a well from a wedge of sand (<b>cake</b> <b>slice)</b> using yet a different coarse sand...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to compare the effect of different Stevia-based sugar substitutes (S 1 –S 3), sucrose alone and a mixture of sucrose + S 1 on: (a) humectant properties, (b) relative colonisation rates of sponge <b>cake</b> <b>slices</b> at 0. 90 aw by strains of Aspergillus flavus, Eurotium amstelodami, Fusarium graminearum and Penicillium verrucosum at 20 and 25 °C and (c) shelf-life periods in days prior to visible growth. Results showed that sucrose, S 1 commercial sugar substitute and the mixture of sucrose + S 1 in water solutions were able to reach water activity levels similar to those of glycerol and glucose mixtures. The S 2 and S 3 commercial sugar substitutes were unable to reduce aw levels significantly. At 25 °C, colonisation of sponge <b>cake</b> <b>slices</b> by E. amstelodami, A. flavus and P. verrucosum occurred in all the treatments. Growth of F. graminearum only occurred on sponge <b>cake</b> <b>slices</b> containing S 2 and S 3 Stevia-based products at both temperatures. The best control of growth (30 days) was achieved in <b>cake</b> <b>slices</b> modified with sucrose or S 1 Stevia treatments inoculated with A. flavus and in the sucrose treatment for E. amstelodami at 20 °C. F. graminearum growth was completely inhibited when sucrose alone, S 1 or sucrose + S 1 treatments were used at both temperatures. This study suggests that, as part of a hurdle technology approach, replacing sucrose with low calorie sugar substitutes based on Stevia glycosides needs to be done with care. This is because different products may have variable humectant properties and bulking agents which may shorten the potential shelf-life of intermediate moisture bakery products...|$|R
50|$|Another version also {{referenced}} as prawn noodles in Singapore {{is similar}} to the Penang variation of Hokkien Mee. Egg noodles and rice noodles are served in richly flavoured dark soup stock with prawns, pork <b>slices,</b> fish <b>cake</b> <b>slices,</b> and bean sprouts topped with fried shallots and spring onion. The stock is made using dried shrimps, prawn heads, white pepper, garlic and other spices.|$|R

50|$|Dendronized {{polymers}}. (or dendronised polymers) are linear polymers {{to every}} repeat unit of which dendrons are attached.

60|$|The {{sight of}} {{the woman with the}} basket of bread {{reminded}} us that we wanted some food. So we searched for bread. None, if you please. It was Monday morning, eaten out. There would be bread at the forno, the oven. Where was the oven? Up the road and down a passage. I thought we should smell it. But no. We wandered back. Our friends had told us to take tickets early, for perhaps the bus would be crowded. So we bought yesterday's pastry and little <b>cakes,</b> and <b>slices</b> of native sausage. And still no bread. I went and asked our old hostess.|$|R
50|$|Although the steamed turnip cake can be {{consumed}} straight with soy sauce, they are commonly cooked again to add additional flavors.

50|$|The {{process begins}} by {{pressing}} the tobacco leaves into a cake {{about an inch}} thick. Heat from fire or steam is applied, and the tobacco is allowed to ferment. This is said {{to result in a}} sweet and mild tobacco. Finally the <b>cake</b> is <b>sliced.</b> These slices must be broken apart, as by rubbing in a circular motion between one's palms, before the tobacco can be evenly packed into a pipe. Flavoring is often added before the leaves are pressed. English Cavendish uses a dark flue or fire cured Virginia (DEC), which is steamed and then stored under pressure to permit it to cure and ferment for several days or weeks.|$|R

60|$|It was a {{substantial}} meal; for, {{over and above}} the ordinary tea equipage, the board creaked beneath the weight of a jolly round of beef, a ham of the first magnitude, and sundry towers of buttered Yorkshire <b>cake,</b> piled <b>slice</b> upon slice in most alluring order. There was also a goodly jug of well-browned clay, fashioned into the form of an old gentleman, not by any means unlike the locksmith, atop of whose bald head was a fine white froth answering to his wig, indicative, beyond dispute, of sparkling home-brewed ale. But, better far than fair home-brewed, or Yorkshire cake, or ham, or beef, or anything to eat or drink that earth or air or water can supply, there sat, presiding over all, the locksmith's rosy daughter, before whose dark eyes even beef grew insignificant, and malt became as nothing.|$|R
50|$|Preparation {{starts with}} the baking of a firm sponge cake in a ring shaped baking tin. The <b>cake</b> is then <b>sliced</b> {{horizontally}} to divide it into two or three rings, and thick layers of buttercream icing are placed between the rings, usually {{with a layer of}} red jam (typically strawberry, blackcurrant or cherry jam). The outside of the cake is then thickly coated with more buttercream and topped with caramel-covered brittle nuts, called Krokant, toasted almond flakes and/or ground hazelnuts. Krokant is signature to this dish.|$|R
