25|$|In solid timber work it {{is common}} to <b>counterbore</b> a hole in the frame or carcase member to conceal the head of the screw. This also allows more of the body of the screw to {{penetrate}} the adjacent member for greater traction. After the screw has been driven into the joint, the <b>counterbore</b> can be filled with an appropriately sized piece of dowel or a wooden plug cut from an offcut of the same timber using a plug cutter.|$|E
25|$|A {{countersink}} is a conical hole {{cut into}} a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material. (By comparison, a <b>counterbore</b> makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.|$|E

25|$|A drill bushing, {{also known}} as a jig bushing, is a tool used in {{metalworking}} jigs to guide cutting tools, most commonly drill bits. Other tools that are commonly used in a drill bushing include <b>counterbores,</b> countersinks, and reamers. They are designed to guide, position, and support the cutting tool.|$|R
25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill bit {{that has the}} tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a <b>counterbore,</b> or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|E
500|$|Bushings are {{the major}} expense in fiber glass production. [...] The nozzle design is also critical. [...] The number of nozzles ranges from 200 to 4000 in {{multiples}} of 200. [...] The {{important part of the}} nozzle in continuous filament manufacture is the thickness of its walls in the exit region. [...] It was found that inserting a <b>counterbore</b> here reduced wetting. [...] Today, the nozzles are designed to have a minimum thickness at the exit. [...] As glass flows through the nozzle, it forms a drop which is suspended from the end. [...] As it falls, it leaves a thread attached by the meniscus to the nozzle as long as the viscosity is in the correct range for fiber formation. [...] The smaller the annular ring of the nozzle and the thinner the wall at exit, the faster the drop will form and fall away, and the lower its tendency to wet the vertical part of the nozzle. [...] The surface tension of the glass is what influences the formation of the meniscus. [...] For E-glass it should be around 400mN/m.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pocket holes}} require two {{drilling}} operations to be completed. The {{first is to}} <b>counterbore</b> the pocket hole itself, which houses the screw head within the member. This hole is stopped 1/4" [...] (5mm) or so {{from the edge of}} the frame member. The second step is to drill a pilot hole concentric with the pocket hole which extends through the edge of the member. The pilot hole allows the screw to pass through the member and into the adjoining member. This two stage drilling operation may be performed with two different sized drill bits, however there are special stepped bits available to perform the operation in a single pass. The drilling operation is often facilitated by a pocket hole jig which allows the user to drill the pocket hole at the correct angle and to the correct depth.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{commercial}} systems available for screwed butt joints {{in which a}} plastic cap is provided with the screw to be fixed {{to the head of}} the screw after it has been driven home. <b>Counterbores</b> are not required for these fasteners.

5000|$|Whereas a <b>counterbore</b> is a {{flat-bottomed}} {{enlargement of}} a smaller coaxial hole, a countersink is a conical enlargement of such. A spotface often {{takes the form}} of a very shallow <b>counterbore.</b>|$|E

The lower <b>counterbore</b> is designed to fit into a drill chuck, and being smaller, is economical to make as one piece.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>counterbore</b> (symbol: ⌴) is a {{cylindrical}} flat-bottomed {{hole that}} enlarges another coaxial hole, or the tool {{used to create}} that feature. A <b>counterbore</b> hole is typically used when a fastener, such as a socket head cap screw, is required to sit flush with or {{below the level of}} a workpiece's surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{geometry}} {{produced by}} lathe boring is usually of two types: straight holes and tapered holes. Several diameters {{can also be}} added to each shape hole if required. To produce a taper, the tool may be fed {{at an angle to}} the axis of rotation or both feed and axial motions may be concurrent. Straight holes and <b>counterbores</b> are produced by moving the tool parallel to the axis of workpiece rotation.|$|R
50|$|Standards {{exist for}} the sizes of <b>counterbores,</b> {{especially}} for fastener head seating areas. These standards can vary between corporations and between standards organizations. For example, in Boeing Design Manual BDM-1327 section 3.5, the nominal diameter of the spotfaced surface {{is the same as}} the nominal size of the cutter, and is equal to the flat seat diameter plus twice the fillet radius. This is in contrast to the ASME Y14.5-2009 definition of a spotface, which is equal to the flat seat diameter.|$|R
40|$|The {{pressures}} of marketplace are increasingly {{resulting in a}} shift in emphasis from such concepts as Scheduled Replacement to notions that include Retirement for Cause (RFC). The shift has resulted in enormous demands placed on the performance levels of NDE algorithms and systems. The need for detection of flaws in the incipient stages of growth and the regularity with which inspections need to be carried have contributed to interest in systems that offer high levels of accuracy and throughput. Pattern recognition algorithms {{play a key role}} in NDE systems and improvements in classification schemes are an area of active research. This paper presents an approach for addressing classification of ultrasonic signals obtained during the inspection of nuclear power plant tubing. The signals are analyzed for detection of intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC). However the similarity of the IGSCC signals to reflectors from other benign sources such as rootwelds and <b>counterbores</b> renders the identification of crack signals difficult. In addition variations in the location of cracks are manifested as temporal shifts or delays in the signal. The classification scheme is therefore required to be insensitive to temporal shifts...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of the preload bolt is often an afterthought {{in the design of}} Langevin type “sandwich” transducers, but quite often it is the root cause of failure for power ultrasonic applications. The main role of the preload bolt is to provide a “prestress” in the piezo stack to prevent interface “gapping” or tension in glued joints which can result in delamination. But {{as an integral part of}} a highly tuned dynamic system, the resulting parasitic resonances in these preload bolts, such as bending or longitudinal modes, are often difficult to predict and control. This research investigates many aspects of preload bolt design for achieving optimal transducer performance, including basic size and strength determination based on drive amplitude, as well as ensuring adequate thread engagement to the mating horn. Other aspects such as rule-of-thumb configuration and length guidelines to reduce parasitic resonances are also investigated. Optimizing the uniformity of stress in the piezoceramics is also considered, which is affected by end mass length, <b>counterbores</b> and proximity to threading. The {{selection of}} the bolt material based on stiffness is also investigated as related to electromechanical coupling. The investigation focuses solely on Langevin type transducers used for semiconductor wire bonding, and which are comprised of the common Navy Types I and III (PZT 4 and PZT 8) piezoelectric materials. Several metrics are investigated such as impedance, displacement gain, and electromechanical coupling factor. The experimental and theoretical research methods include Bode plots, scanning laser vibrometry and finite element analysis...|$|R
40|$|Laser Engineered Net Shaping{trademark} (LENS{reg_sign}) is a unique, layer additive, metal {{manufacturing}} {{technique that}} offers {{the ability to}} create fully dense metal features and components directly from a computer solid model. LENS offers opportunities to repair and modify components by adding features to existing geometry, refilling holes, repairing weld lips, and many other potential applications. The material deposited has good mechanical properties with strengths typically slightly higher that wrought material due to grain refinement from a quickly cooling weld pool. The result is a material with properties similar to cold worked material, but without the loss in ductility traditionally seen with such treatments. Furthermore, 304 L LENS material exhibits good corrosion resistance and hydrogen compatibility. This report gives a background of the LENS process including materials analysis addressing the requirements of a number of different applications. Suggestions are given to aid both the product engineer and the process engineer in the successful utilization of LENS for their applications. The results of testing on interface strength, machinability, weldability, corrosion resistance, geometric effects, heat treatment, and repair strategy testing are all included. Finally, the qualification of the LENS process is briefly discussed to give the user confidence in selecting LENS as the process of choice for high rigor applications. The testing showed LENS components to have capability in repair/modification applications requiring complex castings (W 80 - 3 D-Bottle bracket), thin wall parts requiring metal to be rebuilt onto the part (W 87 Firing Set Housing and Y- 12 Test Rings), the filling of <b>counterbores</b> for use in reservoir reclamation welding (SRNL hydrogen compatibility study) and the repair of surface defects on pressure vessels (SRNL gas bottle repair). The material is machinable, as testing has shown that LENS deposited material machines similar to that of welded metal. Tool wear is slightly higher in LENS material than in wrought material, but not so much that one would be concerned with increased tooling cost. The LENS process achieved process qualification for the AY 1 E 0125 D-Bottle Bracket from the W 80 - 3 LEP program, and in the effort, also underwent testing in weapons environments. These tests included structural dynamic response testing and drop testing. The LENS deposited parts were compared in these tests with conventionally machined parts and showed equivalency {{to such an extent that}} the parts were accepted for use in parallel path subsystem-level weapon environment testing. The evaluation of LENS has shown that the process can be a viable option when either complete metal parts are needed or existing metal parts require modification or repair. The LENS Qualification Technology Investment team successfully investigated new applications for the LENS process and showed that it has great applicability across the Nuclear Weapons Complex as well as in other high rigor applications...|$|R
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the cutters {{that produce}} counterbores are often also called counterbores; sometimes, to avoid ambiguity, the term <b>counterbore</b> cutter is used instead.|$|E
5000|$|Counterbores {{are made}} with {{standard}} dimensions for a certain size of screw or are produced in sizes that {{are not related to}} any particular screw size. In either case, the tip of the <b>counterbore</b> has a reduced diameter section referred to as the pilot, a feature essential to assuring concentricity between the <b>counterbore</b> and the hole being counterbored. Counterbores matched to specific screw sizes generally have integral pilots that fit the clearance hole diameter associated with a particular screw size (e.g., [...]191 inches for a number 10 machine screw). Counterbores that are not related to a specific screw size are designed to accept a removable pilot, allowing any given <b>counterbore</b> size to be adapted to a variety of hole sizes. The pilot matters little when running the cutter in a milling setup where rigidity is assured and hole center location is already achieved via X-Y positioning.|$|E
50|$|A <b>counterbore</b> is {{also used}} to create a {{perpendicular}} surface for a fastener head on a non-perpendicular surface. If this is not feasible then a self-aligning nut may be required.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>counterbore</b> in {{the rear}} flange of the {{crankshaft}} was a -inch diameter until 1967. For 1968, it was enlarged to [...] inches. This difference has implications when swapping engines with automatic transmissions across this date line.|$|E
50|$|A dustcap {{may also}} refer, on a bicycle, to the crankarm bolt cover. It {{is usually a}} piece of metal or plastic that, on the crankarm, is snapped or screwed into the {{threaded}} <b>counterbore,</b> which houses the bolt that holds the crankarm to its axle, the bottom bracket spindle. The dustcap serves to protect the threads (on {{the inside of the}} <b>counterbore),</b> which are used with a crankarm puller to remove the crankarm from the spindle. It is also possible for the crank arm to squirm on the bottom bracket spindle, causing the crankarm nut/bolt to become loose, leading to the nut/bolt working its way out of the bottom bracket spindle. The dust cap limits the amount of dangerous loosening that can occur.|$|E
5000|$|The cutters {{most often}} used to cut spotfaces are <b>counterbore</b> cutters and endmills. In manual {{machining}} especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no relief angle, meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a relief angle such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional <b>counterbore</b> cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills.|$|E

Alternate generations of the model 13 are as follows:1st Gen. -1974- Introduced,2nd Gen. -1977- Change back to gas ring on cylinder,3rd Gen. -1982- Eliminate cylinder <b>counterbore.</b>|$|E
50|$|For a spotface, {{material}} {{is removed from}} a surface to make it flat and smooth, usually for a fastener or a bearing. Spotfacing is usually required on workpieces that are forged or cast.
