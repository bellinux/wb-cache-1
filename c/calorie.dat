5|$|The CGS {{system had}} two units of energy, the erg that {{was related to}} {{mechanics}} and the <b>calorie</b> that was related to thermal energy; so {{only one of them}} (the erg) could bear a coherent relationship to the base units.

5|$|A low <b>calorie</b> diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect on aging.|$|E
5000|$|From 1971 - 2000, {{the average}} daily number of <b>calories</b> which women {{consumed}} in the United States increased by 335 <b>calories</b> per day (1542 <b>calories</b> in 1971 and 1877 <b>calories</b> in 2000). For men, the average increase was 168 <b>calories</b> per day (2450 <b>calories</b> in 1971 and 2618 <b>calories</b> in 2000). Most of these extra <b>calories</b> came from an increase in carbohydrate consumption rather than an increase in fat consumption. [...] The primary sources of these extra carbohydrates were sweetened beverages, which now accounts for almost 25 percent of daily <b>calories</b> in young adults in America.

5000|$|The kind of <b>calories</b> {{consumed}} affects how efficiently {{the body}} can utilize those <b>calories.</b> A low glycemic and low carbohydrate diet resulted in more <b>calories</b> being burned than a low fat diet.

5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all <b>calorie</b> restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the <b>calorie</b> intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E

Over 19million packets of Aeroplane Jelly are sold each year. Strawberry flavour {{is the top}} selling jelly variant with nearly 2 million packs sold each year. In 1953, Aeroplane Jelly introduced Australia's first low <b>calorie</b> jelly. In 1988, in honour of the Australian Bicentenary, jelly was available in special Australian flavours such as Lilly Pilly, Quandong and Midjinberry. These flavours were phased out by 1992.

One of the least selling though was the lemon flavor which sold over 100,000 packets per annum.|$|E
5|$|The {{centimetre}} gram second {{system of}} units (CGS) was the first coherent metric system, having been developed in the 1860s and promoted by Maxwell and Thomson. In 1874, this system was formally promoted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS). The system's characteristics are that density is expressed in , force expressed in dynes and mechanical energy in ergs. Thermal energy was defined in calories, one <b>calorie</b> being the energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 15.5°C to 16.5°C. The meeting also proposed two sets of units for electrical and magnetic properties – the electrostatic set of units and the electromagnetic set of units.|$|E

5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high <b>calorie</b> food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E
