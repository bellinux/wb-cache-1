2500|$|The two ends of {{what was}} once {{considered}} to be a main line remain open, while the large middle section's relics have disappeared with time and the impacts of development. [...] For example, the triangular platform at Makarewa that once served Kingston and the Wairio Branch as well as the large Freezing Works, disappeared sometime between 1995 and 1998. The last rails in the yard lifted when the freezing works were demolished. [...] From here to Winton the formation has been completely obliterated due to intensive dairy farming. From Winton to <b>Centre</b> <b>Bush,</b> little remains except the formation and the occasional minor bridge; the first goods shed still standing is located {{at the site of the}} old <b>Centre</b> <b>Bush</b> yard. [...] Well-preserved remnants can be found in Lumsden, including the water tower, a little trestle bridge, and the station building that is now used as a tourist centre. From just north of Lumsden to Fairlight the Around the Mountains Cycle Trail mostly follows the old railway line. In Lowther, the loading bank remains, and not too far away some rails are embedded in the old level crossing site on Ellis Road. Another level crossing is intact in Athol, and one of the farthest north relics of the line is found just outside Garston, the old combined road/rail bridge. Just south of Garston the old goods shed can be seen against the bottom of a hill, where it was moved to after the line's closure. At the old Fairlight bridge crossing the line becomes 'live' as the southern terminal of the Kingston Flyer Ltd's vintage railway. The old line is reasonably easy to follow on Google Earth Satellite view.|$|R

500|$|Bush's {{first tour}} took place 2 April – 13 May 1979; 35 {{years later she}} {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} 22 concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo, London, beginning 26 August 2014. Apart from these two concert series, she has given only occasional live performances. Several reasons have been suggested as to why she abandoned touring, among them her reputed need to be in total control of the final product, which is incompatible with live stage performance; a rumour of a crippling fear of flying; and the suggestion that the death of 21-year-old Bill Duffield severely affected her. Duffield, her lighting engineer, was killed in an accident during her concert of 2 April 1979 at Poole Arts <b>Centre.</b> <b>Bush</b> held a benefit concert on 12 May 1979, with Peter Gabriel and Steve Harley at London's Hammersmith Odeon for his family. Duffield would be honoured in two later songs: [...] "Blow Away" [...] on Never for Ever and [...] "Moments of Pleasure" [...] on The Red Shoes. Bush explained in a BBC Radio 2 interview with Mark Radcliffe that she actually enjoyed the tour but was consumed with producing her subsequent records. A BBC film crew followed the preparation for the tour which was shown as a 30-minute special on the Nationwide programme.|$|R

By this time the estate covered 438 acre [...] - [...] {{one of the largest in}} the parish. The estate was broken up in 1875 with the North London Estates Company NLEC, a speculative development company buying 373 acre acres.

5000|$|The {{show was}} divided into four sections, {{concluding}} with two encores. It began with playback of whale song, with Bush's shadow projected {{as she began to}} dance whilst the curtain parted to reveal a simple stage with a ramp at its <b>centre.</b> <b>Bush,</b> wearing a blue leotard, sang the first song [...] "Moving." [...] A shadow projection of the band's saxophone player was used next, during [...] "The Saxophone Song". The theatre was then filled with the sound of a heartbeat as red lights flickered whilst the onstage piano was removed. A large plush oval was rolled onto the stage, from within which Bush sang [...] "Room for the Life" [...] whilst curled inside as it was rolled around the stage. Dressed in a long coat and trilby hat, Bush was joined by her two male dancers as she performed [...] "Them Heavy People". She then moved to the piano to play [...] "The Man with the Child in His Eyes", whilst the stage props were removed and the lights faded out. The band then played the as yet unreleased [...] "Egypt", whilst Bush emerged {{from the back of the}} stage wearing an Egyptian costume. An extended introduction to [...] "L'Amour Looks Something Like You" [...] was then played in darkness, whilst Bush changed into a black leotard and red skirt. Whilst at centre-stage by a tall mirror, a magician emerged to perform with a flying cane. Bush performed [...] "Violin", wearing bat wings and taunted by her two dancers dressed as giant violins. As the stage darkened, Bush's brother, John Carder Bush, was heard reciting a poem, which culminated in a spoken duet with Bush herself. She was then illuminated by a spotlight as she performed [...] "The Kick Inside" [...] at the piano. A black veil was placed over her and the curtains closed.|$|R
60|$|So {{making a}} circuit up the hillside, he crept towards {{them on his}} belly as a snake creeps, wriggling in and out between the tufts of last year's dead grass, which grew here in plenty, {{without so much as}} moving their tops. At length he lay still in the <b>centre</b> of a <b>bush</b> that grew behind a stone not five paces from where they were talking, whence he listened intently to every word that passed their lips.|$|R
50|$|Before the broadcast, some 150 people bearing {{placards}} protested {{outside the}} BBC Television <b>Centre</b> in Shepherd's <b>Bush.</b> On the Monday following the broadcast, which was watched by some two million viewers, The Times announced that BBC executives had received death threats after their addresses and telephone numbers were {{posted on the}} Christian Voice website. The Corporation had received some 35,000 complaints before the broadcast, but reported only 350 calls following the broadcast, which were split between those praising the production and those complaining about it.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the {{programme}} was televised for {{the first}} time on BBC Four as part of a 1940s' and 1950s' theme night, with a playlist concentrating on classic light music by composers such as Eric Coates, Trevor Duncan, Ronald Binge and Leroy Anderson. The compère was actor and comedian Roy Hudd. On Friday 19 March 2010, the programme was broadcast from the BBC Television <b>Centre</b> in Shepherds <b>Bush</b> {{for the first}} time. Singers John Lawrenson and Cynthia Glover for many years were the programmes resident musical artists.|$|R

5000|$|As a consequence, studio {{technicians}} {{were instructed}} to make the equipment inoperable. When the BBC moved in it repaired the less-damaged equipment, sometimes using spare parts from the same pieces of equipment that the BBC inherited. The EMI 2001 television cameras used in studios 3 and 4 at BBC Television <b>Centre,</b> Shepherd's <b>Bush,</b> were moved into the newly renamed [...] "BBC Elstree Centre", along with ATV/Central's old EMI 2001s that were repairable. Meanwhile, the BBC replaced the BBC Television Centre studio 3 and 4 cameras with Link 125 tube cameras. Elstree kept the EMI 2001s up until 1991. Elstree's first new cameras were to be Thomson TTV-1531s, {{one of the last}} plumbicon-tubed cameras to be made - being replaced in the mid-1990s with Thomson TTV-1542 and TTV-1647 lightweight cameras using the then-new camera technology of CCDs. Widescreen was introduced in 1999 using Philips/Thomson LDK 100s.|$|R
60|$|Before {{reaching}} it they discovered, {{from the}} sound of voices, that a party of some kind was encamped there; but, of course, as they knew not who, it became needful to proceed with extreme caution. When they gained the edge of the clump, and raised their heads over a low bush-covered bank, they beheld a sight which was not calculated to cheer them, for there, in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>bush,</b> encircling a very small fire, sat a war-party of about fifty painted and befeathered braves of the Cree Indians. They were engaged in council at the moment.|$|R
50|$|In 1996 Kenyon {{became a}} BBC News {{correspondent}} based at TV <b>Centre</b> in Shepherd’s <b>Bush,</b> {{but after a}} year was offered his own investigative series again, this time on BBC 2, called “Raising the Roof”. It continued for two series, until Kenyon was offered his own prime time series on BBC1 - “Kenyon Confronts” which ran from 2001-2003. The show used secret filming and dramatic confrontations to expose criminals. Kenyon famously stopped a sham wedding just as the couple were making their vows, and faked his own funeral in Haiti during an investigation into insurance fraud.|$|R

25|$|During Bush's {{years in}} Miami, he was {{involved}} in many different entrepreneurial pursuits, including working for a mobile phone company, serving on the board of a Norwegian-owned company that sold fire equipment to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, becoming a minority owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars, buying a shoe company that sold footwear in Panama, and getting involved in a project selling water pumps in Nigeria. Miguel Recarey, who ran International Medical <b>Centres</b> (IMC), employed <b>Bush</b> as a real estate consultant and paid him a 75,000 fee for finding the company a new location, although the move never took place. Bush did, however, lobby the Reagan administration vigorously and successfully on behalf of Recarey and IMC.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 {{the school}} had 60 pupils {{between the ages of}} five and six. The school, located in the Simba Community <b>Centre</b> in Shepherd's <b>Bush,</b> taught United Kingdom {{recognised}} curriculum in addition to African history, history of Black historical figures, and NOI practices. The Hammersmith and Fulham Council, which owned the Simba centre, ordered the school to leave. In addition the Department for Education and Employment threatened to close the school if it did not register with the department. NOI supporters protested the proposed expulsion and the proposed closure. By 1999 the school was not ultimately expelled from the community centre, and it registered with the department before the deadline. However the school is no longer operating.|$|R
50|$|Huntley {{had been}} an amateur ventriloquist since his school days and had {{acquired}} a full size walking dummy, whom he enlisted with him! They were soon involved in troop shows. As the Army had even fewer ventriloquists than shorthand writers he eventually became a full-time entertainer with SIB {{and spent most of}} the war “talking to myself.” His dummy, Gunner Jimmy Green, had a battledress made for him by the Army and developed his own persona in military circles. After media publicity in the newspapers and on radio and TV - including a live broadcast from the BBC <b>Centre</b> at Shepherd’s <b>Bush</b> - he took up residence at the Imperial War Museum in London in 2009, where {{he is one of the}} exhibits.|$|R

"Hardly {{were the}} words out of his mouth, when I heard a roar, and {{starting}} round saw the lioness emerge from the very <b>centre</b> of a <b>bush,</b> {{in which she had}} been curled up, just behind Pharaoh. Up she went on to her hind-legs, and as she did so I noticed that one of her fore-paws was broken near the shoulder, for it hung limply down. Up she went, towering right over Pharaoh's head, as she did so lifting her uninjured paw to strike him to the earth. And then, before I could get my rifle round or do anything to avert the oncoming catastrophe, the Zulu did a very brave and clever thing. Realizing his own imminent danger, he bounded to one side, and swinging the heavy axe round his head, brought it down right on {{to the back of the}} lioness, severing the vertebræ and killing her instantaneously. It was wonderful to see her collapse all in a heap like an empty sack.|$|R
5000|$|In 1898, Cardiff were {{unofficial}} club {{champions of}} Wales {{for the first}} time. One year later, centre Gwyn Nicholls became the first Cardiff player {{to play for the}} British and Irish Lions (then only representing the British Isles), and scored a try in both the first and second Tests against Australia. Nicholls would also go on to captain Wales between 1902 and 1906. In 1904, Cardiff players fly-half Percy <b>Bush,</b> <b>centre</b> Rhys Gabe (who later captained Wales in 1907) and Arthur 'Boxer' Harding all went on the Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand (Nicholls was not selected). Bush scored in the first and second test against Australia, as Nicholls had, and thanks to his tries and goal-kicking during the first three Tests, finished as the top Test points scorer. Gabe scored a try in the third test against Australia, while Harding converted a try in the first Test and was the only Lions player to get on the score sheet against New Zealand, after scoring a penalty goal in the game against them {{at the end of the}} tour.|$|R
5000|$|After the Staten Island {{grand jury}} did not indict Pantaleo on December 3, {{citizens}} in New York City and San Francisco gathered in protest, demonstrating with several die-ins, making speeches and rallies against the indictment. On December 5, thousands gathered in protest on the Boston Common in Boston, and then marched {{in the downtown}} area, blocking traffic, especially on I-90, in addition to staging [...] "die-ins." [...] Protests also occurred in Chicago, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Minneapolis, and Atlanta. At least 300 people were arrested at the New York City protests on December 4 and 5, most of them for charges of disorderly conduct or refusal to clear the streets, but two for assault on a police officer. On December 6, 300 protesters marched in Berkeley, California as well. On December 10, 76 protesters were arrested at Westfield shopping <b>centre</b> in Shepherd's <b>Bush</b> in west London, England, during a rally to show solidarity with rallies in the United States. Protesters have made use of Garner's last words, [...] "I can't breathe", as a slogan and chant against police brutality since Garner's death and Officer Pantaleo's grand jury decision. By December 28, at least 50 protests in support of Garner had occurred globally, and many other Black Lives Matter-related demonstrations had occurred.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{breeding}} season, March to May, these birds are very vocal {{and they have}} a repetitive [...] "chee-ri-rirr" [...] or a whistling song [...] "whee-chee-ree-rirr". They feed on insects by flycatching low over the ground (under 2m height) and also pick insects from the ground. Territories are maintained by a pair throughout the year. The threat display involves the male pointing bill up, fanning the tail, opening wings and producing [...] "keet-keet" [...] notes. The alarm call is a zit-zit. Males are usually involved in defense but females may sometimes join in. The nest is built by the female, placed in a low bush or fern. Two greyish speckled eggs form the usual clutch. Young birds are brownish and speckled. The nest is unlike that of most flycatchers and is large, coarse, ball-like and made from sedges. The nest has a foundation of dry leaves and ferns. The nest has an external diameter of about 6 in and the egg cavity which is devoid of any lining is about 2 in in diameter and 2 in deep. The nest is placed usually at the <b>centre</b> of a <b>bush</b> at about 1 to 3 ft height with an entrance hole close to the top.|$|R
40|$|The ‘sea change’ {{phenomenon}} {{is driven by}} social processes and affects Australian communities, economies and the environment. It describes the depopulation of the bush and migration from many inland regional centres to coastal environs. While Australian capital cities continue to grow, the ‘sea change’ {{phenomenon is}} also fuelled {{to a lesser extent}} by the population migration from those capital cities to coastal regions. Both anthropogenic pressures such as population migration and tourism (for example, through greater demands on existing infrastructure), and natural pressures such as coastal erosion and flooding are affecting ‘sea change’ communities. Furthermore, both the anthropogenic and natural pressures are on the increase. Despite these trends, there is little research on the actual state of ‘sea change’ environments. While all tiers of government have acknowledged some of the problems associated with the phenomenon, infrastructure pressures over the last few decades, along with changing community expectations, have forced local governments in particular to confront the ‘sea change’ challenge. It would be naïve to assume that one tier of government in isolation could respond to the ‘sea change’ phenomenon. But perhaps the reasons that people move to the coast are not unique. The population shifts may well be driven by the same factors that drove people to the suburbs of Australia’s capital cities, yet with {{the quality of life in}} Australia’s city suburbs in decline, along with economic decline in other regional <b>centres</b> and the <b>bush,</b> where else does the dream of utopia lie...|$|R
