The town, named for a distant ancestor who helped found it, is covered in fog and deserted. At home, he finds his mother in a catatonic state, murmuring about his father leaving to find Josh; promising to find Josh, Alex leaves.|$|E

40|$|There the {{operating}} modes air-coolers in the <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> agricultural vehicles have been considered. The {{purpose is to}} improve the labour conditions of operators in the <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> agricultural vehicles by way of normalization of temperature-humidity modes of working zone. The operating conditions of water-evaporating coolers have been substantiated. The mathematical simulators of physical processes taking place in the coolers have been constructed and have been realized numerically. The optimization method <b>of</b> dimensions <b>of</b> <b>cab</b> coolers has been developed. The systematic approach to the choice <b>of</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cab</b> coolers <b>of</b> vehicles has been offered. The prototypes of air-coolers <b>of</b> tractor <b>cabs</b> have been constructed with the application of computer simulation. The software package, the cooler prototypes have been introduced at the Tashkent Tractor Works. The efficiencies are the rise of labour productivity by 7 - 10 %, the decrease of occupational deseases, of industrial injuries, the decrease of labour fluidityAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
5|$|Stewie hitches a {{ride with}} a trucker and so Brian follows {{him all the way}} to Canada. On the way, Stewie accidentally causes a traffic pileup by {{discharging}} a flare pistol in the <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> the truck, which catches fire and explodes. Crashing his car in a chain reaction, Brian becomes angry and tells Stewie that Santa does not exist. Stewie becomes frustrated and continues to attempt to hitchhike, corecing Brian to join him. The pair then encounter a Canadian who gives them his snowmobile.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> {{the crane}} is also of iron, with small-paned windows. These window frames are {{decorated}} with small roses cast into the junctions of the glazing bars. Some time around 1900 the top winding drums and gears were enclosed in a further box on the roof.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{bullet holes}} {{were seen in}} the {{windscreen}} and <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> the truck. The entire attack took place over a distance of , between numbers 11 and 147 of the Promenade des Anglais, resulting {{in the deaths of}} 86 people and creating high levels of panic in the crowds. Some were injured as a result of jumping onto the pebbled beach several metres below the Promenade.|$|E
50|$|A further twenty {{locomotives}} {{arrived in}} 1885, five of which {{going to the}} Northern system. This last batch had cabs with steel cutaway sides, an improvement on the open <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> the earlier batches.|$|R
50|$|A 21 m {{turntable}} {{was provided}} for reversing the <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> motor cars and driving trailers into the required direction. A carriage wash was also {{located at the}} workshops for cleaning the exterior of trains.|$|R
50|$|Isuzu is {{the market}} leader in Australia and makes unique models to that market. It {{includes}} Crew <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> popular models with options like 4X4 and PTO. Australia also receives slightly larger versions codenamed FX-series.|$|R
25|$|Eyewitness {{testimony}} {{conflicted with}} some of these events. Residents on the street and others said that the two tow truck operators examined the abandoned vehicle for several minutes before shots were fired, contradicting McMillan's testimony that he was fired upon almost immediately after exiting the <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> his truck. Some residents also said that an African American man approached the tow truck operators and argued with them briefly before departing.|$|E
25|$|An {{automobile}} simulator {{provides an}} opportunity to reproduce the characteristics of real vehicles in a virtual environment. It replicates the external factors and conditions with which a vehicle interacts enabling a driver {{to feel as if}} they are sitting in the <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> their own vehicle. Scenarios and events are replicated with sufficient reality to ensure that drivers become fully immersed in the experience rather than simply viewing it as an educational experience.|$|E
25|$|The first {{member of}} the class (4300) was {{purchased}} for parts and dismantled upon arrival in Australia. This was because it was cheaper to purchase a complete locomotive than buy the components individually. The first batch of SD70ACe/LCi's (4301-4313) was ordered in 2004 and named after sidings on the BHP system. Since {{it did not have}} the newer, isolated <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> the second and subsequent batches it was traded in to the supplier for locomotives with newer cab assemblies.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{design is}} used for the black <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> London. The jump seats, also {{referred}} to as taxi-tip-seats, usually carry advertising on the underside; the advertisements are visible to the passengers when the tip-seats are not in use.|$|R
50|$|During 1971 the London-end <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> units 3001 to 3011 were {{equipped}} with an experimental form <b>of</b> <b>cab</b> signalling (SRAWS - Signal Repeating AWS) which was being trialled in the up-direction between Raynes Park and Surbiton {{as well as in}} the New Forest area. The cab layout showed the driver the aspect of the next signal and the one that the train had just passed.|$|R
50|$|The 16 {{units were}} built at ABB Derby between 1995 and 1996. They {{are very similar}} to Class 319 units, sharing the same {{traction}} equipment and body design, but are fitted with <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> the same design as the ABB Networker family.|$|R
25|$|Electric {{traction}} {{was introduced}} in 1905 with electric multiple units operating between Uxbridge, Harrow-on-the-Hill and Baker Street. To remove steam and smoke from the tunnels in central London, the railway purchased electric locomotives, exchanged for steam locomotives at Harrow from 1908. In 1910, a seventeen-minute silent film recording was made showing large portions of the journey from Baker Street to Aylesbury and Uxbridge, seen from the <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> a train. The film survives and is publicly available.|$|E
25|$|Nubia Docter Barahona, {{a ten-year-old}} American girl, was abused and murdered on February 11, 2011. Her {{body was found}} February 14, 2011, wrapped in a plastic garbage bag {{in the bed of}} her adoptive father's pickup truck on the side of I-95 in West Palm Beach, Florida. Her body had {{partially}} decomposed from being covered in chemicals, possibly pesticides. Her twin brother, Victor Docter Barahona, was in the <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> the truck with his father, suffering seizures from chemical burns and inhalation of toxic gas.|$|E
25|$|On January 7, 1951, William Sause {{and three}} other men entered the <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> a heavy crane aboard a barge on the Skipanon River, a {{tributary}} of the Columbia near Astoria, Oregon. When they started the crane's engine, the engine vibrations sent the crane toppling backwards into the water. One man, John Gibson, jumped clear. Sause and Harold Holmes were knocked unconscious and then were rescued by Gibson; the fourth man, Charles Sanderson, was trapped in the cab and drowned {{at the bottom of the}} river.|$|E
50|$|From February 1901, all of {{the class}} were fitted with larger Belpaire boilers which {{increased}} their weight and also increased the heating surface, matters identified as deficient in William Thow’s Report of 1889. At the same time, wooden cabs replaced the open <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> the earlier batches.|$|R
60|$|So {{they turned}} into another street, and {{presently}} {{they came to}} a stand. There was a long row <b>of</b> <b>cabs</b> there, <b>of</b> various kinds, all waiting to be employed. Among them were several Hansoms.|$|R
50|$|Seven 4+6-car {{trainsets}} (70 vehicles) {{were built}} between 1996 and 1999 to replace ageing Odakyu 3100 series NSE trains. Unlike earlier Romancecar trainsets, which used articulated carriages, the 30000 series sets have 20 m long bogie cars. The inner driving <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> the 4+6-car formations have gangway doors.|$|R
25|$|During the {{construction}} of the DD class, a number of changes were made. The first locomotives built featured low running plates with splashers over the driving wheels and a narrow cab. However, after 26 such examples were built the design was altered with high running plates mounted above the driving wheels and a more comfortable full-width pressed metal <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> Canadian design, a feature incorporated at the request of Victorian Railways Chief Commissioner and former Canadian Pacific Railway Transportation Manager Thomas Tait. These became hallmarks of all subsequent VR steam locomotive designs.|$|E
25|$|In September 1951 Clapp {{resigned}} {{for health}} reasons but continued {{to act as a}} consultant to the Department of Shipping and Transport. On 14 July 1952 the first of the B class diesel electric locomotives, which were to revolutionise train operations in Victoria, was delivered to the VR and travelled from NSW to Melbourne's Spencer Street Station under its own power. The elderly Harold Clapp climbed into the <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> locomotive B 60 and sat at the controls, and was honoured by having the new locomotive named after him.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{vehicles}} over 2,032mm (80inches) wide must {{be equipped}} with three amber front and three red rear identification lamps spaced between 6 and 12inches apart {{at the center of}} the front and rear of the vehicle, as high as practicable. The front identification lamps are typically mounted atop the <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> vehicles. The purpose of these lamps is to alert other drivers to the presence of a wide (and usually, tall) vehicle. This type of identification lamp can also be found on road trains in Australia.|$|E
50|$|Although {{most of the}} {{locomotives}} had <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> {{the standard}} Caledonian Railway style with curved cut-outs on the sides, {{the last of the}} batch (number 917) had a more modern style <b>of</b> <b>cab</b> with two arched windows on either cabside. Sources differ as to whether it was built in this form or whether the cab was modified early in the locomotive's life. Apart from no.917 the only other Caledonian engines to carry side-window cabs were the 179 Class.|$|R

25|$|The first {{reported}} incident of crime at the Anacostia station {{occurred during the}} station's construction. Three teenagers broke into the construction site on July 7, 1989; stole tools; and broke the glass on the <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> a crane before being arrested. Concern about crime at the station led Metro to station additional transit police officers at Anacostia station {{in the weeks after}} the station's opening, and D.C. police patrolled the station's parking garage. Fear of crime {{was one of the reasons}} why Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes in 1991 which would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia station.|$|E
25|$|It was Tur's live {{reports that}} led to Denny being rescued by local black civilian, Bobby Green Jr. of South Central Los Angeles. Green watched Denny's assault live on {{television}} and rushed to the scene. Upon arriving, he found Denny had climbed back into the <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> his truck and was attempting to drive away, {{but was unable to}} go far because he was drifting in and out of consciousness. Green moved Denny out of the driver's seat and drove him to Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood. Upon arriving at the hospital Denny went into a seizure.|$|E
25|$|Upon arrival, the sheriff's deputies {{sealed off}} the spring with crime-scene tape. Ben's tanks, wet suit and other diving {{equipment}} were not present {{and there were}} no signs of a struggle near his truck or anywhere else he could have been. His wallet, with almost $700 in cash, and cell phone were in the <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> his truck; dive logs showed that he had explored the cave and a map he made was also found. At the Santa Rosa Beach house officers found his dog, hungry from having been unfed for two days. Based on these circumstances, police and dive shop employees assumed that he had never resurfaced and had in all probability drowned somewhere in the cave trying to get out. Cadaver dogs alerted on the water surface, further supporting that theory.|$|E
50|$|The {{cabin is}} {{shared with the}} BB7200 and BB22200 series and have even {{a great deal in}} common with <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> other SNCF {{locomotives}} of the 1960s. This class was also the first to introduce the VI ("Vitesse Imposée") cruise control system which is now standard on all SNCF locomotives delivered after 1971.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> the {{locomotive}} were converted from Western Region right-hand {{drive to the}} standard British Rail left-hand drive arrangement. The rebuilt locomotive was completed and ready for trials in October 1958. It retained its original BR black livery, with a silver stripe around {{the middle of the}} body and silver numbers.|$|R
50|$|On April 23, 2012, the <b>CAB’s</b> Board <b>of</b> Directors {{approved}} the creation <b>of</b> the <b>CAB</b> CEO Radio Council to oversee various matters {{pertaining to the}} private radio industry.
