40|$|In wild birds, the {{proximate}} {{and ultimate}} {{factors that affect}} circulating <b>carotenoid</b> concentrations remain poorly understood. We studied variation in plasma <b>carotenoid</b> concentrations across several scales: annual, seasonal, pair, territory and individual, and evaluated whether plasma <b>carotenoid</b> concentrations explained reproductive outcome of wild American kestrels (Falco sparverius). We sampled plasma <b>carotenoid</b> concentrations of 99 female and 80 male incubating kestrels from April to June in 2008 to 2012. Plasma <b>carotenoid</b> concentrations were explained by an interaction between year and sex, date, and random effects for pair and individual identity. In general, plasma <b>carotenoid</b> concentrations of males were signiﬁcantly higher than females, but this depended on year. Within a breeding season, earlier nesting kestrels had higher <b>carotenoid</b> concentrations than later nesting kestrels, a pattern that is coincident with seasonal trends in local ﬁtness. Pair and individual identity explained variation in <b>carotenoid</b> concentrations suggesting that <b>carotenoid</b> concentrations of mated birds were correlated, and some individuals consistently maintained higher <b>carotenoid</b> levels than others. Male <b>carotenoid</b> concentrations were positively associated with number of young ﬂedged per pair. These {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that higher quality individuals have higher <b>carotenoid</b> levels compared to lower quality individuals, despite annual variations in <b>carotenoid</b> availability...|$|R

The expression vectors were introduced into wildtype R. erythropolis AN 12 and their effect on <b>carotenoid</b> accumulation was measured.

40|$|The {{factors that}} {{regulate}} storage organ <b>carotenoid</b> content {{remain to be}} fully elucidated, despite the nutritional and economic importance of this class of compound. Recent findings suggest that <b>carotenoid</b> pool size is determined, at least in part, by the activity of <b>carotenoid</b> cleavage dioxygenases. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether <b>Carotenoid</b> Cleavage Dioxygenase 4 (CCD 4) activity affects potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber <b>carotenoid</b> content. Microarray analysis revealed elevated expression of the potato CCD 4 gene in mature tubers from white-fleshed cultivars compared with higher <b>carotenoid</b> yellow-fleshed tubers. The expression level of the potato CCD 4 gene was down-regulated using an RNA interference (RNAi) approach in stable transgenic lines. Down-regulation in tubers resulted in an increased <b>carotenoid</b> content, 2 - to 5 -fold higher than in control plants. The increase in <b>carotenoid</b> content was mainly due to elevated violaxanthin content, implying that this <b>carotenoid</b> may act as the in vivo substrate. Although transcript level was also reduced in plant organs other than tubers, such as leaves, stems, and roots, there was no change in <b>carotenoid</b> content in these organs. However, <b>carotenoid</b> levels were elevated in flower petals from RNAi lines. As well as changes in tuber <b>carotenoid</b> content, tubers from RNAi lines exhibited phenotypes such as heat sprouting, formation of chain tubers, and an elongated shape. These results suggest that the product of the CCD 4 reaction may be an important factor in tuber heat responses...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, to {{investigate}} the mechanisms regulating <b>carotenoid</b> accumulation in citrus, a culture system {{was set up in}} vitro with juice sacs of three citrus varieties, Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.), Valencia orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck), and Lisbon lemon (Citrus limon Burm. f.). The juice sacs of all the three varieties enlarged gradually with <b>carotenoid</b> accumulation. The changing patterns of <b>carotenoid</b> content and the expression of <b>carotenoid</b> metabolic genes in juice sacs in vitro were similar to those ripening on trees in the three varieties. Using this system, the changes in the <b>carotenoid</b> content and the expression of <b>carotenoid</b> metabolic genes in response to environmental stimuli were investigated. The results showed that <b>carotenoid</b> accumulation was induced by blue light treatment, but was not affected by red light treatment in the three varieties. Different regulation of CitPSY expression, which was up-regulated by blue light while unaffected by red light, led to different changes in <b>carotenoid</b> content in response to these two treatments in Satsuma mandarin and Valencia orange. In all three varieties, increases in <b>carotenoid</b> content were observed with sucrose and mannitol treatments. However, the accumulation of <b>carotenoid</b> in the two treatments was regulated by distinct mechanisms at the transcriptional level. With abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, the expression of the genes investigated in this study was up-regulated in Satsuma mandarin and Lisbon lemon, indicating that ABA induced its own biosynthesis at the transcriptional level. This feedback regulation of ABA led to decreases in <b>carotenoid</b> content. With gibberellin (GA) treatment, <b>carotenoid</b> content was significantly decreased in the three varieties. Changes in the expression of genes related to <b>carotenoid</b> metabolism varied among the three varieties in response to GA treatment. These results provided insights into improving <b>carotenoid</b> content and composition in citrus during fruit maturation...|$|R

40|$|Considering the {{importance}} of dietary constraints for the widely held view of <b>carotenoid</b> pigmentation as an honest quality indicator, there is surprisingly little data on <b>carotenoid</b> availability in different natural diets or along environmental gradients. Here we investigate the <b>carotenoid</b> availability in the main diet of breeding great tits Parus major, living in urban and rural environments with known differences in <b>carotenoid</b> pigmentation. <b>Carotenoid</b> availability for nestling great tits was investigated in two respects: (1) {{quantity and quality of}} diet (i. e., caterpillar abundance and their <b>carotenoid</b> concentration), and (2) parental feeding frequency. First, caterpillars were generally more abundant in the urban environment and the four common Lepidoptera (i. e., caterpillars) genera studied were also heavier here. Second, as determined by HPLC analysis of the caterpillar genera, <b>carotenoid</b> concentration was significantly lower in the urban caterpillars. Furthermore, all except one of the caterpillar genera had higher lutein/zeaxanthin ratio in urban areas, which is in accordance with earlier studies of <b>carotenoid</b> composition in great tit yolk. Third, parental feeding frequency was about twice as high to urban broods compared to rural broods. This result may simply reflect the higher caterpillar abundance (shorter search time) in the urban environment. Poor food quality (low <b>carotenoid</b> concentration) seems therefore to be compensated by quantity in the urban environment. As a consequence the <b>carotenoid</b> availability seems to be similar for nestlings in the two environments...|$|R

5|$|Pigments are {{coloured}} chemicals (such as melanin) {{in animal}} tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a white coat in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), {{an example of}} seasonal camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, are unable to synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones. For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid pigments synthesized by plants. In {{the case of the}} flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize <b>carotenoids.</b> The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both <b>carotenoids</b> and (green) chlorophyll.

40|$|Background: For many bird species, {{vision is}} the primary sensory {{modality}} used to locate and assess food items.

Among wild House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), {{we have found that}} retinal <b>carotenoid</b> accumulation varies significantly among individuals and is related to dietary <b>carotenoid</b> intake. If diet-induced changes in retinal <b>carotenoid</b> accumulation alter spectral sensitivity, then they have the potential to affect visually mediated foraging performance. Methodology/Principal Findings: In two experiments, we measured foraging performance of house finches with dietarily manipulated retinal <b>carotenoid</b> levels. We tested each bird’s ability to extract visually contrasting food items from a matrix of inedible distracters under high-contrast (full) and dimmer low-contrast (red-filtered) lighting conditions. In experiment one, zeaxanthin-supplemented birds had significantly increased retinal <b>carotenoid</b> levels, but declined in foraging performance in the high-contrast condition relative to astaxanthin-supplemented birds that showed no change in retinal <b>carotenoid</b> accumulation. In experiments one and two combined, we found that retinal <b>carotenoid</b> concentrations predicted relative foraging performance in the low- vs. high-contrast light conditions in a curvilinear pattern. Performance was positively correlated with retinal <b>carotenoid</b> accumulation among birds with low to medium levels of accumulation (, 0. 5 – 1. 5 mg/retina), but declined among birds with very high levels (. 2. 0 mg/retina) ...|$|R

When the dyad is dissolved in hexane energy transfer from the <b>carotenoid</b> S 2 state to the fullerene takes place on an ultrafast (sub 100 fs) timescale and no intramolecular electron transfer was detected.
