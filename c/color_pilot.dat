The {{first half of the}} show had reached its goal, and the funding had continued for the second half. However, Anime Sols folded, and Discotek Media picked up the slack, with an announcement of the show on DVD. Also included in the set is the show's <b>color</b> <b>pilot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{movie version}} {{started with the}} <b>color</b> <b>pilot</b> footage, added in {{additional}} footage and subplots (also in color, and including a new subplot featuring the actress Luciana Paluzzi), and was first released in Hong Kong in late 1964 and later shown in the U.S. as a double feature with The Spy with My Face in early 1966. In the UK it was originally released as a support feature to the James Garner/Julie Andrews comedy The Americanization of Emily in 1965, but its release coincided with the broadcast of the series. It later appeared as a top billed feature in many cinemas.|$|E

5000|$|The {{producers}} on The Munsters Today {{felt the}} well known Munster house {{was just as}} important as the characters, so an authentic scale model replica was built for the series to accompany the limited colour stock footage from Munster, Go Home!. The scale model worked well on the show, and many did not notice it was not the same house. The garden was decorated with dried oregano. There are some slight differences between the original house and the scale model used for the new show: seen from the front, the gates are now directly in front of the porch as opposed to slightly to the right. The gateposts are also dramatically smaller and less bulky than in the original; and around the perimeter, instead of a wall, are yet more posts with spiked fencing in-between for several intervals, somewhat similar to what is seen in the 1964 <b>color</b> <b>pilot.</b> There is also a small arched basement window that looks down into Grandpa's lab. Today this model can be seen in Universal's new House of Horrors. A virtual tour of the Munster Mansion is available on The Munsters Today Information Archives website, along with the shows [...] "career" [...] across film and TV history. The website also includes rare details of the model replica, and details the various made for TV movies that utilised different Munster Mansion variations, such as Here Come The Munsters and The Munsters' Scary Little Christmas.|$|E

40|$|Laser Eye Protection (LEP) devices {{selectively}} {{alter the}} spectral environment and affect {{the ability to}} identify and discriminate <b>color.</b> <b>Pilots</b> and mariners must wear LEP for their safety and still {{make decisions based on}} colored lights and objects. These abilities can be compromised with LEP. Determining the level of degradation caused by LEP remains challenging; LEP devices are not uniform in construction and results from laboratory tests may be poor indicators of actual user performance. In addition, performance deficits in the maritime and aviation environment can be exacerbated by cognitive distracters. However there is little known about the interaction of attentional effects with color performance deficits from the use of LEP. Several different mathematical models of color vision were utilized to model and predict color vision performance. Spectral reflectance or transmission was measured and placed into equations utilizing color matching functions of the standard observer. These values were then translated into different color spaces. These results were compared with actual performance. Results for modeling indicate that models that take into account color zone shifts, rather than color shifts are more accurate, and that models cannot yet account for all aspects of color vision performance such as when cognitively distracted...|$|R

The performance gain of the proposed scheme is verified by simulations. Comment: This paper is under the second-round review for an IEEE journa...|$|R

The raiding party sailed into Tripoli harbor aboard the ketch USS Intrepid - itself a captured former Tripolitan war vessel - which was disguised to look like a Maltese merchant vessel, flying British <b>colors.</b> The <b>pilot</b> of the ship claimed to have lost its anchors in a storm and sought permission to tie up next to the captured Philadelphia. When the two ships had tied up, Decatur and his crew overwhelmed the small force guarding the vessel, using only swords and pikes, so as not to alert the Tripolitan authorities to their presence by firing any gunshots. Unable to be sailed away, the Philadelphia was destroyed by Decatur and his crew, who then safely escaped.

40|$|Guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) is a warm-season, annual, leguminous crop {{that was}} {{introduced}} to the United States in 1903. Guar is harvested with a combine at which time seed pods and leaves are removed. Seeds are processed after harvesting to obtain refined guar splits. A primary use for guar is the production of guar (galactomannon) gum from the refined splits. Guar seed processing equipment primarily originates in India, where the crop has been grown for many years. The purpose of this research is to develop a scalable system for producing refined guar splits that will reach a minimum viscosity of 6500 cP at a 0. 92 % solids concentration and a white <b>color.</b> Two <b>pilot</b> scale process streams including heating, milling, sieving, and polishing were developed to produce refined splits. The target viscosity of 6500 cP was achieved under certain conditions for both processes. A white color was not achieved, however predictive models were developed {{to determine the effects of}} experimental factors on color and viscosity response variables. Impurities in refined split samples greatly decrease viscosity of the final solution. Thoroughly cleaning and polishing splits is critical to achieving a consistently high viscosity. Quality metrics vary by end user and affect process parameters. Increasing polishing time increased viscosity but with lower yields of polished splits. Increasing heating temperature had some desirable effects on viscosity and color, but extra costs will be associated with higher energy demands. Raw bean color appeared to affect the color of the refined splits. Darker splits are not as desired by end users and are often purchased from processors at discounted rates. Gum content is not affected by darkening of the seed coat. However, darker color is not as desired by industries where aesthetics is a concern, such as food and pharmaceuticals. Darkening of seed coats can be reduced during the growing and reproducing of the crop. In addition, alternative polishing technologies can be considered to improve yield and efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|A bearing {{is a line}} {{passing through}} the station that points in a {{specific}} direction, such as 270 degrees (due West). NDB bearings provide a charted, consistent method for defining paths aircraft can fly. In this fashion, NDBs can, like VORs, define [...] "airways" [...] in the sky. Aircraft follow these pre-defined routes to complete a flight plan. Airways are numbered and standardized on charts; colored airways are used for low to medium frequency stations like the NDB and are charted in brown on sectional charts. Green and red airways are plotted east and west while amber and blue airways are plotted north and south. There is only one colored airway left in the continental United States, located {{off the coast of}} North Carolina and is called G13 or Green 13. Alaska is the only other state in the United States {{to make use of the}} <b>colored</b> airway systems. <b>Pilots</b> follow these routes by tracking radials across various navigation stations, and turning at some. While most airways in the United States are based on VORs, NDB airways are common elsewhere, especially in the developing world and in lightly populated areas of developed countries, like the Canadian Arctic, since they can have a long range and are much less expensive to operate than VORs.|$|R

[...] The S&S article continued saying, [...] "the only viewers enjoying color right now are those watching the <b>pilot</b> <b>color</b> TV station in Bremerhaven, which went on the air in 1975." [...] Beginning in July 1978, the largest single AFN Bremerhaven target audience were members of the US Army’s 2nd Armored Division (Forward) based on the newly constructed Lucius D. Clay Kaserne in Garlstedt, Germany.Most of the 2nd Armored Division's family members resided in and around the nearby city of Osterholz-Scharmbeck. All of these Americans were served by the AFN Bremerhaven FM transmitter located in Garlstedt. The division had approximately 3,500 soldiers and another approximately 2,500 family members as well as hundreds of US and German civilian employees. (The division newspaper, [...] "The 2nd AD Dispatch," [...] in its final edition of June 12, 1992, reported that, at its peak, the division had [...] "4,400 soldiers and 4,200 family members.") No doubt, the addition of this unit in 1978 greatly increased the mission of AFN Bremerhaven until 1993 when both the 2nd Armored Division (Forward) and AFN Bremerhaven’s deactivations occurred.|$|R

If the pilot applicant is unable to pass any of the office based tests, a real world operational test is available. This test consists of a ground based chart reading and control tower signal light test for Third Class medical certification (This is called the Operational Color Vision Test or OCVT), {{and in addition to}} that, a specialized [...] "Medical Flight Test" [...] (MFT) is required for Second and First Class medical certification. The applicant performs an actual flight test with an FAA Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI) for the purpose of further demonstrating [...] "the ability to perceive those colors necessary for the safe performance of airman duties", which is the color vision requirement as written in the FARs. Note that [...] "Normal Color Vision" [...] is not required, as a certain amount of color vision deficiency is considered safe and permitted. If the tests are passed, a [...] "Letter of Evidence" [...] (LOE) from the FAA is issued, which serves as evidence that the pilot meets the standards for Color Vision and the AME is permitted to issue the class of Medical Certificate indicated on the LOE (All classes if both the OCVT and MFT are passed) with no related restriction if all other medical requirements are met. This allows the pilot to receive a medical certificate with no restrictions related to color vision without the requirement of passing an office based color vision test at every subsequent renewal.|$|R
