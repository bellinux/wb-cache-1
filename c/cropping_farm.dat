40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the use of}} a whole farm model in a participatory modelling research approach to examine the sensitivity of four contrasting case study farms to a likely climate change scenario. The newly generated information was used to support discussions with the participating farmers in the search for options to design more profitable and sustainable farming systems in Queensland Australia. The four case studies contrasted in key systems characteristics: opportunism in decision making, i. e. flexible versus rigid crop rotations; function, i. e. production of livestock or crops; and level of intensification, i. e. dryland versus irrigated agriculture. Tested tactical and strategic changes under a baseline and climate change scenario (CCS) involved changes in the allocation of land between cropping and grazing enterprises, alternative allocations of limited irrigation water across cropping enterprises, and different management rules for planting wheat and sorghum in rainfed cropping. The results show that expected impacts from a likely climate change scenario were evident in the following increasing order: the irrigated <b>cropping</b> <b>farm</b> case study, the cropping and grazing farm, the more opportunistic rainfed <b>cropping</b> <b>farm</b> and the least opportunistic rainfed <b>cropping</b> <b>farm.</b> We concluded that in most cases the participating farmers were operating close to the efficiency frontier (i. e. in the relationship between profits and risks). This indicated that options to adapt to climate change might need to evolve from investments in the development of more innovative cropping and grazing systems and/or transformational changes on existing farming systems. We expect that even though assimilating expected changes in climate seems to be rather intangible and premature for these farmers, as innovations are developed, adaptation is likely to follow quickly. The multiple interactions among farm management components in complex and dynamic farm businesses operating in a variable and changing climate, make the use of whole farm participatory modelling approaches valuable tools to quantify benefits and trade-offs from alternative farming systems designs in the search for improved profitability and resilience...|$|E

The adoption of double cropping soybeans with wheat is evaluated with an expanded model which includes availability of specialized equipment and human capital. It is found that the empirical farm size-technology adoption relationship is consistent with risk aversion and a high covariance of returns between {{the old and new}} technologies. Accounting for human and physical capital differences across farms improves the power of the hypothesis tests. Key words: double <b>cropping,</b> <b>farm</b> size, risk, technology adoption.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate one of the more recent models of technology adoption proposed by Just and Zilberman (1983, 1984).

40|$|With {{the removal}} of many forms of {{government}} intervention from the agricultural sector, risk management has become an increasingly important issue for New Zealand farmers. One strategy for managing risk is enterprise diversification, {{and there has been}} a great deal of research on how this might be done most appropriately. A recent suggestion is that the use of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) may provide appropriate information. The CAPM can be used to determine the proportion of systematic (or non - diversifiable), and non - systematic (or diversifiable) risk associated with each activity, the expected return for each activity, and whether activities are being compensated adequately for the amount of systematic risk associated with them.) Ultimately, it could be used to generate optimal farm plans using much more simplified computational procedures than more traditional quadratic programming approaches. Unlike the traditional approaches to farm planning, the CAPM is able to measure the contribution that each farm activity makes to the variance of the total farm portfolio. A Farm Sector Capital Asset Pricing Model (FSCAPM) was developed for New Zealand mixed cropping agriculture. It was observed that the model results were sensitive to various components of the model, including the choice of a farm sector portfolio, the way the activity returns were measured and whether the activity returns were deflated. An application of the preferred variant of the FSCAPM to the Lincoln University Mixed <b>Cropping</b> <b>Farm</b> showed that high levels of systematic risk were associated with activities on this farm. This suggests that off - farm investment might be a more feasible strategy than on - farm diversification for reducing risk on the farm. The results also showed that all the farm activities examined were being adequately compensated for the level of systematic risk it was accepting. This study makes an addition the limited research which has been undertaken on how to apply the CAPM framework to an agricultural setting...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{results from}} research work carried {{out for the}} Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) on the financial performance of organic farms for 1999 / 00 and 2000 / 01 financial years. The aim of the report is to collate financial data for organic farms differentiated by farm type, {{in order to provide}} continuity between previous studies (project code: OF 0190) on the economics of organic farming covering years 1995 / 96 to 1998 / 99 and new research work carried out by the Institute of Rural Sciences, UWA, to obtain financial information for organic farms for the period 2001 / 02 to 2003 / 04 (project code: OF 0189). The financial data in this report were not collected directly, but were derived from other DEFRA-funded studies. Data are from farms of varied sizes within the samples for each farm type and not always of adequate sample size. This was particularly the case for horticulture while other datasets mainly comprised five farms or more per farm type. A cautious approach is required when viewing smaller farm samples as {{it is not possible to}} draw conclusions on the organic sector from these results; but may permit observation of data trends for the particular set of farms within the sample. Where possible, to provide an idea of economic trends over time, continuous farm data for 1998 / 99 and in some cases for 2001 / 02 are shown alongside the 1999 / 00 and 2000 / 01 data. The report highlights results for organic cropping, horticulture, dairy, lowland and LFA cattle and sheep farms and one set of results for in-conversion dairy farms. Comparable conventional farm datasets are shown alongside some organic datasets for comparison. This was the case for both organic and in-conversion dairy farms and LFA and lowland cattle and sheep farms for 2000 / 01 datasets only. From this report, the financial data show that most farm types under organic management had positive net farm incomes (NFI) with the exception of the in-conversion dairy farm sample. Management and investment incomes (MII) were positive values for all farm types with the exception of lowland and LFA cattle and sheep farms from the FBS sample.

40|$|Agriculture is {{the source}} of 16 percent of Australia’s {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions. Research has shown that changes in agricultural practices can increase carbon sequestration in soils and/or vegetation and reduce GHG emissions. Given worldwide commitments to reduce GHG emissions, {{there is a need to}} better understand the potential for Australian agriculture to contribute to GHG mitigation. GHG abatement practices will only be adopted if profitable to farmers. Without strong evidence for increased profitability, there is no incentive for farmers to move away from their current practices. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate economics in any assessment of the potential for Australian farms to contribute to GHG mitigation. We performed an integrated modelling exercise to predict the GHG mitigation potential and whole-farm economic implications of different mitigation practices that can be implemented on Australian grain farms. This exercise was undertaken in two stages. In the first stage, a range of potential management practices that could provide GHG abatement were identified; these involved adding extra organic matter to the soil or altering nitrogen fertiliser use. The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) was used to estimate the effects of abatement practices on productivity, soil carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emissions and net GHG emissions over time. In the second stage, we develop an economic model that predicts annual revenues at a paddock scale, as well as whole-farm costs and benefits. Taking a whole-farm approach ensures that the full costs of different practices, such as investment in new capital equipment, is included. We present results for a 6, 000 hectare dryland <b>cropping</b> <b>farm</b> in the north-central wheatbelt of Western Australia. This area is representative of the typical Mediterranean climate found in some of Australia’s major grain growing regions. We predict that stubble retention and other organic matter additions increase soil carbon, which is important for greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Productivity gains are possible under some of the GHG abatement practices, i. e. GHG abatement and productivity gains can be achieved simultaneously. Increasing nitrogen fertiliser application or replacing volunteer, weedy pastures with improved, legume pastures are predicted to increase earnings and operating profits. However, when accounting for interest and tax, there was no economic advantage or disadvantage of adopting any of the GHG abatement practices. While gross margins per hectare are positive in almost every season, the whole-farm annual profits were negative for 30 - 40 percent of years. This study demonstrates the benefits of comprehensive economic analyses to accompany any biophysical analyses of the GHG mitigation potential of the Australian agricultural industry, and outlines a framework in which economic and biophysical analyses can be combined.

40|$|A sound {{understanding}} of the transport and fate of leached nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 [...] N) in shallow groundwater is key to understanding the impacts of land use intensification {{on the quality of}} groundwater and surface water bodies. However, these are not well understood in the Lower Rangitikei catchment. This study was undertaken to assess the groundwater flow pattern and its interactions with the Rangitikei River; the redox conditions of the groundwater; and the extent of NO 3 [...] N attenuation in shallow groundwater in the Lower Rangitikei catchment. Groundwater depths were collected from more than 100 wells to map the piezometric surface to inform the groundwater flow pattern within the study area. Groundwater interactions with the Rangitikei River were estimated qualitatively from two longitudinal river flow and water quality surveys (on 6 th and 20 th January 2015) under low-flow conditions. Fifteen wells were sampled and analysed in the study area during December 2014 to characterise the groundwater redox condition. A total of nine piezometers were installed at a range of depths (3 m and 6 m) on two dairy farms (sand country and river terrace) and one <b>cropping</b> <b>farm</b> (sand country). In these piezometers, NO 3 [...] N, dissolved oxygen (DO) and other parameters were monitored over March, April and May 2015. Single-well push-pull tests were used to measure NO 3 [...] N attenuation in shallow groundwater during May 2015. Groundwater flow was largely influenced by the regional topography, particularly shallow groundwater (< 30 m), where it flows from elevated areas such as Marton in a southerly direction towards the Rangitikei River. The longitudinal river flow and water quality surveys revealed a dynamic relationship between the river and the underlying aquifer. The surveys suggested groundwater discharges into the river both upstream and downstream of Bulls. The groundwater redox characterisation showed generally anoxic/reduced groundwater across the lower Rangitikei catchment area. Groundwater typically has a low DO concentration (< 1 mg/L) with elevated levels of available electron donors, particularly dissolved organic carbon and Fe 2 +. These groundwater characteristics provide for generally favourable conditions for NO 3 [...] N reduction. Monitoring at the installed piezometers showed a generally low NO 3 [...] N concentration at these sites. The push-pull tests revealed NO 3 [...] N reduction occurring at all three sites, with the rate of reduction varying between 0. 04 mg N L- 1 hr- 1 to 1. 57 mg N L- 1 hr- 1. These results suggest that groundwater is likely to be connected with the Lower Rangitikei River. However, NO 3 [...] N concentrations in the river and groundwater were generally low, especially for the river at low flows. This suggests NO 3 [...] N may be undergoing reduction within shallow groundwater before it has a chance to seep into the river. Further evidence for appreciable levels of NO 3 [...] N reduction in the shallow groundwater is provided by the redox characterisation of reduced groundwater and the push-pull tests. However, more spatial and temporal surveys and in-situ measurements of denitrification occurrence in the shallow groundwater of the study area are required...|$|E
