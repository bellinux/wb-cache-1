50|$|Save for {{the first}} series of Prussian {{locomotives}} (EG 701 - 713, later E 77 51 to 77 63), all engines had originally had <b>cowl</b> <b>doors.</b> At the reinstatement by DR though, those were dropped. The trailer axles of the threepartite linked locomotives were at first embedded steeply and later flexibly, so that the wheel arrangement was changed from (1B)(B1) to (1'B)(B1'). But even after this conversion they were not yet satisfied with the engines' smoothness.|$|R
50|$|The unit {{aircraft}} were basic CH-3C Sikorsky helicopters models. No armor {{was deemed}} necessary {{at this time}} since the mission was to be clandestine and the power/weight ratio was considered more important. Even then, with the equipped engines, power was sometimes very marginal. In early 1968, the engines were upgraded from the 1300 hp model to the 1500 hp models which was a vast improvement in the high temperature/humidity environment. With the upgrading of the engines, armor was installed on the engine <b>cowling</b> <b>doors,</b> the transmission doors, and around the tail rotor gearbox. Designation was changed from CH-3C to CH-3E.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Hyper-X program was to flight demonstrate an airframe-integrated hypersonic vehicle. On March 27, 2004, the Hyper-X program team successfully conducted flight 2 and achieved all of the research objectives. The Hyper-X research vehicle successfully separated from the Hyper-X launch vehicle and achieved the desired engine test conditions before the experiment began. The research vehicle rejected the disturbances caused by the <b>cowl</b> <b>door</b> opening and the fuel turning on and off and maintained the engine test conditions throughout the experiment. After the engine test was complete, the vehicle recovered and descended along a trajectory while performing research maneuvers. The last data acquired showed that the vehicle maintained control to the water. This report will {{provide an overview of}} the research vehicle guidance and control systems and the performance of the vehicle during the separation event and engine test. The research maneuvers were performed to collect data for aerodynamics and flight controls research. This report also will provide an overview of the flight controls related research and results...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasingly}} high {{capital investment}} required for large autoclaves, ovens and facilities for the processmg of large composite components creates {{a number of}} financial constraints for the development and manufacturing of larger composite aircraft products. This thesis has investigated the use of heated tooling {{as an alternative to}} the use of autoclave and oven curing. A design and development methodology for heated tools has been proposed while a number of heated tooling options have been identified and described. Three representative heated tool options using heater mats, electro-conductive textiles and wire heater elements have been evaluated. The curing capability of a prototype heated tool incorporating wire heater elements has been proved by carrying out a number of curing tests on RFI (Resin Fihn Infusion) laminates. The moulded laminates indicate that a 78 - 83 % extent of cure is achieved prior to post-cure. The fibre and void content of cured laminates has also been verified through acid digestion and microscopy, where an acceptable fibre volume fraction (Vf) of 55 - 57 % and a void content of less than 2 % have been achieved. The usefulness of ID and 3 D thermal Finite Element Analysis for the design and simulation of heated tooling has also been studied. A manufacturing and cost analysis study carried out has identified potential production implications, while the cost effectiveness of heated tooling compared to oven and autoclave processmg has been indicated. Cost reductions are noted in capital investments, operational costs and production set-up costs per part. The work described in this thesis gives valuable information for the implementation of heated tooling as a new processing method for aerospace composite products. The information can prove useful when considermg the processing options of large composite parts such as wing spars, fan <b>cowl</b> <b>doors</b> and wing skins. GKN Aerospace Service...|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{mounting}} was {{designed so that}} the Styx could be powered {{with a variety of}} engines in the [...] range. Five different engine types (and one sub-type) were fitted to Styx variants and are listed below. Early photos show the seven-cylinder Salmson 7Ac, [...] radial engine, mounted with its cylinders uncowled. The main accessories, attached to the frame immediately behind the engine, could be reached via <b>cowling</b> side <b>doors.</b> Its fuel tank was in the wing. Behind a sloping firewall the fuselage was all-metal and of rectangular section, its duralumin tube frame covered with long, narrow dural strips placed horizontally, edge-to-edge. The pilot's cockpit was open and placed under the wing with a circular window forward of the port-side cockpit door and at mid-fuselage height to provide a downward view.|$|R

40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{bodywork}} construction in the automotive industry the constant striving to reduce weight continues to occupy a front-line position. Over {{the last few years}} the use of thin steel sheets has become further established, in particular {{as a consequence of the}} consistent development of new qualities of steel, Trends in lightweight construction, such as, for example, the use of tailored blanks, play a central role. Thin aluminium sheets are increasingly being used as lightweight metal for bodywork fabrication, both in the structure as a whole or in combination with steel. On multi-material design bodywork of this nature, the preferred manufacturing material for the moving add-on parts (<b>doors,</b> engine <b>cowls,</b> rear <b>doors)</b> is aluminium to enable easier handling of the moving parts when the vehicle is in use as well as in the interests of achieving a reduction in weight. Overall, the potential for using steel in lightweight bodywork construction has attained a high level of development with the result that the potential for further optimisation is increasingly diminishing. As a consequence, lightweight construction materials such as magnesium in particular but also aluminium are set to increase in importance in the future. In the following article we shall be presenting the results of studies into the forming and welding of magnesium sheets (AZ 31), achieved within a growth cell (TeMaK) ...|$|R
5000|$|Static dischargers, {{commonly}} known as static wicks or static discharge wicks, are installed on the trailing edges of aircraft, including (electrically grounded) ailerons, elevators, rudder, wing, horizontal and vertical stabilizer tips. Fitted on almost all civilian aircraft today, they are high electrical resistance (6-200 megaohm) devices with a lower corona voltage than the surrounding aircraft structure. They control the corona discharge into the atmosphere, isolating noise and preventing it from interfering with aircraft communication equipment. They are used on aircraft to allow the continuous satisfactory operation of onboard navigation and radio communication systems during precipitation (p-static) conditions. Precipitation static is an electrical charge on an airplane caused by flying through rain, snow, ice, or dust particles. When the aircraft charge is great enough, it discharges into the surrounding air. The discharge path is through pointed aircraft extremities, such as antennas, wing tips, vertical and horizontal stabilizers, and other protrusions. The discharge creates a broad-band radio frequency noise from DC to 1000 MHz. This RF noise can affect aircraft communication. During adverse charging conditions (air friction), static dischargers limit the potential static buildup on the aircraft and control interference generated by static charge. Static dischargers are not lightning arrestors and do not reduce or {{increase the likelihood of}} an aircraft being struck by lightning. Static dischargers are subject to damage as a result of lightning strike to the aircraft, and should be inspected after a lightning strike to ensure proper static discharge operation. Static dischargers will not function if they are not properly bonded to the aircraft. There must be a conductive path {{from all parts of the}} airplane to the dischargers, otherwise they will be useless. Access panels, <b>doors,</b> <b>cowls,</b> navigation lights, antenna mounting hardware, control surfaces, etc., can create static noise if they cannot discharge through the static wick.|$|R
