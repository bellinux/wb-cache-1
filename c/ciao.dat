5|$|<b>Ciao</b> Italia: Live from Italy (credited as Madonna: <b>Ciao,</b> Italia! Live from Italy in {{the video}} sequence) is a video album by American singer-songwriter Madonna and was {{released}} by Warner Reprise Video and Sire Records on May 24, 1988. It contained footage from a previous TV special of the Who's That Girl World Tour, Madonna in Concerto, broadcast in Europe in 1987, filmed at the Stadio Comunale in Turin, Italy. The video release also contained footage from shows recorded in Florence, Italy and Tokyo, Japan, the latter having previously been released as a Japanese TV special and home video release, Who's That Girl: Live in Japan. The decision to release <b>Ciao</b> Italia was spurred {{by the fact that}} this previous release became a commercial success in Japan. A re-release of the video took place in 1999, when it was released in DVD format, with a stereo soundtrack containing the songs only.|$|E
5|$|The release debuted at number17 on Billboards Top Music Video chart, on June 4, 1988 {{and reached}} {{a peak of}} eight, the next week. The video started a steady climb on the chart, and on the issue dated August 20, 1988, it reached number three on the chart, being kept from the top spot by Callan Pinckney's Callanetics and Jane Fonda's Start Up With Jane Fonda workout videos. <b>Ciao</b> Italia {{ultimately}} {{reached the top of}} the chart, remaining there for eight weeks. It was the 27th top selling music videocassette for 1988. The video was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 100,000 copies. <b>Ciao</b> Italia debuted and peaked at number three on the Canadian RPM Top 10 Video chart on June 9, 1990. It was present for a total of eight weeks on the chart. It also charted at number three on the Finnish DVD chart in 2009. <b>Ciao</b> Italia was also certified platinum by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers (CAPIF) for shipment of 15,000 copies in DVD units.|$|E

2500|$|During the Mitigation phase, DoD {{critical}} asset owners, DoD installations, and Sector Chief Infrastructure Assurance Officers, or <b>CIAOs,</b> {{work with the}} National Military Command Center (NMCC) and the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO) to develop, train for, and exercise mitigation responses for various scenarios. [...] When there is a warning, emergency, or infrastructure incident, the {{critical asset}} owners, installations, and Sector <b>CIAOs</b> initiate mitigation actions to sustain service to the DoD. They also provide mitigation status information to the NMCC and JTF-CNO. The NMCC monitors for consequences from an event within one Defense Infrastructure sector that are significant enough to affect other sectors. For events that cross two or more sectors, the NMCC advises on the prioritization and coordination of mitigation actions. When event threats or consequences continue to escalate, the NMCC directs mitigation actions by sector to ensure a coordinated response across the DoD. The NMCC and the JTF-CNO keep the National Infrastructure Protection Center, or NIPC, apprised of any significant mitigation activities.|$|R
2500|$|Intelligence Support - The CIP Intelligence Support Special Function Component {{provides}} intelligence {{support to}} DoD in {{protection of the}} Defense portion of the Federal Government Critical Infrastructure. Intelligence Support responsibilities also include supporting the Defense Warning System, Alert and Notification, and interfacing with the national intelligence community. [...] The responsibilities of the Intelligence Support agencies include such activities as provisioning threat assessments; indications and warnings of potential attacks; advice and support to Sector <b>CIAOs</b> {{in the development of}} defense infrastructure sector monitoring and reporting; crisis management support; and counter-intelligence. This special function component is also tasked with the support to the DoD contingent of the NIPC related to intelligence and counter-intelligence.|$|R
50|$|When {{incidents}} compromise a DoD computer network, the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO) {{directs the}} response activities. These activities {{are designed to}} stop the computer network attack, contain and mitigate damage to a DoD information network and then restore minimum required functionality. JTF-CNO also requests and coordinates any support or assistance from other Federal agencies and civilian organizations during incidents affecting a DoD network. When incidents impact any other DoD owned assets, installation commanders and critical asset owners follow traditional channels and procedures to coordinate responses. This includes notifying affected Sector Chief Infrastructure Assurance Officers, or <b>CIAOs,</b> in the initial notice and status reporting. Although third parties {{play a major role}} in the response to Defense Infrastructure events, DoD CIP personnel also have responsibilities to fulfill.|$|R

In May 2014, the club announced a five-year sponsorship deal with <b>Ciao</b> Telecom. In October 2014, the Rapids sued <b>Ciao</b> for missed payments and quietly disassociated from the company. The club later reached an agreement with Transamerica as a shirt sponsor for two seasons starting in 2015. The Rapids then extended their agreement with Transamerica in March 2016 to go through the 2019 season.|$|E

50|$|The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) is {{the primary}} {{national}} warning center for significant infrastructure attacks. Critical asset owners, DoD installations, and Sector <b>CIAOs</b> monitor the infrastructure daily. Indications of an infrastructure incident are reported to the National Military Command Center, or NMCC. If indications are on a computer network, they are also reported to the Joint Task Force Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO). The NMCC and JTF-CNO assess the indications and pass them to the NIPC and appropriate DoD organizations. When the NIPC determines that an infrastructure event is likely to occur, is planned, or is under way, it issues a national warning. For DoD, the NIPC passes its warnings and alerts to the NMCC and JTF-CNO. These warnings and alerts are then passed to the DoD components. The warning may include guidance regarding additional protection measures DoD should take.|$|R

25|$|The Somali {{language}} {{also contains}} a few Italian loanwords that were retained from the colonial period. The most widely used is <b>ciao,</b> meaning goodbye. As {{part of a broader}} governmental effort to ensure and safeguard the primacy of the Somali language, the post-independence period in Somalia saw a push toward replacement of such foreign loanwords with their Somali equivalents or neologisms. To this end, the Supreme Revolutionary Council during its tenure officially prohibited the borrowing and usage of Italian and English terms.|$|E

500|$|<b>Ciao</b> {{reviewer}} cocoklo {{agreed with}} Universal's assessment, stating that [...] "If {{there ever was}} a band, in my opinion, that needed a greatest hits album, it's Powderfinger".

[...] Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, saying [...] "A festive Italian stadium show featuring the Material Girl, who's turned into a first-rate entertainer, strutting and singing in flashy production-number renditions of her recent most Billboard topping songs, is indeed a delight. The video captures the enormity of Madonna as a performer, and her theatrics, oomph and chutzpah." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post said that [...] "Ciao Italia works wonderful because it makes Madonna look like she's at home, with her Italian family all around her. [...] A Turin soccer stadium became the sexual center of the universe last year when Madonna, one of our naughtiest superstars, taped this concert there before 75,000 gyrating Italians. Ebullient and insouciant, Madonna sings her hits-including the darkly beautiful 'Live to Tell'—in cavernous stereo; dances engagingly with 14-year-old Chris Finch, the quintessential Lucky Little Boy; and crowns herself queen of teases, bending over to reveal 'Kiss' printed on her underpants [...] Sheer showmanship is present in her performances as well as the camera work of this video." [...] Jim Farber from Rolling Stone said that [...] "this version of Madonna's Who's That Girl Tour returns the star to the medium where she excels best. On videocassette, however, Madonna makes manipulation seem like an exciting message indeed." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide however, gave a negative review of the album, saying [...] "Possibly the biggest problem with <b>Ciao</b> Italia regarded the sloppy manner in which the program was assembled. I can’t recall if Italia appeared as a TV special that aired live or if it was taped and edited specifically for future broadcast screenings, but it certainly looked like something that was created on the fly. Sloppy camerawork and editing abound, as those two factors don’t flow together terribly well. It felt as though they tried their best to get appropriate material at the time but that they failed to massage it after the fact." ...|$|E
