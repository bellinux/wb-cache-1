40|$|The {{respiratory}} {{chain of}} the inner mitochondrial membrane is a unique assembly of protein complexes that transfers the electrons of reducing equivalents extracted from foodstuff to molecular oxygen to generate a proton-motive force as the primary energy source for cellular ATP-synthesis.

40|$|We {{recently}} reported a two-hybrid trap for detecting protein-protein interactions in intact mammalian cells (MAPPIT). The bait protein was fused to a STAT recruitment-deficient, homodimeric cytokine receptor and the prey protein to functional STAT recruitment sites. In such a configuration, STAT-dependent responses {{can be used}} to monitor a given bait-prey interaction. Using this system, we were able to demonstrate both modification-independent and tyrosine phosphorylation- dependent interactions. Protein modification in this approach is, however, strictly dependent on the receptor-associated JAK tyrosine kinases. We have now extended this concept by using extracellular domains of the heteromeric granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSFR). Herein, the bait was fused to the (beta) c chain and its modifying enzyme to the GM-CSFRalpha <b>chain</b> (or <b>vice</b> versa). We demonstrate several serine phosphorylation-dependent interactions in the TGFbeta/Smad pathway using the catalytic domains of the ALK 4 or ALK 6 serine/threonine kinase receptors. In all cases tested, STAT-dependent signaling was completely abolished when mutant baits were used wherein critical serine residues were replaced by alanines. This approach operates both in transient and stable expression systems and may not be limited to serine phosphorylation but has the potential for studying various different types of protein modification-dependent interactions in intact cells. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{reveals that the}} {{previously}} described effect of ATP-synthetase inhibition concomitant with inhibition of respiratory chain functioning may be observed at different absolute values of Δψ on the mitochondrial membrane. This fact {{points out that the}} membrane potential is not a unique regulator in coupling of ATP-synthetase and respiratory chain activities. We found, using the double-inhibitor titration technique, that ATP-synthetase inhibition induces proportional inhibition of respiratory <b>chain</b> enzymes and <b>vice</b> versa respiratory <b>chain</b> inhibition induces proportional inhibition of ATP-synthetase. This effect is shown to exist only when osmolarity is close to 150 – 300 (mosM) (in the physiological range). The coupling effectivity (ADP/O) of mitochondria under these conditions is maximal. Under conditions of high osmolarity (400 – 600 mosM) the respiratory chain and ATP-synthetase behave as if they were coupled by bulk phase Δ{ovbar|μ|}H+, from the kinetic point of view...|$|R

40|$|Crystallographic {{studies of}} Escherichia coli {{aspartate}} transcarbamoylase (aspartate carbamoyltransferase, EC 2. 1. 3. 2) {{in conjunction with}} chemical modification experiments {{have led to the}} suggestion that the active sites of the enzyme are at the interfaces between adjacent polypeptide chains of the catalytic trimers and involve joint participation of amino acid residues from the adjoining chains. However, the precise locations of the active sites and of the residues involved in catalysis are not known. To test the hypothesis that the active sites are shared between chains, we constructed hybrid trimers in which two chains were modified at one presumed active site residue and the third chain was altered at a different active site residue. One parental trimer was a reduced pyridoxal phosphate derivative in which lysine- 84 was modified and the other was a mutant protein in which tyrosine- 165 was converted to serine by site-directed mutagenesis. Incubating mixtures of these two virtually inactive derivatives under conditions promoting interchain exchange led to a large increase in enzyme activity corresponding approximately to the formation of one active site per trimer. The purified hybrid trimers, containing either two pyridoxylated and one mutant <b>chain</b> or <b>vice</b> versa, had 23 % and 28 %, respectively, the activity of native wild-type catalytic trimers, compared to 5 % and 3 % for the parental trimers. The most likely explanation for this large increase in activity is the formation of one "native" active site in each of the hybrid trimers. The results constitute strong evidence for shared active sites in aspartate transcarbamoylase...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to analyse the {{conformational}} differences which arise due to acetyl substituents in polysaccharides, crystal structure data on free and acetylated disaccharides are compared. Marked differences {{are found in the}} torsional angles around the skeletal bonds as well as the glycosidic bonds in cellobiose compared with acetyl cellobiose. The cause and the significance of such varia-tions are examined in terms of calculated conformational energy maps. Calculations suggest the possibility of extrapolating the results on disaccharides to predict the structural differences in the respective free and acetylated poly-saccharide counterparts. It is concluded that any theoretical investigation on free or acetylated polysaccharide should be conducted only with data derived from the identically related oligomeric crystal structures. When this is done for acetyl xylan and acetyl'mannan, one can readily explain why the former changes from threefold to twofold <b>chain</b> symmetry and <b>vice</b> versa for the latter when one goes from the native polysaccharide to the acetate derivative. Comparison of cellobiose and acetyl cellobiose conformational energy maps shows that in the former intramolecular hydrogen bonds are much more important confor-mational influences than intermolecular ones, while in the latter non-bonded steric effects are the dominant factor...|$|R

Each interaction involves an area of 1062 Å2 and contributions from hydrophobic side chains, hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. The final homodimer has a structure oriented so that each subunit has the 2 interaction sites. Procaspase-8, also a DED-containing protein, has affinity for the FADD DED. It’s for that reason that they are recruited to FADD as monomers via their DEDs. These interaction is defined by α1/α4 of procapase-8 DED-A and FADD DED α2/α3 or α1/α4 of FADD DED and α2/α5 of procapase-8 DED-B. Porcapase-8 DED-B interacts with FADD and DED-A mediates capase-8 <b>chain</b> formation, or <b>vice</b> versa.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study on Nepalese fresh {{vegetable}} supply chains is to identify factors that impact on the environment external to these chains, information flows along them, and relationships between actors within them. It identifies the role that information structure plays in chain coordination, and so contributes to the emerging literature on this, while also providing policy insights for the Nepalese government. A theoretical framework was developed by incorporating principles of coordination theory, transaction cost economics and network theory, to postulate relationships between information structure and coordination in a supply chain. Empirical research on four Nepalese vegetable supply chains was conducted using an embedded multiple case study approach. It was found that the environment external to the chains had little influence on information structure and chain coordination. Instead, factors internal to the chain were shown to be more important. The results showed that the four chains could be collapsed into two models. The first model exhibited a relatively complete information structure and strong vertical and horizontal coordination. The second model had a relatively asymmetric information structure, along with weak horizontal and vertical coordination. Hence, the completeness of information structure was positively associated with the degree of coordination, both horizontal and vertical. It was observed that strong horizontal coordination accompanied by complete information structure at the farmers’ level aligns producers in the production and supply of vegetables according to market requirements, assembles vegetables to attract buyers, and disseminates knowledge and experience to increase the efficiency of all members. Similarly, strong vertical coordination in association with a complete information structure from input suppliers to retailers aligns activities and incentives, leads actors towards achieving the chain goal, and increases efficiency in the delivery of produce. One insight to emerge is that the observed relationship between information structure and chain coordination result from an underlying factor. This factor was identified as the benefits that chain actors receive or expect to receive from the information they share and the transactions they conduct with other actors. Profits, assurance in buying and selling and strong buyer-supplier relationships are such benefits, which then drive both the completeness of information structure and the degree of coordination, leading to an association between complete information structures and strong coordination and conversely, less complete information structures and weak coordination. Another insight to emerge is that the completeness of information structure and the degree of coordination in these chains also depends on the role that cooperatives play in sharing information and performing business activities. In particular, the greater is the role of cooperatives in information sharing and in performing business activities, the stronger is the coordination in the <b>chain,</b> and <b>vice</b> versa...|$|R

Our case study addresses a geographic place of a chemical manufacturing plant inside its supply chain which the 86 % of the domestic raw material suppliers, its unique distribution center and 100 % of the plastic and metallic packaging suppliers are placed over 800 kilometers of distance. Starting from this restriction the research work consists in how redesign and rethink {{the architecture of the}} existing supply chain and optimize the processes inside the chemical plant trying to minimize the cost disadvantages related directly to the physical location of the factory.

And John Maguire, who headed the CIAs Iraq Operations Group at the time in question, supposedly gave Richer permission to state on his behalf: [...] "I never received any instruction from then Chief/NE Rob Richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter. Further, I have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in Iraq."Former CIA director George Tenet - who has had problems with his memory before - said in statement: [...] "There was no such order from the White House to me nor, {{to the best of my}} knowledge, was anyone from CIA ever involved in any such effort."When honest people are confronted with a false accusation, they typically respond without caveats.But Frattos response is a far cry from a categorical denial that anything akin to what Suskind describes took place. Indeed, given recent White House history, it more likely means: [...] "We want this question to go away, so were going to call it ridiculous."And the statement sent out on behalf of the former CIA officials raises more questions than it answers.
