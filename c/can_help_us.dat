The {{child of a}} Zen Buddhist will not become an evangelical Christian or a Zulu warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a Roman Catholic but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air.

25|$|To {{choose an}} example that did not get much {{attention}} in the debate (because it was shared by both sides), the Solow-Swan model assumes a continuously-attained equilibrium with 'full employment' of all resources. Contrary to Keynesian economics, saving determines investment in these models (rather than vice versa). The fact that the critique was also stated entirely using exactly {{the same kind of}} unrealistic assumptions meant that {{it was very difficult to}} do anything but 'criticize' Solow and Swan. That is, Sraffian models were explicitly divorced from empirical reality. And, as is very common in debates, it was much easier to destroy neoclassical theory than to develop a full-scale alternative that <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> understand the world.|$|E

Yousafzai pleaded with Holbrooke to intervene in the situation, saying, [...] "Respected ambassador, if you <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> in our education, so please help us."

'To feel' in this case refers to a kind of awareness one has of oneself independent of the sensations of the outside world... Like perceptual feeling it is a kind of direct awareness and so a kind of knowledge by acquaintance." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are 4 major {{cognitive}} systems {{involved in}} eye movement in reading: Language processing, attention, vision, and oculomotor control. Eye trackers bounce near infra-red light off {{the interior of}} the eyeball, and monitor the reflection on the eye to determine gaze location. With this technique, the exact position of eye fixation on a screen is determinable. Wang (2011) mentioned that a video-based eye-tracker which uses video cameras to record the eye position of human subjects, thereby recording pupil dilation and eye movements, can be used to examine how fixations, saccades, and pupil dilation responses are related to the information on the screen and behavioral choices during an experiment. According to Wang (2011:185), [...] "understanding the relationship between these observables <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> to understand how human behavior in the economy can be affected by what information people acquire, where their attention is focused, what emotional state they are in, and even what brain activity they are engaged in. This is because fixations and saccades (matched with information shown on screen) indicate how people acquire information (and what they see), time lengths of fixations indicate attention, and pupil dilation responses indicate emotion, arousal, stress, pain, or cognitive load." ...|$|E
2500|$|Patients in coma, vegetative, or {{minimally}} conscious state pose ethical challenges. The {{patients are}} unable to respond, therefore the assessment of their needs can only be approached by adopting a third person perspective. They {{are unable to}} communicate their pain levels, quality of life, or end of life preferences. Neuroscience and brain imaging have allowed us to explore the brain activity of these patients more thoroughly. Recent findings from studies using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} have changed the way we view vegetative patients. The images have shown that aspects emotional processing, language comprehension and even conscious awareness might be retained in patients whose behavior suggests a vegetative state. If this is the case, it is unethical to allow a third party to dictate the life and future of the patient. [...] For example, defining death is an issue that comes with patients with severe traumatic brain injuries. The decision to withdraw life-sustaining care from these patients can be based on uncertain assessments about the individual's conscious awareness. Case reports have shown that these patients in a persistent vegetative state can recover unexpectedly. This raises the ethical question about the premature termination of care by physicians. The hope is that one day, neuroimaging technologies <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> to define these different states of consciousness and enable us to communicate with patients in vegetative states {{in a way that was}} never before possible. The clinical translation of these advanced technologies is of vital importance for the medical management of these challenging patients. In this situation, neuroscience has both revealed ethical issues and possible solutions.|$|E
2500|$|Consequently, his motifs and {{thematic}} {{concepts are}} developed {{in view of}} a real-reader situation that includes—but also searches beyond—academic special interest groups. His verse aims at reaching a wide public and achieves just this. He begins with a prying curiosity. [...] "We all should support independent and committed publishers. Only curious readers looking forward to these books <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> survive, for poetry mainly thrives on the commitment of enthusiastic publishers." [...] Leitner does not write {{with his back to}} the audience, but skillfully involves [...] "poetry into daily communicative processes." [...] Many poets, some of whom have entirely resigned from the necessity of finding an audience, oppose the intentional structure inherent in the compositional principle advocated by Leitner. The debate on a pluralistic public/governmental support of poetry, initiated by [...] in 2011, showed that clearly. While some poets and publishers became angry over Kutsch's criticism of badly planned public endowments of poetry, Leitner defended Kutsch saying that [...] "some comments (by contemporary poets) sound as though they have been written by moody children whose allowances have been threatened to be cut by their fatherland." [...] Leitner highlighted in this debate that poetry, which is supposed to be publicly funded, ought to be accessible to the public as well; otherwise, it should be privately financed. Thus the debate was not generally about governmental subsidies for the arts, in particular for literature. Instead, in Leitner's eyes, it was a debate on the conditions of and for aesthetic production. If a poet is to be funded by the state out of tax-payer resources, then such poets should accept the fact that it is [...] "not poetry that is providing for their material needs, but rather subsidies and prize money, which are often provided from tax-payer money." ...|$|E
