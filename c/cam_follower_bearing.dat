40|$|Roller Cam Positioners {{could support}} the LCLS {{undulator}} sections allowing mi-cron sized alignment adjustment of each undulator in 5 degrees of freedom. The supports are kinematic {{with the number}} of degrees of freedom matched to the number of constraints. Ton loads are supported on simple ball bearings. Mo-tion is intrinsically bounded. Positioning mechanisms are based on pure rolling motion with sub-micron hysteresis and micron resolution. This note describes a general purpose positioning mechanism suitable for undulator support. 1 Mechanical Design A single module design can be used at all 5 roller cam supports. It consists of an aluminum block housing a 0. 75 mm lift camshaft with roller <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> <b>bearing</b> supported on 2 deep groove ball bearings.

To analyse the tribological conditions of the contact surfaces, the generalized Reynolds equation was developed by Dowson [2]. Although several methods have been already developed for solving EHD problems, {{the solution of the}} highly nonlinear problem is still quite challenging.

50|$|The {{standard}} {{driving system}} for a stud type <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> is a slot, for use with a flat head screwdriver. However, hex sockets are available for higher torquing ability, which is especially useful for eccentric <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> and those used in blind holes. Hex socket <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> from most manufacturers eliminate the relubrication capability on that end of the <b>cam</b> <b>follower.</b> RBC Bearings' Hexlube <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> feature a relubrication fitting {{at the bottom of}} the hex socket.|$|R
50|$|A <b>cam</b> <b>follower,</b> {{also known}} as a track follower, is a {{specialized}} type of roller or needle bearing designed to follow cam lobe profiles. <b>Cam</b> <b>followers</b> come in a vast array of different configurations, however the most defining characteristic is how the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mounts to its mating part; stud style <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> use a stud while the yoke style has a hole through the middle.|$|R

50|$|A <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> {{is formed}} by the direct contact of two {{specially}} shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> determines {{the movement of the}} mechanism. In general a <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mechanism's energy is transferred from <b>cam</b> to <b>follower.</b> The <b>cam</b> shaft is rotated and, according to the <b>cam</b> profile, the <b>follower</b> moves up and down. Now slightly different types of eccentric <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> are also available in which energy is transferred from the <b>follower</b> to the <b>cam.</b> The main benefit of this type of <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mechanism is that the follower moves a little bit and helps to rotate the cam 6 times more circumference length with 70% force.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this {{dissertation}} research, failure modes of similar laser and dissimilar ultrasonic welds in lap-shear specimens under quasi-static loading conditions were investigated. High strength low alloy (HSLA) steel sheets were used to make laser welded lap-shear specimens. Magnesium and HSLA steel sheets were used to make ultrasonic welded lap-shear specimens. Quasi-static tests were conducted on dog-bone shaped lap-shear specimens for both welds. In order to understand the failure mode of the welds, finite element analyses were conducted to identify the effects of the material properties and the weld geometry. The results of the finite element analyses for the laser weld based on multi-zone non-homogeneous material models show that the higher effective stress-plastic strain curves of the weld and heat affected zones and the geometry of the weld protrusion result in the necking/shear failure mode in the load carrying sheet. The results of the finite element analyses for the dissimilar ultrasonic weld based on multi-zone indentation models show that the weld indentation triggers different plastic flow patterns in the load carrying sheet. In the second part of this dissertation research, closed-form analytical solutions to calculate the load distributions by the rolling elements on the raceway for zero-interference and interference conditions in roller bearings were investigated. A special case involving <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> roller <b>bearings</b> was also investigated. The contact solutions by Hertz and Persson provided the analytical background for the proposed solutions. These solutions along with an assumption that the multiple contacts of rolling elements are similar to the contact of a lumped body corresponding to the rolling elements were used to derive the proposed solutions. The proposed closed-form solutions require minimal input parameters and therefore are expected to be widely used in the bearing industry. Finite element analyses were conducted to validate the proposed solutions for selected geometries and loads. Based on the proposed solutions, a complete yet simple procedure to estimate the fatigue lives of roller bearings were introduced for use in the bearing design and selection processes...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} utilizes the repetitive control {{approach in}} morphing a high-speed cam mechanism {{so that its}} output displacement tracks the desired output trajectory. The main objective {{is to reduce the}} output tracking error, which is the difference between the actual and desired output displacements of the output mass. A 3 -degree of freedom mathematical model is used to analyze and represent the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> system. The output tracking error in <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> systems is generally caused by errors in cam profile manufacturing, variation in the speed of the driving motor and the dynamics of the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> system. Theoretical and experimental results show that the output tracking error is greatly reduced after repetitive control has been applied to the system. As a result, the actual output displacement tracks the desired output displacement very closely...|$|R

50|$|While roller <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> {{are similar}} to roller {{bearings}}, {{there are quite a}} few differences. Standard ball and roller bearings are designed to be pressed into a rigid housing, which provides circumferential support. This keeps the outer race from deforming, so the race cross-section is relatively thin. In the case of <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> the outer race is loaded at a single point, so the outer race needs a thicker cross-section to reduce deformation. However, in order to facilitate this the roller diameter must be decreased, which also decreases the dynamic bearing capacity.|$|R

They are also used in turntable type applications to reduce skidding. Crowned followers can compensate for up to 0.5° of misalignment, while a cylindrical OD can only tolerate 0.06°. The only disadvantage is that they cannot bear as much load because of higher stresses.|$|R

40|$|The CIF {{will treat}} {{hazardous}} and mixed low-level radioactive waste in a rotary kiln and secondary combustion chamber. A high efficiency {{air pollution control}} system follows the secondary chamber. The rotary kiln is designed with a gas seal {{at each end of}} its rotating barrel which provides a barrier between the interior of the kiln and outside air. The internal pressure of the rotary kiln will be maintained below atmospheric pressure, so exterior air passing the seals is forced into the kiln`s interior. Positive pressure may be applied in the seal labyrinth, adding a barrier to flow. Both CIF seals will be covered entirely with exhaust hoods, drawing air over the outside of the seal and into a HEPA filtered exhaust system. <b>Cam</b> <b>follower</b> misalignment on a John Zink rotary kiln seal caused damage to the seal`s rotor. The misalignment was quantified, corrected, and checked to verify straightness. The primary purpose of the correction was to allow seal testing 1 to continue, but the information is applicable to the Consolidated Incineration Facility (CIF) since two large seals of similar design will be installed there. <b>Cam</b> <b>follower</b> straightness was off as much as 3. 5 {degrees}, causing followers to run untrue on the rotor. High contact forces resulted, removing flakes of metal from the rotor surface. The misalignment caused weight <b>bearing</b> <b>followers</b> {{on one side of the}} seal to back out of their threaded mounts. The root cause was poor machining of the follower mounting holes. Correction was accomplished by relieving the holes and installing machined spacers and retaining nuts. <b>Cam</b> <b>followers</b> on the CIF`s Zink seals should be inspected for straightness before the seals are installed...|$|R
