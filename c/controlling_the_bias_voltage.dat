This type of control can only be achieved through highly nonlinear interactions and additional interfering pathway(s), which is therefore seldom reported. Here, we devise a scheme in which slow light, and a tunable switch from slow light to fast light can be achieved in the probe transmission based on a hybrid setup, which is composed of an optical cavity with two charged nano mechanical resonators (MRs). The two MRs are electrostatically coupled via tunable Coulomb coupling strength (g_c) making a quantum opto-electromechanical system (QOEMS). The parameter g_c that couples the two MRs can be switched on and off by <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages</b> on <b>the</b> MRs, and acts as a tunable switch that allows the propagation of transmitted probe field as slow light (g_c≠ 0) or fast light (g_c = 0).
