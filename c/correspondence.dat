5|$|Today {{physicists}} {{continue to}} look for applications of the AdS/CFT <b>correspondence</b> in quantum field theory. In addition to the applications to nuclear physics advocated by Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators, condensed matter physicists such as Subir Sachdev have used string theory methods to understand some aspects of condensed matter physics. A notable result in this direction was the description, via the AdS/CFT <b>correspondence,</b> of the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. Another emerging subject is the fluid/gravity <b>correspondence,</b> which uses the AdS/CFT <b>correspondence</b> to translate problems in fluid dynamics into problems in general relativity.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigated children 2 ̆ 7 s use of orthographic rime <b>correspondences</b> in nonword {{reading in}} association with word-level reading skills. Experiment 1 demonstrated {{an increase in the}} use of orthographic rime <b>correspondences</b> in two independent nonword reading tasks from second to fourth grade. There was no further increase from fourth to sixth grade. In an ambiguous nonword reading task, where graphemephoneme and orthographic rime <b>correspondences</b> yielded conflicting pronunciations, the use of orthographic rime <b>correspondences</b> varied with the orthographic onset employed. The use of orthographic rime <b>correspondences</b> in reading ambiguous non-words was more strongly associated with word-level reading skills than was the use of grapheme-phoneme <b>correspondences.</b> Experiment 2 replicated the main findings of Experiment 1 concerning the association between word-level reading skills and the use of orthographic rime <b>correspondences</b> in nonword reading within second-grade children. These findings suggest that the use of orthographic rime <b>correspondences</b> in the phonological recoding process increases with word-level reading proficiency...|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in 3 D reconstruction is the computation {{of the fundamental}} matrix. Automatic computation from uncalibrated image pairs is performed from point <b>correspondences.</b> Due to imprecision and wrong <b>correspondences,</b> only an approximation of the true fundamental matrix can be computed. The quality of the fundamental matrix strongly depends on the location and number of point <b>correspondences.</b> Furthermore, the fundamental matrix is the only geometric constraint between two uncalibrated views, and hence {{it can be used}} for the detection of wrong point <b>correspondences.</b> This property is used by current algorithms like RANSAC, which computes the fundamental matrix from a restricted set of point <b>correspondences.</b> In most cases, not only wrong <b>correspondences</b> are disregarded, but also correct ones, which is due to the criterion used to eliminate outliers. In this context, a new criterion preserving a maximum of correct <b>correspondences</b> would be useful. In this paper we introduce a novel criterion for outlier elimination based on a probabilistic approach. The enhanced set of <b>correspondences</b> may be important for further computation towards a 3 D reconstruction of the scene. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one <b>correspondence</b> with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one <b>correspondence</b> between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one <b>correspondence</b> between this class and the class of all sets. This <b>correspondence</b> well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E

40|$|International audienceColor {{difference}} between {{views of a}} stereo pair is a challenging problem. Applications such as compression of stereo image demands the compensation of color differences which is typically done by methods called color mapping. Color mapping is based on feature <b>correspondences.</b> From these feature <b>correspondences,</b> color <b>correspondences</b> are generated which is ultimately used for the color mapping model. This paper focuses on detection of outliers in the feature <b>correspondences.</b> We propose novel iterative outlier removal method which exploits the neighborhood color information of the feature <b>correspondences.</b> From the analysis of our experimental results and comparing with existing methods we conclude by arguing that spatial color neighborhood information around the feature <b>correspondences</b> along with an iterative color mapping can detect outliers in general and can bring a robust color correctio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Schema {{matching}} is {{the process}} of establishing <b>correspondences</b> between the attributes of database schemas for data integration purposes. Although several automatic schema matching tools have been developed, their results are often incom-plete or erroneous. To obtain a correct set of <b>correspondences,</b> a human expert is usually required to validate the generated <b>correspondences.</b> We analyze this reconciliation process in a setting where a number of schemas needs to be matched, in the presence of consistency expectations about the network of attribute <b>correspondences.</b> We develop a probabilistic model that helps to identify the most uncertain <b>correspondences,</b> thus allowing us to guide the expert’s work and collect his input about the most problematic cases. As the availability of such experts is often limited, we develop techniques that can construct a set of good quality <b>correspondences</b> with a high probability, even if the expert does not validate all the necessary <b>correspondences.</b> We demonstrate the efficiency of our techniques through extensive experimentation using real-world datasets.
