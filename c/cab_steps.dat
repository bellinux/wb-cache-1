5000|$|... 387: The 387 (1975-1987) looked {{similar to}} a 353 but had a heavier frame, longer hood, full flat fenders and under <b>cab</b> <b>steps,</b> larger bumper and overall heavier specs. Originally {{designed}} as a coal hauler, the first 387 {{was built in the}} Madison, Tennessee plant in 1976 and {{can be seen in the}} 1977 Working Class brochure as a coal truck.

50|$|All of the DS class {{locomotives}} and variants were {{powered by}} a Gardner 8L3 diesel engine producing 204h.p at 1200r.p.m, coupled to a Wilson five-speed epicyclic gearbox with fluid transmission in turn connected to a final reduction and reverse unit. Power was transmitted to the wheels via a jackshaft, to which the wheels were connected by coupling rods. This jackshaft was located under the cab, and later Drewry DSB class locomotives, Drewry type 'B-2' had a cover-plate over this to prevent staff from being caught by the jackshaft while riding on the <b>cab</b> <b>steps.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{delivered}} in 1894, the locomotive, works number 611, {{was typical of}} a type used on unfenced lines, particularly {{in an area where}} livestock is reared and the horse and cart or even the packhorse the main mode of local goods transportation.The locomotive, built with a round-topped firebox and dome was also fitted with a bell, mounted on the boiler between the chimney and the dome. To aid its progress around the tight track work on the line it had a rigid wheelbase of just 9 ft band the centre driving wheel was without flange. As part of the line ran alongside the road cowcatchers front and rear and side-skirts, to prevent the scaring of animals by the motion of the coupling rods and the seeping of steam from the cylinders, were also fitted. The locomotive was basically an 0-6-0 but the axle load was lightened by the addition of a leading truck and to accommodate this the frames and footplate were extended forward by a couple of feet or so. It was, to the eye, a Tram-type locomotive. In due time the side-skirting was removed, only the deep, almost enclosed <b>cab</b> <b>steps</b> and the fixing points giving a clue as to it ever being there.|$|E
6000|$|But when Irene {{reached the}} cab {{she did not}} get in; she slipped, instead, to the horse's head. Dartie {{was not at the}} moment {{sufficiently}} master of his legs to follow. She stood stroking the horse's nose, and, to his annoyance, Bosinney was at her side first. She turned and spoke to him rapidly, in a low voice; the words 'That man' reached Dartie. He stood stubbornly by the <b>cab</b> <b>step,</b> waiting for her to come back. He knew a trick worth two of that! ...|$|R

5000|$|MK48A1: offers slight {{improvements}} to the original MK48. Those improvements include a revised battery box and cover, an extra <b>cab</b> entry <b>step</b> for both sides, modified air intake cover, and added handles and steps to ease climbing {{on top of the}} power unit.|$|R
2500|$|The GG1 was [...] {{long and}} weighed [...] The {{frame of the}} {{locomotive}} was in two halves joined with a ball and socket joint, allowing the locomotive to negotiate sharper curves. The body rested on the frame and was clad in welded steel plates. The control cabs were {{near the center of}} the locomotive on each side of the main oil-cooled transformer and oil-fired train-heating boiler. This arrangement, first used on the Modified P5 class, provided for greater crew safety in a collision and for bi-directional operation of the locomotive. A pantograph on each end of the locomotive body was used to collect the 25Hz, 11,000V alternating current (AC) from the overhead lines. [...] In operation the leading pantograph was usually kept lowered and the trailing raised to collect current, since if the rear pantograph failed it would not strike the forward pantograph. Transformers between the two <b>cabs</b> <b>stepped</b> down the 11,000V to the voltages needed for the traction motors and other equipment.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2012 {{the courts}} cleared the final {{barriers}} allowing the CAB {{to sell off}} the equestrian centre and Gilligan's house at Weston Green, Lucan. [...] In July 2014, after a lengthy challenge, a Supreme Court ruling brought the <b>CAB</b> one <b>step</b> closer to selling off the house adjoining the equestrian centre, retained by Gilligan's wife, as well as additional properties in Blanchardstown and Lucan.|$|R
50|$|Ruth Polsky (December 5, 1954 - September 7, 1986) was a booker {{and music}} {{promoter}} in New York City. She died after being crushed by a runaway <b>cab</b> on the <b>steps</b> of the Limelight club in New York.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} types of nerf bars are: <b>cab</b> length <b>step</b> bars, wheel-to-wheel nerf bars, oval tube steps, sport tubes and single steps. The {{installation}} {{is common for}} all nerf bars and includes universal or model specific brackets. Brackets are attached either to rocker panels or bolt on directly to the frame of a vehicle. Some model specific brackets for nerf bars do not require drilling and use existing mounting holes {{in the frame of}} a vehicle.|$|R
50|$|On January 4, 1949, Oscar Polk was fatally {{struck by}} a taxi <b>cab</b> as he <b>stepped</b> off a curb in Times Square ten days after his 49th birthday. At {{the time of his}} death he was {{scheduled}} to have a major role in the play Leading Lady, and he was replaced by Ossie Davis. He is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery, Maspeth, Long Island, New York.|$|R
60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} we reached St. Pancras, {{travelling}} by fast train from Torchester, and {{half an hour}} later a hansom put us down at the Hotel Metropole. Immediately in front of the entrance Count de Cartienne's small brougham was waiting, and as we descended from the <b>cab</b> his servant <b>stepped</b> forward and handed me a note. I tore it open and read it under the gas-lamp.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{the first}} {{so-called}} [...] "second generation" [...] EMD diesel locomotive, and was produced in response to increased competition by a new entrant, General Electric's U25B, which was released roughly {{at the same time}} as the GP30. The GP30 is easily recognizable due to its high profile and <b>stepped</b> <b>cab</b> roof, unique among American locomotives. A number are still in service today in original or rebuilt form.|$|R
60|$|It {{was twenty}} minutes past seven, when, in evening dress, {{he left the}} club, and took a shilling's-worth to Buckingham Gate. Here he {{dismissed}} his cab, and turned up the large fur collar of his coat. Between {{the brim of his}} opera-hat and the edge of that collar nothing but his eyes were visible. He waited, compressing his lips, scrutinising each hansom that went by. In the soft glow of one coming fast he saw a hand raised to the trap. The <b>cab</b> stopped; George <b>stepped</b> out of the shadow and got in. The cab went on, and Mrs. Bellew's arm was pressed against his own.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] he said. [...] "Bully! I {{knew you}} could get a move on as quick as anyone else, if you gave your minds to it. This is what I call {{something}} like a revolution. It's a model to every country in the world. But I guess we must close down the entertainment now, or I shall be missing the boat. Will you tell them, Crump, that any citizen who cares for a drink and a cigar will find it in the Palace. Tell the household staff to stand by to pull corks. It's dry work revolutionizing. And now I really must be going. I've run it mighty fine. Slip one of these fellows down there half a dollar and send him to fetch a <b>cab.</b> I must <b>step</b> lively." ...|$|R
5000|$|Route 160 east of Lynch, Kentucky {{and west}} of Appalachia, Virginia crosses the mountain. The summit is reached by a narrow road that turns {{off to the right}} (coming from Lynch, KY or to the left, if coming from Appalachia, VA) at the Kentucky-Virginia line (the gap that is the highest part of Route 160) and leads past an FAA radar dome. There is a one lane dirt road to the left not far past the radar dome that leads to the summit. The summit is marked with an {{abandoned}} metal fire lookout tower (the <b>cab</b> and wooden <b>steps</b> are missing from the tower). There are also multiple radio towers along with transmitter buildings around the summit and a National Geodetic Survey benchmark is located on a large rock over the hill {{to the left of the}} fire tower. This benchmark is 6 feet below the highest point; [...] a second is directly under the old lookout tower, marking the latest survey of the highest natural point.|$|R
50|$|The first {{significant}} {{conductor of the}} Mendelssohn Glee Club, Joseph Mosenthal, helped to popularize the group through his dramatic leadership and musical vision. Mosenthal, who served for 30 years and composed several ambitious works for the Club, exhausted himself getting to rehearsal during a snowstorm in January 1896 and died on a sofa in Mendelssohn Hall, directly beneath his portrait by John White Alexander. He was succeeded by the young Edward MacDowell, who had just returned to New York to found the School of Music at Columbia University. When MacDowell's career came to a tragic end in 1904 after being nearly killed by a hansom <b>cab,</b> the Club <b>stepped</b> in with benefit concerts and private donations {{that led to the}} founding of the MacDowell Colony for the Arts in Peterborough, New Hampshire, where the composer eventually succumbed. His place was taken by Walter Damrosch, of the famous New York musical family. During World War II the Club was led by Cesare Sodero, who was also the vocal director for Verdi operas at the Met. Sodero was followed by Emerson Buckley, who left to found the Fort Lauderdale Symphony and lster to introduce Luciano Pavarotti to America. The noted basso John Royer Bogue led the Club through its centennial years. In 1966, the first concert of its 100th season was marked by the only time the great Blum murals have been displayed since Mendelssohn Hall was torn down. The baton was passed to the present director, Eugene Wisoff, in 1993.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{definitions}} on {{intra-abdominal pressure}} (IAP), intra-abdominal volume (IAV) and abdominal compliance (<b>Cab)</b> are a <b>step</b> forward in understanding these important concepts. They help {{our understanding of}} the pathophysiology, aetiology, prognosis, and treatment of patients with low Cab. However, there is still a relatively poor understanding of the different methods used to measure IAP, IAV and Cab and how certain conditions may affect the results. This review will give a concise overview of the different methods to assess and estimate Cab; it will list important conditions that may affect baseline values and suggest some therapeutic options. Abdominal compliance (Cab), defined as a measure of the ease of abdominal expansion, is measured differently than IAP. The compliance of the abdominal wall is only a part of the total abdominal pressure-volume (PV) relationship. Measurement or estimation of Cab is difficult at the bedside and can only be done in a case of change (removal or addition) in IAV. The different measurement techniques will be discussed in relation to decreases (ascites drainage, haematoma evacuation, gastric suctioning) or increases in IAV (gastric insufflation, laparoscopy with CO₂ pneumoperitoneum, peritoneal dialysis). More specific techniques using the interactions between the thoracic and abdominal compartment during positive pressure ventilation will also be discussed (low flow PV loop, respiratory IAP variations, respiratory abdominal variation test, mean IAP and abdominal pressure variation), together with the concept of the polycompartment model. The relation between IAV and IAP is linear at low IAV and becomes curvilinear and exponential at higher volumes. Specific conditions in relation to increased (previous pregnancy or laparoscopy, gynoid fat distribution, ellipse-shaped internal abdominal perimeter) or decreased Cab (obesity, fluid overload, android fat distribution, sphere-shaped internal abdominal perimeter) will be discussed as well as their impact on baseline IAV, IAP, reshaping capacity and abdominal workspace volume. Finally, we suggest possible treatment options in situations of unadapted IAV according to existing Cab, which results in high IAP. A large overlap exists between the treatment of patients with abdominal hypertension and those with low Cab. The Cab {{plays a key role in}} understanding the deleterious effects of unadapted IAV on IAP and end-organ perfusion and function. If we can identify patients with low Cab, we can anticipate and select the most appropriate surgical treatment to avoid complications such as IAH or AC...|$|R
