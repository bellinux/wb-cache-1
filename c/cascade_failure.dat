25|$|There {{have been}} several notable power outages in Auckland. The five-week-long 1998 Auckland power crisis blacked out much of the CBD after a <b>cascade</b> <b>failure</b> {{occurred}} on four underground cables in Mercury Energy's sub-transmission network. The 2006 Auckland Blackout interrupted supply to the CBD and many inner suburbs after an earth wire shackle at Transpower's Otahuhu substation broke and short-circuited the lines supplying the inner city. In 2009, much of the northern and western suburbs, {{as well as all}} of Northland, experienced a blackout when a forklift accidentally came into contact with the Otahuhu to Henderson 220kV line, the only major line supplying the region. Transpower spent $1.25billion in the early 2010s reinforcing the supply into and across Auckland, including a 400kV-capable transmission line from the Waikato River to Brownhill substation (operated at 220kV initially), and 220kV underground cables between Brownhill and Pakuranga, and between Pakuranga and Albany via the CBD. These reduced the Auckland Region's reliance on Otahuhu substation and northern and western Auckland's reliance on the Otahuhu to Henderson line.|$|E

Furthermore, not only the mean node degree but also the largest eigenvalues of the network are found to relate to the size of <b>cascading</b> <b>failures</b> in the network.

40|$|Abstract—When {{the modern}} {{electrical}} infrastructure is under-going a {{migration to the}} Smart Grid, vulnerability and security concerns have also been raised regarding the <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> threats in this interconnected transmission system with complex communication and control challenge. The DC power flow-based model has been a popular model to study the <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> problem due to its efficiency, simplicity and scalability in simula-tions of such failures. However, due to the complex nature of the power system and <b>cascading</b> <b>failures,</b> the underlying assumptions in DC power flow-based <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> simulators (CFS) may fail to hold during the development of <b>cascading</b> <b>failures.</b> This paper compares the validity of a typical DC power flow-based CFS in <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> analysis with a new numerical metric defined as the critical moment (CM). The adopted CFS is first implemented to simulate system behavior after initial contingen-cies and to evaluate the utility of DC-CFS in <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> analysis. Then the DC-CFS is compared against another classic, more precise power system stability methodology, i. e., the tran-sient stability analysis (TSA). The CM is introduced with a case study to assess the utilization of these two models for <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> analysis. Comparative simulations on the IEEE 39 -bus and 68 -bus benchmark reveal important consistency and discrepancy between these two approaches. Some suggestions are provided for using these two models in the power grid <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> analysis.

50|$|A common {{occurrence}} during a <b>cascade</b> <b>failure</b> is a walking failure, where sections go down, causing {{the next section}} to fail, after which the first section comes back up. This ripple can make several passes through the same sections or connecting nodes before stability is restored.|$|E
50|$|So then, {{the pile}} of sand {{can be viewed as}} a network of {{interconnected}} systems, each with its own criticality. The relationships between these groups impose a structure on this network which has a profound effect on the probability and scope of a <b>cascade</b> <b>failure</b> in response to some other event. In other words - structured criticality.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{related systems}} are {{affected}} in this case. As an example, DNS resolution might fail {{and what would}} normally cause systems to be interconnected, might break connections that are not even {{directly involved in the}} actual systems that went down. This, in turn, may cause seemingly unrelated nodes to develop problems, that can cause another <b>cascade</b> <b>failure</b> all on its own.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cascading {{failures}} {{triggered by}} trivial initial events are encountered in many complex systems. It is actually not any specific reason but {{the interaction between}} components {{of the system that}} causes <b>cascading</b> <b>failures.</b> Based on this idea interactions between components are quantified and the interaction matrix and interaction network are obtained. By using the quantified interactions, key links and key components that play important roles in the propagation of <b>cascading</b> <b>failures</b> are identified. An interaction model is also proposed to simulate <b>cascading</b> <b>failures</b> by using the interactions and to study the influence of these interactions on the <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> risk. Interaction-based mitigation measures are suggested to mitigate the <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> risk by eliminating a small number of key links, which can be achieved in real systems by wide area protection such as blocking of some specific protective relays. The proposed interaction quantifying method, <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> model, and mitigation measures are validated with line outage data generated by the AC OPA cascading simulations on the IEEE 118 -bus system.

50|$|The {{avalanches}} {{are caused}} when {{the impact of}} a new grain of sand is sufficient to dislodge some group of sand grains.

50|$|If enough routes go {{down because}} of a <b>cascade</b> <b>failure,</b> a {{complete}} section of the network or internet can become unreachable. Although undesired, this can help speed up the recovery from this failure as connections will time out, and other nodes will give up trying to establish connections to the section(s) that have become cut off, decreasing load on the involved nodes.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} a <b>cascade</b> <b>failure</b> is usually the {{overloading}} of a single, crucial router or node, which causes the node to go down, even briefly. It can also be caused by taking a node down for maintenance or upgrades. In either case, traffic is routed to or through another (alternative) path. This alternative path, as a result, becomes overloaded, causing it to go down, and so on. It will also affect systems which depend on the node for regular operation.|$|E

The results indicate that major <b>cascading</b> <b>failures</b> follow from the failure of nodes with highest loads and {{that the existence of}} operational reserves might not be enough to prevent blackouts when failures occur in key points of the network...|$|R
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of a <b>cascade</b> <b>failure</b> include: packet loss and high network latency, not just to single systems, but to whole sections of a network or the internet. The high latency and packet loss {{is caused by the}} nodes that fail to operate due to congestion collapse, which causes them to still be present in the network but without much or any useful communication going through them. As a result, routes can still be considered valid, without them actually providing communication.|$|E

Each of these sub-systems are more or less likely to suffer a <b>cascade</b> <b>failure.</b> Those that are likely to fail and reorganize can be said to be in a critical state.|$|E

40|$|Catastrophic {{disruptions}} of large, interconnected infrastructure {{systems are}} often due to <b>cascading</b> <b>failure.</b> For example, large blackouts of electric power systems are typically caused by <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> of heavily loaded system components. We introduce the CASCADE model of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> {{of a system}} with many identical components randomly loaded. An initial disturbance causes some components to fail by exceeding their loading limit. Failure of a component causes a fixed load increase for other components. As components fail, the system becomes more loaded and <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> of further components becomes likely. The probability distribution {{of the number of}} failed components is an extended quasibinomial distribution. Explicit formulas for the extended quasibinomial distribution are derived using a recursion. The CASCADE model in a restricted parameter range gives a new model yielding the quasibinomial distribution. Some qualitative behaviors of the extended quasibinomial distribution are illustrated, including regimes with power tails, exponential tails, and significant probabilities of total system <b>failure.</b> 1. <b>CASCADE</b> model <b>Cascading</b> <b>failure</b> is a standard cause of catastrophic failure in large, interconnected infrastructure systems.

50|$|The DSB-independent pathway was {{proposed}} when people studied spo11 mutant cells in some species {{and found that}} these Spo11 cells could not process to metaphase I {{even in the absence}} of DSB. The direct purpose of these DSBs is to help with the condensation of chromosomes. Even though the initial homolog paring in early leptotene is just random interactions, the further progression into presynaptic alignment depends on the formation of double strand breaks and single strand transfer complexes. Therefore the unsynapsed chromosomes in Spo11 cells can be a target of checkpoint. An AAA-adenosine triphosphatase (AAA-ATPase) was found to be essential in this pathway. but the mechanism is not yet clear. Some other studies also drew sex body formation into attention, and the signaling could be either structure based or transcription regulation such as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Under this <b>cascade,</b> <b>failure</b> to synapse will maintain the gene expression from sex chromosomes and some products may inhibit cell cycle progression. Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation only happens in male, which may partially be the reason why only Spo11 mutant spermatocytes but not oocytes fail to transition from prophase I to metaphase I. However the asynapsis does not happen only within sex chromosomes, and such transcription regulation was suspended until it was further expanded to all the chromosomes as meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin, but the effector gene is not found yet.|$|E

However, networked systems hold a certain danger that a failure of a single node in the system may diffuse to all other nodes. This chain of failure is widely known as <b>cascading</b> <b>failure.</b> Examples of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> include disease epidemics, traffic congestion, electrical power system blackouts, and so on. In these systems, if external shocks or excess loads at some nodes are propagated to other connected nodes due to failure, the domino effects often come with disastrous consequences. Thus, how to prevent <b>cascading</b> <b>failures</b> in complex networks becomes an important emergent issue. In this paper, we consider an overload-based <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> model and design a robust network structure against this type of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure.</b> Numerical simulations show that the proposed network, which consists of a complete cluster of connected hub nodes, and periphery nodes connecting one of hub nodes in the cluster, is least susceptible to <b>cascading</b> <b>failures</b> compared with other types of networks.
