25|$|Pandya {{made his}} One Day International (ODI) debut for India against New Zealand on 16 October 2016 at Dharamshala. Hardik {{was taken in}} the ODI squad as strong middle order batsman, for not just hard hitting but also for {{building}} partenership and taking the team to victory in complicated situations. Hardik concentrated a lot on his batting skills acquiring {{the role of a}} perfect batting all rounder. He became the fourth Indian to be named player of the match on ODI debut after Sandeep Patil, Mohit Sharma and K. L. Rahul. In his first ODI innings as a better, he scored 36 runs from 32 balls. On 18 June 2017, in the final of the Champions Trophy at the Oval, he struck a 43-ball 76 in a losing cause, after <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> India at 54/5 following a top order collapse.

25|$|Kamran Akmal is a quick-scoring batsman and a wicket-keeper, who has {{achieved}} 6 centuries in Test cricket. However, his first century was vital – his 109 {{from the number}} eight position at Mohali, <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> Pakistan in a lead of 39 against India in the first Test, ensured that the visitors could draw the match. His form against the touring England in 2005 {{made him one of}} the most important players in the team. Naturally, he is a batsman that plays lower down the order but has sometimes opened in both Test and One-day cricket. As an opener he has scored two back to back centuries in ODIs against England. Coming in lower down the order in Test matches, he played one memorable innings. He saved Pakistan from a score of 39/6, scoring a century, to a competitive 245 which helped Pakistan win the match and the series.|$|E
25|$|In July and August 2006, Bangladesh toured Zimbabwe for a five-match ODI series. In the 3rd ODI, Mortaza was hit for six off {{the final}} {{ball of the}} match by Brendan Taylor, giving the Zimbabweans victory. With Zimbabwe already winning the series 3–1, Mortaza was dropped for the final match, which Bangladesh went on to win. In the four matches he played in, Mortaza took five wickets {{at an average of}} 29.20. Following their defeat by Zimbabwe, Bangladesh faced Kenya in three ODIs, winning them all. Mortaza was {{instrumental}} in the second victory, <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the score on 120/7 chasing 185 to win. He guided his team home with an 43 not out, farming the strike to protect the Bangladesh tail. Mortaza took career best bowling figures of 6/26 from his 10overs in the final ODI, ensuring Bangladesh were chasing a low target. His figures are also the best in ODIs by any Bangladesh cricketer. In the calendar year of 2006 Mortaza was the world's highest wicket taker in ODIs, collecting 49 wickets. The haul was the most ever in a calendar year by a Bangladeshi, and 17th most for anyone.|$|E

25|$|Gerard Hodgkinson {{was educated}} at Eton College and then joined the family business. In 1904, {{he made the}} first two of 19 {{first-class}} cricket appearances for Somerset as a right-handed middle- or lower-order batsman. He was not successful in his 1904 matches for Somerset, nor when he reappeared in two games in 1906. In 1907, he played six times for the county, the most appearances in a single season, and made 49 in the match against Worcestershire, his highest to that point: this was the match in which Bert Bisgood, making his first-class debut, scored 82 and an unbeaten 116, {{the first time a}} Somerset batsman made 100 on debut. Hodgkinson did not play for Somerset in 1908 or 1909, but returned for four games in 1910 and in his first match of the season, against Gloucestershire he made the highest score of his career. <b>Coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> Somerset at 134 for six wickets, he hit 99 before his partner for a last-wicket stand of 68, Jack White, was out, leaving him a run short of a century. He never reached such heights again in first-class cricket: that was his only score of more than 50, though in the match against the Indians in 1911 he made 44 in the first innings and 41 in the second. He did not appear in first-class cricket after the 1911 season.|$|E

Milne broadly agreed with Robertson that any attempt to attack across the mountains to cut the Nis-Sofia-Constantinople railway was logistically impractical, although he did stress that his forces must either advance or retreat from the malaria-infested Struma Valley and that the Bulgarians might be beaten if pressed hard. On 23 July he was told to “engag(e) the maximum of Bulgar forces” whilst the Romanians mobilised and attacked, followed by secret messages from Robertson that he should “guard against being committed for any serious action” until it was certain that Romania was <b>coming</b> <b>in.</b> <b>With</b> Bulgaria seeming close to collapse in October and November 1916, Milne advised Robertson (5 November) that the Germans would do all they could to keep her in the war.|$|E
