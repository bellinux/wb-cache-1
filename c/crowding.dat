5|$|This high {{concentration}} of macromolecules in cytosol causes an effect called macromolecular <b>crowding,</b> which is when the effective concentration of other macromolecules is increased, since they have less volume to move in. This <b>crowding</b> effect can produce large changes in both the rates and the position of chemical equilibrium of reactions in the cytosol. It is particularly important {{in its ability to}} alter dissociation constants by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to their targets in the genome.|$|E

5|$|Although Emily Huskisson {{had wanted}} to keep the service {{small-scale}} and free from pageantry, William Huskisson had been an instrumental figure in the development of Liverpool and there was a huge amount of sympathy and respect for him. Almost all the city's inhabitants who were in a position to attend the funeral lined the route; it was estimated that 69,000 people, roughly half the city's population, attended. Reports spoke of all available space at every window being packed with onlookers, other than the house in Duke Street in which Huskisson had stayed for the 10 days before the journey, and of people climbing trees and <b>crowding</b> onto roofs for a better view, despite rain and hail.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the trends}} in human-computer {{interaction}} (HCI) {{is that its}} increasing focus on social issues. <b>Crowds</b> are frequent social phenomena in society. Understanding the psychology behind <b>crowd</b> interaction and behavior not only forms a meaningful contribution to HCI, but also {{a significant contribution to}} the field of <b>crowd</b> management. This paper developed a set 13 <b>crowd</b> emotional feelings and investigated their relation with 11 action (behavioral) tendencies in both event and non-event <b>crowd</b> situations. The results are expected to be relevant for designing self-report software to support the interactions between <b>crowd</b> managers and <b>crowd</b> members.

50|$|Psychological aspects are {{concerned}} with the psychology of the <b>crowd</b> as a group and the psychology of those who allow their will and emotions to be informed by the <b>crowd</b> (both discussed more comprehensively under <b>crowd</b> psychology), and other individual responses to <b>crowds,</b> such as claustrophobia, agoraphobia and social anxiety. At a general level, <b>crowd</b> psychology is concerned with the behaviour and thought processes of individual <b>crowd</b> members and the <b>crowd</b> as a whole. Given the prevalence of <b>crowd</b> events, and the potential safety issues associated with such large gatherings of people, the topic is receiving increasing attention from agencies responsible for <b>crowd</b> management and also from governments.|$|R

She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E

The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which at the time was the operator of all the routes serving the 42nd Street station, originally sued to block construction of the new entrance because it would cause <b>crowding,</b> but the New York City Board of Transportation pushed to allow the corridor anyway. Chrysler eventually built and paid for the building's subway entrance. Work on the new entrance started in March 1930 and it opened along with the Chrysler Building two months later.|$|E
5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric <b>crowding</b> by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E
30|$|<b>Crowd</b> {{model of}} the moving target is a linear fusion {{intelligent}} time domain mapping control model. The model {{is based on the}} cooperation of moving target prediction model and <b>crowd</b> control algorithm. The model includes the dynamic control, the <b>crowd</b> control model and the linear time domain predictive control. The <b>crowd</b> control can predict the status and position of moving objects by using <b>crowd</b> model. The <b>crowd</b> control model can design the mobile constraints and <b>crowd</b> optimization objectives based on the real-time mobile trajectory information. The model can generate the target state matrix and the target <b>crowd</b> information for the relationship mapping. The real-time continuous optimization is realized by <b>crowd</b> control with output information. The <b>crowd</b> algorithm can transform the tracking problem of moving objects to the target of the <b>crowd</b> optimization problem. This conversion is realized by using the <b>crowd</b> information of each moving target in the time domain to reset the optimization objective and the real-time optimal control conditions.|$|R
30|$|As a {{first study}} of hybrid <b>crowd</b> design, this study {{contributes}} to the crowdfunding literature and to crowdfunding practice by opening the issue of <b>crowd</b> designs, recognizing hybrid <b>crowd</b> as a novel <b>crowd</b> design, and offering our insights into managing lead investors in hybrid <b>crowds.</b> Specifically, this study introduces the emerging hybrid <b>crowd</b> design and seeks to stimulate more research on this topic by outlining several testable hypotheses. Unlike previous studies that examine specific design elements in pure <b>crowds</b> (such as project length and community functionality), this study examines a high-level <b>crowd</b> design issue: choosing between pure and hybrid <b>crowds</b> {{in the context of}} crowdfunding. Our comparisons of pure and hybrid <b>crowds</b> can shed light on the evolution of <b>crowd</b> design in crowdfunding. In addition, both crowdfunding researchers and practitioners can benefit from our list of key driving factors behind the <b>crowd</b> design. Our discussion on the management of lead investors points to ways in which agency relationships in hybrid <b>crowds</b> could be further examined and opens a new door for the application of agency theory in crowdfunding.|$|R

5|$|The {{effects of}} global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths <b>crowding</b> the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska.

5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the <b>crowding</b> and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E

In France, some newspapers even reported that Nungesser and Coli had arrived safely in New York, evoking a wave of French patriotism. L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would have given them approximately 42 hours of flight time. After this time had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Crowd</b> {{behavior}} {{recognition is}} becoming an important research topic in video surveillance for public places. In this paper, we first discuss the <b>crowd</b> feature selection and extraction and propose a multiple-frame feature point detection and tracking based on the KLT tracker. We state that behavior modelling of <b>crowd</b> is usually coarse compared to that for individuals. Instead of developing general <b>crowd</b> behavior models, we propose to model <b>crowd</b> events for specific end-user scenarios. As a result, a same type of event may be modelled slightly differently from one scenario to another and several models are to be defined. Consequently, fast modelling is required and this is enabled {{by the use of}} an extended Scenario Recognition Engine (SRE) in our approach. <b>Crowd</b> event models are defined; particularly, composite events accommodating evidence accumulation allow to increase detection reliability. Tests have been conducted on real surveillance video sequences containing <b>crowd</b> scenes. The <b>crowd</b> tracking algorithm proves to be robust and gives reliable <b>crowd</b> motion vectors. The <b>crowd</b> event detection on real sequences gives reliable results of a few common <b>crowd</b> behaviors by simple dedicated models.

40|$|<b>Crowd</b> {{safety is}} a major concern for those {{attending}} and managing mass gatherings such as the annual Hajj or pilgrimage to Makkah. One threat to <b>crowd</b> safety at such events is <b>crowd</b> density. However, recent research also suggests that psychological membership of <b>crowds</b> can have positive benefits. We tested the hypothesis that the effect of density on safety might vary depending on whether there is shared social identification in the <b>crowd.</b> We surveyed 1194 pilgrims at the Holy Mosque, Makkah, during the 2012 Hajj. Analysis of the data showed that the negative effect of <b>crowd</b> density on reported safety was moderated by social identification with the <b>crowd.</b> Whereas low identifiers reported reduced safety with greater <b>crowd</b> density, high identifiers reported increased safety with greater <b>crowd</b> density. Mediation analysis suggested that a reason for these moderation effects was the perception that other <b>crowd</b> members were supportive. Differences in reported safety across national groups (Arab countries and Iran compared to the rest) were also explicable in terms of <b>crowd</b> identification and perceived support. These findings support a social identity account of <b>crowd</b> behaviour and offer a novel perspective on <b>crowd</b> safety management...|$|R
