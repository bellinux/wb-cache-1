50|$|A thermal rocket is {{a rocket}} engine {{that uses a}} {{propellant}} that is externally heated before being passed through a nozzle, as opposed to undergoing a chemical reaction as in a <b>chemical</b> <b>rocket.</b>|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 2010s, many {{satellite}} manufacturers were offering electric propulsion options on their satellites—mostly for on-orbit attitude control—while some commercial communication satellite operators {{were beginning to}} use them for geosynchronous orbit insertion in place of traditional <b>chemical</b> <b>rocket</b> engines.|$|E
50|$|In {{a nuclear}} thermal rocket a working fluid, usually liquid hydrogen, is heated {{to a high}} {{temperature}} in a nuclear reactor, and then expands through a rocket nozzle to create thrust. The nuclear reactor's energy replaces the chemical energy of the reactive chemicals in a <b>chemical</b> <b>rocket</b> engine. Due to the higher energy density of the nuclear fuel compared to chemical fuels, about 107 times, the resulting specific impulse of the engine is {{at least twice as}} good as chemical engines. The overall gross lift-off mass of a nuclear rocket is about half that of a <b>chemical</b> <b>rocket,</b> and hence when used as an upper stage it roughly doubles or triples the payload carried to orbit.|$|E

50|$|Electric {{propulsion}} systems use an external source {{such as a}} nuclear reactor or solar cells to generate electricity, which is then used to accelerate a chemically inert propellant to speeds far higher than achieved in a <b>chemical</b> <b>rocket.</b> Such drives produce feeble thrust, and are therefore unsuitable for quick maneuvers or for launching {{from the surface of}} a planet. But they are so economical in their use ofreaction mass that they can keep firing continuously for days or weeks, while chemical rockets use up reaction mass so quickly that they can only fire for seconds or minutes. Even a trip to the Moon is long enough for an electric propulsion system to outrun a <b>chemical</b> <b>rocket</b> - the Apollo missions took 3 days in each direction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>rocket</b> {{propellants}} {{are most}} commonly used, which undergo exothermic chemical reactions which produce hot gas {{which is used}} by a rocket for propulsive purposes.

50|$|The ion {{thruster}} {{is not the}} most promising type of electrically powered spacecraft propulsion (although the most successful in practice). An ion drive would require two days to accelerate a car to highway speed. The technical characteristics, especially thrust, are considerably inferior to the prototypes described in literature, technical capabilities are limited by the space charge created by ions. This limits the thrust density (force per cross-sectional area of the engine). Ion thrusters create small thrust levels (the thrust of Deep Space 1 is approximately equal to the weight of one sheet of paper) compared to conventional <b>chemical</b> <b>rockets,</b> but achieve high specific impulse, or propellant mass efficiency, by accelerating the exhaust to high speed. The power imparted to the exhaust increases with the square of exhaust velocity while thrust increase is linear. Conversely, <b>chemical</b> <b>rockets</b> provide high thrust, but are limited in total impulse by the small amount of energy that can be stored chemically in the propellants. Given the practical weight of suitable power sources, the acceleration from an {{ion thruster}} is frequently less than one thousandth of standard gravity. However, since they operate as electric (or electrostatic) motors, they convert a greater fraction of input power into kinetic exhaust power. <b>Chemical</b> <b>rockets</b> operate as heat engines, and Carnot's theorem limits the exhaust velocity.|$|R
50|$|When calculating {{specific}} impulse, only propellant that {{is carried}} with the vehicle before use is counted. For a <b>chemical</b> <b>rocket</b> the propellant mass therefore would include both fuel and oxidizer; for air-breathing engines only {{the mass of}} the fuel is counted, not the mass of air passing through the engine.|$|E
50|$|Whereas the {{integration}} of the above energy equation can be done, numerically or otherwise, short burns of <b>chemical</b> <b>rocket</b> engines close to periapsis or elsewhere are usually mathematically modelled as impulsive burns, where the force of the engine dominates any other forces that might change the vehicle's energy over the burn.|$|E
50|$|Laser {{propulsion}} {{is a form}} of beam-powered propulsion {{where the}} energy source is a remote (usually ground-based) laser system and separate from the reaction mass. This form of propulsion differs from a conventional <b>chemical</b> <b>rocket</b> where both energy and reaction mass come from the solid or liquid propellants carried on board the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Ion thrust {{engines are}} {{practical}} {{only in the}} vacuum of space and cannot take vehicles through the atmosphere because ion engines do not work {{in the presence of}} ions outside the engine.

50|$|The highest {{specific}} impulse <b>chemical</b> <b>rockets</b> use liquid propellants (liquid-propellant rockets). They can {{consist of a}} single chemical (a monopropellant) or a mix of two chemicals, called bipropellants.
