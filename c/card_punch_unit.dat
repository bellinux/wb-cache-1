50|$|With the {{development}} of computers <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> found new uses as their principal input media. <b>Punched</b> <b>cards</b> were used not only for data, but for a new application - computer programs, see: Computer programming in the <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> era. <b>Unit</b> record machines therefore remained in computer installations in a supporting role for keypunching, reproducing card decks, and printing.|$|R
50|$|Railroads were early {{users of}} {{automatic}} data processing equipment, starting {{at the turn of}} the twentieth century with <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and <b>unit</b> record equipment. Many rail systems have turned to computerized scheduling and optimization for trains which has reduced costs and helped add more train traffic to the rails.|$|R
25|$|Leslie Comrie's {{articles}} on <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> methods and W.J. Eckert's publication of <b>Punched</b> <b>Card</b> Methods in Scientific Computation in 1940, described <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> techniques sufficiently advanced to solve some differential equations or perform multiplication and division using floating point representations, all on <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and <b>unit</b> record machines. Such machines were used during World War II for cryptographic statistical processing, {{as well as}} a vast number of administrative uses. The Astronomical Computing Bureau, Columbia University, performed astronomical calculations representing {{the state of the art}} in computing.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1950s <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and <b>unit</b> record {{machines}} {{had become}} ubiquitous in academia, industry and government. The warning often printed on cards {{that were to}} be individually handled, [...] "Do not fold, spindle or mutilate", coined by Charles A. Philips, became a motto for the post-World War II era (even though many people {{had no idea what}} spindle meant).|$|R
5000|$|Hollerith {{founded the}} Tabulating Machine Company (1896) {{which was one}} of four {{companies}} that were amalgamated (via stock acquisition) to form a fifth company, Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), later renamed [...] International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Other companies entering the <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> business included The Tabulator Limited (1902) later renamed the British Tabulating Machine Company Limited, Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH (Dehomag) (1911),Powers Accounting Machine Company (1911) , Remington Rand (1927), and Groupe Bull (1931). [...] These companies, and others, manufactured and marketed a variety of <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and <b>unit</b> record machines for creating, sorting, and tabulating <b>punched</b> <b>cards,</b> even after the development of electronic computers in the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM 632 was a valve-and-relay driven basic (very basic) {{accounting}} machine, {{introduced in}} 1958, that {{was available in}} seven different models. It consisted of an IBM Electric typewriter {{and at least a}} <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> <b>unit</b> (like the IBM 024) that housed the [...] "electronics" [...] in two gates (a relay gate and an electronic gate). Some machines also had a card reader unit (like the IBM 026). A small core memory provided storage for 8 numeric 12 digit words.|$|R
50|$|An IBM {{card sorter}} is a machine for sorting decks of <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> in the format popularized by the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), which {{dominated}} the <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> data processing industry {{for much of}} the twentieth century. Sorting was a major activity in most facilities that processed data on <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> using <b>unit</b> record equipment. The work flow of many processes required decks of cards to be put into some specific order as determined by the data <b>punched</b> in the <b>cards.</b> The same deck might be sorted differently for different processing steps. The IBM 80 series sorters sorted input cards into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the sorter's settings.|$|R
50|$|Columbia University Astronomy Professor Wallace Eckert was {{examining}} the process {{used by the}} Navy to produce Air Almanacs. Deciding that the manual computation techniques used were too slow and error prone, he recommended automating the process with existing <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> based <b>unit</b> record equipment. One of the hardest problems was getting a high-quality printout of the tables. Initially IBM 405 accounting machines with special modifications were used, but he wanted something better. In 1941 Eckert developed a specification for a card-driven composing typewriter and asked IBM to design and build it.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 056 {{verifier}} {{used most}} of the same mechanical and electrical components as the 024/026 keypunches {{with the exception of}} the <b>punch</b> <b>unit</b> and print head. The <b>punch</b> <b>unit</b> had sensing pins in place of the punches. The holes sensed or not sensed would trip a contact bail when the configuration was other than that entered by the verifier operator. This stopped the forward motion of the card, and presented a red error light on the machine cover. The notching mechanism was located in the area occupied by the print mechanism on a 026 printing keypunch. It had a solenoid which drove the notching mechanism, and another that selected the top notch punch or end of <b>card</b> <b>punch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Batch {{processing}} {{dates to}} the late 19th century, in the processing of data stored on decks of <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> by <b>unit</b> record equipment, specifically the tabulating machine by Herman Hollerith, used for the 1890 United States Census. This was the earliest use of a machine-readable medium for data, rather than for control (as in Jacquard looms; today control corresponds to code), and thus the earliest processing of machine-read data was batch processing. Each card stored a separate record of data with different fields: cards were processed by the machine one by one, {{all in the same}} way, as a batch. Batch processing continued to be the dominant processing mode on mainframe computers from the earliest days of electronic computing in the 1950s.|$|R

A <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> input is a computer input device used to read executable computer programs, source code, and data from <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> Most early computers used <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> as their main input device. Along with a <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> readers were an earlier method of entering data and running programs before {{the current generation of}} input devices existed.

50|$|The {{card reader}} could read 600 {{standard}} <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> per minute, {{each with a}} capacity of up to 80 characters. The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> could <b>punch</b> 100 <b>cards</b> per minute.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> had {{a maximum}} rate of 150 cards per minute. Timing was quite {{critical}} throughout {{the operation of}} the <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> the <b>card</b> reader and the printer, all being based on electromechanical principles. The basic <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> mechanism was manufactured by Bull, a French company which owned patents on 80 column <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> machines. The machine came in two versions, the P147 and the P67, the main difference being electromagnetic clutch or a solenoid operated mechanical [...] "dog" [...] clutch to initiate a punch cycle. Since many gears, electrical contact cams were affixed to the main shaft with taper pins, the P 67 with its severe stopping dog clutch would cause timing loss more frequently than the P 147. Most emergency maintenance time was spent replacing worn and damaged taper pins and retiming the machine. The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> had a preread station, a punch station and a checkread station. The machine could be quite difficult to maintain and required much skill to troubleshoot and maintain. The machine cycle was oddly divided into 420 [...] "points" [...] or [...] "Bull degrees".|$|R
50|$|A lace <b>card</b> is a <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> {{with all}} holes punched (also called a whoopee card, {{ventilator}} card, flyswatter card, or IBM doily). They were mainly used as practical jokes to cause unwanted disruption in card readers. Card readers tended to jam when a lace card was inserted, as the resulting card had too little structural strength to avoid buckling inside the mechanism. <b>Card</b> <b>punches</b> could also jam trying to produce cards with all holes punched, owing to power-supply problems. When a lace card was fed through the reader, a card knife or card saw (a flat tool used with <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> readers and <b>card</b> <b>punches)</b> {{was needed to}} clear the jam.|$|R
