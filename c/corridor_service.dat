5|$|The {{discontinuance}} of the Atlantic City Express in 1995, and {{the arrival}} of the California Cars in 1996 and the Surfliner railcars in 2000–2002, lessened the need for the Metroliner-based cab cars. However, the Vermonter <b>corridor</b> <b>service</b> began using them when a reverse move was added between Springfield, Massachusetts and Palmer, Massachusetts in 1995. The later cab cars, and some of the earlier conversions, were retired in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, six of the 9600-series cab cars were brought out of retirement to support additional frequencies on the newly re-electrified Keystone Service. After the Vermonters backup move was eliminated in 2014, the ex-Metroliner cab cars have been used primarily on the Keystone Service and New Haven–Springfield Shuttle.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1993 Phase IV was {{introduced}} as a striking {{departure from the}} traditional red, white, and blue style seen previously. Phase IV was brought into service with the delivery of the newer Superliner II cars. It consisted of two thin red stripes over a white background, over a thick dark-blue stripe. In 1997 Amtrak extended the scheme to locomotives, initially GE P42DC diesel locomotives on Northeast <b>Corridor</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
25|$|Amtrak {{was created}} on May 1, 1971, as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation {{to assume the}} {{passenger}} operations of private railroads which had been declining since the 1950s. In Central New York, Amtrak's Empire <b>Corridor</b> <b>Service</b> extends from Penn Central Station in New York City up the Hudson River Valley to Albany, and west through Syracuse to Niagara Falls. It also includes the segment from Albany to Montreal along Lake Champlain utilizing the Delaware and Hudson Railroad (CP Rail).|$|E
500|$|Amtrak {{placed a}} $24 million order with Budd on October 12, 1973 for 57 [...] "non-powered Metroliner cars." [...] These, {{together}} with new GE E60 electric locomotives, were {{to provide additional}} Metroliner service on the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak expanded its plans in June 1974, ordering 200 more cars for $81 million. On October 25 it added another 35 cars. Finally, in April 1975, with the first deliveries imminent, Amtrak added 200 more cars to the order for $86 million. This brought the first order to 492 cars, with a total cost of $192 million. Amtrak intended to use 212 of the cars on Northeast <b>Corridor</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Corridor</b> <b>services</b> to Kitchener, London, and Windsor {{were reduced}} to fewer trains per day {{starting}} in October 2012, though still at least two each way.|$|R
25|$|Toronto Union Station {{serves as}} the hub for VIA Rail's {{intercity}} services in Central Canada, and includes services to various parts of Ontario, <b>Corridor</b> <b>services</b> to Montreal and national capital Ottawa, and long distance services to Vancouver and New York City.|$|R
50|$|EMD F59PHI {{locomotives}} used in <b>corridor</b> <b>services</b> {{are often}} spotted on the Coast Starlight {{as they are}} ferried from either the Northwest or Northern California down to Amtrak's shops in Los Angeles where equipment required for major locomotive servicing is available.|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, Caltrain {{requested}} that TAMC approach other train operators. TAMC subsequently opened {{discussions with the}} [...] and the Caltrans Division of Rail to extend Capitol <b>Corridor</b> <b>service</b> south from San Jose to Salinas using the same routing and stations. The switch to Capitol Corridor was cited as an advantage, since CCJPA had experience with commuter trains sharing service on Union Pacific-owned freight right-of-way. Two Capitol Corridor trains would originate from Salinas in the mornings and run through to San Jose and on to Sacramento, with two evening trains making the return trip south to Salinas.|$|E
2500|$|Regional rail {{transportation}} {{is provided by}} BART and the Altamont Commuter Express (ACE). Fremont's BART station once served as the southernmost terminus for the BART system; a [...] BART extensions to the Warm Springs / South Fremont station opened as of March 2017. [...] A southward BART extension into Santa Clara county and the Milpitas and Berryessa stations {{is scheduled to open}} December 2017; a further BART extension to downtown San Jose is in the planning stages. The Fremont-Centerville station provides a stopping point for ACE service, which travels from Stockton to San Jose, as well as for Amtrak's Capitol <b>Corridor</b> <b>service.</b> [...] Bus service is provided by AC Transit locally. Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority provides express bus service to various points in Silicon Valley, including downtown San Jose and California's Great America (seasonally) in Santa Clara, thus providing an alternative to the already heavy traffic on I-880 and I-680.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{significant}} new funding program dubbed [...] "Renaissance", {{a fleet of}} unused passenger cars which had been built for planned Nightstar sleeper services between locations in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe, via the Channel Tunnel, were purchased and adapted following the cancellation of the Nightstar project. The new [...] "Renaissance" [...] cars were swiftly nicknamed déplaisance ("displeasure") by French-speaking employees and customers, due to early problems adapting the equipment for Canadian use. Doors and toilets froze in cold Atlantic Canada temperatures, resulting in delays and service interruptions. New diesel-electric P42DC locomotives purchased from General Electric allowed the withdrawal of older locomotives, including the remaining LRC locomotives. The LRC passenger cars were retained and continued to provide much of the <b>Corridor</b> <b>service.</b> This expansion to Via's fleet has permitted scheduling flexibility, particularly in the corridor. Additionally, many passenger stations have been remodelled into passenger-friendly destinations, with several hosting co-located transit and regional bus hubs for various municipalities.|$|E
50|$|Toronto Union Station {{serves as}} the hub for VIA Rail's {{intercity}} services in Central Canada, and includes services to various parts of Ontario, <b>Corridor</b> <b>services</b> to Montreal and national capital Ottawa, and long distance services to Vancouver and New York City.|$|R
50|$|Both of Amtrak's Northeast <b>Corridor</b> <b>services</b> {{go through}} New Haven Union Station; most Acela Express and all Northeast Regional trains stop. Additionally, Amtrak's New Haven-Springfield Shuttle offers local service to Springfield, which is {{planned to be}} {{supplemented}} by the Hartford Line commuter service.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Corridor</b> <b>services</b> to Sarnia and Niagara Region {{were reduced}} to one per day {{starting}} in October 2012, with some cuts starting in July 2012.

5000|$|Prior to Via's {{formation}} in 1978, both CN and CP operated <b>Corridor</b> <b>services.</b> [...] Proposals have been advanced {{to build a}} high-speed rail link in this corridor. On November 14, 2011, the governments of Ontario, Quebec and Canada officially released the final report of a high-speed rail study for this corridor.|$|R
50|$|The Maple Leaf {{is a joint}} Amtrak-Via Rail service: {{ticketing}} is shared, {{and trains}} consist of Amtrak equipment but are operated on the Toronto-Niagara Falls portion of the route by Via crews. The station was formerly served by additional Via trains operating as part of <b>Corridor</b> <b>services,</b> but these were discontinued in 2012.|$|R
