40|$|Saccharin is {{carcinogenic}} for the {{urinary bladder}} in rats and mice, {{and most likely}} is carcinogenic in human beings. The neoplasms of the urinary bladder are malignant and invade and metastasize. Male rats {{are more susceptible to}} urinary bladder carcinogenesis than female rats. Rats exposed as fetuses develop neoplasms more readily than rats exposed as weanlings. The lesions in the urinary bladder go through the stages of hyperplasia, hyperplastic nodules, and later carcinomas. The male of the human species ingesting saccharin, as for rats, is more susceptible to carcinogenesis of the urinary bladder than the female. Neoplasms of the urinary bladder in rats were not caused by stones, parasites, sodium, or impurities. Carcinomas developed at the same time or prior to the development of stones in rats with both. There is a cocarcinogenic effect between saccharin and methyinitrosurea for the urinary bladder. Even though carcinomas of the urinary bladder are present in rats given the higher doses <b>of</b> <b>saccharin,</b> one was observed in a female rat given 0. 5 %. Chronic renal disease develops in rats ingesting saccharin. The disease is more advanced at the lower doses than at the higher doses, suggesting that saccharin at the lower doses does not reach the urinary bladder. Early neoplasms are seen in the renal pelvis of rats given the higher doses <b>of</b> <b>saccharin.</b> The risk ratios for urinary bladder carcinomas in human beings increase with both frequency and duration <b>of</b> <b>saccharin</b> usage.
