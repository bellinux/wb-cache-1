40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{hypothesis}} that the application of high voltage to the skin enhances both stratum corneum and keratinocyte permeability. Therefore, the transport of FITC labelled phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (FITC-PS) administered by passive diffusion, iontophoresis or electroporation was localized. METHODS: Fluorescent microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to visualize the FITC-PS transport at the tissue and cell level respectively in hairless rat skin after electroporation (5 x (200 V approximately 500 ms) or iontophoresis (same amount of <b>charges</b> <b>transferred).</b> RESULTS: FITC-PS did not penetrate the viable skin by passive diffusion. Molecular transport in the skin upon electroporation or iontophoresis was localized and implied mainly hair follicles for iontophoresis. In the stratum corneum, the pathways for FITC-PS transport were more transcellular during electroporation and paracellular during iontophoresis. FITC-PS were detected in the nucleus of the keratinocytes a few minutes after pulsing. In contrast, iontophoresis did not lead to an uptake of the oligomer. CONCLUSIONS: The internalization of FITC-PS in the keratinocytes after electroporation confirms the hypothesis and suggests that electroporation, which allows both efficient topical delivery and rapid cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides, might be useful for antisense therapy of epidermal diseases...|$|E

Hence, the aims were: (1) {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the mechanisms of drug transport by these methods; (2) to evaluate the safety issues associated with current application. Complementary biophysical methods were used to provide a complete picture of the stratum corneum. Even though the mechanism of drug transport is believed to be different, i. e., electrophoresis for iontophoresis and creation of new aqueous pathways for electroporation, the effects on the stratum corneum detected minutes after current application are very similar. For both methods, the major findings were: (1) a disorganisation of the lipid bilayers of the stratum corneum; (2) an increase in skin hydration; (3) a larger decrease in skin resistance induced by electroporation as compared to iontophoresis. These changes were partly reversible and depended on the amount of electrical <b>charges</b> <b>transferred.</b> The mechanisms of stratum corneum perturbations are discussed.

40|$|The kinetic {{properties}} {{of a single}} Na+ channel in the tunicate egg cell membrane were studied by the patch-recording technique. A conventional micropipette filled with a solution of 600 mM NaCl and 1. 5 mM MnCl 2 {{was used as the}} patch electrode. The seal resistance between patch electrode and egg surface was more than 1000 M omega. In the patch recording, the current fluctuations at a given membrane potential consisted of pulse-like events of a uniform amplitude. The amplitude was 1 pA at - 56 mV and decreased as the membrane potential was made more positive. It is suggested that the fluctuation in the patch current is the current through a single Na+ channel for the following reasons. First, the reversal potential of the pulse-like fluctuation in the patch current was approximately equal to that of the total membrane Na+ current in a solution equivalent to that in the patch electrode. Second, the <b>charges</b> <b>transferred</b> by the patch current and by the total membrane Na+ current during a 170 -msec command pulse showed parallel dependence on membrane potential.

40|$|The hERG channel has a {{relatively}} slow activation process but an extremely fast and voltage-sensitive inactivation process. Direct measurement of hERG's gating current (Piper, D. R., A. Varghese, M. C. Sanguinetti, and M. Tristani-Firouzi. 2003. PNAS. 100 : 10534 – 10539) reveals two kinetic components of gating charge transfer that may originate from two channel domains. This study {{is designed to}} address three questions: (1) which of the six positive charges in hERG's major voltage sensor, S 4, are responsible for gating charge transfer during activation, (2) whether a negative charge in the cytoplasmic half of S 2 (D 466) also contributes to gating charge transfer, and (3) whether S 4 serves as the sole voltage sensor for hERG inactivation. We individually mutate S 4 's positive charges and D 466 to cysteine, and examine (a) effects of mutations {{on the number of}} equivalent gating <b>charges</b> <b>transferred</b> during activation (za) and inactivation (zi), and (b) sidedness and state dependence of accessibility of introduced cysteine side chains to a membrane-impermeable thiol-modifying reagent (MTSET). Neutralizing the outer three positive charges in S 4 and D 466 in S 2 reduces za, and cysteine side chains introduced into these positions experience state-dependent changes in MTSET accessibility. On the other hand, neutralizing the inner three positive charges in S 4 does not affect za. None of the charge mutations affect zi. We propose that the scheme of gating charge transfer during hERG's activation process is similar to that described for the Shaker channel, although hERG has less gating charge in its S 4 than in Shaker. Furthermore, channel domain other than S 4 contributes to gating charge involved in hERG's inactivation process...|$|E

The time response of conductance measurements showed a quickly and largely increased conductivity when the sensor {{was exposed to}} ammonia gas produced by a bubble system of ammonia water. However, the desorption process in vacuum took more than 1  h which {{indicated that there was}} a larger number of transferred carriers and a strong adsorption force between ammonia and graphene. The desorption time could be greatly shortened down to about 2  min by adding the flow of water-vapor-enriched air {{at the beginning of the}} recovery stage which had been confirmed as a rapid and high-efficiency desorption process. Moreover, the optimum geometries, adsorption energies, and the charge transfer number of the composite systems were studied with first-principle calculations. However, the theoretical results showed that the adsorption energy between NH 3 and graphene was too small to fit for the experimental phenomenon, and there were few <b>charges</b> <b>transferred</b> between graphene and NH 3 molecules, which was completely different from the experiment measurement. The adsorption energy between NH 4 and graphene increased stage by stage which showed NH 4 was a strong donor. The calculation suggested that H 2 O molecule could help a quick desorption of NH 4 from graphene by converting NH 4 to NH 3 or (NH 3)n(H 2 O)m groups, which was consistent with the experimental results. This study demonstrates that the ammonia gas produced by a bubble system of ammonia water is mainly ammonium groups of NH 3 and NH 4, and the NH 4 moleculars are ideal candidates for the molecular doping of graphene while the interaction between graphene and the NH 3 moleculars is weak.|$|E
40|$|Voltage-gated ion {{channels}} are crucial for electrical activity and chemical signaling {{in a variety}} of cell types. Structure-activity studies involving electrophysiological characterization of mutants are widely used and allow us to quickly realize the energetic effects of a mutation by measuring macroscopic currents and fitting the observed voltage dependence of conductance to a Boltzmann equation. However, such an approach is somewhat limiting, principally because of the inherent assumption that the channel activation is a two-state process. In this analysis, we show that the area delineated by the gating charge displacement curve and its ordinate axis is related to the free energy of activation of a voltage-gated ion channel. We derive a parameter, the median voltage of charge transfer (Vm), which is proportional to this area, and prove that the chemical component of free energy change of a system can be obtained from the knowledge of Vm and the maximum number of <b>charges</b> <b>transferred.</b> Our method is not constrained by the number or connectivity of intermediate states and is applicable to instances in which the observed responses show a multiphasic behavior. We consider various models of ion channel gating with voltage-dependent steps, latent charge movement, inactivation, etc. and discuss the applicability of this approach in each case. Notably, our method estimates a net free energy change of approximately − 14 kcal/mol associated with the full-scale activation of the Shaker potassium channel, in contrast to − 2 to − 3 kcal/mol estimated from a single Boltzmann fit. Our estimate of the net free energy change in the system is consistent with those derived from detailed kinetic models (Zagotta et al. 1994. J. Gen. Physiol. doi: 10. 1085 /jgp. 103. 2. 321).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with employing the statistics of charge transfer in a conductor {{as a tool for}} quantum measurement. The physical systems studied are electronic devices made by nanoscale manufacturing techniques. In this context quantum measurement appears not as a postulate, but as physical process. In this thesis I am considering a quantum system, in particular a qubit or a nanomechanical resonator, interacting with a tunnel junction. The effect of coupling a quantum system to a tunnel junction is twofold: The state of the quantum system will be changed and there will be information about the quantum system in the statistics of charge transfer of the tunnel junction. As the first example a quantum measurement process of a qubit is considered. A common description of the system and charge dynamics is found by introducing a new quantity, the charge specific density matrix. By deriving and solving a Markovian master equation for this quantity the measurement process is analyzed. The measurement is shown to be a dynamical process, where correlations between the initial state of the qubit and the number of <b>charges</b> <b>transferred</b> in the tunnel junction arise on a typical timescale, the measurement time. As another example of a quantum system a nanomechanical oscillator is considered. It is found, that the biased tunnel junction, acting as a non-equilibrium environment to the oscillator, increases the temperature of the oscillator from its thermal equilibrium value. The current in the junction is modulated by the interaction with the oscillator, but the influence vanishes for bias voltages smaller than the oscillator frequency. For an asymmetric junction and non-vanishing oscillator momentum a current is shown to flow through the junction even at zero bias. The current noise spectrum induced by the oscillator in the tunnel junction consists of a noise floor and a peaked structure with peaks at zero frequency, the oscillator frequency and double the oscillator frequency. The peak heights are dependent on the coupling strength between oscillator and junction, the occupation number of the oscillator, the bias voltage and the junction temperature. I show how the peak height {{can be used as a}} measure of the oscillator temperature, demonstrating that the noise of a tunnel junction can be used for electronic thermometry of a nanomechanical oscillator...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} charge {{geometry}} on the structural response of right circular cylinders, subjected to internal blast loading, was investigated. Thin-walled, seamless {{304 stainless steel}} cylinders were subjected to blast loads from partially confined bare cylindrical PE 4 charges with different diameter and aspect ratios(charges length to charge diameter). The diameters of interest were: 25 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 3). 30 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 1. 6). 35 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 1. 1). 40 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 0. 9). The effect of aspect ratio, for the constant diameter or constant mass cases, on the structural response of the cylinders (that is, diametric deflection, axial impulse, and axial shortening) is reported. Cylindrical charges with an aspect ratio of 1, were compared to spherical charges of equivalent mass. For charges with constant diameter with varying length: The diametric deflection increased with increasing aspect ratio. The axial shortening increased with increasing aspect ratio. The axial impulse increased with increasing aspect ratio. For charges with constant mass with varying diameter and length: The long charges (that is, charges with aspect ratios greater than 1) caused larger diametric deflections than their mass equivalent short (that is, charges with aspect ratios less than 1) charges. This is because the long charges had more side effective charge mass (that is, {{the mass of the}} charge that contributes directly to the diametric deflection of a cylinder) than the shorter charges. The short <b>charges</b> <b>transferred</b> more axial impulse to the ballistic pendulum, because they had more axial effective charge mass (that is, the mass of the charge that contributes directly to the axial impulse that is transferred to a ballistic pendulum) than their mass equivalent long charges. It was observed that a lighter charge can diametrically deflect a cylinder more effectively than a heavier charge, if its side effective charge mass is greater than that of the heavier charge. The structural responses of the cylinders obtained from cylindrical charge detonations were greater than those obtained from the mass equivalent spherical charge detonations. The deflections resulting from the cylindrical charges were also more localised compared to the spherical charges...|$|E
40|$|Transmembrane ion {{channels}} mediate {{a number}} of essential physiological processes in a cell ranging from regulating osmotic pressure to transmission of neural signals. Kinetics and selectivity of ion transport is of critical importance to a cell and, not surprisingly, it is a subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies. In this presentation we will analyze in detail computer simulations of two simple channels from fungi - antiamoebin and trichotoxin. Each of these channels is made of an alpha-helical bundle of small, nongenomically synthesized peptides containing {{a number of}} rare amino acids and exhibits strong antimicrobial activity. We will focus on calculating ionic conductance defined as the ratio of ionic current through the channel to applied voltage. From molecular dynamics simulations, conductance can be calculated {{in at least two}} ways, each involving different approximations. Specifically, the current, given as the number of <b>charges</b> <b>transferred</b> through the channel per unit of time, can be obtained from the number of events in which ions cross the channel during the simulation. This method works well for large currents (high conductance values and/or applied voltages). If the number of crossing events is small, reliable estimates of current are difficult to achieve. Alternatively, conductance can be estimated assuming that ion transport can be well approximated as diffusion in the external potential given by the free energy profile. Then, the current can be calculated by solving the one-dimensional diffusion equation in this external potential and applied voltage (the generalized Nernst-Planck equation). To do so three ingredients are needed: the free energy profile, the position-dependent diffusion coefficient and the diffusive flux of ions into the channel. All these quantities can be obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. An important advantage of this method is that it can be used equally well to estimating large and small currents. In addition, once the free energy profile becomes available the full current-voltage dependence can be readily obtained. For both channels we carried out calculations using both approaches. We also tested the main assumptions underlying the diffusive model, such as uncorrelated nature of individual crossing events and Fickian diffusion. The accuracy and consistency of different methods will be discussed. Finally we will discuss how comparisons between calculated and measured ionic conductance and selectivity of transport can be used for determining structural models of the channels...|$|E

The <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> rate of the solution probe was enhanced with the modified electrodes compared to the <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> rate measured with unmodified electrodes. Even though the cause of the enhancement in the <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> rate is not clear, the results suggest that the modification of TCO may improve the charge collection efficiency of TCO, which is desirable for the application of TCO in devices such as organic photovoltaic cells...|$|R
