2500|$|Schumacher {{came back}} after his {{suspension}} for the European Grand Prix, which he won by about 25 seconds, {{to take a}} lead of 5 points into the penultimate round in Japan. The race in Japan was held in torrential rain, with Hill managing to win the restarted race, by three seconds on aggregate over Schumacher who finished second. Going into the final round at Adelaide, Schumacher led Hill by a single point. Mansell took pole for Williams, but had a poor start which let Hill and Schumacher through {{to fight for the}} lead and the 1994 title. Midway through the race, Schumacher's perceived need for a low downforce setup cost him, as he lost control and clipped the outside wall at the 5th corner (out of sight of Hill). As Schumacher recovered, Hill <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and attempted to overtake into the next corner. Schumacher turned in and the resulting contact (Schumacher in the wall and Hill retiring with bent suspension), meant Schumacher was the champion. This collision has been controversial. Some, such as Williams's Patrick Head, have suggested that this was a deliberate attempt by Schumacher to take Hill out of the race. Others, such as then BBC commentator Murray Walker, defended Schumacher, calling the accident a [...] "racing incident".|$|E

60|$|Marilla looked scandalized {{and glanced}} apprehensively {{around to make}} sure the twins were not within earshot. They <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the house just then.|$|E
60|$|The two {{glanced back}} {{once more and}} to their chagrin saw that <b>the</b> Rovers had <b>come</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and were chasing after them faster than ever. This caused Bill Glutts to become more frightened than before.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked around}} sharply, {{and at that}} moment a student chanced to <b>come</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of <b>the</b> Hall, {{on the way to the}} {{gymnasium}} building. Job Haskers leaped towards him and caught him roughly by the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} his glance and saw Tony the Greek, {{the one who}} had sprung overboard the first day. He had just <b>come</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of <b>the</b> house, and, beyond one arm in a sling, seemed in good condition. He walked easily and with strength, a testimonial to the virtues of Mr. Pike's rough surgery.|$|R
60|$|I {{was sitting}} on the front {{doorstep}} after they had gone when Johnny <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> looking so mysterious and determined that I knew he had thought of something splendid.|$|E
60|$|When Euchre <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of {{the cabin}} Duane was not so astounded as he was {{concerned}} to see the outlaw white and shaking. Sweat dripped from him. He had a wild look.|$|E
60|$|She {{opened the}} gate of the yard, and panted across it just as a tall, grim-faced woman <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the house and stood rooted to the ground in astonishment at the sight that met her eyes.|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, a {{familiar}} figure <b>came</b> shambling <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> It was Sammy Simpson.|$|R
5000|$|However Patrick and Rick get {{up earlier}} {{and go to}} school. In the hall Patrick charges the gun telling Rick to follow him and show {{everything}} he does. When he <b>comes</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> he starts shooting some students (among them are [...] "a greedy fatman" [...] and [...] "religious girl" [...] whom {{he was planning to}} kill in one scene). Then he looks for Taylor and his friends.|$|R
60|$|A boy <b>came</b> running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of <b>the</b> path. He {{struck out}} at Maude. With a remarkably swift {{movement}} she retaliated.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned to}} the window, and so did Snap and Whopper. At that minute {{one of the men}} <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the street. The lion leaped from behind the tree into the roadway. Pulling up his gun, the man banged away wildly, for he was nervous and frightened.|$|E
60|$|And here he {{encountered}} more smoke, floating lazily upward {{in the warm}} sunshine beyond an outjut of rock. As he <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> he heard a light, metallic tap-tapping and a merry whistling that kept the beat. Then he saw the man, an upturned shoe between his knees, into the sole {{of which he was}} driving hob-spikes.|$|E
60|$|In {{the cool}} {{twilight}} Ethel went with Agnes Bentley to mail her letter. As {{they stopped at}} the door of the little country store, a young man <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> It was Young Si. He was in his rough fishing suit, with a big herring net trailing over his shoulder, but no disguise could effectually conceal his splendid figure. Agnes sprang forward eagerly.|$|E
40|$|If you had <b>come</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of <b>the</b> Home Economics Annex any morning {{this spring}} I {{wonder if you}} would have been {{surprised}} to hear the merry song or 2 ̆ 2 Here we go round the Mulberry Bush, 2 ̆ 2 or to have seen, if you had peeked in the door, eager faces bent over such fascinating work as modelling a bear or cutting out a picture. These workers are our very youngest college students, but perhaps the whole affair would need an explanation...|$|R
50|$|The police {{arrive with}} Chester {{to arrest the}} gang. Susan scolds Chester for running off with the money but Chester clarifies that he left the hotel to wire the money to her mother immediately, showing her a receipt as proof. Stan and Ollie arrive on deck to see Susan and Chester kiss before leaving the ship. The duo plan to leave the ship as well but {{suddenly}} <b>the</b> remaining gangsters <b>come</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and Stan and Ollie leap overboard in order to escape.|$|R
50|$|Jerry's signs lead Tom to Mammy's bedroom, where Tom falls asleep. Jerry {{watches as}} an unsuspecting Mammy sees Tom on her bed, and violently throws Tom {{out of the}} house. Tom crashes into a fence, but is too tired to care and simply falls back asleep while using a brick as a pillow. Tom's friends <b>come</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> then upon {{spotting}} Tom having dozed off, they pick him up and tug him along with them through the alleyway, singing in the moonlight once again whilst they are leaving.|$|R
60|$|As I {{was about}} to mount my bicycle the boy <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the inn. Upon his face was a diabolical grin. The thought rushed into my mind {{that he might have}} been {{standing}} beneath the parlor window. Instinctively I made a movement towards him, but he did not run. I turned my eyes away from him and mounted. I could not kill a boy {{in the presence of a}} nurse-maid.|$|E
60|$|Tommy {{was still}} feasting {{his eyes on}} the geraniums when Miss Octavia herself <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the house. Her face darkened the minute she saw Tommy. Most people's did. Tommy had the {{reputation}} of being a very bad, mischievous boy; he was certainly very poor and ragged, and Miss Octavia disapproved of poverty and rags on principle. Nobody, she argued, not even a boy of twelve, need be poor and ragged if he is willing to work.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the guide <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the house, from the inn yard, leading the horse. He stopped to water the horse at a {{fountain}} in the street, and then led him to the door. In the mean time the porter of the inn had brought down the trunk, and then the guide proceeded to fasten it upon the saddle of the horse, by means of two strong straps. The saddle was what is called a pack saddle, and was made expressly to receive such burdens.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{was taken}} by surprise. She had not thought he would ever come again, and was off her guard. He had <b>come</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> porch <b>corner</b> {{abruptly}} as she {{stood there in the}} dusk, and she started very perceptibly.|$|R
60|$|The {{two boys}} {{went into the}} house, and there they found that Dorothy had got some breakfast ready for them upon the kitchen table. After eating their breakfast, they got into the wagon, and set out. Jonas first put in a large umbrella. Just as they were driving out of the yard, the first beams of the morning sun shone in under the {{branches}} of a great tree in the yard, and brightened up the tips of the horses' ears and the boys' faces. At the same time, a rude gust of wind <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of <b>the</b> house, and slammed to the gate of the front yard.|$|R
60|$|Policeman Cleary <b>came</b> back <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> as <b>the</b> crowd dispersed. Surprised, he upturned an ear {{toward the}} McCaskey apartment, where {{the crash of}} irons and chinaware and the ring of hurled kitchen {{utensils}} seemed as loud as before. Policeman Cleary took out his timepiece.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mrs. Dr. dear, he {{was sitting}} out on the back steps this afternoon. It was just after the news came that the Armistice had been signed and he was looking his Hydest. I can assure you he was an awesome looking beast. All at once, Mrs. Dr. dear, Bruce Meredith <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the kitchen walking on his stilts. He has been {{learning}} to walk on them lately {{and came over to}} show me how well he could do it. Mr. Hyde just took a look and one bound carried him over the yard fence. Then he went tearing through the maple grove in great leaps with his ears laid back. You never saw a creature so terrified, Mrs. Dr. dear. He has never returned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was this}} way," [...] {{answered}} Hiram Duff, dropping {{down on the}} chair Sam fixed for him. [...] "I {{was sitting on the}} back porch mending my coat {{when all of a sudden}} a fellow <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the house. He was a strange looking young fellow and he wore a funny looking cap pulled away down over his eyes. He asked me if I wasn't Hackler. I said I wasn't, that my name was Hiram Duff. Then he says, 'I knew it, I knew it! At last!' and sits down on the porch. I says, 'At last, what?' and he says something about a nugget of gold. He acted awful mysterious like, and finally he asks me if I'd like to own half of a big nugget of gold. I told him I certainly would." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was {{in hopes}} the four-in-hand wouldn't come, but {{in less than}} ten minutes there drove up to our door a four-horse coach which, not having half enough passengers, was glad to come such a little ways to get some more. There {{was a man in}} a high hat and red coat, who was blowing a horn as the thing <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> and just as I was looking into the coach and {{thinking}} we'd have it all to ourselves, for there was nobody in it, he put a ladder up against the top, and says he, touching his hat, [...] "There's a seat for you, madam, right next the coachman, and one just behind for the gentleman. 'Tain't often that, on a fine morning like this, such seats as them is left vacant on account of a sudden case of croup in a baronet's family." ...|$|E
60|$|Before Monsieur Gratiot could answer, a child <b>came</b> running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of <b>the</b> {{house and}} stood, surprised, staring at us. Nick made a face, stooped down, and twirled his finger. Shouting with a terrified glee, the boy {{fled to the}} garden path, Nick after him.|$|R
50|$|Jimmy Edwards, a bullied and tormented teenager, who {{was once}} close friends with Lucas Scott (Chad Michael Murray), Skills Taylor (Antwon Tanner) and Mouth McFadden (Lee Norris), enters the school while smoking a cigarette. He walks down the hallway and sees the bullies who beat him up the night before going through his locker; when they notice him, they move to leave, {{laughing}} while one of them bumps him purposefully and insults him. Jimmy pulls out a gun just as Peyton Sawyer (Hilarie Burton) and Brooke Davis (Sophia Bush) <b>come</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> at <b>the</b> glass library doors. Jimmy fires one shot as Peyton and Brooke hit the floor for cover and the school is sent into a frenzied panic.|$|R
5000|$|He goes {{looking for}} Iolaus. Iolaus, {{hiding in a}} bush, attacks Hercules {{and the two men}} fight. As they fight, Iolaus <b>comes</b> walking <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and Hercules realizes the [...] "Iolaus" [...] he has been {{fighting}} is really Proteus, a god who can change his form to that of any living being.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a cool}} day for September, {{a perfect}} day, an auspicious day, and yet it went {{the way of the}} others before it. This was the very fulness of the year, the earth giving out the {{sweetness}} of her maturity, the corn in martial ranks, with golden plumes nodding. The forest still in its glory of green. They walked in silence the familiar paths, and Alfred, clipping the late roses for the supper table, shook his white head as they passed him. The sun, who had begun to hurry on his southward journey, went to bed at six. The few clothes Clarence was to take with him had been packed by Virginia in his bag, and the two were standing in the twilight {{on the steps of the}} house, when Ned <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> He called his young mistress by name, but she did not hear him. He called again.|$|E
60|$|When {{we got to}} Exford we {{left our}} cycles at the inn and {{followed}} Mr. Poplington to the hunting stables, which are near by. I had not gone a dozen steps from the door before I heard a great barking, and the next minute there <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> a pack of hounds. They crossed the bridge over the little river, and then they stopped. We went up to them, and while Mr. Poplington talked to the men the whole of that pack of hounds gathered about us as gentle as lambs. They were good big dogs, white and brown. The head huntsman who had them in charge told me there was thirty couple of them, and I thought that sixty dogs was pretty heavy odds against one deer. Then they moved off as orderly {{as if they had}} been children in a kindergarten, and we went to the stables and saw the horses; and then the master of the hounds and a good many other gentlemen in red coats, in all sorts of traps, rode up, and their hunters were saddled, and the dogs barked and the men cracked their whips to keep them together, and there was a bustle and liveliness to a degree I can't write about, and Jone and I never thought about going in to breakfast until all those horses, some led and some ridden, and the men and the hounds, and even the dust from their feet, had disappeared.|$|E
50|$|One {{day before}} the Olympic tournament, Peeters had become amateur world {{champion}} in track cycling. One day later he rode the Olympic 1000 m sprint, {{and of course he}} was considered a favourite. He lost in the first round, but his second place was enough to progress to the next round. He then won the quarter final and the semi-final. In the final, he rode against two British cyclists, Harry Ryan and Tiny Johnson. They tried to make use of their numerical advantage, and Ryan attacked, so that Peeters had to get him back. In the final corner, Johnson should <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> to win the race, but Peeters was ahead and kept his lead.|$|E
5000|$|Not {{all events}} {{are limited to}} a {{particular}} moment in time. The normal physical rules {{of cause and effect}} may see a series of interlocking circumstances conspire to cause a particular injury. If the facts of the example above are slightly changed so that the accident occurs at night at a sharp bend on a very quiet country road. When the driver sees the victim lying in the road he simply leaves the unconscious person where he fell. Some hours later, when a second car innocently <b>comes</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and kills <b>the</b> victim, the first driver is happily asleep in his bed. Thus, he argues that, {{at the time of the}} death, he had no mens rea and so cannot be guilty of homicide. This argument fails because of the so-called Single Transaction Principle ...|$|R
60|$|At {{a corner}} of Sixth Avenue {{electric}} lights and cunningly displayed wares behind plate-glass made a shop window conspicuous. Soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass. People <b>came</b> running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> a policeman in the lead. Soapy stood still, {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and smiled at the sight of brass buttons.|$|R
60|$|Phibbs {{pulled a}} bell-cord, {{and a soft}} faraway jingle was heard. Then an old man <b>came</b> slowly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of <b>the</b> house. His bare head was quite bald. He wore a short canvas apron and carried pruning-shears in one hand. Without a word of {{greeting}} to his mistress or scarce a glance at her half recumbent form, he mounted {{the steps of the}} piazza and assisted Phibbs to lift the chair to the ground.|$|R
