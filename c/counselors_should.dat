5000|$|As stated, {{the study}} of postures can give {{a vast amount of}} {{information}} about emotions and self-perceptions. The study of posture has also proven beneficial in other fields. Professional counselors, who were the participants, had to view recorded interactions of counselors and clients and determine the emotions of the client. [...] Researchers found that relying only on verbal communication to determine the emotions of the client resulted in an accuracy of only 66%. High levels of empathy could be misconstrued without the matching positive nonverbal communication. In similar studies it was noted that the arms and legs were the most important bodily factors in signaling low levels of empathy. [...] Further, researchers suggested that <b>counselors</b> <b>should</b> not only be trained in verbal communication but also in nonverbal communication.|$|E

40|$|Some {{research}} and ideas about learning, which {{are of interest}} to eiementary school counselors, deal with individual differences and classroom environment. Studies find girls markedly superior to boys in language skills,. with boys better in analytic thinking and transfer of learning. However, no sex differenon in intellect have been found. There are differences in perceptions of self and the school experience, basically more negative for boys than for girls. Teachers respond differently to boys than to girls by differentiating instruction in segregated classes, and by giving higher grades to girls even on comparable achievement. The climate of the classroom effects the maturation of students. Counselors, therefore, can help teachers (1) use individual differences constructively, both in tests and in the classroom experiences; (2) become better diagnosticians in collecting data on intellectual and nonintellectual factors and in keeping useful records; and (3) deal effectively with children experiencing classroom difficulties.

40|$|Perhaps I held naïve {{expectations}} about {{the realities of the}} school counselor role when I entered my practicum site for the first time. I estimated that a 2006 RAMP counseling department would have significant support from administrators to offer comprehensive services for students. Instead, my mentors face daily lunch duty, which not only siphons time away from appropriate counseling duties, but conflicts with individual student appointments. In my own interaction with the administration, I experienced first hand the phenomenon school counselors face across the nation [...] the foggy and unsupported role of the school counselor: “Schedules and transcripts [...] . Good school <b>counselors</b> <b>should</b> be actively involved in the schedule changes and transcripts of students. This is an academic institution, all that other stuff isn’t necessary. ” Further observations made it increasingly clear that to many, school counselors offer no significant benefit to students and are merely “extra staff. ” Whiston (2002) suggests that the school counseling profession is “at risk ” because school counselors fail to demonstrate accountability for their services. Similarly, Brigman and Campbell (2003) propose that school <b>counselors</b> <b>should</b> use empirical data interventions to convince decision makers to protect their time devoted to direct student services. I likewise agree that in order for school counselors to implement comprehensive counseling services, they need to accurately demonstrate accountability for their interventions on individual, departmental, and professional levels. Accountability starts with each individual counselor. Because it remains difficult to quantify the impact of many subjective counseling interventions, school <b>counselors</b> <b>should</b> consciously devise strategies to record and track all interventions in some way.
