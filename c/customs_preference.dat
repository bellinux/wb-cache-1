The emergence of bank-issued credit served as an important engine for economic growth, and it spread from the Moscow district to other Russian regions (Berkowitz and DeJong 2011). These institutional changes led to a major transformation in the agro-industrial sector: private land ownership on a large scale, increased ability for producers to respond to market conditions and demand, creation of functioning wholesale markets for raw materials and agricultural products, an increased number of large integrated farms, and additional entrepreneurship opportunities. Investment environment in the agro-industrial sector were improved due to state support of investments in transportation infrastructure, cold storage, distribution, access to foreign markets for equipment and genetic material, interest rate subsidies, tax benefits, and <b>customs</b> <b>preferences.</b>|$|R

Most of these devices work autonomously on a specific set of appliances or only for specific necessities, such as heating or cooling. The proposed smart energy solutions are focused on gathering datasets of the historical data for energy consumption and then propose different algorithms for analysing these datasets. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using a new Smart-ECO model, consisting of a smart device, which is running its own smart algorithm. We will conduct analysis on real-time household dataset, in order to optimize the electricity consumption per appliance.

40|$|Supporting {{streaming}} media applications over current packet network infrastructures represents a challenging task in many regards. For one, {{the lack of}} quality of service (QoS) guarantees in existing networks such as the Internet means that time-constrained media packets will face dynamic variations in bandwidth, loss rate, and delay as they traverse the network from the sender to the receiver. The variable rate of media traffic represents yet another difficulty when transmission constraints need to be met. Finally, the heterogeneity of client devices and access bandwidth coupled with <b>custom</b> user <b>preferences</b> exacerbate the problem of smooth and quality-optimized media playback even further. In this article we {{provide an overview of}} the various techniques for media and streaming strategy adaptation, which can be employed to deal with the difficulties imposed by such dynamic environments. These techniques depend on the characteristics of the media application, in particular on the network streaming infrastructure and the timing constraints imposed on the media packets’ delivery. We survey adaptation techniques that act on the encoding of the multimedia information, on the scheduling of the media packets, or that try to combat transmission errors. We also briefly overview some media-friendly networking solutions, which contribute to increased QoS by incorporating some level of intelligence in intermediate network nodes. Finally, we describe a few open challenges in media streaming, emphasizing strategies based on promising cross-layer approaches where adaptation strategies are applied in a coordinated manner, across different layers of the network protocol stack...|$|R

MethodsA descriptive exploratory study design was used. A convenience sample of 224 Asian Americans was recruited from the states of Michigan and Ohio. ResultsIt was found that (a) participants were significantly different in mean age, duration of stay in country of origin and the United States, and proficiency in English; (b) the familiarity, preference and utilization of overall ethnic items were statistically different by ethnic group; (c) overall, familiar feeling with ethnic items had the highest mean score for all ethnic items, and ethnic food was the most familiar, preferred and used item in daily life; (d) Asian Americans who sought more ethnic items had greater proficiency in English and more preference, use and familiarity with ethnic items; and (e) daily use of ethnic items was the best predictor of familiarity, followed by preference, and fluency in English. ConclusionAsian Americans have different backgrounds in terms of <b>customs,</b> food <b>preferences,</b> beliefs, lifestyles, and languages. Despite being in different age groups, having different lengths of stay in the United States, and different countries of origin, a common trait among Asian Americans was that they were consciously seeking ethnic items regardless of ethnic group.

Multiprocessor control systems that are characterised with high independency compose very important area of automation resources. Maintenance of the multiprocessor system priority requires fast, safe and reliable communication channel. Based on these requirements was used the CAN communication device. This control system enables non-deterministic control in real-time. The matching rate and access method of communication system is adapted to this. That means, that every participant of the net can be an arbiter for a definite period of time. This method is combining with random access to net, which solves collision by <b>custom</b> of <b>preference</b> decision.

Self-help housing in informal settlements has different influences that are denoted in the <b>customs</b> and <b>preferences</b> of the residents, which in turn, are reflected on the elements of house exteriors as well as its interior. Colonias in the U. S-Mexico border region are a model of informal settlements. The purpose of this study is to analyze the social and cultural influences on housing fronts in Webb County Colonias. The study focuses on investigating traditional features, vernacular forms, building rituals, and social features as they relate to the morphology of house fronts and their production. The housing model of Geddes and Bertalanffy explained by Turner (1972) was the premise of establishing the argument of this study. A mixed-method approach was used in data gathering from the following three Colonias: Los Altos, Larga Vista, and Rio Bravo. Utilized methods included image-based research through systematic random sampling of housing fronts in the Colonias, as well as a group-administered structured survey distributed during community monthly gathering for food distribution. The development of the research process and methodology incorporated the input of the local community and local leaders and volunteers assisted in its implementation. The study concluded that past and present experiences of Colonias residents have intense impacts on different aspects contributing to the themes comprising the morphology of Colonias housing fronts. A classical pattern of migration as well as maintained contact and continuous dialogue between residents and their kin were found to result in preserving the inherent native culture of the Colonias?????? residents and can thus be considered as core elements. This preservation of native culture was indicated by utilization of semi-private space, traditional roof forms, privacy and security elements, and building rituals. The study also identified additional secondary modified elements, represented by the lack of gates utilization as a measure of security. These core and modified elements coincide with the Geddes and Bertalanffy model and therefore it can be deduced that this model can be applied in the case of the Colonias...|$|R

Understanding how household income, food prices, parental education and nutritional knowledge, and culturallybased <b>customs</b> and food <b>preferences</b> interact to determine food consumption patterns (particularly for nonstaple foods), and so micronutrient intake, can provide crucial information for designing policies and intervention programs to improve human nutrition. Within the typical dietary {{patterns of the}} Bangladeshi survey population, the key food group with respect to micronutrient consumption is vegetables, providing nearly 95 percent of vitamin A intake, 75 percent of vitamin C intake, and 25 percent of iron intake. Vegetables are the least expensive sources {{of all of these}} nutrients. Vegetables are sufficiently inexpensive sources of vitamin A and vitamin C that they could provide the RDA within normal dietary patterns and the budgets of low-income groups. There is no corresponding inexpensive source of iron. Programs to educate consumers about the importance of meeting recommended daily allowances of vitamin A and vitamin C and about commonly eaten sources of these nutrients has the potential for improving intake. Because a high proportion of vitamin A and vitamin C intake apparently comes from own-production, extension programs to promote growing specific vitamin A and vitamin C rich foods not only would provide households with a ready supply of these nutrients, but increased production could bring the local price down. iv In contrast, it is much more difficult to see how these types of education and extension programs could be effective in increasing iron intake, because sources of bioavailable iron are expensive.
