This paper {{reports the}} design and {{experimental}} demonstration of a novel bi-directional solid-state disconnect (SSD) based on Silicon Carbide (SiC) depletion-mode junction field effect transistors (JFETs) for protecting critical sensitive components in high power systems. The SSD is able to provide a fast disconnect action upon receiving a preset trip current flowing through it and has a very low insertion loss, which makes it suitable for high power applications. For the application in 150 kW six-phase power inverter systems, an insertion loss of less than 0. 91 % and a <b>current</b> <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> of less than 20 µs for trip currents of about 800 A have been demonstrated experimentally. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there are no other solid-state disconnects available of comparable parameters...|$|E
40|$|Intense {{magnetic}} fields {{exist in the}} immediate vicinity of a lightning strike (and near power lines). Conducting barriers increase the rise time (and thus decrease the rise rate) interior to the barrier, but typically do not prevent penetration of the magnetic field, since the lightning <b>current</b> <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> may be larger than the barrier diffusion time. Thus, substantial energy is present in the interior field, although the degradation of rise rate makes it more difficult to couple into electrical circuits. This report assesses the threat posed by the diffusive magnetic field to interior components and wire loops (where voltages are induced). Analytical and numerical bounding analyses are carried out on a pill box shaped conducting barrier to develop estimates for the worst case magnetic field threats inside the system. Worst case induced voltages and energies are estimated and compared with threshold charge voltages and energies on the output capacitor of the system. Variability of these quantities with respect to design parameters are indicated. The interior magnetic field and induced voltage estimates given in this report can be used as excitations for more detailed interior and component models. 3. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} simulation {{and experimental}} results for a 1400 A, ± 900 V peak rated, switch mode power supply for SNS Injection Kicker Magnets. For each magnet (13 mΩ, 160 µH), the power supply must supply controlled pulses at 60 Hz repetition rate. The pulse current must rise {{from zero to}} maximum in less than 1 millisec {{in a controlled manner}}, flat top for up to 2 millisec, and should fall in a controlled manner to less than 4 A within 500 µs. The low current performance during fall time is the biggest challenge in this power supply. The simulation results show that to meet the controlled fall of the current and the current ripple requirements, voltage loop bandwidth of at least 10 kHz and switching frequency of at least 100 kHz are required. To achieve high power high frequency switching with IGBT switches, a series connected topology with three phase shifted (0 °, 60 ° & 120 °) converters each with 40 kHz switching frequency (IGBT at 20 kHz), has been achieved. In this paper, the circuit topology, relevant system specifications and experimental results that meet the requirements of the power supply are described in detail. A unique six pulse SCR rectifier circuit with capacitor storage has been implemented to achieve minimum pulse width to meet required performance during <b>current</b> <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> below 50 A due to the very narrow pulse width and non-linearity from IGBT turn-on/off times...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{kinetics}} {{of generating}} ultrashort light pulses by gain switching unbiased semiconductor lasers emitting relaxation oscillations is theoretically modeled and described using phase portraits. Biomolec-ular recombination processes and realistic injection current pulse shapes are {{incorporated in the}} model. Approximate analytical solutions of the rate equations are derived for high current injection. Laser pulse widths, pulse peak power, electrical to optical pulse delay times, and time differ-ence to subsequent relaxation oscillations are computed. Their depen-dence on injection current to threshold current density ratio (J/Jt) and on material and laser design parameters is explicitly derived and is in good agreement with experiment. In particular the remarkable observa-tion that the laser pulse width is broadly independent of the injection <b>current</b> rise and <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> can thus be understood...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{advanced}} MOSFETs for DC-DC converters applications is growing {{as is the}} push for applications miniaturization going {{hand in hand with}} increased power consumption. These advanced new designs should theoretically translate into doubling the average switching frequency of the commercially available MOSFETs while maintaining the same high or even higher efficiency. MOSFETs packaged in SO 8, DPAK, D 2 PAK and IPAK have source inductance between 1. 5 nH to 7 nH (nanoHenry) depending on the specific package, in addition to between 5 and 10 nH of printed circuit board (PCB) trace inductance. In a synchronous buck converter, laboratory tests and simulation show that during the turn on and off of the high side MOSFET the source inductance will develop a negative voltage across it, forcing the MOSFET to continue to conduct even after the gate has been fully switched off. In this paper we will show that this has the following effects: The drain <b>current</b> rise and <b>fall</b> <b>times</b> are proportional to the total source inductance (package lead + PCB trace) The rise and <b>fall</b> <b>times</b> arealso proportional to the magnitude of the drain current, making th...|$|R

The goal for this paper is to affirm or modify recommended needle sampling time. Needles of Douglas-fir, Turkish fir, Nordmann fir, Noble fir, Grand fir, and Fraser fir Christmas trees were collected monthly for a year, dried, and analyzed for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and B. No single period was found for any species when needle nutrient concentration was stable for all elements investigated. Revised recommended needle collection times were chosen by integrating cultural practices, likelihood of nutrient deficiency, and needle nutrient concentration changes for species grown in an area.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{approach to the}} design and simulation of a Class-E power amplifier under typical high frequency switching conditions is presented. The analysis will optimize the loading network at the output for transistors with an exponential transition current, while accounting for harmonics injected into the circuit from the choke inductor and a non-infinite output Q. Two methods have been successfully implemented to simulate the class-E amplifier waveforms, optimize the required circuit components, and calculate amplifier performances such as efficiency and total harmonic distortion (THD). The first optimizes the circuit parameters while considering finite choke inductances, drain <b>current</b> <b>fall</b> <b>time,</b> and loaded quality factor of the output network inductance. The second accounts for all these {{in addition to a}} finite ON resistance of the switch, rise and fall time of the input signal, and parasitic resistances of both circuit inductors. The first method (integral method) utilizes an iterative technique where each waveform is defined symbolically and solved using the integral function in MATLAB. Initial values are assumed and an iterative process is implemented to quickly arrive at the desired results. The second method (finite difference method) expresses the circuit equations using differential equations and solves them simultaneously using finite difference technique. The results of the theoretical analysis is then compared to a commercial circuit simulation software program (Spectre ©) as well as to a low frequency hardware circuit utilizing discrete components. The presented analysis is shown to accurately model the high frequency simulation as well as the actual hardware circuit with the results discussed...|$|E
