40|$|Effects {{of three}} {{planting}} patterns; two-row-planting high density (25 plants·m(- 2)), two-row-planting low density (12. 5 plants·m(- 2)), and four-row-planting (25 plants·m(- 2)) on the <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> number {{and quality of}} spray carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.) cv. ‘Barbara’ and ‘Cherry Tessino’ grown by fertigation cultivation were investigated. In ‘Barbara’, {{there was no difference}} in total <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> number between two-row-planting high density and four-row-planting. Total <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> number of two-row-planting low density decreased to 60 % of two-row-planting high density or four-row-planting. In ‘Cherry Tessino’, the total <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> number of two-row-planting high density was 15 % more than that of four-row-planting. The total <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> number of two-row-planting low density decreased to 60 ~ 70 % of two-row-planting high density or four-row-planting. There was no difference in <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> quality between two-row-planting high density and four-row-planting in both cultivars. <b>Cut</b> <b>flower</b> weight and stem diameter of two-row-planting low density increased compared to those of two-row-planting high density or four-row-planting.

5|$|For {{commercial}} use, varieties with {{a minimum}} stem length of 30cm are sought, making them ideal for <b>cut</b> <b>flowers.</b> Florists require blooms that only open when they reach the retail outlet. For garden plants the objectives are to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms, {{and there is a}} particular demand for miniature varieties. The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than the wild types. The main species used in breeding are N. bulbocodium, N. cyclamineus, N. jonquilla, N. poeticus, N. pseudonarcissus, N. serotinus and N. tazetta.|$|E
5|$|For <b>cut</b> <b>flowers,</b> bulbs {{larger than}} 12cm in size are preferred. To bloom in December, bulbs are {{harvested}} in June to July, dried, stored {{for four days}} at 34°C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20°C and then placed in cold storage for precooling at 9 degrees for about 15–16 weeks. The bulbs are then planted in light compost in crates in a greenhouse for forcing at 13°C–15°C and the blooms appear in 19–30 days.|$|E
5|$|For potted flowers a lower {{temperature}} {{is used for}} precooling (5°C for 15 weeks), followed by 16°C–18°C in a greenhouse. For later blooming (mid- and late-forcing), bulbs are harvested in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted, being stored a 17–20°C after harvesting and placed in cold storage at 9°C in September for 17–18 (<b>cut</b> <b>flowers)</b> or 14–16 (potted flowers) weeks. The bulbs can then be planted in cold frames, and then forced in a greenhouse according to requirements.|$|E

5|$|Narcissi are now {{popular as}} {{ornamental}} plants for gardens, parks and as <b>cut</b> <b>flowers,</b> providing colour {{from the end}} of winter to the beginning of summer in temperate regions. They {{are one of the most}} popular spring flowers and one of the major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops, being produced both for their bulbs and <b>cut</b> <b>flowers,</b> though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than the area of commercial production. Over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers. They are normally sold as dry bulbs to be planted in late summer and autumn. They are one of the most economically important ornamental plants. Plant breeders have developed some daffodils with double, triple, or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments. Many of the breeding programs have concentrated on the corona (trumpet or cup), in terms of its length, shape, and colour, and the surrounding perianth or even as in varieties derived from N. poeticus a very reduced form.|$|E

The Netherland produces about 2,200 million lily bulbs annually, of which 96% is used domestically and the remainder exported, principally within the European Union. One particularly important crop is the production of Lilium longiflorum, whose white flowers are associated with purity and Easter.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxicity}} of Narcissus varies with species, N. poeticus being more toxic than N. pseudonarcissus, for instance. The distribution of toxins within the plant also varies, for instance {{there is a}} five times higher concentration of alkaloid in the stem of N. papyraceus than in the bulb, making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume the stem than the bulb, and {{is part of the}} plant's defence mechanisms. The distribution of alkaloids within tissues may also reflect defence against parasites. The bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants, including roses, rice, and cabbages, inhibiting growth. For instance placing <b>cut</b> <b>flowers</b> in a vase alongside other flowers shortens the life of the latter.|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{to improve the quality}} of chrysanthemum, this {{research}} is to explore the quality change of chrysanthemum <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> under various amount of compression deformation and period of transportation as well as its relaxation and creeping behavor. By knowing information about compression effects, one can control the bud transformation and find the best size packing in practice. The results showed that the longer chrysanthemum <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> was in the post-harvest process, the more broken leaves it had, the shorter its flowers and leaves lasted, and smaller its blossoms were. It was also showed that the amount of brokeneaves increased and the size of blossoms decreased when chrysanthemum <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> was packed in the lower layers of packages. The force relaxation of chrysanthemum <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> was predicted by a Generalized Maxwell model which consisted of three parallel Maxwell elements. According to an equation of chrysanthemum <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> force relaxation, it was predicted that in the condition of 10 mm deformation, the relaxation force of chrysanthemum <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> buds would became " 0 " after 15 hours. Thus, the beginning deformation would become permanent. Therefore, for the lower layer packages of chrysanthemumcut flower, its allowable amount of deformation should be the added value of the beginning deformation and its deformation during the saving period cause by its creeping behavior. In the case of chrysanthemum <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> with an average weight of 60 g, its deformation was 1. 52 mm after saving for 12 days. Since the allowable deformation for chrysanthemum buds was 5 mm, the beginning deformation should be less than 3. 84 mm. So, for a package of 200 pieces of chrysanthemum cutflower, the best height of its package should be 26. 8 cm. 菊花栽培與外銷為台灣中部地區一項重要的產業，本研究主要目的在於探 討台灣地區輸日菊花在現行包裝儲運過程中，菊花花苞在不同的壓縮量與 不同儲運時間下之品質變化，以及菊花花苞受壓縮後之負荷鬆弛與潛變現 象，以控制花苞之變形量，求取最佳之包裝紙箱尺寸，以改善菊花外銷品 質。根據本研究顯示，外銷菊花在現行儲運方式下，破損葉片數、葉片壽 命、花朵壽命、花朵開度等各項品質指標均隨儲存時間之延長呈顯著下降 趨勢，且位於紙箱下層之菊花其破損葉片數量較上層有極顯著之增加，花 朵開度方面較上層亦有顯著之減小。菊花花苞之負荷鬆弛特性可用三個馬 克斯威爾元件並聯所組成的一般化馬克斯威爾模式來預測。根據所得之負 荷鬆弛特性方程式預測，菊花花苞在 10 mm變形量之下，經過 15 小時以後， 其內部應力將降為"零"，因此裝箱時之初始變形量都將成為永久變形，因 此最下層菊花花苞可容許之最大變形量，應為裝箱時之初始壓縮變形量與 下層菊花於儲存期間，因潛變因素所增加之變形量兩者之總和。以單枝平 均重量 60 g之菊花為例，冷藏儲存 12 天後，菊花花苞因潛變因素所導致之 變形量為 1. 52 mm，而菊花花苞容許之最大變形量為 5 mm，因此在裝箱時菊 花花苞之最大可容許壓縮變形量應為 3. 84 mm，故每箱 200 支菊花之包裝方 式，其紙箱之最佳高度應為 26. 8 cm...|$|R

5|$|Historical {{accounts}} suggest narcissi {{have been}} cultivated {{from the earliest}} times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily on the Netherlands. Today narcissi are popular as <b>cut</b> <b>flowers</b> and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, narcissi are classified into divisions, covering {{a wide range of}} shapes and colours. Like other members of their family, narcissi produce a number of different alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Long celebrated in art and literature, narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring. The daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of the wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.|$|E
