5000|$|Naturally, {{their first}} thought was [...] "I wonder whether we could get some of these Troddlers to clear up for us whilst we maybe have a little snooze!" [...] They were both in such a rush {{to be the first}} to get at the Troddlers that they ripped the box and spilled Troddlers powder in their <b>cleaning</b> <b>bucket.</b> There were bubbles, ripples, and then {{splashes}} and jets of water as the powder turned into Troddlers who burst out of the bucket and all over the floor. There were hundreds of them. The Troddlers, who apparently have animal-like minds, instinctively began walking toward a teleporter (which appeared to be a little door) at the far end of the storeroom as if they were hypnotized. Hokus and Pokus had no idea what to do.|$|E

50|$|On {{the third}} of September, Axel could not find Barbro anywhere. He searched around and {{eventually}} finds her {{on the banks of}} a stream. He wonders what has happened the child Barbro was pregnant with. According to her, she had been near the stream collecting juniper twigs for <b>cleaning</b> <b>buckets</b> when suddenly, she slipped into the river {{at the same time she}} was to give birth. It was too late as the baby had already succumbed to drowning. Axel went to look for the infant and found it under a heap of moss and twigs wrapped in a cloth. He ran home for a shovel to bury the body properly. Axel and Barbro argued as she continued to claim that the baby drowned when she accidentally slipped into the water. Barbro, in the heat of the argument, confessed that she had once killed another baby and threw it off a boat. That winter, Barbro went to the village to visit the dentist. Axel had no faith in her returning and as he predicted, she had gone to Bergen, another large city, to stay.|$|R
5000|$|Relief Supplies {{formulated}} {{six different}} kits that are sent around the world. Bedding Kits consist of 2 bed sheets, 2 pillow cases, and 2 pillows. <b>Cleaning</b> <b>Buckets</b> contain 17 different items to assist people in cleaning after a flood or hurricane. Health Kits, as described above, provide hygiene supplies to areas where basic sanitary items are unaffordable or unavailable. Layette kits {{are made of}} diapers, baby clothing, and blankets which are {{designed to meet the}} basic non-medical supplies needed directly after childbirth. School Kits are assembled with scissors, paper, a ruler, pencil sharpener, pencils, crayons and an eraser. They are designed to promote learning in areas where educational buildings and supplies are scarce or nonexistent. The final kit that Relief Supplies creates and distributes is the Sewing Kit. Sewing Kits provide recipients with three yards of fabric, scissors, needles, threads, and buttons. Sewing kits are intended to help people learn to create their own clothing instead of simply supplying garments. This kit also promotes cultural preservation by allowing recipients to sew clothing in their own cultural styles. Kit contents change periodically.

5000|$|After graduating {{high school}} Pangrazio worked as scenic artist for a {{television}} network, {{which was a}} euphemistic term for [...] "bucket boy", as {{he was charged with}} <b>cleaning</b> paint <b>buckets,</b> dirty brushes and other menial tasks. He subsequently performed these tasks for a small Hollywood effects studio, before he met Joe Johnston of Industrial Light & Magic. It was through him that he was hired in 1978 at ILM. Lacking any experience, conceptual artist and matte painter Ralph McQuarrie taught him the craft of matte painting, a trade he learned in the course of three years.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the principal management factors that influenced bulk milk somatic cell count (BMSCC) and {{total bacterial count}} (TBC) of smallholder dairy farms in the 10 th region of Chile. One hundred and fifty smallholder milk producers were selected randomly from 42 milk collection centres (MCCs). In April and May of 2002, all farms were visited and a detailed interview questionnaire on dairy-cow management related to milk quality was conducted. In addition, the BMSCC and TBC results from the previous 2 months' fortnightly tests {{were obtained from the}} MCCs. The mean BMSCC and TBC were used as the dependent variables in the analyses and were normalised by a natural-logarithm transformation (LN). All independent management variables were categorised into binary outcomes and present (= 1) was compared with absent (= 0). Biserial correlations were calculated between the LNBMSCC or LNTBC and the management factors of the smallholder farms. Management factors with correlations with P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 20 were entered into the linear multiple regression models and backward elimination was used to exclude non-significant (P > 0. 05) factors. A random MCC effect was included in the models to investigate the importance of clustering of herds within MCC. In the null model for mean LNTBC, the random effect of MCCs was highly significant. It was explained by: milk collected once a day or less compared with collection twice a day, not <b>cleaning</b> the <b>bucket</b> after milking mastitic cows versus <b>cleaning</b> the <b>bucket</b> and cooling milk in a vat of water versus not cooling milk or using ice or a bulk tank to cool milk. Other factors that increased the LNTBC were a waiting yard with a soil or gravel floor versus concrete, use of plastic buckets for milking instead of metal, not feeding California mastitis test (CMT) -positive milk to calves and cows of dual-purpose breed. The final model explained 35 % of the variance. The model predicted that a herd that complied with all the management practices had a mean predicted TBC of 105 colony forming units (cfu) /ml, whereas a herd that did not comply with any of these management factors had a predicted TBC of 59 x 109 cfu/ml. The model of mean LNBMSCC explained 18 % of the variance; the random effect of MCC was not significant. Management factors that decreased the mean LNBMSCC were: using the CMT for 1 year versus using the test for more than 1 year or not at all, absence of a concrete waiting yard, not filtering the milk or using filters other than a plastic sieve to filter the milk, milking cows with mastitis last, and sometimes or always examining the udder before milking. A herd that complied with all of these management factors had a BMSCC of approximately 46, 166 cells/ml, whereas a herd that did not comply with any of the management practices above had a mean BMSCC of 2 x 10 (6) cells/ml.

40|$|International audienceCEA LIST and AREVA {{have been}} jointly {{developing}} telerobotic devices for 15 years to perform force feedback remote handling tasks in the AREVA La Hague used fuel recycling plant hot-cells. This article first reviews the technological developments involved: The generic Cartesian telerobotics software TAO 2000 and the rad-hardened force sensor and multiplexer. We then discuss {{the experience of}} several maintenance campaigns of the dissolver wheel with the telerobot Stäubli RX TAO (using the Stäubli RX as a slave arm) and the specification of a new maintenance operation (<b>bucket</b> <b>cleaning).</b> The promising first operational results of the through-the-wall telescopic telerobot MT 200 TAO [4] (a motorized version of the MT 200 La Calhène cable-driven mechanical slave arm) in regular production tasks, are also presented. We conclude on the undergoing industrialization of these equipments by AREVA and its awaited benefits on the existing and future hot cell operations and design...|$|R
5000|$|In 1958, the {{collective}} farm named Stalin joined that of Petrovsky. At that time, {{the collective}} farm named Petrovsky had 2 trucks GAZ-51 (drivers Pylypenko Mykola Okafiyovych and Kolesnik Dmitri Tihonovich), 25 oxen, 100 horses (the horse team was there {{where is the}} house 145 in Postniy street now [...] ). They took tractors from MTS. The collective farm land amounted to 3200-3500 hectares.In the period 1954 - 1959 years {{the chairman of the}} collective farm was Barylchenko Ivan P., awarded in 1958 the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. During this time the villagers built the double and four-row cow-houses (the head of dairy farms was Dorozhon A.S), a garage, put up water pipes (before this they carried water with milkmaid's yokes from three wells). The collective farmer's working day lasted 12 hours (from 7 am to 7 pm). They worked hard on fields, farms, corn floors. In arid 1954 farmers got 200 grams of bread for 1 workday unit, and in 1955 they sewed their clothes of cloak-tents. In 1956 the kolkhoz farmers passed 150 tons of apples to the State and in 1957-1958 years the collective farm named [...]Petrovsky {{was one of the best}} to deliver the meat (pork) to the State and already had 20 hectares of garden area. A calf-woman Nina Sydorivna Gatsenko received the [...] "Order of Honor". She had a group of 30 calves and carried food and water for them with <b>buckets,</b> <b>cleaning</b> calves by hand. And thanks to it weight of calves reached 800-1000 grams per day.|$|R
