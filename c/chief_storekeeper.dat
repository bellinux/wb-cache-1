50|$|Ann Siang Hill, located off South Bridge Road, was {{the site}} of the house and estate of Chia Ann Siang (谢安祥; 1832 - 1892), a wealthy Malacca-born Hokkien Chinese sawmiller. Chia joined British firm Boustead and Company (now known as Boustead Singapore today) in 1848. The company traded in natural resources, spices, coconut, tobacco, tin, tea and silk. Boustead's ships plied the China-Europe routes in the early days. After eight years on the job, Chia was {{promoted}} to <b>chief</b> produce <b>storekeeper.</b> He retired in 1890 after over 40 years of service in the company, and went into the timber business. He also became a partner of the firm Geok Teat and Company in 1863. After he became a wealthy landowner and one of the leading merchants of his time, he acquired both Ann Siang Hill and Mount Erskine.|$|R
50|$|On 13 January 1945 <b>Chief</b> <b>Storekeeper</b> H. G. Williamson {{reported}} on board Blue Ridge. He was an escaped prisoner of war, having been {{captured by the}} Japanese on 18 January 1942, while attached to the Naval Air Station at Cavite. He had escaped on 15 March 1942 and had remained in hiding near San Fabian since then. Williamson was returned to duty at the Naval Base and Blue Ridge departed Lingayen Gulf on 15 January 1945. The ship continued to serve as Vice Admiral Barbey's flagship at San Pedro Bay and Subic Bay until 8 June 1945. Two days later, Blue Ridge was underway for Saipan and then to Pearl Harbor when she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Jerauld Wright, Commander Amphibious Group Five on 30 June 1945. She hauled down his flag on 20 July and entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for alterations and repairs.|$|E
50|$|When the ROC {{was first}} issued with RAF style uniforms in 1941, the RAF {{was able to}} provide the {{majority}} of the uniform items but held insufficient stocks of RAF blue berets. However, at that time the Army held a surplus of black Royal Tank Regiment berets, therefore the ROC was initially issued with black berets, which remained part of the ROC uniform only until a manufacturer was able to produce the prescribed midnight blue berets, which then remained part of the ROC uniform throughout its history. There was a similar shortage of both Sergeant and Corporal stripes. However, there existed a large surplus of rank badges destined for the quasi-military Royal Canadian (Volunteer) Storekeeper Corps who served in UK dockside warehouses during the Second World War. These badges, displaying horizontal bars within a wreath of laurel leaves, were adopted for the ROC, with <b>Chief</b> <b>Storekeeper</b> becoming Chief Observer and Leading Storekeeper becoming Leading Observer. The four bar rank of Master Storekeeper was discounted initially, but was again under consideration in 1990 as an RAF Warrant Officer equivalent rank styled Master Observer; intended to act as dedicated assistants to Crew, Group and NRC officers. However, the decision on whether to introduce the rank of Master Observer was overtaken by the standing down announcement. (The surplus rank badges destined for the Royal Canadian (Volunteer) Storekeeper Corps were also used by the United States' Civilian Technical Corps, who were based in the UK during the Second World War).|$|E

Dear Members of the Bryant Service Club, I {{shall have}} to {{apologize}} for my negligence in not writing {{for the past few}} months, but an awful lot has happened since, and I have been more or less 2 ̆ 2 snowed under 2 ̆ 2 with one thing or another. As you will notice, I have been transferred from one extreme to another, that is from a battleship to a tin-can or destroyer, which believe me is quite a contrast, for never did I have to brace myself in a chair or attach a rubber band to the carriage of my typewriter, so that it would move with the sway of the ship, on the old COLORADO. Due to my change of address, I haven 2 ̆ 7 t received and [sic] Bryant Service News or 2 ̆ 2 On The Campus 2 ̆ 2 bulletins for some time, so your club activities are somewhat strange to me at present, consequently, I do so hope that you will record my new address in your files. I do wish to thank you one and all for a package of candy that I recently received, which just about went half way around the world and back home again, and from therein forwarded back to me, somewhere in the Pacific, despite all this handling and subjection to various temperatures, the package as well as the candy stood up very well, so someone is to be commended. As to my new duty, I can truthfully say, that I like it a great deal, since a person has an opportunity to do work with much morediversion, for instance, here we have a little office, though terribly crowded, since warships utilize space for more important reasons than just offices now, however, it serves as a Disbursing Office, Supply Office, and Commissary Office, whereas on the previous ship, why these were all individual. In this respect, one is able to learn every phase of his work, much more readily. An item of passing interest, may be that I have recently changed uniforms to that of a Chief Petty officer or <b>Chief</b> <b>Storekeeper,</b> which decidedly has it[s] advantages in a good many respects. If Mr. Handy should see this letter, he would be astonished at the number of errors in grammar, punctuation, etc., however, I {{shall have to}} attribute it to the adverse conditions under which I am working, trusting that he will make allowances for this. There are so many items of interest that I would like to relate to you, but are all to be classed as military secrets, so far be it for me to try to circumvent our censorship regulations, however, I suppose it 2 ̆ 7 s permissable to say that you may be quite certain that the LAWS will be in there pitching, doing her utmost to make the foe feel the full fury of our attacking forces, whenever opportunity arises. In conclusion, thanks again for the package and sincere best wishes to you one and all from the branch of the Navy that 2 ̆ 2 Hits hard and travels fast. 2 ̆ 2 Most sincerely, 2 ̆ 2 Charlie 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 Charlie 2 ̆ 2 (for the censor) Charles E. Tumidajski, CSK, USN. U. S. S. LAWS (DD 558) c/o F. P. O. San Francisco, Calif. P. S.
