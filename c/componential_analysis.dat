40|$|Set-based {{analysis}} (SBA) produces good {{predictions about}} the behavior of functional and objectoriented programs. The analysis proceeds by inferring constraints that characterize the data flow relationships of the analyzed program. Experiences with MrSpidey, a static debugger based on SBA, indicate that SBA can adequately deal with programs of up {{to a couple of}} thousand lines of code. SBA fails, however, to cope with larger programs because it generates systems of constraints that are at least linear, and possibly quadratic, {{in the size of the}} analyzed program. This article presents theoretical and practical results concerning methods for reducing the size of constraint systems. The theoretical results include a proof-theoretic characterization of the observable behavior of constraint systems for program components, and a complete algorithm for deciding the observable equivalence of constraint systems. In the course of this development we establish a close connection between the observable equivalence of constraint systems and the equivalence of regular-tree grammars. We then exploit this connection to adapt a variety of algorithms for simplifying grammars to the problem of simplifying constraint systems.

In addition, the researcher also differentiates the conceptual meaning and the new meaning of words in film making terms. In this research, the researcher applies descriptive qualitative method fom Isaac and Michael (1971 : 42), in order to explain {{the result of the}} research. The <b>componential</b> meaning <b>analysis</b> from Palmer (1981 : 111) is used to figure out the characteristic of word. The data of the analysis are all words of the film making terms obtained from Kamus Istilah Film Populer by Nisrina Lubis (2009). In collecting data, the researcher uses documentation method from Arikunto (1983 : 18), because the data are taken from printed media. The method of collecting data was continued by applying a note taking technique from Sudaryanto to classify the data. In addition, the purposive sampling is used because the samples taken randomly from the population according to particular criteria based on purpose of the research. The result shows four types of meaning change occured in film making terms, that are, generalization, specialization, pejoration, and amelioration. The researcher concludes that generalization and specialization are the common types of meaning change because the majority of word in film making terms have neutral sense and do not includes as a methapor, so words do undergo two types of meaning. In addition, the discussion on the factors facilitating the meaning change shows that there are five factors that generates the meaning change, they are scientific words, needs new meaning, taboo, vagueness in meaning, and loss of motivation because they represent all factors that is mentioned by Palmer’theory and Ulmann’theory. ...|$|R

This approach is called <b>componential</b> <b>analysis,</b> also known as semantic decomposition.

They differentiate each term based on what the object that causes smell is. This research is aimed at describing the semantic analysis of smell terms in Javanese. By using Lyon’s theory that is supported by the other linguists, this research shows semantic field of smell terms in Javanese and their definitions. In addition, <b>componential</b> meaning <b>analysis</b> (Nida, 1975) is used to know the differences of each term and find the meaning relations of it. 	This research uses a descriptive qualitative method (Moleong, 2007) as it describes smell terms in Javanese. In collecting the data, the researcher uses documentation technique (Mardalis, 2003) because the data that is related to the research is taken from Kamus Lengkap Bahasa Jawa (Sudarmanto, 2008). Meanwhile, the researcher uses total / jenuh sampling (Sugiyono, 1999) to be able to show differences among each words of Javanese smell terms clearly. In analyzing the data, teknik perluas or expansion method (Sudaryanto, 1993) is used to see how the word is grammatical or not if it is expanded. In addition, the researcher also uses substitution method (Sudaryanto, 1993) to see the substituted part is suitable with the data or not. 	From the analysis, the researcher finds twenty-nine smell terms in Javanese that can be categorized into pleasant and unpleasant smell terms. In general, the difference among those terms is on their collocation. Moreover, the researcher also finds the meaning relations, such as: hyponymy, synonymy, and antonymy. All smell terms can be grouped into five synonymy, one antonym, and two kinds of hypernymy and hyponymy. Synonymy is the meaning relation that is mostly appeared in Javanese smell terms. It is because some words almost have same semantic components, such as meaning, usage, collocation, etc. The difference things is usually in the Javanese speech level whether it is krama or ngoko level. ...|$|R

5000|$|Logical {{positivism}} {{asserts that}} structural semantics {{is the study}} of relationships between the meanings of terms within a sentence, and how meaning can be composed from smaller elements. However, some critical theorists suggest that meaning is only divided into smaller structural units via its regulation in concrete social interactions; outside of these interactions, language may become meaningless.Structural semantics is that branch that marked the modern linguistics movement started by Ferdinand de Saussure at the break of the 20th century in his posthumous discourse titled [...] "Cours De Linguistique Generale" [...] (A Course in General Linguistics). He posits that language is a system of inter-related units and structures and that every unit of language is related to the others within the same system. His position later became the bedding ground for other theories such as <b>componential</b> <b>analysis</b> and relational predicates. Structuralism is a very efficient aspect of Semantics, as it explains the concordance in the meaning of certain words and utterances.

Ethnographic ethnoscience uses similar classification systems for cultural domains like ethnobotany and ethnoanatomy.

Approximately 5 %- 10 % of individuals diagnosed with LTBI are at risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB) disease; the highest risk occurs within two years following the diagnosis. Burmese refugees face a high potential of developing LTBI during resettlement in the U. S. and are at high risk for subsequent TB. Currently, we have limited knowledge of the Burmese Chin refugees' explanatory model (EM) of LTBI. Understanding the EM of these refugees is important because one's EM facilitates the recognition and response to illness, including early diagnosis and treatment. In the context of LTBI, this relates to the potential prevention of active TB disease. The purpose of this ethnographic study was to discover the Burmese Chin refugees' EM of LTBI and to describe the barriers experienced in receiving LTBI treatment. Kleinman's EM provided a conceptual framework to guide this study. A Burmese refugee gatekeeper assisted with community immersion and participant recruitment. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit participants. Data were collected through participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Three data analysis strategies for ethnography that were used included domain, taxonomic, and <b>componential</b> analyses. Domain <b>analysis</b> began after open, inductive coding of the data.

The analysis revealed the participants' language, behavior patterns, beliefs, values and health seeking experiences of LTBI in the U. S.
