60|$|Up {{the steep}} hill behind them came the puffing and groaning {{of a small}} motor-car. They both turned their heads to watch it come into view. It was an {{insignificant}} affair of an almost extinct pattern, a single <b>cylinder</b> <b>machine</b> with a round tonneau back. The engine was knocking badly as the driver brought it to a standstill {{a few yards away}} from them. Involuntarily Tavernake stiffened as he saw the two men who descended from it, and who were already passing through the gate close to where they were. One was Mr. Dowling, the other the manager of the bank where they kept their account. Mr. Dowling recognized his manager with surprise but much cordiality.|$|E

50|$|There is a Cumbria Coalition of Motorcycle Clubs.

50|$|Another type {{forming section}} is the <b>cylinder</b> mould <b>machine</b> using a mesh-covered {{rotating}} cylinder partially {{immersed in a}} tank of fibre slurry in the wet end to form a paper web, giving a more random distribution of the cellulose fibres. <b>Cylinder</b> <b>machines</b> can form a sheet at higher consistency, which gives a more three dimensional fibre orientation than lower consistencies, resulting in higher calliper (thickness) and more stiffness in the machine direction (MD). High MD stiffness is useful in food packaging like cereal boxes and other boxes like dry laundry detergent.|$|R
50|$|During the First World War the Shuttle was an {{invaluable}} means to get messages from families {{at home to}} the soldiers on the battlefields, and also stories and pictures of men at war were published.

5000|$|Wooler was a British {{manufacturer}} of motorcycles and automobiles, founded by engineer John Wooler in 1911 based in Alperton, Middlesex. The company became {{known for its}} unconventional designs which included several fore-and-aft twins, a vertical camshaft single <b>cylinder</b> <b>machine,</b> a transverse-four beam engine, and a transverse flat four. Most machines possessed Wooler's enduring design features of a petrol tank which extended past the steering head.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, Honda {{developed}} a radically new V4 NSR500 that featured {{the fuel tank}} under the engine and the expansion chambers under a false tank above the engine. Teething problems and injuries from crashes hindered Spencer's defense of his crown and he was relegated to fourth place in the championship.

50|$|The 400 {{class was}} a 4-cylinder 4-6-0 steam locomotive, these, the only 4 cylindered {{locomotives}} in Ireland, {{were not a}} success.

50|$|In 2000, the British {{inventor}} James Dyson {{launched the}} CR01 ContraRotator, {{a type of}} washing machine with two cylinders rotating in opposite directions. It was claimed that this design reduced the wash time and produced cleaner washing than a single <b>cylinder</b> <b>machine.</b> In 2004 there was {{the launch of the}} CR02, which was the first washing machine to gain the British Allergy Foundation Seal of Approval. However, neither of the ContraRotator machines are now in production as they were too expensive to manufacture.|$|E

It was also used on the LE Velocette, a motorcycle he sketched during his war years at the company.

5000|$|Even though market {{research}} showed that people wouldn’t {{be happy with}} a transparent container for the dust, Dyson and his team {{decided to make a}} transparent container anyway and {{this turned out to be}} a popular and enduring feature which has been heavily copied. The DC01 became the biggest selling vacuum cleaner in the UK in just 18 months. By 2001, the DC01 made up 47% of the upright vacuum cleaner market.The company introduced a <b>cylinder</b> <b>machine,</b> the DC02, and produced a number of special editions and revised models (DC02 Absolute, DC02 De Stijl, DC05, DC04, DC06, DC04 Zorbster). On 2 January 2001 the company name was shortened from Dyson Appliances Ltd. to simply Dyson Ltd. In April of that year the DC07, a new upright vacuum cleaner using [...] "Root Cyclone" [...] technology with seven cyclone funnels instead of the original dual-cyclone design, was launched. By 2009 Dyson began creating other technologies: the AirBlade hand dryer, the Air Multiplier [...] "bladeless" [...] fan and Dyson Hot, the [...] "bladeless" [...] fan heater.|$|E

30|$|ZR {{arrived in}} Italy in 1986, and {{has engaged in}} catering, bags, and other industries. He {{acquired}} basic Italian fluency when waiting tables. In subsequent years he brought his mother and siblings to Italy. In 1993, influenced by his brother-in-law, he came to Prato {{and went into the}} clothing business. “I had a state of mind of fear. I had never seen the clothes, and I could only constantly ask and constantly learn.” Fortunately many of ZR’s classmates and relatives were already in Prato. Coupled with ZR’s own efforts to learn, the garment factory achieved resounding success in one year. Recalling his original intention to go abroad, ZR stated, “My family had difficulties, then I wanted to go abroad to change the living conditions for my family. When I first came I was really frustrated, and felt like crying a lot. But no matter how hard it was I was very happy. … When I was in Prato, very few people understood the language. Sometimes my relatives and fellows got sick or needed to give birth; we went to the hospital and they did not understand anything. No matter how tired I was, I went to the hospital with them. The hospital staff all knew me.” A strong sense of responsibility and commitment to family became ZR’s motivation to continuously learn and constantly create value for twenty years. His reputation among his peers also helped ZR acquire critical information in many industries. ZR “started everything from a mere factory worker, learned to use the line trimmer, the double <b>cylinder</b> <b>machine,</b> thanks to his own efforts to learn.” With the dedication and talent, ZR soon learned clothing techniques and industry terminology and rapidly became able to work independently. “I love to learn more than others, always willing to learn. When I was working in Milan, I learned all the basic terminology from different restaurants; later when I opened up the garment factory I slowly learned the terminology in clothing also. If I want to settle down here, I at least need to speak some simple Italian. I used the restaurant experience to communicate with foreigners, and received a good client.” In addition, ZR also stated,” I hold the bar high for all employees; that’s why foreigners like to work with us. The company’s decoration is also completely different than others. Standardized decoration, good management practices—only by keeping up with these will foreigners trust us.” His advantage in language makes it easier for ZR to build trust with Italian customers. Continuous improvement of daily management helped his factory expand rapidly. ZR gained recognition outside of his network community due to continuous learning of existing industry knowledge; his strong sense of responsibility stems from strong ties outside of the network that promoted rapid trust building.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cylinder</b> <b>machines</b> of {{the late}} 1880s and the 1890s were usually sold with {{recording}} attachments. The ability to record as well as play back sound was an advantage of cylinder phonographs over the competition from cheaper disc record phonographs which began to be mass-marketed {{at the end of}} the 1890s, as the disc system machines can be used only to play back prerecorded sound.|$|R

30|$|The {{previous}} {{studies show that}} the best experimental parameters' combination to be considered is a 0.163 A current value and 830  s as attack time. Those conditions give samples with a reflectivity of about 3 %. In order to reduce this reflectivity, we decided to consider a trap geometrical cavity in which the incident radiation must undergo many reflections before escaping from the detector (Figure  7). In this sense, we choose a design of the absorbing cavity like a <b>cylinder</b> <b>machined</b> at an angle of α.|$|R
50|$|Superbike {{racing is}} the {{category}} of motorcycle road racing that employs modified production motorcycles. Superbike racing motorcycles must have four stroke engines of between 800 cc and 1200 cc for twins, and between 750 cc and 1000 cc for four <b>cylinder</b> <b>machines.</b> The motorcycles must maintain the same profile as their roadgoing counterparts.

When the locomotives were rebuilt they became two <b>cylinder</b> <b>machines,</b> and the majority had split footplates, none looked were completely alike to another. For example, No. 401 had a split footplate, while No. 402 had a flush footplate. No. 406 had a flush footplate a far as its cylinders, as the cylinders were higher {{than the rest of}} the footplate, they proved far more reliable after their rebuilding, and gave many good years of service to the GSR and CIE.|$|R
