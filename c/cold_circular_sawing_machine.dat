50|$|The name carbide saw {{came from}} the tool, a <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, with silver {{soldered}} carbide tips. It competed with and just about replaced, solid or segmental HSS blades, because carbide is much harder than HSS. Before HSS saws were developed, abrasive, friction or hot saws were used and are still manufactured for certain applications. These processes create heat and are therefore called hot saws. However, HSS blades use coolant and the cut surfaces don’t get hot, thus called cold saws. With the unique geometry of the teeth of carbide <b>circular</b> <b>saws,</b> the heat, developed by the cutting process is transferred into the chips and carried away with the chips. The cut surfaces stay cool. Therefore, carbide saws were also called cold saws. Other names include <b>cold</b> cut <b>saws,</b> <b>cold</b> <b>circular</b> <b>saws,</b> <b>cold</b> cut off <b>saws</b> or <b>circular</b> <b>cold</b> <b>saws.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} paper explores {{the design of}} an automatic safety brake mechanism on a manual <b>circular</b> table <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> which stops the blade from rotating when human flesh is detected in the blade proximity. Fatal injuries are occurring, human thumbs and entire hand cutting during operation when operator accidentally touches the spinning blade. It has {{become a matter of}} concern to develop the safety mechanism which can be retrofitted on old-model table <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> used to train students at a university wood workshop. The researchers made use of capacitive proximity sensors to detect human flesh and then automatically activate the brake pawl to the rotating blade, D.

The design procedure confirmed the quick release of the safety mechanism within 0. 25 seconds as revealed from the simulation of circuits in Proteus software. With this design it is possible to stop the spinning blade in 0. 25 seconds, before the operator touches the spinning blade and also the mechanism is adoptable to all <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> (panel <b>saw,</b> bench saws), thus making a work-safe environment on the <b>circular</b> <b>saws...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{industrial}} revolution was manifested in {{new kinds of}} transportation installations, such as railways, canals and macadam roads. These required large amounts of investment. New construction devices included steam engines, machine tools, explosives and optical surveying.

40|$|Deck and {{stringer}} boards’ manufacturing {{for wood}} pallet production requires complex management {{due to the}} variability of the logs used as raw material. An analysis was carried out on a representative sawmill in north-eastern Italy; the manufacturing line was composed of a band-saw, a cut-saw and a multi <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> connected by rollers and belts conveyors provided with buffers. A discrete event simulation model was built in order to investigate the possible inﬂuence of the variability of log diameter and of the productive layout on the actual production level. The simulations showed that the major advantage could come from an improvement in the layout, identifying the cut-saw machine as the main bottleneck of the manufacturing line. By adopting a different cutsaw machine, the productivity of the manufacturing line could increase up to+ 56 % in the daily production of deck and stringer boards showing an increased daily productive time of + 13 %.

40|$|In the {{classical}} approach, energetic effects (cutting forces and cutting power) of wood sawing process are generally calculated {{on the basis}} of the specifi c cutting resistance, which is in the case of wood cutting the function of more or less important factors. On the other hand, the cutting forces (power) problem may be tackled with an innovative, up-to-date fundamental analysis of the mechanics of sawing based on modern fracture mechanics. This line of attack is an improvement on traditional approaches for cutting forces and power, many of which are empirical and based upon limited information. Such formulae do not permit generalisation to new conditions of operation of sawmills, such as e. g. the use of narrow-kerf blades. The presented algebraic model, for cutting power determination while sawing, in addition to timber ‘strength’ and friction between tool and workpiece, takes into account the property called ‘fracture toughness’ (resistance to cracking), which is a vital ingredient. Furthermore, forecasting of the shear plane angle with this model is achievable even for small values of uncut chips. Moreover, the mentioned model is a universal one, and useful for determination of energetic effects of sawing of every kinematics such as: frame <b>sawing</b> <b>machines,</b> bandsawing <b>machines</b> and <b>circular</b> <b>sawing</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Nickel-based alloys can be {{machined}} using techniques {{similar to}} those employed to cut ferrous materials, however, additional requirements are imposed due to the poor machinability of these alloys. Through a series of cutting tests, the authors have applied techniques to optimise the cutting conditions for high speed steel <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades <b>machining</b> materials from three principal categories of nickel-based alloy. The current paper considers the resultant wear mechanisms and the suitability of these tools for this application. Cutting tests were undertaken in which Cupro 107, Inconel 600 L 1 and Nimonic PK 31 1 workpieces were machined over a range of cutting speeds and feeds to determine the optimum cutting conditions. Test results showed considerable variation in blade performance when cutting these materials. These variations were reflected {{in the rate of}} wear and the predominant wear mechanisms associated with the machining of each material. Since both tool and material costs are high, identification of the dominant wear mechanisms is of importance to both manufacturing engineer and end-user when assessing the suitability of using <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades for this application, and when selecting the cutting conditions to maximise tool life.

40|$|The thesis investigates optical {{measuring}} {{and statistical}} data processing, and presents {{a method to}} understand and reduce sawing variation by examination of sawn timber sizes. Continuous timber size control offers improved opportunities for analysing <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> or even individual sawblades. The thesis is illustrated with seven <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> case studies {{that relate to the}} development of the technique. Log and cant breakdown is examined in single- and double-arbor <b>circular</b> <b>saws</b> and bandsaws. The first analysis of each <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is made in normal production, and the second using a controlled benchmarking test. A total of 44350 logs were sawn in the study. The behaviour of a <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is described using such descriptors as total, within-board and between-board standard deviations, and sawblade bend. Based on observations in benchmarking, an equation y=αeβx±R, where α and β are constants, R the process reproducibility, and x a variable that expresses sawing time and saw load, can be established for each of the <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> descriptors. An example is the total standard deviation descriptor function s= 0. 21 e 0. 58 x± 0. 11, established for a single-arbor <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> in a 4 -piece saw set-up. The method will help a sawmill to establish descriptors and equations used to describe the behaviour of their <b>saw</b> <b>machines,</b> to baseline <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> performance and to compare it to best practices in the industry. The descriptors may be used to establish current, short- or long-term capabilities and characteristics. The method can be used to examine various production conditions and tooling, such as effects of log size, feed speed, and sawing time. Other factors include saw speed, sawblade parameters, operation of setworks and feedworks, and effects of seasons. The results of the study show that sawblade behaviour, feedworks and work piece holding problems, and previous <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> may be causes of large sawing variation. reviewe...|$|R

30|$|When <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade {{is cutting}} the work piece, {{tangential}} and radial tensile stresses are produced {{because of the}} centrifugal force generated by the higher rotational speed of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade. Meanwhile, thermal stress is produced because {{the temperature in the}} edge of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade is higher than other regions. The thermal stress will lead to a large tangential compressive stress in the edge of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade with the increase of temperature difference between the edge and center of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, which could cause the buckling deformation of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, reduction of cutting precision and machining quality of the surface, increase of kerf loss and shortening of saw life. The tensioning processes such as hammering, rolling and heating are proposed and applied {{in order to avoid the}} above-mentioned phenomenon. The tangential tensile tensioning stress field is produced during tensioning process in order to compensate the tangential compressive stress, which will improve the stability and quality of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade [1, 2]. Therefore, the tangential tensioning stress distribution after tensioning is the key factor that determines the quality of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade.|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades {{are very}} {{widespread}} in wood machining. They {{are used in}} different batches and sizes and in large quantities from hand tools to large machining centers. Because of this huge range of applications the <b>circular</b> <b>saws</b> have gained great importance in the industry. The rising request to improve the cutting quality, reduce the noise emission and increase the life time requires improvement of the dynamic behavior of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade. The roll tensioning of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade has been empirically established {{as a solution to}} improve the static and dynamic properties of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade. However, there are several influencing parameters for this process that have not yet been studied scientifically accurate. A scientific and economical solution for the study of various roll tensioning parameters is a simulation model based on finite elements method (FEM) that analyzes the effects on the dynamic behavior of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade. A simulation model for roll tensioning of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades was developed in this study. With this simulation model, the residual stresses induced by the roll tensioning can be calculated. The induced residual stresses are actually responsible for the changing of dynamic properties of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, such as the shifting of eigenvalues and reduction of side run out. Furthermore, this simulation model allows the investigation of various roll tensioning parameters. This investigation helps {{to gain a better understanding}} of the relationship between roll tensioning and improvement of dynamic behavior of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades. Furthermore, it helps to determine the optimization potential of the roll tensioning process, which is one of the important stages of the production line of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades...|$|R

In the edge area of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, the tangential tensioning stress was increased with the ratio of radius, and the feasibility of multi-spot pressure tensioning process was theoretically proved.|$|R
30|$|However, {{thermal stress}} is {{produced}} when <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade is working, because the temperature {{at the edge}} of the blade is higher than that in other regions of the blade. It will cause high tangential compressive stress on the edge of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, causing a buckling deformation that reduces cutting precision, increases kerf loss, and shortens the saw’s life [1, 2]. Thin <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade is more easily affected by thermal stress.
