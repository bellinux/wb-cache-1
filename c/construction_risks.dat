40|$|Background: Substantial {{empirical}} {{research has shown}} conflicting results regarding the influence of organizational external factors on <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> management, suggesting the necessity to introduce a moderator into the study. The present research confirmed whether rules and regulations matter on the relationships between organizational external factors and <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> management. Methods: Based on discouragement and organizational control theory, this research {{examined the effects of}} organizational external factors and rules and regulations on <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> management among 238 employees operating in construction companies in Abuja and Lagos, Nigeria. A personally administered questionnaire was used to acquire the data. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results: A significant positive relationship between organizational external factors and <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> management was asserted. This study also found a significant positive relationship between rules and regulations and <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> management. As anticipated, rules and regulations were found to moderate the relationship between organizational external factors and <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> management, with a significant positive result. Similarly, a significant interaction effect was also found between rules and regulations and organizational external factors. Implications of the research from a Nigerian point of view have also been discussed. Conclusion: Political, economy, and technology factors helped the construction companies to reduce the chance of risk occurrence during the construction activities. Rules and regulations also helped to lessen the rate of accidents involving construction workers as well as the duration of the projects. Similarly, the influence of the organizational external factors with rules and regulations on <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> management has proven that most of the construction companies that implement the aforementioned factors have the chance to deliver their projects within the stipulated time, cost, and qualities, which {{can be used as a}} yardstick to measure a good project...|$|R

Methodologically, this research is perhaps the first to assess {{the extent of}} effective <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> management in Abuja Federal capital territory and Lagos state Nigeria.

To {{get better}} {{understanding}} of TBM <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> and avoid it, comprehensive analysis and summary of various factors to TBM <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> were made in three aspects, such as geological and hydrological conditions, TBM equipment, construction team of TBM.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of Building Information Modelling provides a visual and information-rich environment {{to incorporate the}} <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> knowledge {{in the domain of}} safety management. Ontology and semantic web technology offer an opportunity to enable such domain knowledge to be represented semantically. This paper attempts {{to take advantage of the}} strength of BIM, ontology and semantic web technology to establish an ontology-based methodology/framework for <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> knowledge management in BIM environment. The risk knowledge is modelled into an ontology-based semantic network to produce a risk map, from which the interdependences between risks, risk paths can be inferred semantically. Based on the semantic retrieval mechanism, the applicable knowledge is dynamically linked to the specific objects in the BIM environment. Based on the methodology, a prototype system is developed as a tool to facilitate the <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> knowledge management and reuse in hope of indirectly improving the <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> analysis process. A case application is implemented to demonstrate the <b>risk</b> prevention through <b>construction</b> process/method selection, including the risk factors identification, risk paths reasoning and risk prevention plan recommendation. Finally, a questionnaire survey highlights the potential benefits and limitations on the deployment of such system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a model {{based on}} the agency theory to analyze the optimal transfer of <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> in public works contracts. The base assumption {{is that of a}} contract between a principal (public authority) and an agent (firm), where the payment mechanism is linear and contains an incentive mechanism to enhance the effort of the agent to reduce construction costs. A theoretical model is proposed starting from a cost function with a random component and assuming that both the public authority and the firm are risk averse. The main outcome of the paper is that the optimal transfer of <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> will be lower when the variance of errors in cost forecast, the risk aversion of the firm and the marginal cost of public funds are larger, while the optimal transfer of <b>construction</b> <b>risk</b> will grow when the variance of errors in cost monitoring and the risk aversion of the public authority are large...|$|R

40|$|Managing {{risks in}} {{construction}} projects has been acknowledged {{as a key}} direction process {{for the purposes of}} attaining the project goal in terms of time, cost, quality, safety, and environmental sustainability. Hence, the paper evaluated pre-construction and <b>construction</b> <b>risks</b> on active project sites in Abuja-Nigeria. This was achieved using survey method through the self-administration of 35 questionnaires to the professionals handling the 35 identified projects being undertaking at that time. Results showed that errors and omissions in design and improperly defined project scope had mean score values of 3. 03 and 2. 54, respectively, were the <b>construction</b> <b>risks</b> most experienced by the professionals during pre-construction. On the other hand, fluctuation in market prices and delays with mean score values of 3. 14 and 2. 74, respectively, were the <b>construction</b> <b>risks</b> experienced by the professionals during the construction phase of the projects. It is recommended that procurement methods such as construction management should be adopted and stakeholders should keep to their own side of the bargain to avoid unnecessary delays...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} methods of {{managing}} <b>construction</b> <b>risks</b> in the Nigerian construction industry is the insurance method.

Also it identifies, through a questionnaire survey, the various insurable <b>construction</b> <b>risks</b> perceived to be encountered in the Nigerian construction industry and the types of insurance policy employed in managing them. High importance is placed by the construction industry on site security, construction risk, and health and welfare requirements, and the use of an all-risk insurance policy is the most prominent method for managing the identified risks. Finally it is concluded that there is a correlation between insured sum and actual replacement cost when there are losses or damages. However, the insurance claims settled could cater for only 61. 1 % of the replacement cost of on-going construction works studied.

The thesis’ empirical data is made up by texts from the organizations, interviews with Danske Spil and Ludomaniforeningen plus wording of the Act and an article. The theory included in the thesis, is made up by Mark Suchman and Susanne Holmström to define legitimacy, and Paul Slovic and Stephen Hilgartner is included to describe the <b>construction</b> of <b>risk.</b> The thesis takes a pragmatic view on philosophy of science. The purpose of the analysis of <b>risk</b> <b>construction</b> in the thesis {{is to be able}} to assess how <b>risk</b> <b>construction</b> influences the legitimacy of Danske Spil.

For effective construction risk management, the specific work process improvement that can be employed {{in the field in}} terms of risk management of the entire corporation such as financial, insurance and safety management is necessary.
