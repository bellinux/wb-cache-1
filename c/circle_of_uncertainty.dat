In MoA, spatial {{uncertainty is}} defined using the point-radius method, where a site {{is assumed to}} be at the centre of a circle whose radius is the uncertainty u. In both diagrams, d is the Euclidean distance between the MoA estimate of the site's location (blue cross) and the aggregator estimate (red square). The offset o is the distance d minus the uncertainty u. In diagram 1 the aggregator site is within the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> surrounding the MoA site, and the offset is negative.

40|$|In many applications, one {{may need}} to {{characterize}} a given network among a large set of base networks, and these networks are large in size and diverse in structure over the search space. In addition, the characterization algorithms are required to have low volatility and with a small <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> For large datasets, these algorithms are computationally intensive and inefficient. However, under the context of network mining, a major concern of some applications is speed. Hence, we are motivated to develop a fast characterization algorithm, {{which can be used}} to quickly construct a graph space for analysis purpose. Our approach is to transform a network characterization measure, commonly formulated based on similarity matrices, into simple vector form signatures. We shall show that the [Formula: see text] similarity matrix can be represented by a dyadic product of two N-dimensional signature vectors; thus the network alignment process, which is usually solved as an assignment problem, can be reduced into a simple alignment problem based on separate signature vectors...|$|E
40|$|Mercy Amba Oduyoye�s {{untitled}} {{poem about}} a circle sets {{the context for}} the renewal of the legacy <b>of</b> The <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> Concerned African Women Theologians (The Circle) {{at a time when}} The Circle seems to be moving in <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> lacking a clear unified focus. Oduyoye describes a circle as eternal, expansive, evolving and sustained by self-critique, accountability, inclusiveness and connectedness to the reality around it. This continuous movement is expressed in the concept of Sankofa�Kairos which is rooted in the past and radically responsive to the present. This �backward�forward� theological method is critical for The Circle to remain true to its mission as a liberating theological and cultural voice for women and other oppressed groups. In contemporary contexts where oppression is pervasive and includes all groups, an inclusive gender paradigm as well as accountability to oppressed groups is critical for the renewal <b>of</b> The <b>Circle.</b> Trinitarian theology provides a model for liberating relationships characterised by equality, difference, mutuality, communion and oneness. Thus, it will be argued that Trinitarian theology provides theological resources for Sankofa�Kairos theologies for The Circle that will be inclusive and accountable to all oppressed groups. This will contribute to the restoration <b>of</b> The <b>Circle</b> as a critical contributor to liberation theologies in Africa. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This article proposes Sankofa�Kairos methodology based on the dual legacies <b>of</b> The <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> Concerned African Women Theologians and The Kairos Document as the starting point for developing accountable and inclusive liberation theologies rooted in Social Models of the Trinity that could respond to the multiple challenges emerging from the African context.
