40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{forensic}} identification when the trace evidence {{from the scene of}} the crime is imperfect: for example, it might be measured with error, or be partially missing. A general framework for imperfect data is developed, and applied in particular to the following cases, singly and in combination: 'measurement error ' in the recorded information at {{the scene of the crime}}; 'binning', i. e. discretisation of an originally <b>continuous</b> <b>crime</b> measurement; 'paternity testing', in which the DNA profiles of the child and of the mother provide partial information on the true father's DNA; two types of 'laboratory error', one in which the error is equally distributed among all possible results, and a second in which there is a bias in the error mechanism producing a false match; and 'partial data', as when there is information on the offender's DNA profile, but not on his racial group...|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of <b>continuous</b> study of <b>crime</b> statistics, {{emphasizing}} the location and time of commission, the patrolling of the interior areas of the American Zone was modified so as to provide for more frequent visits to disorderly areas than to the relatively quiet localities.|$|R
25|$|To {{struggle}} against the <b>continuous</b> increase of <b>crime</b> and its international aspects and, on the other hand, the increase of the texts and their complexity the Royal Gendarmerie is modernising its methods and equipment continuously and reinforcing its efficiency by evaluating technical and scientific policing and criminal data.|$|R

One example is the song [...] "Skalamientos", which chronicles the <b>continuous</b> rise in <b>crime</b> in Puerto Rico. Other songs addressed subjects like materialism, alcoholism, and homelessness.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the war crime at Article 8 (2) (b) (viii) of the Rome Statute, 'the transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power {{of parts of}} its own civilian population into the territory it occupies', by addressing the doctrinal elements of the provision {{in light of the}} impact which the practice of transfer of Israeli civilians into occupied territory has had on the application of the rule of international law to the broader situation in Palestine. The provision is distinct among war crimes within the Court's jurisdiction as it refers to the activity of a state – the occupying power – in addition to that of the individual perpetrator. This feature reflects the structural issues that the provision was designed to address, and emphasizes that its purpose is not so much to confront direct physical violence, but rather to prevent colonial practices. Despite the political significance of the underlying conduct there has been comparatively little analysis of the war crime itself. Following an overview of how Israel's transfer of civilians into occupied territory challenges international law's distinction between civilian and combatant and has given rise to the charge of apartheid, the paper {{considers the}} drafting history of Article 8 (2) (b) (viii) of the Rome Statute, reflecting on the provision's unusual construction, before reviewing Israel's state responsibility for unlawful transfer, and considering the temporal jurisdiction of the ICC and the nature of continuing and <b>continuous</b> <b>crimes...</b>|$|R

Every time he escapes from punishment {{and at last}} when he is caught, he is put at prison in [...] "Thokthake Prahari Chauki", Kusunde by Himal Ashahi. But somehow he escapes from the jail. At last he learns lesson from that but <b>continuous</b> his next <b>crime.</b> His wife Suntali and his father tells him not to do so.|$|R
40|$|As is well known, Indonesians {{experienced}} a catastrophic lowering of living standards during the war. It is also {{well known that}} this was in large {{part due to the}} greed and cruelty of the Japanese army. Though further studies are warranted, a <b>continuous</b> search for <b>crimes</b> may not lead to a qualitative improvement in our knowledge. Monocausal explanations have long blinded us to other important factors; living standards during the War cannot be explained solely in terms of exploitation...|$|R

To struggle against the <b>continuous</b> increase of <b>crime</b> and its international aspects and, on the other hand, the increase of the texts and their complexity the Royal Gendarmerie is modernising its methods and equipment continuously and reinforcing its efficiency by evaluating technical and scientific policing and criminal data.With this aim, two laboratories, which are under the administration of senior researchers, were established.|$|R
50|$|In April 2016, {{after many}} years of {{anchoring}} various newscasts, {{this is the first time}} that Martin Andanar doesn't have any television-produced programs except the <b>continuous</b> rerun of <b>Crime</b> Klasik and as host of Punto Asintado from Radyo5. He then focused on his radio and podcast career, while continuing his job as the official voice over of all News5 platforms: Radyo5, AksyonTV (except Sports5 programs), N5E, and News5 programs on TV5. But on June 2, 2016, it was revealed that Martin Andanar was appointed as the new head of PCOO (Presidential Communication Operations Office) under the Duterte Administration, which supervises the government's media infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|Since 1993, {{the term}} {{femicide}} {{has referred to}} a <b>continuous</b> wave of <b>crimes</b> committed to women due to gender or race, a structural feature of our societies. This paper inscribes the question on {{the limits of the}} representation of the unutterable in our local post-colonial genealogies. How could we write a feminist narrative symbolically able to inscribe the losses within it, and question the world outside? This shows that all efforts in favor of Politics of Memory must be founded in the recovery of silenced First People languages, and in the cross-disciplinary junction of Art and Social Sciences.

40|$|The annual crime {{reports from}} the {{countries}} in the world have presented us <b>continuous</b> increasing <b>crime</b> affairs. Crime experts are arguing that the increasing of the number of crime affairs is due to the improved registration method. But we are all convinced that an extra security unit can make an environment safer. At least occurred crimes will be registered and extra surveillance in that environment can reduce this problem. By the rapid advancement of the technology it is nowadays possible to secure the home environment. Static cameras are installed at many places, mounted at the ceiling, to safeguard its environment. The automated panning cameras which are able to turn itself around its axes can monitor a larger area around itself. Since the growing interest of research on image processing, cameras are now also able to recognize moving objects and follow them. The object recognition possibilities of cameras are advancing in a rapid pace, but the problem with static cameras is its limited range. Occluded objects can not be detected by the static cameras. A camera which is able to move around the environment can observe better and more in detail than a static one. The Sony AIBO robot dog which is able to move itself around freely is a very popular researc...|$|R
40|$|With the <b>continuous</b> rise in <b>crimes</b> in {{some big}} {{cities of the}} world like Karachi and the {{increasing}} complexity of these crimes, the difficulties the law enforcing agencies are facing in tracking down and taking out culprits have increased manifold. To help cut back the crime rate, a Crime Forecasting System (CFS) can be used which uses historical information maintained by the local Police to help them predict crime patterns {{with the support of}} a huge and self-updating database. This system operates to prevent crime, helps in apprehending criminals, and to reduce disorder. This system is also vital in helping the law enforcers in forming a proactive approach by helping them in identifying early warning signs, take timely and necessary actions, and eventually help stop crime before it actually happens. It will also be beneficial in maintaining an up to date database of criminal suspects includes information on arrest records, communication with police department, associations with other known suspects, and membership in gangs/activist groups. After exploratory analysis of the online data acquired from the victims of these crimes, a broad picture of the scenario can be analyzed. The degree of vulnerability of an area at some particular moment can be highlighted by different colors aided by Google Maps. Some statistical diagrams have also been incorporated. The future of CFS can be seen as an information engine for the analysis, study and prediction of crimes...|$|R
6000|$|This is {{precisely}} our present case--a case of rebellion wherein {{the public safety}} does require the suspension--Indeed, arrests by process of courts and arrests in cases of rebellion do not proceed altogether upon the same basis. The former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary and <b>continuous</b> perpetration of <b>crime,</b> while the latter is directed at sudden and extensive uprisings against the government, which, at most, will succeed or fail in no great length of time. In the latter case arrests are made {{not so much for}} what has been done as for what probably would be done. The latter is more for the preventive and less for the vindictive than the former. In such cases the purposes of men are much more easily understood than in cases of ordinary crime. The man who stands by and says nothing when the peril of his government is discussed, cannot be misunderstood. If not hindered, he is sure to help the enemy; much more if he talks ambiguously--talks for his country with [...] "buts," [...] and [...] "ifs," [...] and [...] "ands." [...] Of how little value the constitutional provision I have quoted will be rendered if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall have been committed, may be illustrated by a few notable examples: General John C. Breckinridge, General Robert E. Lee, General Joseph E. Johnston, General John B. Magruder, General William B. Preston, General Simon B. Buckner, and Commodore Franklin Buchanan, now occupying the very highest places in the rebel war service, were all within the power of the government since the rebellion began, and were nearly as well known to be traitors then as now. Unquestionably if we had seized and had them the insurgent cause would be much weaker. But no one of them had then committed any crime defined in the law. Every one of them, if arrested, would have been discharged on habeas corpus were the writ allowed to operate. In view of these and similar cases, I think the time not unlikely to come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather than too many.|$|R
