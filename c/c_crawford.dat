2500|$|In 1863, a new {{independent}} steamer, the Enterprise, {{was built}} at Canemah by Capt. George A. Pease, {{backed by a}} company formed by Capt. Charles. W. Pope (1831-1871), Capt. Nat H. Lane, Sr. (1823-1878), C. Friendly, Judge Riley E. Stratton, <b>C.</b> <b>Crawford,</b> James Wilson, C.W. Rea, and S. Ellsworth. [...] Enterprise, the second steamer of this name to operate on the Willamette, was launched in November 1863, and ran independently {{for a short time}} under George Pease. [...] Soon an accommodation was reached with the P.T. Company, after which Pease remained in command for over two years. [...] In 1866, the P.T. purchased Enterprise outright from its original owners.|$|E
2500|$|The flow of Virgin Falls {{varies from}} barely a trickle {{in late summer}} and early fall (the dry season), to a raging torrent during the late winter and early spring (the wet season). [...] The source of this {{enormous}} amount of water during the wet season was a mystery for many years, but geologist Nicholas <b>C.</b> <b>Crawford</b> conducted dye tests that conclusively proved {{that the source of}} the water for Virgin Falls was a sinking creek in Lost Creek Cove, nearly three (3) miles to the north. [...] Lost Creek Cove is a polje, a geologic feature that consists of a very large, closed depression in karst topography where all the water drains underground. [...] One of the sinking creeks in Lost Cove re-emerges at Virgin Falls and the other re-emerges at Lost Creek Falls, 1.8 miles west of Virgin Falls. [...] This area has a complex and fascinating underground flow pattern that has been studied for years by local cavers and geologists.|$|E
