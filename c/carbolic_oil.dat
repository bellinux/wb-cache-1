60|$|In {{the first}} frenzy of microbe killing, {{surgical}} instruments were dipped in <b>carbolic</b> <b>oil,</b> {{which was a}} great improvement on not dipping them in anything at all and simply using them dirty; but as microbes are so fond of <b>carbolic</b> <b>oil</b> that they swarm in it, {{it was not a}} success from the anti-microbe point of view. Formalin was squirted into the circulation of consumptives until it was discovered that formalin nourishes the tubercle bacillus handsomely and kills men. The popular theory of disease is the common medical theory: namely, that every disease had its microbe duly created in the garden of Eden, and has been steadily propagating itself and producing widening circles of malignant disease ever since. It was plain from the first that if this had been even approximately true, the whole human race would have been wiped out by the plague long ago, and that every epidemic, instead of fading out as mysteriously as it rushed in, would spread over the whole world. It was also evident that the characteristic microbe of a disease might be a symptom instead of a cause. An unpunctual man is always in a hurry; but it does not follow that hurry is the cause of unpunctuality: on the contrary, what is the matter with the patient is sloth. When Florence Nightingale said bluntly that if you overcrowded your soldiers in dirty quarters there would be an outbreak of smallpox among them, she was snubbed as an ignorant female who did not know that smallpox can be produced only by the importation of its specific microbe.|$|E
50|$|Leopard of the Mulher Valley: In 1903 L. S. Osmaston (1870-1969), a {{conservator}} {{employed by}} the Imperial Forestry Service, reported that a man-eating leopard had killed more than 30 humans in the Mulher Valley between 1901 and 1902. Osmaston twice set out to kill the leopard in February and March 1902, but was unsuccessful. His forestry work required him to leave Mulher later that month, and {{he was unable to}} return until late November. The leopards last attack occurred a few days later on 3 December:I heard a boy of 15 had been killed at Wadai, 4 miles from my camp; this boy was most unfortunate. Last year the panther had tried to get him, but only mauled one leg; my wife and I were able to dose the wound with <b>carbolic</b> <b>oil</b> and the boy got well; this time he and one or two others were sitting close to a bright fire on a threshing floor near the village {{in the early part of}} the night and the panther came and carried him off: the panther took him about a quarter of a mile to a patch of high grass and brushwood and ate all he could of the head, the flesh of one leg and all his inside; so there was plenty left for the beast to come back for. Osmaston constructed a blind 11 m from the boys corpse and waited. The leopard returned to the area in the afternoon, but cautiously avoided approaching the body until after dark. When it finally ventured within shooting range, Osmaston fired with his double-barreled express rifle. The injured animal darted off into the night, and was killed the following morning when it was discovered alive some distance away. Osmaston speculated that the attacks began during the Indian famine of 1899-1900, the leopard having taken to man-eating after killing a dying person in the jungle. He also believed the man-eater was responsible for other fatal attacks in the nearby Dang and Dhule districts, but did not know the exact number of fatalities.|$|E
40|$|Phenol (87. 3 mg/l), p-cresol (58. 6 mg/l), o-cresol (76. 9 mg/l), and 2, 5 -xylenol (36. 7 mg/l) were {{detected}} in the urine of workers employed in the distillation of the high temperature phenolic fraction of tar (<b>carbolic</b> <b>oil).</b> The concentrations of these compounds in the urine of non-exposed male workers was 11. 7 mg/l, 25. 7 mg/l, 68. 1 micrograms/l, and 69 micrograms/l respectively. The excretion rates were 4. 20 mg/h for phenol, 2. 4 mg/h for p-cresol, 3. 3 mg/h for o-cresol; and 1. 5 mg/h for 2, 5 -xylenol. The highest concentrations of the mentioned compounds {{were detected}} in urine collected between eight and 10 hours {{from the beginning of}} exposure. The kinetics of excretion are considered...|$|E
