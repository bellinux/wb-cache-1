25|$|In 1999, a new search {{expedition}} was mounted, {{founded by}} German Everest researcher Jochen Hemmleb, {{and led by}} Eric Simonson. Simonson had seen some very old oxygen bottles near the First Step during his first summit climb in 1991. One of these bottles was again found in 1999 and was one belonging to Mallory and Irvine, thus proving the two climbed at least as high as shortly below the First Step. Their location also suggests a <b>climbing</b> <b>speed</b> of approximately 275nbsp&vert-ft/hr, good time for the altitude and an indication the oxygen systems were working perfectly.

40|$|The {{competitive}} market will keep asking airlines for better services and lower prices, imposing pressure on costs. Therefore, {{it is important}} for an airline to establish operational standards that will allow an aircraft to be operated more efficiently. The implementation of the Economic Speeds defined by the Cost Index can represent significant operating cost reductions when compared to simply flying Fixed Speeds. Different aircraft models today are equipped with Flight Management Computers (FMC) that are capable of automatically calculating the Economic Speeds based on the Airline Cost Index. In the other hand, several aircraft types manufactured by world leading companies and flown by many airlines around the globe are equipped with FMCs that do not have this capability. Accordingly, this work focuses on the Economic Speeds defined by the Cost Index. More specifically, the Cost Index Methodology is discussed and its fundamentals are applied to the climb phase of the flight. Finally, a methodology for the generation of a practical guidance that allows the determination of the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule during the daily operation is presented, allowing an airline with a fleet equipped with FMCs not capable of automatically calculating the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule {{to take advantage of the}} potential operating cost reduction. The proposed methodology can be applied on the development of a calculation software to be installed on an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) or to be used for generating data to be sent directly to the flight crew in the cockpit through a Datalink System. In case an EFB or a Datalink System are not an alternative, the proposed methodology leads to the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule Table, a practical guidance that allows the flight crew to determine the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule for an Airline Cost Index and different conditions of aircraft weight, cruise altitude and speed, with corrections for temperature and wind variations. Since corrections for temperature and wind variations can be understood as a simplification that permits the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedules to be presented through a table, it is necessary to investigate the impact of this simplification on the optimization. Therefore, the operating costs for an aircraft flying the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule calculated for each specific condition is compared with that same aircraft flying the speeds obtained from the suggested Table. Finally, a Study Case analyses the impact on the operating costs for an aircraft flying the speeds obtained from the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule Table in comparison with flying a Fixed <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule...|$|R

2500|$|From the {{location}} of their final camp (discovered in 2001), a summit climb may be estimated to have taken them around eleven hours. Assuming they took two cylinders each, they only had about eight hours of oxygen available, so [...] although this depends on the flow rate, which could be controlled and was not necessarily full flow [...] the oxygen would almost certainly have run out before they reached the summit. The two flow rates available on those oxygen sets were 1.5 and 2.2 litres/min. Both are low rates for active climbing, and it is unlikely the two would have used the lower flow rate. One of their oxygen bottles was found some [...] short of the First Step, which enables their speed of climbing to be calculated (~275 vert-ft/hr; Hillary and Norgay climbed at 350 vf/h at this altitude). It can be estimated that at best they might have reached {{the base of the}} Second Step with one-and-a-half hours of oxygen remaining each. Given the vertical distance remaining (~800 vft), the climb to the summit after the Second Step at the same climbing rate would be three hours. But <b>climbing</b> <b>speed</b> drops quickly with altitude (Hillary and Norgay managed only 150 vf/h above 28,000ft). Thus, even if Mallory had taken Irvine's oxygen, he would not have had enough oxygen to reach the summit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Locomotor {{performance}} in ecologically relevant activities is often linked to individual fitness. Recent controversy over evolution of extreme sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in spiders centres {{on the relationship}} between size and locomotor capacity in males. Advantages for large males running over horizontal surfaces and small males climbing vertically have been proposed. Models have implicitly treated running and climbing as functionally distinct activities and failed to consider the possibility that they reflect common underlying capacities. Findings We examine the relationship between maximum climbing and running {{performance in}} males of three spider species. Maximum running and <b>climbing</b> <b>speeds</b> were positively related in two orb-web spiders with high SSD (Argiope keyserlingi and Nephila plumipes), indicating that for these species assays of running and climbing largely reveal the same underlying capacities. Running and <b>climbing</b> <b>speeds</b> were not related in a jumping spider with low SSD (Jacksonoides queenslandica). We found no evidence of a performance trade-off between these activities. Conclusions In the web-spiders A. keyserlingi and N. plumipes good runners were also good climbers. This indicates that climbing and running largely represent a single locomotor performance characteristic in these spiders, but {{this was not the case}} for the jumping spider J. queenslandica. There was no evidence of a trade-off between maximum running and <b>climbing</b> <b>speeds</b> in these spiders. We highlight the need to establish the relationship between apparently disparate locomotor activities when testing alternative hypotheses that yield predictions about different locomotor activities. Analysis of slopes suggests greater potential for an evolutionary response on performance in the horizontal compared to vertical context in these spiders. </p...|$|R
