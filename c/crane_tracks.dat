40|$|Abstract. Setting up an {{adaptable}} {{and flexible}} simulation model for steel-making process {{is very important}} to improve production system design and manufacture automation. To assist the decision-makers in steel-making plants, the Logistical simulator for steel-making has been developed using em-Plant software. The Simulator can be used to rapidly model any steel plant, including the movement of the operation equipments and the changes of production parameters. With the help of Simulator, the influences of lay-out changes, process parameters, and changes in planning could be revealed vividly, and the realistic production planning could be created. Results include production Gantt charts, display of <b>cranes</b> <b>track,</b> utilization figures and production statistics. Simulation cases show that the simulator is valid for simulating different steel-making processes, and production states on different conditions can be investigated by using this model...|$|R
5|$|As of 1994, {{the line}} was intact and {{operational}} from Ganddal to Foss-Eigeland and the cement factory there. Here, an internal <b>crane</b> <b>track</b> has been welded across the line. From Foss-Eigeland to Figgjo, the track is intact. At Figgjo, a bridge has been demolished, {{and it is not}} possible to traverse that section. Except for a number of level crossings where the tracks have been asphalted over, the line remains intact to Ålgård. At Ålgård Station the tracks have been removed, but the station building and depot remains. The station at Foss-Eigeland has been converted to a church, while the station at Figgjo had been taken over by a wholesaler. The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The Norwegian National Rail Administration retains ownership and can in the future renovate the line for operation.|$|R

40|$|The highest {{losses in}} the Aransas-Wood Buffalo {{whooping}} crane population occur during migration. Conservation and recovery of the endangered whooping crane requires understanding of migration patterns to identify important stopover areas and potential sources of mortality or disturbance. We converted the Cooperative Whooping <b>Crane</b> <b>Tracking</b> Project database, containing more than 3 decades of data on whooping crane sightings, to a geographic information system (GIS) to allow coarse scale spatial analyses of whooping crane migration patterns in the United States portion of the Central Flyway. At this writing, the geodatabase contains point data for 1, 981 confirmed whooping crane sightings through the spring migration of 2008. Limitations and appropriate uses of the sighting point data are discussed. We compared the distribution of confirmed whooping crane sightings using a flyway-wide analysis and state-specific analyses. State-specific analyses showed substantial differences in distribution of whooping crane sightings between states, illustrating potential differences in habitat availability between states. However, differences in whooping crane distribution between states are confounded to an undeterminable degree by observer bias, illustrating the need for information on whooping crane migration patterns that is less dependent {{on the distribution of}} observers qualified to confirm whooping crane presence...|$|R
