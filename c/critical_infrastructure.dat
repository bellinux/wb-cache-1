40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> facing hazards is a burning issue for urban risks management. In this context, developing methodologies for analysing {{the causes and}} consequences of <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> vulnerability appears necessary for improving the proper functioning of cities that strongly depend on such <b>infrastructures.</b> The <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are complex socio-technical systems in which the components are particularly interdependent. Interdependencies also exist between <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> All these interactions may imply many failures caused by cascade effect {{in a context of}} risks. After a review of existing methodologies for assessing the interdependencies within and between <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> the paper develops a global methodology based on dependability methods in order to automatically produce the scenarios of failures caused by cascade effect within a rail transport system, as an example of <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> facing a flood hazard, as an example of urban risks.

40|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are the {{backbone}} of modern society and provide many essential goods and services to urban areas. Given {{the risks associated with}} the impact of natural hazards on <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> the move towards safer and more resilient cities requires the development and application of an improved risk assessment framework to address high-impact and low-probability events. In this context, the STREST project developed a stress test framework to determine the risk and resilience of non-nuclear <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> In addition, the project developed a consistent modelling approach to hazard, vulnerability, risk and resilience assessment of low-probability and high-consequence events, considering relevant epistemic uncertainties and interdependencies of <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Six key representative <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in Europe were selected for exploratory application of the stress test methodology.

5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} events can disrupt and or damage the {{infrastructure}} upon which society depends. Several recent eruptions have illustrated {{the vulnerability of}} urban areas that received only a few millimetres or centimetres of volcanic ash. This has been sufficient to cause disruption of transportation, electricity, water, sewage and storm water systems. Costs have been incurred from business disruption, replacement of damaged parts and insured losses. Ash fall impacts on <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructure</b> can also cause multiple knock-on effects, which may disrupt many different sectors and services.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an analytical planning framework for hypothesizing, formulating and mitigating vulnerability in <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The {{point of departure}} is that because technological change {{plays a significant role}} in the development of <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> the dynamics of such change must be taken into account when assessing how such structures advance a state of vulnerability over time. A second key notion is that while underlying interdependencies are characteristic of developing technological systems in general, these relationships receive a new significance in the context of <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The article contributes a model of vulnerability, which integrates a number of system levels of technological change as they bear on <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The framework is exemplified by a case description and analysis of cyber attacks on vital public functions. Finally a number of key principles are proposed for addressing systemic vulnerability in <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> across sectors of society. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Interdependencies of <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> on {{communications}} {{and information technology}} infrastructure (CITI) are known collectively as cyber interdependency, which has significant impact on many <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> However, till now no formal relationship has been proposed to estimate cyber interdependencies. In this paper, we present a set of empirical functions to represent cyber interdependencies for different <b>critical</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Our approach is based on identifying important CITI services {{for each of these}} infrastructures and systematically ranking them according to their contribution to the infrastructures' output. The description of interdependencies between infrastructure entities in functional form is rooted in system theory and is an essential component of computational modelling and simulation.
