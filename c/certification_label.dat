Consumer expectations in relation to food quality present new business opportunities for EU aquaculture producers {{who are willing to}} differentiate their products. In particular, new convenience formats and <b>certification</b> <b>labels</b> are likely to influence consumer choices. This study uses the choice experiment method to investigate consumer preferences and willingness to pay for new convenient formats and <b>certification</b> <b>labels</b> for oysters. Cross-sectional data were collected through a web-based consumer survey carried out in Italy in 2015. The main result of the study is that <b>certification</b> <b>labels</b> are decisively more effective than new convenient preparation formats to differentiate high-quality products. However, some heterogeneity was detected in consumer preferences...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{regional}} products, such as Florida oranges, Idaho {{potatoes and}} Parma ham, {{often have to}} compete against products passing themselves off as the authentic product using the exact same name. This unfair competition misleads consumers, discourages {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) from marketing products based on their region of origin, and may end up hurting rural economies. To protect consumers, and support SMEs and rural economies, many countries around the world have introduced regulations enabling SMEs to legally protect the names of their regional products. The success of these regulations largely depends on consumers' appreciation of regional <b>certification</b> <b>labels</b> that inform consumers that the name of the regional product is protected and that it denotes the authentic product. To gain an understanding about consumers' appreciation of regional <b>certification</b> <b>labels,</b> this paper investigates consumers' image of these labels and proposes a model that relates this image to consumers' willingness to buy and pay for protected regional products. The model is tested based on Regulation No. 2081 / 92 that was introduced by the EEC allowing European SMEs to protect their regional products and market their products with a protected-designation-of-origin (PDO) label. Structural equation modelling results suggest that consumers' image of regional <b>certification</b> <b>labels</b> consists of a quality warranty dimension and an economic support dimension, which positively relate to consumers' willingness to buy and pay for the protected regional product. Protecting regional products and marketing them with regional <b>certification</b> <b>labels</b> may be beneficial for SMEs producing and marketing regional products.

40|$|SummaryThe {{decline and}} {{collapse}} {{of many of}} the world's fisheries has led to the implementation of social marketing that promotes the consumption of sustainably harvested seafood [1, 2]. Because the success of this strategy depends on supply chain integrity, we investigated the accuracy of eco-labels for Patagonian toothfish, marketed as ‘Chilean sea bass’ (Dissostichus eleginoides), by genetically analyzing retail fish bearing <b>certification</b> <b>labels</b> from the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). For Chilean sea bass, MSC <b>certification</b> <b>labels</b> indicate that fish were harvested from the only sustainable fishery [3, 4], a population in waters surrounding the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia and the nearby plateau at Shag Rocks [3]. We found that not all MSC-certified fish were Chilean sea bass from the certified stock: some were simply not D. eleginoides, but among those that were, we found significant genetic differences between the retail sample of fish and the certified stock population. Uncertified fish may not necessarily resemble stocks closest to their country of origin because capture and processing often occur at different places. However, significant differences between MSC-certified Chilean sea bass and the sole certified fishery for this species indicate that uncertified fish were inserted into the MSC supply chain...|$|R

50|$|Various {{features}} of the vehicle being considered for certification are examined. There are four levels of certification for a vehicle(s) in the eRating program: e1, e2, e3, and e4. The CST uses a point system, or sustainability index, to determine the certification level of a given vehicle. Points are given for more efficient features and attributes of the vehicle, with 100 being required for entry level, or e1, certification. e1 certification represents entry-level certification and e4 certification indicates the highest level. Only the most energy efficient, lowest impacts forms of transportation are eligible for certification; a <b>certification</b> <b>label</b> on a vehicle, be it e1, e2, e3, or e4, lets consumers know that the vehicle has met a set of rigorous sustainability criteria.|$|E

50|$|The MC2D association, {{with the}} support of the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, has decided to launch a campaign, in Monaco, to promote the use of wood {{harvested}} from sustainably managed forests. This campaign is entitled “Monaco makes a commitment against deforestation”.Deforestation of the tropical rainforests accounts for more than 20% of greenhouse gas emissions and moreover leads to soil degradation, loss of biodiversity and the exclusion of the local populations.One of the most effective ways of combating this scourge is to give these forests an economic value through the development of sustainable management. Such management enables us to target certain species of tree and of a certain age only, whilst at the same time respecting biodiversity-rich areas and the people living there. Rational forestry practice enables forest regeneration and generates economic value for the parties concerned, foresters and the indigenous people alike.One of the concrete catalysts for change resides in the production, marketing and utilisation of certified wood under the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) label, which is currently the most important forest <b>certification</b> <b>label</b> for the tropical rainforests.With this initiative, the Principality aims to set an example for the protection of the tropical rainforests and the fight against global warming.|$|E
40|$|Abstract It is {{important}} to {{encourage the use of}} <b>certification</b> <b>label</b> in health foods marketing because the <b>certification</b> <b>label</b> not only can ensure consumers'' rights and benefits but also can lead manufacturers to reinforce the competitiveness of the products. The purpose of this study makes two points. First, it aims to explore customers' perception of <b>certification</b> <b>label</b> toward health foods. Second, this study attempts to investigate the relationships among customers' health belief, message credibility, socio-demographic factors, and purchase behavior. This study employed a questionnaire to survey 287 consumers in hyper-market. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The customers' main perceptions of the label of certification are “to pay attention the primary conditions “, “the words with medical function are not allowed to label on the health foods“, and “to notice other clear signs before buying health foods“. However, “health foods with little green-man mark benefit one's health“ does not attract much attention. 2. “It's better to adopt doctor''s suggestions“, “Chronic diseases leads to psychological impact“, and “adopt preventive behaviors according to various discomforts“ are three most valued health belief aspects that customers mentioned. However, the notion“to purchase and eat health foods to promote health“ does not obtain much attention. 3. With regard to information credibility, “certification from governmental agencies“ got highest regards, followed by “expert''s authentication“ and “company''s brand“. The so-called “multi-level marketing“ is deemed most distrusted. 4. The logistic regression analysis shows that the respondents' “health belief“, “information credibility“, and some” demographical variables" present significant influences on “purchase behavior toward health foods”. The more consumers possessing health belief and information credibility, the higher they show purchase behavior of health foods. In addition. the middle-aged, students, and those with university education exhibit significant buying behavior toward health foods.
