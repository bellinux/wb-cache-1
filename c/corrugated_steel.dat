25|$|The Sarafand was a six-engined biplane {{flying boat}} with equal span wings. Due {{to the high}} wing end loads, Gouge {{specified}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> spars for both upper and lower wings. The six engines, in tractor/pusher pairs, were housed in monocoque nacelles mounted between the wings on integral girders; the central nacelle was further supported by two pairs of splayed struts to the lower wing-roots. The hull, largely constructed of anodised Alclad, had a stainless-steel planing bottom. It had a monoplane tail unit with one large fin and two small auxiliary fins on the tailplane.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{temperature}} changes of <b>corrugated</b> webs <b>steel</b> beam in fire at different time, 3 different kinds of shear buckling modes and the changes of elastic buckling critical stress of <b>corrugated</b> web <b>steel</b> beam are analyzed in the fire, considering the effect of fire high temperature on structure elasticity modulus. The computed expressions of partial shear elastic critical buckling stress, elastic critical buckling stress of general buckling mode and critical stress of elastic relevant buckling in the fire are presented in the paper. Numerical results show that fire high temperature has obvious effect on elastic shear critical buckling stress changes of <b>corrugated</b> web <b>steel</b> beam...|$|R
25|$|A {{major problem}} left to solve {{was that the}} new {{autorack}} cars did not provide any protection from theft, vandalism, or from severe weather. Individual railroads began installing mesh side screens and solid panels to their racks to protect the vehicles from impact and debris in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s new racks were being delivered with these side panels. However, thieves and vagrants could still {{gain access to the}} automobiles. In 1973 the first fully enclosed racks with continuous side panels, end doors, and roofs were developed to address this problem. Whitehead & Kales, Ford, N and DT jointly developed a Snap-Pak prototype enclosed tri-level car, NW 400000. The car side was made up of overlapping perforated steel sheets. The ends were protected with two trifold doors, and a <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> roof extended the full length of the car. A competing RailPac prototype was developed by Portec-Paragon, Chrysler, and several railroads. It featured mesh screen side panels, vertically sliding three-piece doors, and a similar roof. The Southern Railway and Greenville Steel Car developed a unique 124-foot articulated three-unit Autoguard car with single axle trucks, SOU 599000-599001.|$|E
500|$|The roof {{has four}} layers. On the {{underside}} is {{a layer of}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets. Above them, thermal and acoustic insulation is provided by Polyisocyanurate sheets. A layer of plasterboard is above it. Finally, the entire roof is covered with [...] of Firestone Ultraply TPO. On the underside, a flexible membrane covers the structure. This final layer helps to collect rainwater for reuse {{in other areas of}} the stadium.|$|E
500|$|Another {{planning}} {{office was}} established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle. The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971. The initial station was entirely blasted in bedrock and consisted of a single platform, [...] long and [...] wide. Adjacent to the bedrock is a layer of construction concrete and above the platforms, there are <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> plates to catch drips and to reduce noise. The section of line past Nationaltheatret {{was part of a}} [...] section of the Oslo Tunnel designated Studenterlunden. Of this, [...] was to run with the Common Tunnel of the Oslo Metro directly above it, resulting in a two-story tunnel. However, just east of Nationaltheatret, the two lines diverge, so the metro station is not directly on top of the railway station.|$|E

Harvey's books, explaining 20th-century civilization, as well as a world globe, a bible, encyclopedias, and newspapers, were to be placed inside two vaults and hermetically sealed in glass. Harvey also wanted to place in this large room: [...] "numerous small items now used in domestic and industrial life, from the size of a needle and safety pin up to a Victrola." [...] It was estimated that the construction would use 16,000 bags of cement, 30,000ft³ (850m³) of sand, 58,000ft³ (1,642m³) of gravel, and tons of <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> reinforcement. The Portland Cement Association donated the service of one of its experts, who pronounced that the Pyramid would not deteriorate or suffer from erosion and would last for over a million years. To prevent water in the valley from interfering with the foundation and to shore up the low knoll to support the heavy Pyramid, Harvey constructed a [...] long retaining wall of stone and concrete.|$|E
500|$|During {{the night}} of 4–5 February, a few protesters {{continued}} to camp out in Tahrir Square. Early in the morning shots were fired as protesters said pro-Mubarak activists tried to assault the square. Troops then fired into the air to disperse them. Demonstrators later formed a human chain to prevent tanks from passing through the barricades into the square; a witness said scuffles broke out when an army general asked demonstrators to take down their makeshift barricades of <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> and debris. As the army tightened access to Tahrir Square, {{the head of the}} army met protesters and asked them to return home. Protesters responded that [...] "he (Mubarak) will go" [...] and they would not. The army was also more organized and present than on any other day of the protest. A heavy military presence continued in central Cairo. An Interior Ministry spokesman said that [...] "the army remains neutral and is not taking sides because if we protect one side we will be perceived as biased....our role is to prevent clashes and chaos as we separate the opposing groups." [...] Scuffles were reported during the day in Tahrir Square and one protester was said to have died. A group of foreigners including an English protester on the 5th and a Swede on the 6th joined the protesters in Tahrir Square, handing out flowers in a sign of solidarity and holding up a banner in English. Five hundred protesters arrived in Tahrir Square from Suez. There were reports of over 10,000 people continuing to stay in Alexandria through the night.|$|E
