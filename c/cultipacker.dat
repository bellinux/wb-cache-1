5000|$|The <b>cultipacker</b> {{differs from}} the field roller {{in that it is}} made up of many {{sections}} that form peaks and valleys in the soil where the <b>cultipacker</b> has been used.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>cultipacker</b> {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} applied to ridged packers, while the term roller may refer {{to either a}} smooth or a ridged packer. The term <b>cultipacker</b> appeared in English around 1914 and may have originated as a brand name. By the 1920s and ever since, it has been widely used in a genericized sense.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>cultipacker</b> is a {{piece of}} {{agricultural}} equipment that crushes dirt clods, removes air pockets, and presses down small stones, forming a smooth, firm seedbed. Where seed has been broadcast, the roller gently firms the soil around the seeds, ensuring shallow seed placement and excellent seed-to-soil contact.|$|E

5000|$|Tillage is the {{agricultural}} preparation of soil by mechanical [...] of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. Examples of human-powered tilling methods using hand tools include shovelling, picking, mattock work, hoeing, and raking. Examples of draft-animal-powered or mechanized work include ploughing (overturning with moldboards or chiseling with chisel shanks), rototilling, rolling with <b>cultipackers</b> or other rollers, harrowing, and cultivating with cultivator shanks (teeth). Small-scale gardening and farming, for household food production or small business production, tends {{to use the}} smaller-scale methods, whereas medium- to large-scale farming tends to use the larger-scale methods. There is a fluid continuum, however. Any type of gardening or farming, but especially larger-scale commercial types, may also use low-till or no-till methods as well.|$|R

5000|$|Gardner {{was born}} in Batavia, New York. His father was a lay preacher and dairy farmer, and his mother taught English at a local school. Both parents were fond of Shakespeare and often recited {{literature}} together. He {{was active in the}} Boy Scouts of America and made Eagle Scout. As a child, Gardner attended public school and worked on his father's farm, where, in April 1945, his younger brother Gilbert was killed in an accident with a <b>cultipacker.</b> Gardner, who was driving the tractor during the fatal accident, carried guilt for his brother's death throughout his life, suffering nightmares and flashbacks. The incident informed much of Gardner's fiction and criticism — most directly in the 1977 short story [...] "Redemption," [...] which included a fictionalized recounting of the accident as an impetus for artistic inspiration.|$|E
40|$|Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) {{is a high}} {{priority}} species for federal and state land management agencies. Sage-grouse are sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) obligates requiring sagebrush for their survival throughout the year. Sagebrush has been removed and replaced with crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum 2 ̆ 6 A. desertorum) throughout the West. The objectives of this paper were to review the literature (99 papers), as well as consult experts, to determine which methods {{are most likely to}} eliminate crested wheatgrass and establish sagebrush. No technique eliminates crested wheatgrass in a single application. Grazing and fire have no long-term impacts on crested wheatgrass. Mechanical treatments, such as plowing, disking, and cultivating reduce and eradicate crested wheatgrass, but a flush of invasive annual grasses following mechanical disturbance can make establishment of seeded species difficult. It appears {{that the best way to}} reduce crested wheatgrass cover and establish sagebrush is to spray crested wheatgrass with glyphosate in early spring for two consecutive years at a rate of 1. 1 kg/ha of active ingredient. Then, sagebrush should be seeded in the late fall using a compact row seeder or Brillion <b>cultipacker</b> at a rate of 0. 22 kg/ha pure live seed...|$|E
40|$|Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a C 4 -grass {{indigenous}} to North America being considered as the “model” energy crop. Switchgrass {{is difficult to}} establish and first-year stand failure often challenge the large scale production of switchgrass. Reliable establishment methods and effective weed management practices to produce a harvestable biomass in the establishment year are required. Also, to maximize the economic viability of switchgrass production, appropriate nutrient management and harvests are needed. Thus, we conducted researches to improve switchgrass establishment and production. These studies ranged from finding the most promising switchgrass variety to adjusting switchgrass seeding rate, determine the most appropriate seeding date, seeding methods, weed management, nitrogen application, and harvest management. Currently Cave-in-Rock is a highly suggested upland variety for northern region of United States. Results of our variety trials both at establishment and production level indicated that Carthage and Shawnee could also be considered as promising varieties in northern regions of United States. In a four-year study, Carthage consistently produced higher biomass yield compared with other varieties. A vigor test trial was suggested for adjusting switchgrass seeding rate and we found {{significant differences between the}} required seeding rate for producing acceptable first-year biomass in fertile soils and marginal soils. While approximately 7 kg ha- 1 seeding rate might be sufficient for fertile soils, 14 kg ha- 1 might be required to produce enough established seedling for the same biomass production in a marginal soil. An early planting of switchgrass was not as effective as a late planting in weed suppression but plants were more advanced morphologically thus, produced acceptable biomass yield with root system which ensures successful second-year production. Among cover crops, oat outperformed others (Fallow and Rye) with both suppressing weeds and improving switchgrass establishment. Results suggested drastic differences between no-till planting and seeding with <b>cultipacker</b> seeder where no-till planting into oat produced significantly higher biomass yield compared with <b>cultipacker</b> seeder. A firm seedbed is also another desirable method of planting where significantly improved switchgrass establishment and production was observed with 2 times rolling/cultipacking after seeding. Our findings indicated that application of herbicides is strongly required in the establishment year where a Broad Spectrum application of atrazine, quinclorac, 2, 4 -D, and dicamba improved switchgrass establishment through effective control of weeds. We found a late-fall harvest could improve switchgrass quality for combustion (less moisture, ash, and nutrient content) without yield reduction for many years. When switchgrass was harvested in late-fall, no response to N application was found. Overall, it is proposed that a no-till planting of switchgrass into oat cover crop with herbicide application planted in early-June could provide a successful stand and later, a late-fall harvest without any N application could maintain crop productivity with acceptable biomass yield and quality for several years...|$|E
