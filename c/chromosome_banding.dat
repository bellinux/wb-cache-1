50|$|Walter Nelson-Rees (11 January 1929 - 23 January 2009) was a {{cell culture}} worker and {{cytogeneticist}} who helped expose {{the problem of}} cross-contamination of cell lines.

50|$|Initially {{the idea}} of {{identifying}} the genotype of individuals and subsequently their associated phenotype(s) was first used in early cytogenetic studies.

From the 1960s to 1990s cytogenetic techniques such as <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to identify and phenotypically characterize patients with chromosomal abnormalities.|$|E

50|$|Presence {{of certain}} {{chromosomal}} aberrations and their resulting fusion genes {{is commonly used}} within cancer diagnostics in order to set a precise diagnosis. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> analysis, {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH), and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are common methods employed at diagnostic laboratories. These methods all have their distinct shortcomings due to the very complex nature of cancer genomes. Recent developments such as high-throughput sequencing and custom DNA microarrays bear promise of introduction of more efficient methods.|$|E
40|$|Visual {{examination}} of <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> patterns {{is an important}} means of chromosome analysis. Cytogeneticists compare their patient's chromosome image against the prototype normal/abnormal human <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> patterns. Automated chromosome analysis instruments facilitate this by digitally enhancing the chromosome images. Currently available systems employing traditional highpass/bandpass filtering and/or histogram equalization are approximately equivalent to photomicroscopy {{in their ability to}} support the detection of band pattern alterations. Improvements in chromosome image display quality, particularly in the detail of the banding pattern, would significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of these systems. In this paper we present our work on the use of multiscale transform and derivative filtering for image enhancement of <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> patterns. A steerable pyramid representation [2, 31 of the chromosome image is generated by a multiscale transform. The derivative filters are designed to detect the bands of a chromosome, and the steerable pyramid transform is chosen based on its desirable properties of shift and rotation invariance. By processing the transform coefficients that correspond to the bands of the chromosome in the pyramid representation, contrast enhancement of the chromosome bands can be achieved with designed flexibility in scale, orientation and location. Compared with existing chromosome image enhancement techniques, this new approach offers the advantage of selective <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> pattern enhancement that allows designated detail analysis. Experimental results indicate improved enhancement capabilities and promise more effective visual aid to comparison of chromosomes to the prototypes and to each other. This will increase the ability of automated chromosome analysis instruments to assist the evaluation of chromosome abnormalities in clinical samples...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{outlines}} the methods currently employed in cancer cytogenetics, spanning from <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> to array- and sequencing-based techniques. A correct sampling procedure {{is the basis}} for correct scientific and diagnostic conclusions. Chromosome preparation requires live cells, whereas in situ hybridization at least requires intact nuclei, and genome arrays as well as sequencing rely on DNA that has not been extensively degraded. Direct preparations or short-term cultures are therefore usually preferred for <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> analysis. In situ hybridization techniques are based on the inherent organization of DNA into two antiparallel complementary strands. Genomic arrays are highly efficient tools for obtaining data on genomic imbalances present in a tumor sample. The advent of massive parallel/second-generation/ next-generation sequencing (NGS technology has radically transformed the field of cancer cytogenetics. More than 800 genomes of more than 25 cancer types have now been sequenced...|$|E

40|$|Vicia barbazitae, a taxon {{belonging}} to section Vicia of subgenus Vicia, was recovered and analysed by cytological, karyological and molecular methods {{with the aim}} of both proposing a general characterisation of this species and studying the relationships among the species of section Vicia.

Automated karyotype analysis has been determined after Feulgen's reaction; <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> was performed by sequence-specific fluorochrome staining. Fluorescent <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> showed CMA(+) /DAPI(-) NOR-associated heterochromatin in the satellite pair. Karyomorphological parameters, based on symmetry indices, the dendrogram of linkage distance constructed on 37 chromosome parameters, as well as the molecular data based on internal transcribed spacer sequences provided information about phylogenetic position of this species inside the section Vicia and among the species {{belonging to}} the sections Microcarinae, Wiggersia, Atossa and Vicia.

40|$|AIMS—To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} submicroscopic deletions within <b>chromosome</b> <b>band</b> 22 q 11 in infants with significant heart disease and compare this with the prevalence of other chromosomal abnormalities causing significant heart disease. To determine a minimum prevalence of deletions within <b>chromosome</b> <b>band</b> 22 q 11 in infants in the general population.  METHODS—Chromosome analysis was performed on samples from infants born in the former UK Northern Health Region in 1994 and 1995 who either had significant heart disease or who were suspected to have a <b>chromosome</b> <b>band</b> 22 q 11 deletion following referral to the Northern Genetics Service. Significant heart disease was defined as major structural malformation or cases where invasive investigation or intervention was required in infancy.  RESULTS—Chromosome band 22 q 11 deletions were identified in nine infants in a population of 69 129 livebirths, giving a minimum prevalence of 13 per 100 000 (95 % confidence interval 4. 5 to 21. 5). Six cases had significant heart disease, one of whom died before diagnosis. In the same population there were 53 cases of trisomy 21, 15 of whom had significant heart disease.  CONCLUSION—The most common chromosomal cause of significant congenital heart disease remains trisomy 21, while {{the second most common}} chromosomal cause is deletion in <b>chromosome</b> <b>band</b> 22 q 11. ...|$|R
