40|$|Following Davies, Elekes and Keleti, {{we study}} <b>measured</b> <b>sets,</b> i. e. Borel sets B in R (or in a Polish group) {{for which there}} is a {{translation}} invariant Borel measure assigning positive and σ-finite measure to B. We investigate which sets can be written as a (disjoint) union of <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> We show that every Borel nullset B⊂R of the second category is larger than any nullset A⊂R in the sense that there are partitions B=B_ 1 ∪ B_ 2, A=A_ 1 ∪ A_ 2 and gauge functions g_ 1, g_ 2 such that the Hausdorff measures satisfy H^g_i(B_i) = 1 and H^g_i(A_i) = 0 (i= 1, 2). This implies that every Borel set of the second category is a union of two <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> We also present Borel and compact sets in R which are not a union of countably many <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> This is done in two steps. First we show that non-locally compact Polish groups are not a union of countably many <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> Then, to certain Banach spaces we associate a Borel and/or σ-compact additive subgroup of R which is not a union of countably many <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> It is also shown that there are <b>measured</b> <b>sets</b> which are null or non-σ-finite for every Hausdorff measure of arbitrary gauge function...|$|R

One important goal is to find a track assignment with the minimum number of tracks such that the signal interference between nets assigned to neighboring tracks is minimized. This problem is called crosstalk minimization. For a given track assignment with k tracks, crosstalk can be reduced by finding another track assignment for S with k tracks (i. e., by permuting tracks). However, considering all possible permutations requires exponential time. For general cost function for <b>crosstalk</b> <b>measure,</b> the problem is NP-hard. Several heuristic approaches were previously presented. In this paper, we consider special instances of the crosstalk-minimization problem where the cost function [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The null cover {{characterization}} {{conveys the}} intuition that a random real number {{should not have}} any property that is “uncommon”. Each <b>measure</b> 0 <b>set</b> {{can be thought of}} as an uncommon property. It is not possible for a sequence to lie in no <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets,</b> because each one-point <b>set</b> has <b>measure</b> 0. Martin-Löf's idea was to limit the definition to <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets</b> that are effectively describable; the definition of an effective null cover determines a countable collection of effectively describable <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets</b> and defines a sequence to be random if it does not lie in any of these particular <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets.</b> Since the union of a countable collection of <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets</b> has <b>measure</b> 0, this definition immediately leads to the theorem that there is a <b>measure</b> 1 <b>set</b> of random sequences. Note that if we identify the Cantor space of binary sequences with the interval 0,1 of real numbers, the measure on Cantor space agrees with Lebesgue measure.|$|R

A typical result in this area would say something like "a random element (or a tuple of elements) of a group G has a property P with probability p". The validity of a statement like that does, of course, heavily depend on how one defines probability on groups, or, equivalently, how one <b>measures</b> <b>sets</b> in a group (in particular, in a free group).
