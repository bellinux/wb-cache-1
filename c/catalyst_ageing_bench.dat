40|$|The {{influence}} of hydrothermal aging between 500 and 900 A degrees C for 3 h, {{on the structure}} of a Cu-Beta catalyst was studied in this work. The XRD measurements indicated a structural breakdown of the zeolite upon 900 A degrees C hydrothermal aging. This was confirmed from the loss of surface area as measured by BET method. The temperature for the zeolite structure break down was different between the powder bed as opposed to the sample that was washcoated on a cordierite monolith, which was most likely due to slightly different aging conditions and the presence of binders.
