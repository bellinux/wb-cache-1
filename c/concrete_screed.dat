This study evaluates the characteristics of concrete produced with Atlantic ocean and Lagoon water. Concrete produced with tap water (regarded as potable drinking water) serves as the control experiment. Compressive strength, workability and density were used to evaluate the characteristics of concrete specimens. All the concrete samples have true shnnp with Lagoon water concrete having low workability and both tap and Atlantic ocean water concrete having medilllll workability. The concrete specimens produced with the three types of water fall into the category of normal weight concrete as their densities lie within the range of 2200 - 2600 kg m- 3 specified. The 28 th day compressive strength of concrete specimens produced with Atlantic ocean, tap and Lagoon water are 25. 0 and 33. 5 N mm- 2, 17. 9 and 28. 6 N mm- 2 as well as 15. 1 and 19. 4 N mm- 2 for mix ratios 1 : 3 : 6 and 1 : 2 : 4, respectively. It was concluded that tap water should be used in mixing concrete where strength is of major concern, Atlantic ocean water could be used where early strength is required and Lagoon water should only be used for general concrete works where strength is of less importance such as in mass <b>concrete,</b> floor <b>screed</b> and mortar...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic ash {{deposited}} on paved surfaces during volcanic eruptions often compromises skid resistance, {{which is a}} major component of safety. We adopt the British pendulum test method in laboratory conditions to investigate the skid resistance of road asphalt and airfield concrete surfaces covered by volcanic ash sourced from various locations in New Zealand. Controlled variations in ash characteristics include type, depth, wetness, particle size and soluble components. We use Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) for most road surface experiments but also test porous asphalt, line-painted road surfaces, and a roller <b>screed</b> <b>concrete</b> mix used for airfields. Due to their importance for skid resistance, SMA surface macrotexture and microtexture are analysed with semi-quantitative image analysis, microscopy and a standardised sand patch volumetric test, which enables determination of the relative effectiveness of different cleaning techniques. We find that SMA surfaces covered by thin deposits (~ 1 mm) of ash result in skid resistance values slightly lower than those observed on wet uncontaminated surfaces. At these depths, a higher relative soluble content for low-crystalline ash and a coarser particle size results in lower skid resistance. Skid resistance results for relatively thicker deposits (3 – 5 mm) of non-vesiculated basaltic ash are similar to those for thin deposits. There are similarities between road asphalt and airfield concrete, although there is little difference in skid resistance between bare airfield surfaces and airfield surfaces covered by 1 mm of ash. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for maintaining road safety and effective cleaning techniques in volcanic ash environments...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Türkiye'nin güneyinde, Akdeniz kıyısında bulunan Antalya kenti, Helenistik dönemden günümüze farklı uygarlıkların yaşadığı bir liman kentidir. Antalya' nın bugünkü tarihi çekirdeğini oluşturan Kaleiçi, Roma, Bizans, Selçuklu ve Osmanlı dönemlerinden günümüze kalan kültür varlıklarını barındırmaktadır. Bugünkü Kaleiçi'nin sınırlarını, şehri savunma amaçlı inşa edilmiş surlar belirler. Helenistik dönemde yapımı başlayan surlar, Roma, Selçuklu ve Osmanlı dönemlerinde bazı eklemeler ve onarımlarla günümüze kadar gelmiştir. Kaleiçi'nin günümüzdeki tarihi konut dokusu bütünüyle 19. - 20. yüzyıla aittir. Teze konu olan Ömer Lütfü Lülü Konağı, Kaleiçi 19. yüzyıl sivil mimari mirasına örnektir. 19. yüzyıl sonunda Antalya belediye başkanlığı yapmış olan Ömer Lütfü Lülü tarafından yaptırıldığı düşünülmektedir. Ömer Lütfü Lülü Konağı, Antalya İli, Muratpaşa İlçesi, Kaleiçi, Kılınçarslan Mahallesi, 115 ada 10 parselde bulunmaktadır. Yapı, Kaleiçi kentsel ve III. derece arkeolojik sit alanında bulunmaktadır. Yapı bahçesine 115 ada 13, 15 ve 16 parseller dahil olup, 15 parselde sur duvarı ve burç yer almaktadır. Konak, Antalya Kültür ve Tabiat Varlıklarını Koruma Kurulu'nun 13. 05. 1992 gün ve 1442 sayılı kararı ekindeki Korunması Gerekli Taşınma Kültür Varlığı olarak KV(2) müdahale türünde tescil kaydı devam eden taşınmazlara ait listede yer almaktadır.   Ömer Lütfü Lülü Konağı, yıllar içerisinde farklı işlevlerde kullanılmış, bazı müdahaleler görmüştür. Ancak günümüzde kullanılmayan yapı, özgün detaylarını büyük ölçüde korumaktadır. Görkemli biçimlenişiyle Kaleiçi silüetinde ve şehir dokusunda dikkat çekici görünümü olan sivil mimari örneği bu konağın, çağdaş restorasyon ilkelerine göre restorasyon projesinin hazırlanması, böylece kültür mirasımızdan bir örneğin, gelecek kuşaklara güvenilir şekilde aktarılması tez çalışmasının temel hedefidir. Turkey's {{southern}} city of Antalya on the Mediterranean coast is a port city where different civilizations live from the Hellenistic period to the present day. Antalya Kaleiçi, which {{is the core of}} today's historic, accommodates the remaining cultural heritage from Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk and Ottoman periods to the present day. The limits of today's Kaleiçi are determined by the city walls, built for defense. The walls, which started construction in the Hellenistic period, had some additions and repairs on Roman, Seljuk and Ottoman periods. Housing tissue of Kaleiçi is dated 19. - 20. century.   The subject of the thesis, Ömer Lütfü Lülü House, is the example of Kaleiçi 19. century civil architecture heritage. Ömer Lütfü Lülü House is in Antalya city, the town of Muratpaşa, Kaleiçi, Kılınçarslan Quarter, 115 block, 10 layout. The building is in Kaleiçi urban and III. degree archaeological site. 115 block 13, 15 and 16 layout are included in house garden. City wall and constellation are located in 15 layout. Ömer Lütfü Lülü House is situated in the list of protected cultural heritage of Antalya Cultural and Natural Heritage Preservation Commission's 13. 05. 1992 day and 1442 numbered decision. It {{is believed to have been}} built at the end of the 19. centıry by Ömer Lütfü Lülü who served as the mayor of Antalya. Ömer Lütfü Lülü has came to Antalya with the invitation of  II. Abdülhamit. He was famous timber merchant. Timber which is used on building construction was transfered from Antalya to Egypt by Ömer Lütfü Lülü.   Ömer Lütfü Lülü House plan typology does not fix to Antalya Houses' plan typology because Ömer Lütfü Lülü was not from Antalya and  he has political position. Therefore, the house's plan typology similar with 19. - 2. century İstanbul House plan typology. The house is situated at the nortwest corner of the garden at the point of junction of Mermerli banyo Street and Kaledibi Street. Two facade of the building looks the street, other two facade looks the garden. There is 3 meters elevation difference between  north and south facade because, topography of the land  where the house is situated is sloping. Gardens were cretated in two plane by terracing. The garden was surrounded by 5 meter height rubble stone wall. There are garden entrances on the north, south and west sides of garden. Today, garden entrances from street were closed. There are ten date palm tree, five palm tree, seventeen medlar tree, twenty citrus and two olive tree in the garden. There are also  a water well and a pool on the upper level garden. Three annex building is located on the garden.   City wall and a constellation is located on the upper level of garden. There are ancient column pieces, marble block and collecting material pieces on the wall pattern of constellation. North facade of the constellation looks Ömer Lütfü Lülü House garden and the entrance of constellation is from garden. There is acces from Mermerli Banyo Street to the yard with stairs. There are four rooms and a yard on the ground floor. The yard is the entrance hall of the house and circulation to upper floors and the rooms is from the yard. There are wooden pillars which carry the upper floor, on the east side of the yard. A sustaining wall was built at the south of the yard because of difference of levels between yard floor and garden. Stone stairs, which supplies the acces to the upper floors, exists on the south of the yard. There is a fountain under the stone landing on the south of the yard. Appendix building which has two storey was built after main building was constructed. Ground floor of the appendix building is he same level with garden. North side of  appendix building adjacent tothe main building and the west side adjacent to garden wall. South wall of appendix building is wood, west wall is rubble stone. The appendix building has three rooms and one of the rooms is kitchen. The building block relation between stairs,  landing and garden.   Acces of the room on the half floor is supplied by gateway from wooden stairs. Headway of the half floor room is lower than other rooms. The half floor room was used as store, janitor room or winter room. There are thirteen rooms on the first floor. The hall on the first floor has four iwan  but nothern iwan was closed with a wall. Acces of other rooms is supplied  from the hall. The rooms which has oriel are located on the north side of the hall and these rooms are symmetrical. There is a door which supplies access to additional building on the south iwan of the hall. First floor of appendix building is the same level with first floor of main building. There are kitchen, bath and toilet in the appendix building part. It is observed that there is deflexion on the eastern iwan of the hall. It is considered that the reason of deflexion is intervention to ground floor wooden pillars. The main door of the building is on the middle axis of the north facade which is located on Mermerli Banyo Street. The main door differentiate with material, ornamentand relief and the doorway is arched. There are two oriels on the north facade and an oriel on the west facade. The oriel which is located on the south facade is supported by wooden pillars. There is also an additional building on the south facade. Wooden pillars are closed by a wall on the east facade. The roof was tempered to appendix building on the south part of the roof. Ground floor and first floor windows are bigger than half floor windows on the facades. There are in built cupboards in the rooms especially on the first floor. It is seen plaster ornaments above the windows and niches.  Hand-drawn ornaments exist on the walls of some rooms on the first floor but these hand-drawn ornaments is not original. Ceiling and floor of the rooms are wooden material. One of the rooms on the ground floor has plaster ceiling. Yard's floor is <b>screed</b> <b>concrete</b> material.   Construction techniques of the house is similar with Turkish House construction techniques. Foundation, ground floor and half floor are built stone masonry, first floor is built wooden frame. Rubble stone and cut stone is used on the walls. Cut stone is used on the chamfered corner of the buildings. Exterior surface of buildings is plastered. Ömer Lütfü Lülü House used for different functions over the years and it was seen some interventions. Additional building was built on the south facade of the house in the  first half of the 20. century. It is considered that the additional building which has wc, bath and kitchen in it, was built because of requirements of the house owners. The bearing system was interfered in the second half of the 20. century. Therefore, there is structural problems in the house today. Changes on original plan typology was made by interventions on the walls, door and windows. The house is also exposed to external conditions beside user interventions. The damages of the house are classified as material damages, structural damages, biological damages and damages occured by user interventions. Chronological analyses is maded before restitution work. First period which is the original situation of the house is worked as restitution. It is used signs from building, typologic study and source study. Original plan typology of the building, original facades and original details were analyzed.   It is used  traces of building and typologic analyses while restitution project. It could nort reached  any visual material but oral sources was used. It was enough traces of building and typologic analyses while restitution of Ömer Lütfü Lülü House. However, itcould not said strong conclusion on the restitution of garden because of less of source about Antalya houses' gardens. The garden of Ömer Lütfü Lülü House is also different from other houses' gardens.   It is classified functional suggestions and  repairment suggestions while restoration project. Social balance was changed where the house is located, because of  the tourism. It is considered that Ömer Lütfü Lülü House could not maintain original function anymore because Kaleiçi region has tourism function. First, it is considered that the function of house can be a museum. Because of existence of other buildings which has museum function, the idea was given up. Most of old buildings' function is changed as otel in Kaleiçi because of tourism. Ömer Lütfü Lülü House's function also changed as otel on restoration decisions. Our ambition is being a good instance for old building otel projects.  It is also offered long term repairment and continuous maintenance of building.   The house is documented with surveying, material and damage analyses were made, restitution and restoration projects of the house were prepared. The problems because of wrong interventions, damages on structural elements and material threaten existence of the building. Therefore, it is offered suitable intervention which does not affect original properties. The building, which is unused nowadays, remains the original details. Preparing restoration project of Ömer Lütfü Lülü House which has remarkable appearance of the region, according to the principles of contemporary restoration is the main target of thesis.
