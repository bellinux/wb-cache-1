40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of {{bilateral}} tariff reductions on the profitability of cost-reducing horizontal mergers. Given Cournot competition in a two-country world, for any positive tariff below a certain threshold, marginal trade liberalization is shown to encourage only those domestic mergers with sufficiently large <b>cost-savings</b> and to discourage the rest. For tariffs close to, but smaller than, the prohibitive tariff, however, marginal trade liberalization necessarily encourages all domestic mergers. Moreover, we show that for a given level of <b>cost-savings,</b> the impact of marginal trade liberalization may not reliably predict that of nonmarginal liberalization. Although at high tariffs, domestic mergers are shown to be unambiguously more profitable than cross-border mergers, near free trade, mergers which yield the most <b>cost-savings</b> become the most profitable. Thus, when comparing domestic and cross-border mergers, trade liberalization encourages the type which yields the most <b>cost-savings.</b> Copyright � 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation � 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many <b>cost-saving</b> measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E

40|$|Background: Sustained {{efforts at}} {{preventing}} diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and subsequent leg amputations are sporadic in most {{health care systems}} despite the high costs associated with such complications. We sought to estimate effectiveness targets at which <b>cost-savings</b> (i. e. improved health outcomes at decreased total costs) might occur. Methods: A Markov model with probabilistic sensitivity analyses was used to simulate the five-year survival, incidence of foot complications, and total health care costs in a hypothetical population of 100, 000 people with diabetes. Clinical event and cost estimates were obtained from previously-published trials and studies. A population without previous DFU but with 17 % neuropathy and 11 % peripheral artery disease (PAD) prevalence was assumed. Primary prevention (PP) was defined as reducing initial DFU incidence. Results: PP was more than 90 % likely to provide <b>cost-savings</b> when annual prevention costs are less than $ 50 /person and/or annual DFU incidence is reduced by at least 25 %. Efforts directed at patients with diabetes who were at moderate or high risk for DFUs were very likely to provide <b>cost-savings</b> if DFU incidence was decreased by at least 10 % and/or the cost was less than $ 150 per person per year. Conclusions: Low-cost DFU primary prevention efforts producing even small decreases in DFU incidence may provide the best opportunity for <b>cost-savings,</b> especially if focused on patients with neuropathy and/or PAD. Mobile phone-based reminders, self-identification of risk factors (ex. Ipswich touch test), and written brochures may be among such low-cost interventions that should be investigated for <b>cost-savings</b> potential...|$|R

The number of jurors required for certain cases was reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting jury duty. Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by local law enforcement. Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state property tax was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.|$|E

40|$|A 12 -month {{trial of}} teledentistry was {{conducted}} in two general dental practices (one in the Orkney Islands {{and one in the}} Scottish Highlands at Kingussie). The dental practices had a PC-based videoconferencing link, connected by ISDN at 128 kbit/s, to a restorative specialist at a hospital in Aberdeen. Twenty-five patients were recruited into the trial. A cost-minimization analysis was undertaken by comparing the costs of teledentistry with two alternatives: outreach visits, where the specialist regularly visited the remote communities, and hospital visits, where patients in remote communities travelled to hospital for consultation. For Orkney patients, dental teleconsultations cost the National Health Service (NHS) an additional 36 per patient compared with outreach visits, but <b>cost-savings</b> of 270 per patient could be achieved compared with hospital visits. For Kingussie patients, teleconsultations cost the NHS an additional 44 and there were <b>cost-savings</b> of 1. 54 compared with outreach visits and hospitals visits, respectively. However, patients incurred additional costs for radiographs and photographs, and the general dental practitioner incurred additional preparation time costs. When the value of patient time was included, there were <b>cost-savings</b> of around 900 per Orkney patient compared with hospital visits, but compared with outreach visits teledentistry cost an additional 180 per patient. Based on the trial data, there were no <b>cost-savings</b> from teledentistry for Kingussie patients, even when the value of time was included. These results were relatively robust in a sensitivity analysis. However, we estimated that the cost-effectiveness of teledentistry would improve with greater familiarity and use of equipment. Benefits and <b>cost-savings</b> would be greatest in island or remote communities, where patients have to travel long distances to hospital for specialist consultations.

5|$|Democrats won a {{majority}} in the Indiana House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections. This caused Indiana to have a divided government, with Democrats controlling the Indiana House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor's office and the Indiana Senate. This also lead to a stalemate in the budget debate, which caused Mitch Daniels call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly. The state was faced with a $1 billion shortfall in revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and <b>cost-saving</b> measures in his budget proposal. The General Assembly approved some of his proposals, but relied heavily on the state's reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall. Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.|$|E

5|$|One {{was that}} under the law, seniors could be denied care due to their age and the other that the {{government}} would advise seniors to end their lives instead of receiving care. The ostensible basis of these claims was the provision for an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB).

In fact, the Board was prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments to certain providers before 2020, and was prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes that would result in rationing.|$|E

5|$|Science Fantasy, {{which also}} {{appeared}} under the titles Impulse and SF Impulse, was a British fantasy and science fiction magazine, launched in 1950 by Nova Publications as {{a companion to}} Nova's New Worlds. Walter Gillings was editor {{for the first two}} issues, and was then replaced by John Carnell, the editor of New Worlds, as a <b>cost-saving</b> measure. Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964. The titles were acquired by Roberts & Vinter, who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit Science Fantasy; Bonfiglioli changed the title to Impulse in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable. The title was changed again to SF Impulse for the last few issues. Science Fantasy ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|The Maschinenpistole 40 ("Machine pistol 40") {{descended from}} its {{predecessor}} the MP 38, {{which was in}} turn based on the MP 36, a prototype made of machined steel. The MP 36 was developed independently by Erma Werke's Berthold Geipel with funding from the German Army. It took design elements from Heinrich Vollmer's VPM 1930 and EMP. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype to answer a request from the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 36, and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38, with certain <b>cost-saving</b> alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts.|$|E
