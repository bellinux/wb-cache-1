Before filming began, Mecca attempted to research the biographies of Dahlan and his wife, as she and the other young actors did not {{know much about the}} couple. However, she found such research difficult as the libraries did not have the information she needed.|$|E

5|$|Digging for Fire {{features}} an ensemble cast, the largest Swanberg {{had worked with}} at the time. He and Johnson cast the film by contacting friends and other actors who they knew had enjoyed their previous film together, Drinking Buddies. Rosemarie DeWitt and Swanberg decided to work together after her husband, Ron Livingston, starred in Drinking Buddies. Unlike the other actors, Orlando Bloom was cast through an agent. Swanberg <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> own son, Jude, as the three-year-old son of the lead characters.|$|E
5|$|Having secured his party's nomination, Tydings {{moved forward}} to face Beall {{in the general}} {{election}}. The final election results gave Tydings nearly 63% of 1,081,042 votes <b>cast.</b> <b>His</b> large margin of victory was due {{at least in part}} to the landslide win by fellow Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson for President in the same election, which likely increased voter turnout.|$|E
5|$|Production of Tiga Dara {{began in}} 1956. Chitra Dewi, Mieke Wijaya, and Indriati Iskak were {{cast as the}} titular maidens.

Iskak, the 14-year-old daughter of film director Raden Iskak, made her feature film debut with Tiga Dara. Supporting roles were filled by Fifi Young, Rendra Karno, Hassan Sanusi, Bambang Irawan, and Roosilawaty. For the role of Joni, Ismail <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> real-life son, Irwan Usmar Ismail.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1841, Meyerbeer had {{completed}} {{the first draft of}} Le prophète, but refused to stage it because the then director of the opera, Leon Pillet, wished to <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> mistress, Rosine Stoltz, in the part of Fidès, the hero's mother. (Berlioz characterised Stoltz as 'la Directrice du Directeur'). Meyerbeer insisted on Pauline Viardot for the role. Meyerbeer lodged the score with a Parisian lawyer, and refused to countenance any production until his wishes were met. It was not until 1849 when the Opéra was willing to agree his conditions. Meyerbeer was unique in his time in having the wealth and influence to impose his will as a composer in this way.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{remained}} in the Senate for several months after his election as commissioner {{because he wanted to}} <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> vote on the Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement and the Charter of the United Nations. He received only his Senate salary until his resignation on November 1, 1945, despite claims to the contrary by the press. Nevertheless, his delay in assuming the commissioner's job upset many team owners, as did his late arrival to Game 3 of the 1945 World Series, which rendered him unavailable to rule on whether the weather was clement enough to begin the game. Many owners believed Chandler had been attending a political meeting; the actual cause of his delay was his attendance at a Detroit Athletic Club luncheon, where he was representing Major League Baseball.|$|E
5|$|Duchovny cast {{several of}} The X-Files {{technical}} crew {{members in the}} episode. Tina M. Amedrui, the show's actual craft services woman, portrayed Tina, the craft service woman for Wayne Federman's movie. Bill Roe, the show's photography director, was cast as the vegetarian zombie. Assistant director Barry K. Thomas was cast {{as one of the}} men on the movie set, Paul Rabwin was cast as a producer, and special effects coordinator Bill Millar was cast as the movie's director. Duchovny also <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> brother, Daniel, as the assistant director.

5|$|In early 2007, Thiagarajan {{approached}} M. Karunanidhi {{with the}} intention of making a film on his adaptation of the Ponnar Shankar epic that he had written in the late 1970s. The latter accepted Thiagarajan's offer and approved of his decision to <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> son, Prashanth, in the dual lead roles. In July2008, the project was officially announced in a press meet. The film subsequently began pre-production, with Thyagarajan opting to produce the film under his Sri Lakshmi Shanthi Films banner. The preliminary stages of the production took more than a year, with story-boarding, costume designs and colossal set designs all being finalized. Prashanth revealed that extensive research about the time period alone took a year and a half.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet was not {{enthusiastic}} about secession from the Union, {{but he had}} long been infused {{with the concept of}} states' rights, and felt he could not go against his homeland. Although he was born in South Carolina and reared in Georgia, he offered his services to the state of Alabama, which had appointed him to West Point and where his mother still lived. Furthermore, he was the senior West Point graduate from that state, which implied a commensurate rank in the state's forces would be available. After settling his accounts, he resigned from the U.S. Army on May 8, 1861 to <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> lot with the Confederacy in the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 1942 Driberg <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> first {{vote in the}} House of Commons, {{in support}} of Churchill against a rebel motion of censure on the government's conduct of the war. The rebels' case was put incompetently, which ensured that the motion gained only 25 votes, as against 477 cast for the government. Driberg {{delivered}} his maiden speech on 7 July, in a debate {{on the use of}} propaganda. He called for the lifting of the ban on the Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, which he saw as a potentially valuable weapon of home propaganda.|$|E

5|$|Under the new constitution, each of Kentucky's {{legislative}} districts chose an elector, {{and these}} electors voted {{to choose the}} governor. Both Logan and Garrard were chosen as electors from their respective counties. On the first ballot, Logan received the votes of 21 electors, Garrard received 17, and Todd received 14. A lone elector <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> vote for John Brown, a Frankfort attorney who would soon be elected to the U.S. Senate. Some speculated that Garrard's moral character prevented him from voting for himself, but his political acumen prevented him from voting for a rival, so he voted for Brown, who had not declared his candidacy. No proof exists {{that this was the}} case, however.|$|E
5|$|White {{received}} his early {{education in the}} public schools of Romney, and attended Romney's Potomac Academy. At the age of 16, he began his career in public service serving as the Deputy Clerk of Court in the office of his father, Christian Streit White, who was then serving as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County. In 1894, White graduated from Potomac Academy at the age of 18. Two years later, he began studying jurisprudence at the West Virginia University College of Law in Morgantown. He graduated from the West Virginia University College of Law in 1899, earning a Bachelor of Laws degree. White <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> first vote for Democratic Party presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan in the United States presidential election of 1900.|$|E
5|$|White {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the House of Burgesses in Williamsburg from 1772 to 1773, {{representing}} Hampshire County. White served with Patrick Henry; Henry reportedly never <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> vote without first consulting with White. White was an eloquent public speaker, and due to his Scottish Presbyterian background, he was strongly opposed to the colonial government's preferential support of the Church of England in Virginia. Because of this stance, White presented a resolution before the House of Burgesses regarding the separation of church and state. According to historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher, White is the first man in what is now the United States to present a resolution to a legislature regarding the freedom of religion.|$|E

5|$|After Cedar Creek, {{the army}} {{stayed in the}} {{vicinity}} through election day, when McKinley <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> first presidential ballot, for the incumbent Republican, Abraham Lincoln. The next day, they moved north up the valley into winter quarters near Kernstown. In February 1865, Crook was captured by Confederate raiders. Crook's capture added to the confusion as the army was reorganized for the spring campaign, and McKinley found himself serving on the staffs of four different generals over the next fifteen days—Crook, John D. Stevenson, Samuel S. Carroll, and Winfield S. Hancock. Finally assigned to Carroll's staff again, McKinley acted as the general's first and only adjutant. Lee and his army surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant a few days later, effectively ending the war. McKinley found time to join a Freemason lodge (later renamed after him) in Winchester, Virginia, before he and Carroll were transferred to Hancock's First Veterans Corps in Washington. Just before the war's end, McKinley received his final promotion, a brevet commission as major. In July, the Veterans Corps was mustered out of service, and McKinley and Carroll were relieved of their duties. Carroll and Hancock encouraged McKinley {{to apply for a}} place in the peacetime army, but he declined and returned to Ohio the following month.|$|E
5|$|Gebhard's {{eventual}} defeat {{changed the}} balance of power in the Electoral College of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1589, Ernst of Bavaria became uncontested Prince-elector of Cologne, the first Wittelsbach to hold the position. Wittelsbach authority in northwestern German territories endured until the mid-18th century, with the election of a succession of Bavarian princes to the archbishop's throne and to the Prince-Elector's seat. This gave the family two voices in the choice of imperial candidates, which had ramifications in the 18th century. In 1740, Charles Albert, Duke of Bavaria, laid claim to the imperial title; his brother Klemens August of Bavaria, then the Archbishop and Prince-elector, <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> vote for Charles and personally crowned him at Frankfurt am Main. The shift of the emperor's orb from the House of Habsburg to the Wittelsbach family, albeit a brief event, was only resolved by the ascension of Maximilian III Joseph who, with the Treaty of Füssen, eschewed any imperial pretensions.|$|E
5|$|Kuykendall was {{a lifelong}} Democrat, and he <b>cast</b> <b>his</b> first vote for Democratic Party presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan in the United States presidential {{election}} of 1900. Kuykendall served one term {{as the chairman}} of the Executive Committee of West Virginia's 2nd congressional district and was elected to three terms {{as the chairman of}} the Hampshire County Democratic Party Central Committee. In 1916, Kuykendall was a delegate to the West Virginia Democratic Party State Convention at Parkersburg that nominated John J. Cornwell as the party's gubernatorial candidate. He was also both a delegate and chairman of the West Virginia Democratic Party's Congressional Convention that nominated William Gay Brown, Jr., as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives. Kuykendall was a strong proponent of Brown, whom he supported in subsequent conventions and elections. He was also a presidential elector in the Electoral College during the reelection of Woodrow Wilson.|$|E
