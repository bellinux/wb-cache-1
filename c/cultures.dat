The increasingly common within the Przeworsk culture area presence of objects made by the Jastorf people reflects penetration by their population.

To this end, this study employed group <b>culture,</b> hierarchical <b>culture,</b> development <b>culture,</b> and rational <b>culture,</b> which were presented by Kimberly & Quinn (1984) as organizational <b>culture</b> types, as independent variables, and employed job satisfaction and organizational commitment as dependent vari*ables. The result was that semiconductor industry recognized organizational <b>culture</b> in order of rational <b>culture,</b> group <b>culture,</b> development <b>culture</b> and hierarchical <b>culture,</b> and showed a high level of affective commitment, but a low level of normative commitment.

5|$|Among {{the first}} devices {{external}} to the human body that are considered instruments are rattles, stampers, and various drums. These earliest instruments evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such as dancing. Eventually, some <b>cultures</b> assigned ritual functions to their musical instruments, using them for hunting and various ceremonies. Those <b>cultures</b> developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets. Some of these labels carry far different connotations from those used in modern day; early flutes and trumpets are so-labeled for their basic operation and function rather than any resemblance to modern instruments. Among early <b>cultures</b> for whom drums developed ritual, even sacred importance are the Chukchi people of the Russian Far East, the indigenous people of Melanesia, and many <b>cultures</b> of Africa. In fact, drums were pervasive throughout every African culture. One East African tribe, the Wahinda, believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person other than the sultan.|$|E
