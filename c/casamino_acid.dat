Removal of hazardous pollutants is important to reduce the ecological, social and economic loss caused by the direct discharge of waste into environment.

The heavy metals tolerance analysis and carbon or/and nitrogen utilization tests on Escherichia sp. were conducted at 37 ºC by measuring the absorbance (OD 600 nm). The results obtained for heavy metals tolerance suggested that this bacterium can tolerate well against both zinc and copper concentrations up to 100 mg/L and manganese up to 500 mg/L. This strain exhibited intolerance against cobalt and aluminium concentrations starting from 60 mg/L and 400 mg/L respectively. Based on the carbon utilization tests, highest growth (OD 600 nm= 0. 695) was observed in glycerol containing medium. When kerosene, benzene and sulfanilic acid was supplied as the sole carbon source in medium, no growth was observed. The maximum growth (OD 600 nm) of Escherichia sp. in <b>casamino</b> <b>acid</b> as sole nitrogen source and the sole carbon and nitrogen source are 0. 282 and 0. 168 respectively.

Some {{effects of}} carbon source, aeration, and {{temperature}} on {{growth of a}} psychrophilic strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens. J. Bacteriol. 86 : 429 – 433. 1963. —A psychrophilic strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens was grown in stationary and aerated culture at 4, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 32 C. Generation times were determined for cultures growing in media containing glucose, monosodium citrate, or <b>Casamino</b> <b>Acids</b> as the primary carbon and energy source. The results indicated that growth on <b>Casamino</b> <b>Acids</b> with aeration contributed to significantly shorter generation times at low temperatures when compared with other media systems. Furthermore, temperature coefficients (Q 10 values) calculated from growth-velocity data showed {{that the effects of}} temperature on growth rate are influenced by the carbon source in the growth medium and by aeration...|$|R
