[...] In Britain before 1857 wives were under the economic and legal control of their husbands, and divorce was almost impossible. It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps £200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford. [...] It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty. [...] The first key legislative victory came with the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England. [...] The new law made divorce a <b>civil</b> <b>affair</b> of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases. [...] The process was still quite expensive, at about £40, but now became feasible for the middle class. [...] A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a feme sole, with full control of her own civil rights. [...] Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace. [...] The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.|$|E

During this span, <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> operations have evolved from operations conducted only by combat units to those conducted by a dedicated <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> force. The demand for <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> has increased significantly since September 11, 2001, and in response to that demand, the Army has attempted to grow the <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> force in both the active and reserve components. The rapid growth in demand for <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> has {{led to the creation of}} a <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> force composed of one active-duty <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> special-operations brigade, one active-duty <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> brigade for conventional forces, and nine reserve <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> brigades.

30|$|The {{need for}} {{long-term}} care is excluded from the medical insurance reform, which requires the reform in medical welfare to expand from alleviating financial risk in illness to responding to comprehensive risk in health (including physical and psychological functions). One available option is to construct a home-and-community-based long-term care system since institutional care for disabled elderly is expensive and cannot be fully afforded by frail elders. Some community-based integration models have emerged in the USA, such as OnLok, Green House, California Tri-City Elder Coalition, and Age Friendly New York City, and have integrated health and social service resources in the communities. In China, the community health centers mainly provide public health and treatment services but lack psychological health, geriatrics, and other comprehensive health services. However, they are gradually starting to carry out chronic disease management. In addition, despite providing entertainment activities and household services, the aged-care system in the community administrated by <b>Civil</b> <b>Affair</b> Departments lacks professional services delivered by social workers. Accordingly, the development of socialized long-term care in the communities should be promoted through the means of strengthening the human capital training, improving quality-monitoring programs, expanding the functions of day-care centers, increasing governmental investments in social service affairs, and establishing a program of tax incentives for the social service industry (Wu and Xu 2007). To achieve these goals, a monitoring mechanism should be established to integrate community resources and initiate a comprehensive healthcare and long-term care system.|$|E
40|$|War {{causes and}} conduct have fascinated war planners, war executors and {{scholars}} {{for a long}} time because little attention has been given to how wars are ended. This oversight is apparent not only in historical accounts of warfare but, more importantly, in contemporary analyses and doctrinal formulations of deterrence and overall defense policies. Just as historians have focused on how wars begin and are fought, military analysts and planners have concentrated on influencing the initiation and conduct of warfare rather than on analyzing the process and requirements for terminating warfare on acceptable terms and at acceptable costs. Conflict termination is the formal end of fighting, not the end of conflict. Despite the volumes of research and literature on the subject, belligerents mismanage war termination. The major objective of wartime strategy is defeating enemy arms as quickly as possible with the least cost in friendly casualties. As long as hostilities endure, diplomacy is subordinated to military requirements. War termination planning, as it is currently accomplished, takes the form of <b>civil</b> <b>affair</b> planning on the details of how the vanquished will be managed following the capitulation of the enemy and cessation of hostilities.
