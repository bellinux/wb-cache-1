5000|$|Typically {{the disease}} affects a child between {{six months and}} two years of age, and begins with a sudden high fever (39-40 °C; 102.2-104 °F).

After a few days the fever subsides, and just as the child appears to be recovering, a red rash appears. This usually begins on the trunk, spreading to the legs and neck. The rash is not itchy and may last 1 to 2 days.

50|$|M. pneumoniae {{is known}} to cause a host of {{symptoms}} such as primary atypical pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, and upper respiratory tract disease. Primary atypical pneumonia {{is one of the}} most severe types of manifestation, with tracheobronchitis being the most common symptom and another 15% of cases, usually adults, remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic infections tend to develop over a period of several days and manifestation of pneumonia can be confused with a number of other bacterial pathogens and conditions that cause pneumonia. Tracheobronchitis is most common in children due to a reduced immune system capacity, and up to 18% of infected children require hospitalization. Common mild symptoms include sore throat, wheezing and coughing, fever, headache, <b>coryza,</b> myalgia and feelings of unease, in which symptom intensity and duration can be limited by early treatment with antibiotics. Rarely, M. pneumoniae pneumonia results in death due to lesions and ulceration of the epithelial lining, pulmonary edema, and bronchiolitis obliterans. Extrapulmonary symptoms such as autoimmune responses, central nervous system complications, and dermatological disorders have been associated with M. pneumoniae infections in up to 25% of cases.|$|E

50|$|The laws {{of memory}} {{are subject to}} the more general laws of habit. Habit is a {{compromise}} effected between the individual and his environment, or between the individual and his own organic eccentricities, the guarantee of a dull inviolability, the lightning-conductor of his existence. Habit is the ballast that chains the dog to his vomit. Breathing is habit. Life is habit. Or rather life is a succession of habits, since the individual is a succession of individuals; the world being a projection of the individual’s consciousness (an objectivation of the individual’s will, Schopenhauer would say), the pact must be continually renewed, the letter of safe-conduct brought up to date. The creation of the world did not take place once and for all time, but takes place every day. Habit then is the generic term for the countless treaties concluded between the countless subjects that constitute the individual and their countless correlative objects. The periods of transition that separate consecutive adaptations (because by no expedient of macabre transubstantiation can the grave-sheets serve as swaddling-clothes) represent the perilous zones {{in the life of the}} individual, dangerous, precarious, painful, mysterious and fertile, when for a moment the boredom of living is replaced by the suffering of being. (At this point, and with a heavy heart and for the satisfaction or disgruntlement of Gideans, semi and integral, I am inspired to concede a brief parenthesis to all the analogivorous, who are capable of interpreting the ‘Live dangerously,’ that victorious hiccough in vacuo, as the national anthem of the true ego exiled in habit. The Gideans advocate a habit of living—and look for an epithet. A nonsensical bastard phrase. An automatic adjustment of the human organism to the conditions of its existence has as little moral significance as the casting of a clout when May is or is not out; and the exhortation to cultivate a habit as little sense as an exhortation to cultivate a <b>coryza.)</b> The suffering of being: that is, the free play of every faculty. Because the pernicious devotion of habit paralyses our attention, drugs those handmaidens of perception whose co-operation is not absolutely essential.|$|E

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper on fowl <b>coryza</b> {{it was noted}} that the disease {{produced}} by the intranasal injection of normal birds with exudate from the upper air passages of naturally infected fowl could be divided into three types. Type I was characterized by a rapid onset and short duration, type II by a slow onset and long duration, and type III by a rapid onset and long duration (1). A Gram-negative bacillus corresponding to the hemophilic bacterium originally described by De Blieck was regularly isolated from birds infeetedwith type I <b>coryza</b> (2, 3). There is reason tobelieve that this bacillus, now known as Henwphil~ ga~linarum, was the only etiologic factor involved. The relation of H. ga~li~zrum to the type III <b>coryza</b> with which it was also associated was less clearly defined. Recently isolated cultures were invariably infective but produced a <b>coryza</b> of short duration in contrast to the prolonged course of the <b>coryza</b> produced by exudate. Confusing irregularities were also observed following the injection of exudate in birds which had recovered from the <b>coryza</b> produced by H. gaEinarum. We had previously suggested that the differences between the coryzas produced by H. galtinarum and type III exudate might be referable to a degradation in virulence induced by artificial cultivation of the bacillus (1). This suggestion was made before the etiology of type II <b>coryza</b> had been worked out. With the demonstration that this type was caused by minute Gram-negative cells termed coccobacilliform bodies, another explanation was offered (4) : namely, that the type III <b>coryza</b> might be due to a mixed infection with these 847 848 UNCOMPLICATED <b>CORYZA</b> OF DOMESTIC]FOWL.

The disease is seen most commonly in adult chickens and can cause a very significant reduction in the rate of egg production. Considering the economic importance of the disease, the present research pursuit was undertaken with the aim to isolate H. paragallinarum from the suspected cases of Infectious <b>coryza</b> in commercial poultry farms in Gujarat state with reference to their cultural, morphological characterization and antimicrobial drug sensitivity patterns.
