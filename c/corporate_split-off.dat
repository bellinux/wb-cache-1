40|$|AbstractThis study {{dealt with}} {{organizational}} commitment, {{as a result}} of integration strategy along with the effect of transformational leadership in the context of <b>corporate</b> <b>split-off.</b> A research model analyzing <b>corporate</b> <b>split-off</b> in terms of organizational commitment was proposed and empirically tested. Integration strategy included job security, equity, transparency, and communication. Transformation leadership consisted of idealized influence, individualized consideration, inspirational motivation, and intellectual stimulation. In addition, this study hypothesized the differing effects of integration strategy and transformational leadership on affective commitment, depending on the status of the organizational members, i. e., managers vs. employees. The results of this study showed that all the factors of integration strategy were relevant to influence affective organizational commitment. Inspirational motivation and individualized consideration were statistically relevant to explain affective commitment. The moderating effect of organizational status was also identified...|$|E

It is widely believed that divisions are essential to business planning; thus, tax-free treatment promotes business flexibility. Yet, an untaxed division may allow tax avoidance through 2 ̆ 2 bail-out 2 ̆ 2 of corporate earnings and profits at capital gain rates...|$|R
40|$|If {{specified}} conditions are satisfied, the Internal Revenue Code provides nonrecognition for gain or loss realized when stocks and securities of one corporation are exchanged for stocks and securities of another corporation. When the exchange is made {{as part of}} a <b>corporate</b> division (a <b>split-off</b> or a split-up), the principal nonrecognition provision is section 355; and when the exchange is made {{as part of a}}n acquisitive reorganization, the principal nonrecognition provision is section 354. Complete nonrecognition is provided only when stock is exchanged solely for stock and securities are exchanged solely for securities of no greater principal amount. If, in addition to receiving property that is permitted to be received without recognizing gain or loss, a taxpayer also receives other property (property that does not qualify for nonrecognition), the other property is sometimes referred to as ‘‘boot. ’’ When a taxpayer receives both nonrecognition property and boot in either a qualified corporate division or an acquisitive reorganization, nonrecognition is not necessarily lost entirely. In those cases, except for a so-called ‘‘B’’ acquisitive reorganization, section 356 provides that no loss can be recognized, and that realized gain will be recognized only to the extent of the boot received. The determination of whether any recognized gain is to be characterized as capital gain or as ordinary income turns on the operation of section 356 (a) (2) and is not discussed in this article...|$|R
