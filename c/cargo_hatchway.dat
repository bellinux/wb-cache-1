50|$|The main <b>cargo</b> <b>hatchway</b> {{was located}} {{forward of the}} main mast. Additional {{hatchways}} were placed at the bow and stern. Bragozzo was typically 8 to 12meters in length. Its freeboard was generally between 0.5 and 1 meter. It did not typically tow or carry a dinghy. Its dead-weight was {{in the range of}} 10 to 20 tons.|$|E
60|$|The captain superintended {{the setting}} {{up of the}} rigging, and the getting of the ship into working order; while the under {{officers}} saw to the hoisting in and storing of the cargo. Gangs of men were at work tarring {{the sides of the}} ship, for she had only two days before returned from a trip to Spain; and a number of sailors were unloading the <b>cargo</b> from one <b>hatchway,</b> while her fresh freight was being taken in at the other.|$|R
40|$|Access {{to space}} {{is still a}} {{challenge}} for many types of small spacecraft, especially for small un-encapsulated microsatellites. Altius Space Machines and NanoRacks LLC are developing the HatchBasket™ SmallSat deployment system, which leverages elements of the International Space Station (ISS) ecosystem to: provide additional launch opportunities for small spacecraft, address the short lifetime of payloads launched directly from the ISS, and provide additional unique services for technology demonstration launches. HatchBasket is a spacecraft deployer carrier system that: flies to ISS as pressurized cargo in a cargo vehicle such as Orbital Sciences Cygnus or the JAXA HTV, is installed by the ISS crew into the <b>cargo</b> vehicle’s <b>hatchway</b> {{in lieu of the}} pressure hatch prior to departure of the cargo vehicle from the ISS, and deploys payloads in a controlled manner after the cargo vehicle has maneuvered to the desired orbit (below ISS altitude and up to 500 km circular altitude). This paper will discuss the physical concept for the HatchBasket system, the concept of operations for satellite deployment missions, some of the unique capabilities that can be provided by HatchBasket for technology demonstrations and other payloads, as well as the current status of HatchBasket development...|$|R
60|$|This voyage, {{of which}} the details need not be given, we had to range far afield for {{sufficient}} reasons. Coming up from the South to end it with the important and really dangerous part of the scheme in hand, we {{found it necessary to}} look into Barcelona for certain definite information. This appears like running one's head into the very jaws of the lion, but in reality it was not so. We had one or two high, influential friends there, and many others humble but valuable because bought for good hard cash. We were in no danger of being molested; indeed, the important information reached us promptly by the hands of a Custom-house officer, who came on board full of showy zeal to poke an iron rod into the layer of oranges which made the visible part of our <b>cargo</b> in the <b>hatchway.</b>|$|R
