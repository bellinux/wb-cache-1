500|$|The species Canis lupus {{was first}} {{recorded}} by Carl Linnaeus in his publication Systema Naturae in 1758, with the Latin classification translating into the English words [...] "dog wolf". The thirty-seven subspecies of Canis lupus are listed under the designated common name of [...] "wolf" [...] in Mammal Species of the World third edition {{that was published}} in 2005. The nominate subspecies is the Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), {{also known as the}} <b>common</b> <b>wolf.</b> The subspecies includes the domestic dog, dingo, eastern wolf and red wolf, but lists C. l. italicus and C. l. communis as synonyms of C. l. lupus. However, the classification of several as either species or subspecies has recently been challenged.|$|E
6000|$|Exact {{measurements}} of large series of comparable skulls of the mammalia {{are not easily}} found, but from those available I have prepared three diagrams (Figs. 14, 15, and 16), in order to exhibit the facts of variation in this very important organ. The first shows the variation in ten specimens of the <b>common</b> <b>wolf</b> (Canis lupus) from one district in North America, {{and we see that}} it is not only large in amount, but that each part exhibits a considerable independent variability.[23] ...|$|E
60|$|Wolves, alas, like bandits, seem to {{flee the}} traveller's advance; and you may trudge through all our {{comfortable}} Europe, and not meet with an adventure worth the name. But here, if anywhere, a man was on the frontiers of hope. For this was {{the land of the}} ever-memorable BEAST, the Napoleon Bonaparte of wolves. What a career was his! He lived ten months at free quarters in Gevaudan and Vivarais; he ate women and children and 'shepherdesses celebrated for their beauty'; he pursued armed horsemen; he has been seen at broad noonday chasing a post-chaise and outrider along the king's high-road, and chaise and outrider fleeing before him at the gallop. He was placarded like a political offender, and ten thousand francs were offered for his head. And yet, when he was shot and sent to Versailles, behold! a <b>common</b> <b>wolf,</b> and even small for that. 'Though I could reach from pole to pole,' sang Alexander Pope; the Little Corporal shook Europe; and if all wolves had been as this wolf, they would have changed the history of man. M. Elie Berthet has made him the hero of a novel, which I have read, and do not wish to read again.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, this wolf was re-classified as Canis lupus occidentalis, the Mackenzie Valley <b>wolf,</b> <b>common</b> with <b>wolves</b> in Alaska and Western Canada.|$|R

60|$|Extent and Limitations of Specific Areas.--Leaving for {{the present}} these cases of want of {{continuity}} in a species, we find the most wide difference between the extent of country occupied, varying in fact from a few square miles to almost the entire land surface of the globe. Among the mammalia, however, the same species seldom inhabits both {{the old and new}} worlds, unless they are strictly arctic animals, as the reindeer, the elk, the arctic fox, the glutton, the ermine, and some others. The <b>common</b> <b>wolf</b> of Europe and Northern Asia is thought by many naturalists to be identical with the variously coloured wolves of North America extending from the Arctic Ocean to Mexico, in which case this will have perhaps the widest range of any species of mammal. Little doubt exists as to the identity of the brown bears and the beavers of Europe and North America; but all these species range up to the arctic circle, and there is no example of a mammal universally admitted to be identical yet confined to the temperate zones of the two hemispheres. Among the undisputed species of mammalia the leopard has an enormous range, extending all over Africa and South Asia to Borneo and the east of China, and thus having probably the widest range of any known mammal. The winged mammalia have not usually very wide ranges, there being only one bat common to the Old and New Worlds. This is a British species, Vesperugo serotinus, which is found over the larger part of North America, Europe and Asia, as far {15} as Pekin, and even extends into tropical Africa, thus rivalling the leopard and the wolf in the extent of country it occupies.|$|E
6000|$|Turning to the Old World, some European dogs closely {{resemble}} the wolf; thus the shepherd dog of {{the plains of}} Hungary is white or reddish-brown, has a sharp nose, short, erect ears, shaggy coat, and bushy tail, and so much resembles a wolf that Mr. Paget, who gives this description, says he has known a Hungarian mistake a wolf {{for one of his}} own dogs. Jeitteles, also, remarks on the close similarity of the Hungarian dog and wolf. Shepherd dogs in Italy must anciently have {{closely resemble}}d wolves, for Columella (vii. 12) advises that white dogs be kept, adding, [...] "pastor album probat, ne pro lupo canem feriat." [...] Several accounts have been given of dogs and wolves crossing naturally; and Pliny asserts that the Gauls tied their female dogs in the woods that they might cross with wolves. (1/19. Paget 'Travels in Hungary and Transylvania' volume 1 page 501. Jeitteles 'Fauna Hungariae Superioris' 1862 s. 13. See Pliny 'History of the World' (English translation) 8th book ch. 40 about the Gauls crossing their dogs. See also Aristotle 'Hist. Animal.' Lib. 8 c. 28. For good evidence about wolves and dogs naturally crossing near the Pyrenees, see M. Mauduyt 'Du Loup et de ses Races' Poitiers, 1851; also Pallas in 'Acta Acad. St. Petersburgh' 1780 part 2 page 94.) The European wolf differs slightly from that of North America, and has been ranked by many naturalists as a distinct species. The <b>common</b> <b>wolf</b> of India is also by some esteemed as a third species, and here again we find a marked resemblance between the pariah dogs of certain districts of India and the Indian wolf. (1/20. I give this on excellent authority, namely Mr. Blyth (under the signature of Zoophilus) in the 'Indian Sporting Review' October 1856 page 134. Mr. Blyth states that he was struck with the resemblance between a brush-tailed race of pariah-dogs, north-west of Cawnpore, and the Indian wolf. He gives corroborative evidence with respect to the dogs of the valley of the Nerbudda.) ...|$|E

50|$|Lycodon capucinus, {{also known}} as the <b>common</b> <b>wolf</b> snake, is a species of {{colubrid}} snake, which is commonly found in the Indo-Australian Archipelago.

5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor.

5000|$|Often (incorrectly) {{called the}} [...] "true tarantula", Lycosa can be {{distinguished}} from <b>common</b> <b>wolf</b> spiders by their relatively large size. This genus includes the European Lycosa tarantula, which was once associated with tarantism, a dubious affliction whose symptoms included shaking, cold sweats, and a high fever, asserted to be curable only by the traditional tarantella dance. There is no scientific substantiation of that myth; the venom of Lycosa spiders is generally not harmful.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{animals are}} {{typically}} only grouped within subspecies, {{it is simply}} written as a trinomen with a third name. For example, because dogs are still so similar to wolves as to form part of their species but so distinct as to require separate treatment, they are described as [...] (Lat.

40|$|In the Nepalese Himalaya, {{conflict}} with rural communities due to livestock predation to large carnivores like snow leopard, <b>common</b> leopard, <b>wolf</b> and wild dog has risen sharply in recent years.

50|$|The Iberian wolf {{differs from}} the more <b>common</b> Eurasian <b>wolf</b> with its slighter frame, white marks on the upper lips, the dark marks on the tail {{and a pair of}} dark marks in its front legs that give it its {{subspecies}} name, signatus ("marked"). The subspecies differentiation may have developed {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene Ice Ages due to the isolation of the Iberian Peninsula when glacier barriers grew in the Pyrenees and eventually reached the Gulf of Biscay in the West and the Mediterranean in the East.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the Christmas Island pipistrelle's decline is unknown. Several {{potential}} threats have been suggested: predation or disturbance at roost sites, and disease. Introduced species such as the <b>common</b> <b>wolf</b> snake, giant centipede http://www.ento.csiro.au/aicn/name_s/b_3704.htm, yellow crazy ant, black rat or feral cats have all been identified as potential suspects responsible for the decline either through predation or disturbance of the bats. It has also been speculated that an unidentified health threat, or poisoning from the insecticide Fipronil used to control yellow crazy ant 'supercolonies' could {{be responsible for the}} decline.|$|E
50|$|A {{subspecies}} is the {{taxonomic rank}} below species. When geographically separate populations {{of a species}} exhibit recognizable phenotypic differences, biologists may identify these as separate subspecies; a subspecies is a recognized local variant of a species. The thirty-seven subspecies of Canis lupus are listed in Mammal Species of the World third edition that was published in 2005. The nominate subspecies is the Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), {{also known as the}} <b>common</b> <b>wolf.</b> The subspecies includes the domestic dog, dingo, eastern wolf and red wolf. However, the classification of several as either species or subspecies has recently been challenged.|$|E
50|$|The Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), {{also known}} as the <b>common</b> <b>wolf</b> or Middle Russian forest wolf, is a {{subspecies}} of grey wolf native to Europe and the forest and steppe zones of the former Soviet Union. It was once widespread throughout Eurasia prior to the Middle Ages. Aside from an extensive paleontological and genetic record, Indo-European languages typically have several words for wolf, thus attesting to the animal's abundance and cultural significance. It was held in high regard in Baltic, Celtic, Slavic, Turkic, ancient Greek, Roman, and Thracian cultures, whilst having an ambivalent reputation in early Germanic cultures.|$|E
25|$|Hybridization in {{the wild}} usually occurs near human habitations where wolf density is low and dogs are common. However, there were several {{reported}} cases of wolfdogs in areas with normal wolf densities in the former Soviet Union. Wild wolfdogs were occasionally hunted by European aristocracy, and were termed lycisca to distinguish them from <b>common</b> <b>wolves.</b> Noted historic cases (such as the Beast of Gévaudan) of large wolves that were abnormally aggressive toward humans, may be attributable to wolf-dog mating. In Europe, unintentional mating of dogs and wild wolves have been confirmed in some populations through genetic testing. As the survival of some Continental European wolf packs is severely threatened, scientists fear {{that the creation of}} wolfdog populations {{in the wild}} is a threat to the continued existence of European wolf populations. However, extensive wolf–dog hybridization is not supported by morphological evidence, and analyses of mtDNA sequences have revealed that such mating are rare. In 1997, during the Mexican Wolf Arizona Reintroduction, controversy arose when a captive pack at Carlsbad designated for release was found to be largely composed of wolfdogs by Roy McBride, who had captured many wolves for the recovery programme in the 1970s. Though staff initially argued that the animals' odd appearance was due to captivity and diet, it was later decided to euthanise them.|$|R
50|$|They also compete {{directly}} for lemmings and other prey with several predators, including rough-legged hawks, golden eagles, peregrine falcons, gyrfalcons, jaegers, glaucous gulls, short-eared owls, great horned owls, Eurasian eagle-owls, <b>common</b> ravens, <b>wolves,</b> Arctic foxes, and ermine. They are normally dominant over other raptors although may (sometimes fatally) lose in conflicts to large raptors such as other Bubo owls, golden eagles {{and the smaller}} but much faster peregrine falcons. Some species nesting near snowy owl nests, such as the snow goose, seem {{to benefit from the}} incidental protection of snowy owls that drive competing predators out of the area.|$|R
50|$|Oenothera wolfii is a {{rare species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the evening primrose family known by the <b>common</b> name <b>Wolf's</b> evening primrose. It is native to the coastline of southern Oregon and northern California, where it grows in coastal prairie, dunes, and coastal forest and woodland habitat. As of 1997 it was known from only about 16 occurrences. The biggest threat to the plant is its easy hybridization with its relative and probable descendent, Oenothera glazioviana. As this rare wild plant crosses with the introduced garden escapee, introgression occurs, causing {{what is known as}} genetic pollution; fewer pure individuals of O. wolfii will be seen as they are outnumbered by hybrids.|$|R
