5|$|Louis Pasteur {{demonstrated}} in 1859 {{that the growth}} of microorganisms causes the fermentation process, and that this growth is not due to spontaneous generation. (Yeasts and moulds, <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> fermentation, are not bacteria, but rather fungi.) Along with his contemporary Robert Koch, Pasteur was an early advocate of the germ theory of disease.|$|E
5|$|Pseudomembranous colitis is a {{potentially}} lethal condition <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> clindamycin, but which occurs with other antibiotics, as well.

5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E
50|$|The {{region is}} <b>commonly</b> <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> mythical {{stories of the}} Sasanian times and even after Islam, it {{continues}} to be considered mysterious by the Islamic historians and geographers.

It affects spinning missiles, and has some engineering uses, for instance in the design of rotor ships and Flettner aeroplanes.|$|R
5000|$|KvLQT1 {{can also}} <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> {{any of the}} {{five members of the}} KCNE family of proteins, but {{interactions}} with KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNE3 are the only interactions within this protein family that affect the human heart. KCNE2, KCNE4, and KCNE5 have been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the functionality of KvLQT1, while KCNE1 and KCNE3 are activators of KvLQT1. [...] KvLQT1 can <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> KCNE1 and KCNE4 with the activation effects of KCNE1 overriding the inhibitory effects of KCNE4 on the KvLQT1 channel, and KvLQT1 will <b>commonly</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> anywhere from two to four different KCNE proteins in order to be functional. [...] However, KvLQT1 most <b>commonly</b> <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> KCNE1 and forms the KvLQT1/KCNE1 complex since it has only been seen to function in vivo when <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> another protein. [...] KCNQ1 will form a heteromer with KCNE1 in order to slow its activation and enhance the current density at the plasma membrane of the neuron. [...] In addition to <b>associating</b> <b>with</b> KCNE proteins, the N-terminal juxtamembranous domain of KvLQT1 can also <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> SGK1, which stimulates the slow delayed potassium rectifier current. Since SGK1 requires structural integrity to stimulate KvLQT1/KCNE1, any mutations present in the KvLQT1 protein can result in reduced stimulation of this channel by SGK1. [...] General mutations in KvLQT1 have been known to cause a decrease in this slow delayed potassium rectifier current, longer cardiac action potentials, and a tendency to have tachyarrhythmias.|$|R

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about Silverthrone’s eruptive history. However, as at other calderas, eruptions at Silverthrone are {{explosive}} in nature, involving viscous magma, glowing avalanches of hot volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows. The source magma of this rock is classified as acidic, having high to intermediate levels of silica, as in rhyolite, dacite, and andesite. Andesitic and rhyolitic magma are <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the two forms of explosive eruptions called Plinian and Peléan eruptions. Silverthrone is considerably younger than its nearest prominent neighbour Franklin Glacier Volcano to the east-southeast.|$|E

5|$|Warfarin is {{contraindicated}} in pregnancy, as {{it passes}} through the placental barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus; warfarin use during pregnancy is <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and preterm birth. Coumarins (such as warfarin) are also teratogens, that is, they cause birth defects; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin in utero appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) {{have been reported in}} some studies. Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy, two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise.|$|E
5|$|Women with {{a family}} history of endometrial cancer are at higher risk. Two genes most <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an {{apparent}} link with these genes but it is attributable to the use of tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer. Women with this disorder have a 5–10%lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, compared to the 2–3%risk for unaffected women.|$|E
5|$|Californication is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was {{released}} on June8, 1999, on Warner Bros. Records and was produced by Rick Rubin. Californication marked the return of John Frusciante, who had previously appeared on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to replace Dave Navarro as the band's guitarist. Frusciante's return was credited with changing the band's sound altogether, producing a notable shift in style from the music recorded with Navarro. The album's subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos <b>commonly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the band, but also contained more varied themes than previous outings, including lust, death, contemplations of suicide, California, drugs, globalization, and travel.|$|E

30|$|Mail-ordering {{has been}} growing rapidly {{over the last decade}} [1]. For the most part, this {{development}} {{can be attributed to the}} increasing acceptance of online shopping. Obviously, e-tailers have done a good job in reducing the risks customers <b>commonly</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> mail-order businesses. One common way of building trust and increasing the likelihood of ordering is the establishment of liberal return policies. Well-known examples of this strategy are the fashion retailers Zalando (www.zalando.com) and Zappos (www.zappos.com), which allow customers to return merchandise for up to 365  days at no charge. However, returns also entail a variety of direct and indirect costs.|$|R
