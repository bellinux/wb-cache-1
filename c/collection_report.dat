40|$|Highlighted by {{a digital}} {{forensics}} investigation specialists from FBI in DFRWS 2006, live forensics investigations already {{become one of}} the most important procedures in digital forensics investigations. Many digital forensics investigation product companies have already joint the battlefield in developing their only live forensics tools. However, similar to the development trend in traditional digital forensics, evaluation criteria for Live Digital Forensics could only be standardized after operating procedures being standardized. One way to standardize the Live Digital Forensics Investigation procedure is to define the investigation objectives around the core digital forensics principles. Through the use of FORZA framework, a more legal and investigation oriented live digital forensics investigation procedures have been outlined. Based on the FORZA based procedure, a set of operation best practices, operational tips and evaluation criteria was derived.

40|$|The {{blood supply}} in the small {{intestine}} of seven Tamandua tetradactyla (Linnaeus, 1758), was studied. The method included preparation of the macroscopic <b>collection</b> <b>report,</b> perfusion of the arterial network with water (40 ºC), injection of colored latex (Neoprene 650 ®, 2350 - 0003 Suvinil® dye), fixation in formaldehyde (10 %), and preservation in ethanol (50 %). For description and analyzes, dissection under mesoscopic light and photo documentation were performed. The small intestine of T. tetradactyla is irrigated by the cranial mesenteric artery, the ventral visceral branch of the abdominal aorta. The artery emerges from the retroperitoneum and disperses between the layers of the common mesentery, parallel to the caudal mesenteric artery. The primary cranial collateral branches irrigate the pancreas, duodenum, jejunum (13 arteries), ileum (14 vessels), and the cecocolic region. The arteries anastomose with adjacent vessels to form arches. Terminal branches are derived from these peri-intestinal arcs that reach into the intestine through the mesenteric boundary and form capillaries within the lining. The vascular pattern of the lesser anteater differs from those of other previously described vertebrates, but {{is similar to the}} pattern found in fetuses of domestic mammals during early intestinal development...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{approaches}} to information retrieval search through all applicable entries in an inverted file {{for a particular}} collection {{in order to find}} those documents with the highest scores. For particularly large collections this may be extremely time consuming. A solution to this problem is to only search a limited amount of the collection at query-time, in order to speed up the retrieval process. In doing this we can also limit the loss in retrieval efficacy (in terms of accuracy of results). The way we achieve this is to firstly identify the most “important” documents within the collection, and sort documents within inverted file lists in order of this “importance”. In this way we limit the amount of information to be searched at query time by eliminating documents of lesser importance, which not only makes the search more efficient, but also limits loss in retrieval accuracy. Our experiments, carried out on the TREC Terabyte <b>collection,</b> <b>report</b> significant savings, in terms of number of postings examined, without significant loss of effectiveness when based on several measures of importance used in isolation, and in combination. Our results point to several ways in which the computation cost of searching large collections of documents can be significantly reduced...|$|E

40|$|Background: Patient {{reported}} outcomes (PROs) {{are increasingly}} assessed in clinical trials, and guidelines {{are available to}} inform the design and reporting of such trials. However, researchers involved in PRO data <b>collection</b> <b>report</b> that specific guidance on ‘in-trial ’ activity (recruitment, data collection and data inputting) and the management of ‘concerning ’ PRO data (i. e., data which raises concern {{for the well-being of}} the trial participant) appears to be lacking. The purpose of this review was to determine the extent and nature of published guidelines addressing these areas. Methods and Findings: Systematic review of 1, 362 articles identified 18 eligible papers containing ‘in-trial ’ guidelines. Two independent authors undertook a qualitative content analysis of the selected papers. Guidelines presented in each of the articles were coded according to an a priori defined coding frame, which demonstrated reliability (pooled Kappa 0. 86 – 0. 97), and validity (, 2 % residual category coding). The majority of guidelines present were concerned with ‘pre-trial ’ activities (72 %), for example, outcome measure selection and study design issues, or ‘post-trial ’ activities (16 %) such as data analysis, reporting and interpretation. ‘In-trial ’ guidelines represented 9. 2 % of all guidance across the papers reviewed, with content primarily focused on compliance, quality control, proxy assessment and reporting of data collection. There were no guidelines surrounding the management of concerning PRO data. Conclusions: The findings highlight there are minimal in-trial guidelines in publication regarding PRO data collection an...|$|E

30|$|Beginning in the 1970 s Cowan and his {{students}} pioneered the application of equivariant bifurcation theory to pattern formation in cortical networks. First-principles explanation of a broad class of geometric visual hallucination patterns began with Cowan’s work with Ermentrout [26] and later extended to include anatomical details such as long-range anisotropic, orientation-specific connectivity [7, 10 – 12, 21]. Similar methods yielded results on the formation of connectivity patterns underlying phenomena such as orientation preference, ocular dominance, and spatial frequency maps in primary visual cortex (area V 1) [2, 6, 8, 9, 50 – 52]. Two contributions in this <b>collection</b> <b>report</b> on continued advances in understanding pattern formation in cortical activity and connectivity patterns. The paper by Afgoustidis [1] builds on work by Wolf, Geisel, Kasschube and others [35, 36, 60] which showed a surprising statistical regularity in both imaging studies of orientation preference maps and phenomenological models for map formation {{in the presence of}} symmetry constraints, namely, that the typical density of orientation preference singularities (“pinwheels”) and the hypercolumn area are in a constant ratio of π across species. Wolf and Geisels’ analysis, like that in Cowan’s papers, were developed assuming the symmetries of the Euclidean plane. Afgoustidis extends the analysis for the specification of “typical” orientation patterns to symmetric manifolds M of constant curvature, namely the sphere and the hyperbolic plane as well as Euclidean space. He generalizes the key elements of Wolf and Geisel’s framework: smooth Gaussian random fields, invariance with respect to an appropriate Lie group of transformations of M, and monochromaticity, i.e. composition of orientation preference maps via superposition of (uniformly, randomly distributed) “plane waves” with a common wavelength. This last element is interpreted in terms of the irreducible factors in the Plancherel decomposition of the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on the Euclidean plane, the sphere, and the hyperbolic plane, respectively.|$|E
