5|$|Scrooge awakens on <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning</b> {{a changed}} man. He spends {{the day with}} Fred's family and {{anonymously}} sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay and becomes like another father to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge began to treat everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Since 1864, the Serpentine {{has hosted}} a 100-yard (91.4m) {{swimming}} competition every <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning</b> at 9am. In 1904, author J. M. Barrie awarded the Peter Pan Cup {{to the winner}} of the race, a tradition which has continued ever since. Owing to the hazards of swimming in freezing water, the race is open only to members of the Serpentine Swimming Club.|$|E
5|$|Guest and Knowles were {{summoned to}} the Defence Department and told to stop recruiting. The Administration had decided to raise a {{regiment}} in Rhodesia, and Guest joined the Salisbury battalion of the 1st Rhodesian Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant. The battalion was sent to South Africa to assist in suppressing the 1914 Maritz Rebellion by Boers opposed to fighting for Britain. It was not, however, deployed against the Rebellion and when it ended the battalion was sent, with the Imperial Light Horse, to reinforce the South African troops in the South-West Africa Campaign in German South-West Africa, present-day Namibia. They landed at Lambert's Bay on <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning</b> 1914, but made no contact with the enemy until they were sent to Swakopmund.|$|E

50|$|Not surprisingly, having built Finsbury Chapel, {{it became}} a {{well-known}} venue for Alexander Fletcher's children's events. On <b>Christmas</b> <b>mornings,</b> it would be full of children from all the Sunday schools he could attract across the capital, and it drew similar gatherings of children for Whit Monday when all the schools in Hackney would be invited. As a result, the chapel's Sunday School for children {{was said to have}} been the most popular in London.|$|R
5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning,</b> where he thinks his father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
5|$|On <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning,</b> {{everybody}} {{wakes up}} to find no presents under their trees. They turn on the news, which is broadcasting the same story. Brian and Stewie appear on the broadcast and bring the dying Santa out in a wheelchair, explaining that humanity's greed is killing him and if they don't shorten their demands to one Christmas present a year, {{they may have to}} give up Christmas altogether. Chastened, everyone agrees and by one year later, Santa has recovered, the workshop is once again a lively, colorful cottage and the elves and reindeer are all rejuvenated.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{fed by the}} River Westbourne and Tyburn Brook in the 1730s, the lake's {{water was}} then pumped from the Thames in the 1830s. The water is now pumped from three {{boreholes}} within Hyde Park, the most recent being installed in May 2012 {{as part of the}} 2011–2012 restoration of the Lake. The Serpentine provided a focal point for The Great Exhibition of 1851, and more recently was a venue for the men's and women's triathlon and marathon swimming events in the London 2012 Olympics. Since 1864 the Serpentine Swimming Club has organised a 100-yard race every <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning.</b> In 1913, the Peter Pan Cup was inaugurated for this race by J. M. Barrie, the creator of the fictional character Peter Pan.|$|E

500|$|The Stampers were famously reticent {{with the}} press and only rarely gave interviews. They {{explained}} that this was both {{to protect their own}} time and due to their preference to let their games speak for themselves. Their brand benefited from this mystique of secrecy, but their reclusiveness was the subject of derision from other UK developers who otherwise greatly respected their work. The Stampers were known for working 18-hour days and believed that part-time work [...] "resulted in a part-time game". They only took two days off: two <b>Christmas</b> <b>mornings.</b> Tim Stamper referred to his custom-built Lamborghini as a token of his hard work.|$|R
60|$|The {{music on}} <b>Christmas</b> <b>mornings</b> was {{frequently}} below {{the standard of}} church-performances at other times. The boys were sleepy from the heavy exertions of the night; the men were slightly wearied; and now, {{in addition to these}} constant reasons, there was a dampness in the atmosphere that still further aggravated the evil. Their strings, from the recent long exposure to the night air, rose whole semitones, and snapped with a loud twang at the most silent moment; which necessitated more retiring than ever {{to the back of the}} gallery, and made the gallery throats quite husky with the quantity of coughing and hemming required for tuning in. The vicar looked cross.|$|R
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning</b> , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E
5|$|Kresge {{comes to}} see Scully, {{telling her that}} the Sims {{received}} several large payments from a pharmaceutical company, Prangen Industries. The two visit Dr. Calderon, who tells them that Emily was part of clinical trials and that Roberta was paid the money {{to keep her from}} pulling Emily from the program. Marshall Sim is arrested for the murder of his wife. Scully visits Emily and gives her the cross necklace. Marshall confesses soon after, but is found dead in his cell shortly after being visited by the two dark-suited men. Bill shows Scully a photo of Melissa, who is clearly not pregnant, shortly before Emily was born, which he thinks proves that she isn't Emily's mother. Scully meets with someone from an adoptive agency, wanting to adopt Emily. The woman is very hesitant considering Scully's job and the fact that Emily is a special needs child. Scully flashes back to talking with Melissa around Christmas time shortly before she joined the FBI. On <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning</b> Scully receives the results of a DNA test from the FBI proving that Melissa is not Emily's mother—she is.|$|E
25|$|Since 2012, Michael {{had been}} in a {{relationship}} with Fadi Fawaz, an Australian celebrity hairstylist and a freelance photographer of Lebanese descent based in London. It was Fawaz who found Michael's body on <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning</b> 2016.|$|E

50|$|The Moweaqua Coal Mine Disaster {{happened}} on December 24, 1932, in Moweaqua, Illinois. The disaster {{was caused by}} a methane gas explosion killing 54 miners.

25|$|The girls' childhoods {{were marked}} by poverty. One <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning,</b> Fred Talmadge left the house to buy food, and never came back, leaving his wife to raise their three daughters.

25|$|A polaznik, polažajnik, polaženik, or radovan, is {{the first}} person who visits the family on Christmas Day. This visit may be fortuitous or pre-arranged. People expect that it will summon {{prosperity}} and well-being for their household in the ensuing year. A family often picks in advance a man or boy, and arranges that he visit them on <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning.</b> If this proves to be lucky for the family, he is invited again next year to be the polaznik. If not, they send word to him not to come any more in that capacity.|$|E
5000|$|Buck's Fizz is popularly {{served at}} weddings as a less {{alcoholic}} alternative to Champagne. It is also {{touted as a}} morning [...] "antidote" [...] for a hangover.

25|$|Colin Cowdrey and John Edrich {{were unable}} to {{practice}} on Christmas Eve – {{mainly because of the}} drizzling rain but also because Cowdrey wanted to spend his birthday in comparative peace. Since both batsmen wanted to feel the ball on bat before the Test, I volunteered the use of the Hawthorn Indoor Cricket Centre, in which I was a partner, for a two hour work-out on <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning.</b> It was quite a contrast to open the children's presents in the early hours and to open the bowling at the two English batsmen before lunch. My fifteen old son, Philip, thought the latter experience to be quite the best of his Christmas presents.|$|E
25|$|Hagel {{was born}} in North Platte, Nebraska, a son of Charles Dean Hagel, and his wife Elizabeth (Betty) Dunn. His father was of German heritage, while his mother was of Irish and Polish ancestry. Growing up, Hagel lived across Nebraska; in Ainsworth, Rushville, Scottsbluff, Terrytown, York and Columbus, Nebraska. Hagel was the oldest of four brothers. His father, a veteran of World War II, died {{suddenly}} on <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning,</b> 1962, {{at the age of}} 39, when Hagel was 16. He graduated from St. Bonaventure High School (now Scotus Central Catholic High School) in Columbus, Nebraska, in 1964, the Brown Institute for Radio and Television in 1966, and he earned a BA degree in history at the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 1971.|$|E
25|$|In late 2005 {{the police}} warned Pararajasingham of {{a plot to}} kill him {{and as a result}} he avoided going to Batticaloa unless it was necessary. However, on Christmas Eve 2005 Pararajasingham and Sugunam {{travelled}} from Colombo to Batticaloa along with two police bodyguards. Pararajasingham wanted to attend the midnight mass at St. Mary's Cathedral, Batticaloa being given by Bishop Kingsley Swampillai but a worried Sugunam suggested that attend mass on <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning.</b> However, Pararajasingham insisted that they go that night. The only people who knew of the Pararajasinghams' decision to attend midnight mass were their police bodyguards. That evening, at around 10.30pm, they arrived at St. Mary's Cathedral but on finding the cathedral deserted they left, only to return later with Robin, Sugunam's brother, and his family.|$|E

40|$|For {{football}} fans, {{today will}} be a whirlwind of expectation and disappointment as the 6 pm transfer window deadline approaches. Imagine a kind of sporting <b>Christmas</b> Day <b>morning,</b> only hyper-fuelled by astronomical wages and even more astronomically unrealistic hopes {{on the part of}} the fans. And for football journalists it is just as busy as for the players’ agents (but somewhat less profitable I suspect) ...|$|R
50|$|On <b>Christmas</b> Eve <b>morning,</b> Sheriff Jacob Eberhart {{conducted}} Tassel {{from the}} Hall County Jail in an oxcart to gallows erected for the hanging {{in a field}} {{at the corner of}} Main and Grove streets, two blocks south of the log courthouse. Tassel rode to the hanging place atop his own coffin with tied hands and feet. Judge Clayton stood by Eberhart as he conducted the execution.|$|R
25|$|A girl {{or woman}} goes {{early in the}} morning to a {{resource}} of water, as a well, spring, or stream. After she puts by the water an ear of maize and a bunch of basil which she has brought from home, she collects water with a bucket, and takes it home to her family. This water collected on early <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning</b> is called the strong water, and is believed to possess a special beneficial power. Each member of the family washes the face with it, and drinks it before breakfast; infants are bathed in it. On her way back home, the girl who carries the strong water picks several cornel or willow twigs, with which children are lightly struck that morning. This is intended to strengthen their health.|$|E
25|$|Bompas {{eventually}} {{reached the}} Red River Colony, and from there, he was rowed by Salteaux Indians in Hudson's Bay Company boats. The Methye Portage was reached on October 12, {{too late to}} catch a boat going further north due to the ensuing winter. Bompas engaged a crew to row him further north, reaching Fort Chipewyan, Alberta after days of struggle against the cold. Although {{he was invited to}} stay the winter at Fort Chipewyan, this offer was rejected, Bompas preferring to push further ahead. When the river became frozen over, his party continued by land, reaching the safety of Fort Resolution mid-winter. After a month's stay there, he was dispatched from there armed with snowshoes and a strong party. Bompas was determined to reach Fort Simpson before Christmas Day, and that he did, drawing into the entrance to the Fort on <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
25|$|A custom {{to use a}} {{domestic}} animal as a polaznik was kept in some regions until {{the first half of}} the 20th century. A sheep, ox, swine, or calf was led into the house on <b>Christmas</b> <b>morning.</b> In the west Serbian region of Rađevina, centered on the town of Krupanj, the head of household would place a sheep between himself and the fireplace, and pronounce the aforementioned words while striking the badnjak with a branch cut from it. In the region of Bihor, north-eastern Montenegro, a round loaf of bread with a hole in its center was prepared; four grooves were impressed into its surface along two mutually perpendicular diameters of the loaf. After an ox was led into the house, the loaf was put on his horn, and some grain was thrown on the ox. Yanking his head, the ox would throw off the loaf; having fallen down, the loaf would break into four pieces along the grooves. The pieces were picked up and distributed among the family members. This custom was preserved up to the 1950s even in some Muslim families of the region. Ethnologists consider that the animal polažajnik is more ancient than the human one.|$|E
