40|$|We {{study the}} {{monotonicity}} properties of solutions {{in the classic}} problem of fair cake-cutting - dividing a single heterogeneous resource among agents with subjective utilities. Resource and population-monotonicity relate to scenarios where the cake, {{or the number of}} participants who divide the <b>cake,</b> <b>changes.</b> It is required that the utility of all participants change in the same direction: either all of them are better-off (if there is more to share) or all are worse-off (if there is less to share). We formally introduce these concepts to the cakecutting setting and present a meticulous axiomatic analysis. We show that classical cakecutting protocols, like the Cut and Choose, Banach-Knaster, Dubins-Spanier and many other fail to be monotonic. We also show that, when the allotted pieces must be contiguous, proportionality and Pareto-optimality are incompatible with each of the monotonicity axioms. We provide a resource-monotonic protocol for two players and show the existence of rules that satisfy various combinations of contiguousness, proportionality, Pareto-optimality and the two monotonicity axioms...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{filtration}} {{to separate}} solid from liquids is a commonly-used unit operation employed {{in a range}} of different applications. The development of accurate models is therefore important in facilitating e. g. design, scale-up and troubleshooting. Accurate constitutive relationships between local filtration properties need to be formulated in order to form precise models of the filtration process. One important parameter that is seldom considered explicitly in filtration models is the inter particle forces, e. g. electrostatic forces. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate local filtration properties, under controlled conditions, for the model material TiO(2) where the zeta-potential, and thereby one important parameter affecting the inter-particle interactions, is altered. In this study the local solidosity is measured during filtration by gamma-attenuation, the local pressure is measured using capillary tubes. These data are used to calculate the local specific filtration resistance. The compressibility of the filtration <b>cake</b> was <b>changed</b> substantially by altering the zeta-potential.

40|$|Filter cake {{characterization}} is {{very important}} in drilling and completion operations. Heterogeneity of the filter cake {{plays a key role in}} the design of chemical treatments needed to remove the filter cake. The objectives of this study are to characterize the filter cake under static and dynamic conditions, evaluate the using of polylactic acid and chelating agents to remove calcium carbonate-based filter cake, assess glycolic acid to remove Mn 3 O 4 -based filter cake, and evaluate ilmenite as a weighting material for water-based drilling fluid. In order to characterize the filter cake, computer tomography (CT) was used in combination with the scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) to analyze the filter cake. A modified HPHT filter cell was developed to perform the filtration tests. A see-through-cell was used to check the compatibility of different chemicals that were used to remove the filter cake. The results obtained from the CT scan showed that the filter cake was heterogeneous and contained two layers with different properties under static and dynamic conditions. Under static conditions, the formation of filter <b>cake</b> <b>changed</b> from compression to buildup; while under dynamic conditions, the filter cake was formed under continuous buildup. Polylactic acid was used as a component of the drilling fluid components and the results obtained showed that the drill-in fluid had stable rheological properties up to 250 ?F over 24 hrs. The removal efficiency of the filter cake was nearly 100 % and the return permeability was about 100 % for Indiana limestone and Berea sandstone cores, when using a weight ratio of polylactic acid to calcium carbonate 3 to 1. GLDA (pH 3. 3) and HEDTA (pH 4) can be used to remove the filter cake in one step without using ?-amylase enzyme solutions. GLDA (20 wt% in a 200 g solution and pH of 3. 3) and HEDTA (20 wt% in a 200 g solution and pH 4) had 100 % removal efficiency of the filter cake using Indiana limestone and Berea sandstone cores. Chelate solutions, GLDA (pH of 3. 3 - 13) and HEDTA (pH of 4 and 7) were incompatible with ?-amylase enzyme solutions over a wide range of temperatures. CT results showed that no formation damage was observed when using chelating agents as a breaker to remove the calcium carbonate filter cake. Manganese tetraoxide-based filter cake had a removal efficiency of 85 % after 20 hrs soaking with glycolic acid (5 wt%) after soaking with ?-amylase for 24 hrs, and 89 % after reaction with acid mixture (1 wt% HCl and 7 wt% glycolic acid) for 16 hrs. for both methods, the retained permeability was 100 % for Indiana limestone cores and 120 % for Berea sandstone cores, which indication maximum productivity of these formations. Ilmenite-based filter cake was ideal for HPHT applications, 0. 2 in. thickness and 12 cm 3 filtrate under dynamic conditions. The filtrate volume was reduced by adding a minor amount of CaCO 3 solids that improved the particles packing.

The leaves maintained a high CP content (> 164 g/kg dry matter (DM)) during the prolonged maturation in the winter feed scarcity period. The leaves were rich in Ca (41 g/kg DM) and K (89 g/kg DM). The rate of degradation and effective degradability of CP were consistently higher (P < 0. 001) in CSC than in G. oppositifolia. A balance trial in a 4 x 4 Latin square design with four mature Ramghani wethers showed that DM intake, DM and CP digestibility, and N retention did not differ with the substitution of CSC with G. oppositifolia leaves, {{as a supplement to}} a basal diet of sorghum hay.

40|$|Filtration as a {{means of}} {{separating}} solids from liquids is an important unit operation employed in a range of different industrial sectors, e. g. forest products, mineral, chemical process and pharmaceutical industries to name but a few. Accurate and applicable models for the filtration unit operation are imperative if industrial filtration equipment is to be designed correctly. Easy-to-filter, incompressible or near-incompressible materials can currently be modelled satisfactorily, thereby facilitating scale-up and design. There is, however, a lack of good models for compressible cakes that are formed by hard-to-filter materials. Efforts attempting to model filtration have often been based on average filtration properties; although providing certain information regarding filtration, this approach is inferior to that of using models based on local data. Models for filtration often contain lumped parameters, i. e. the classical filtration equation describes the filtration properties of particles using the average specific filtration resistance parameter. An alternative would be to base their filtration properties on the interactions experienced during filtration. Important interactions that should be considered between particles include surface forces, material bridges between particles and interlocking. This work investigates hard-to-filter materials. Two materials are used. A model material, titanium dioxide, is used to investigate the effects of particle interactions on filtration behaviour. Although all of the interactions mentioned above may be of interest, depending on the filtration situation, this thesis focuses on electrostatic interactions. The separation of green liquor, a process that is of great interest in the pulp and paper industry, is also investigated. Green liquor dregs form hard-to-filter, compressible cakes. As far as titanium dioxide is concerned, local filtration properties are investigated for different particle interactions. The inter-particle interactions are changed by controlling the ζ-potential. Both local solidosity and pressure are measured, and a local specific filtration resistance calculated from this data. It could be concluded that the compressibility of the filtration <b>cake</b> is <b>changed</b> substantially by altering the ζ-potential.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. Dewatering coal, and {{especially}} fine coal (- 600 μm), {{is a significant}} problem {{in the preparation of}} coal. The final moisture level of fine coal can be anything up to 30 % by weight, {{depending on the type of}} dewatering equipment used. Moisture in coal can cause many problems, for example by increasing the transportation costs, as well as decreasing the calorific value of the coal. In industry today there is a need for a dewatering technique that will produce a drier final product. It was found that an interruption in the application of vacuum during a single dewatering cycle yielded a filter cake with a lower final moisture content. It was also demonstrated that the rate at which the coal is being dewatered is much higher than during continuous vacuum application. A further study of this phenomenon showed a twofold time dependency involving both the duration of the vacuum break, and the instant it is introduced in the dewatering cycle. An optimum was found at about 29 s time duration and an introduction time of 30 s, after the start of the cycle. The possibilities of diffusion and <b>cake</b> structural <b>changes</b> were investigated. For the diffusion tests, repeated interruptions of the vacuum were performed during a single dewatering cycle. Although the kinetics agreed with what was expected, the final moisture content was not as low as that found for the optimum single break test. The compressibility of a coal filter cake was one of the structural changes investigated, the other being an increase in area and, thus, airflow through the cake. Coal filter cakes were shown to be largely incompressible. It was, however, shown that an increase in area, and thus an increase in the airflow through the cake, gave excellent results. An increased area resulted in a much lower final moisture content as well as an increase in the dewatering rate. The addition of a cake surface cutter to a standard vacuum belt filter will make the application of these finfings relatively easy to industry. Master...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the {{membrane}} bioreactor (MBR) industry expanded and nowadays {{this technology is}} diffused worldwide for wastewater treatment. Nevertheless, membrane fouling is still a critical issue and most research is focused on this aspect {{in order to control}} the fouling phenomenon, such as the definition of foulant agents, which are mainly extracellular polymeric substances. One of the main drawbacks related to fouling in MBRs is the sudden jump of the transmembrane pressure, often attributed to the collapse of the fouling layer, which in turn leads to a reduction of the pores size. A potential solution to this problem can be the addition of particles as to reduce the compressibility of the fouling layer through the engineering of the cake structure. Aim of the present work is to test this hypothesis through the addition of nanospheres of different diameter in a hollow fiber MBR unit at lab scale. The nanospheres are inert and non-compressible, and have been chosen for their capability to form well-structured layers. In order to analyze the MBR filtration performance, a synthetic solution has been prepared, in which a foulant agent (sodium alginate) has been spiked. A filtration model has been provided as to interpret the results and their eventual dependence on diameter and concentration of the nanospheres. Results obtained at constant flux in dead-end mode show that the presence of particles <b>changes</b> <b>cake</b> resistance and leads to the formation of non-compressible fouling. However, the addition of particles leads to better filtration performances, no matter what the diameter or concentration may be. Nevertheless, further research is required with the aim of testing the hypothesis with real wastewater. This study may, therefore, enlarge the choice of membrane fouling reducers by taking into consideration their ability to form more structured fouling. © 2015 Balaban Desalination Publications...|$|R
40|$|With {{the study}} of cake uncles and cake {{delivery}} in rural areas of southern China, this thesis intends to explore how peasants become criminals and how criminal villages emerge during the rapidly emerging process of modernization in China since the economic reforms started in the late 1970 s. The fieldwork of this study took place in Fang town, Ning county, in a southern province in China. In {{order to protect the}} identity of the informants and interviewees, Fang town and Ning county are not the real names of the town and the country in question. Through {{the study of}} a criminal town, I intend to demonstrate how crime is socially and economically produced in contemporary China. The methodology of this study is based on grounded theory, and aims to find out “what is going on” in rural China. In this study I have applied various ways to collect data including interviewing, participant-observation, use of the blogosphere and online forum contents, reading of local chronicles, yearbooks and horizontally inscribed boards and tablets. This study examines the formation of a criminal village. After the dismantling of the commune system, the peasants are encouraged to pursue their personal interests, but the excluded social position they find themselves in has the limited access of legal and moral opportunities to gain social acceptance and material wealth. The peasants had to “innovate” by using illegal ways to become rich. The clansmen relationships and fellow townsmen relationships turn into a channel for the motivated peasants to learn the scams of cake uncle activities. The mismatch between the “Chinese dream” and the blocked opportunities for the peasants to reach this social and material goal morally and legally is producing crime in China. Crime becomes an alternative approach for the peasants to break their condition of social exclusion. This study also shows the unique culture of cake uncles and how the culture of <b>cake</b> uncles <b>changes</b> the mainstream culture in the village. The cake uncles are forming an entrepreneurial culture and class because of their relative modern lifestyle and values, the cake uncles are in fact modernizers–moral and material modernizers –of this rural society. The traditional social relations, values and norms are changing after the emergence of cake delivery. This study also demonstrates the neutralization tactics of the cake uncles. Religion has a dual effect on the peasants and the cake uncles. On one hand, religion prevents ordinary peasants from committing crime, on the other hand, religion is used by cake uncles to get rid of moral pressure. To sum up, this study provides a unique angle from which to see the modernizing of China, especially rural China. Crime becomes a useful tool for the peasants to reach the Chinese dream of wealth and respect, the traditional rural society is modernized rapidly, and crime is neutralized in part by the use of traditional values and religion. published_or_final_versionSociologyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

The choice of one category may affect the selection of another category due to the complementary nature (e. g., cake mix and cake frosting) of the two categories. Alternatively, two categories may co-occur in a shopping basket not because they are complementary but because of similar purchase cycles (e. g., beer and diapers) or because of a host of other unobserved factors. While complementarity gives managers some control over consumers' buying behavior (e. g., a change in the price of <b>cake</b> mix could <b>change</b> the purchase probability of cake frosting), co-occurrence or co-incidence is less controllable. Other factors that may affect multi-category choice may be (unobserved) household preferences or (observed) household demographics. We also argue that not accounting for these three factors simultaneously could lead to erroneous inferences. We then develop a conceptual framework that incorporates complementarity, co-incidence and heterogeneity (both observed and unobserved) as the factors that could lead to multi-category choice. We then translate this framework into a model of multi-category choice. Our model is based on random utility theory and allows for simultaneous, interdependent choice of many items. This model, the multi probit model, is implemented in a Hierarchical Bayes framework. The hierarchy consists of three levels. The first level captures the choice of items for the shopping basket during a shopping trip. The second level captures differences across households and the third level specifies the priors for the unknown parameters. We generalize some recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in order to estimate the model. Specifically, we use a substitution sampler which incorporates techniques such as the Metropolis Hit-and-Run algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler. The model is estimated on four categories (cake mix, cake frosting, fabric detergent and fabric softener) using multicategory panel data. The results disentangle the complementarity and co-incidence effects. The complementarity results show that pricing and promotional changes in one category affect purchase incidence in related product categories. In general, the cross-price and cross-promotion effects are smaller than the own-price and own-promotions effects. The cross-effects are also asymmetric across pairs of categories, i. e., related category pairs may be characterized as having a “primary” and a “secondary” category. Thus these results provide a more complete description of the effects of promotional changes by examining them both within and across categories. The co-incidence results show the extent of the relationship between categories that arises from uncontrollable and unobserved factors. These results are useful since they provide insights into a general structure of dependence relationships across categories. The heterogeneity results show that observed demographic factors such as family size influence the intrinsic category preference of households. Larger family sizes also tend to make households more price sensitive for both the primary and secondary categories. We find that price sensitivities across categories are not highly correlated at the household level. We also find some evidence that intrinsic preferences for cake mix and cake frosting are more closely related than preferences for fabric detergent and fabric softener. We compare our model with a series of null models using both estimation and holdout samples. We show that both complementarity and co-incidence {{play a significant role in}} predicting multicategory choice. We also show how many single-category models used in conjunction may not be good predictors of joint choice. Our results are likely to be of interest to retailers and manufacturers trying to optimize pricing and promotion strategies across many categories as well as in designing micromarketing strategies. We illustrate some of these benefits by carrying out an analysis which shows that the “true” impact of complementarity and co-incidence on profitability is significant in a retail setting. Our model can also be applied to other domains. The combination of item interdependence and individual household level estimates may be of particular interest to database marketers in building customized “cross-selling” strategies in the direct mail and financial service industries.
