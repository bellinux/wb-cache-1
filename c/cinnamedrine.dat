It was then promoted as a cure for hiccups claiming it controlled spasms, and finally as a remedy for menstrual cramps and bloating. A formulation sold in the 1980s was made with the sympathomimetic <b>cinnamedrine.</b> It had been reported to have abuse potential as an appetite suppressant and sympathomimetic agent.|$|E
