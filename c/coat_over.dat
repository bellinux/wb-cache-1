5|$|The basic German (Luftwaffe) {{camouflage}} {{during most}} of the war was based on a light blue undersurface and a two tone splinter pattern of various greens for the upper surfaces. In {{the first year of the}} war, the top colors were dark green and black-green; later, lighter and more greyish colors were used for fighters, though bombers mostly maintained the dark green/black green camouflage. The side of the fuselage on fighters and some light bombers often had irregular patches sprayed on, softening the transition from the upper to the lower surface. The undersides of night bombers and night fighters were painted black early in the war, but by 1943 switched to lighter base colors of their usual light blue undersurfaces for aircraft flown by day, and a light gray base <b>coat</b> <b>over</b> the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. A special pattern was devised for the Mediterranean front, consisting of a sand yellow that often faded to tan, with or without olive green patches. As Germany lost air supremacy, ground camouflage became increasingly important, and late war fighters received a two tone scheme like the British Sand and Spinach, in dark brown and light green.|$|E

25|$|During the 1942–43 timeframe, the {{formerly}} all-black night fighter camouflage used by Luftwaffe night fighters had yielded to a light-color camouflage scheme that {{took advantage of}} the skyglow over German cities at night — this generally comprised the use of the Luftwaffe's usual Hellblau light blue undersurface color for diurnal-flown aircraft, and a light gray base <b>coat</b> <b>over</b> the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. The light gray base color usually had irregular patterns of darker gray splotches or irregular wavy lines spread over the light gray areas to increase the camouflage effect. Later in WW II, Luftwaffe night fighters, like some of the Kampfgeschwader-flown He 177A heavy bombers being used at night, switched back to a black coloration for the undersurfaces and vertical sides of the airframe, while retaining the light gray with dark gray-color disruptive patterns established in the mid-war period.|$|E

Officers chased then 16-year-old Keef, who turned around several times and pointed the gun at them. The policemen [...] "discharged their weapons," [...] but missed. They caught him a half-block later and recovered the pistol, which was loaded. Keef was charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a firearm on a police officer and aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He was also given a misdemeanor charge for resisting arrest. He was held in the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center until a judge sentenced him to home confinement at his grandmother’s house.|$|E
500|$|The music video's storyline depicts Azalea's biographical {{journey from}} {{life on the}} streets to Hollywood. According to Natasha Stagg of American {{magazine}} V, the plot involves Azalea rising from [...] "trailer park standby to high-class Hollywood-ite {{in a matter of}} minutes". The music video opens with Azalea confidently walking on a deserted highway situated in a desert environment. Azalea's costume includes dark red lipstick, red-soled vertiginous Louboutins, a powder blue Givenchy bag, a tropical print brassiere and shorts. The scene is intercepted with visuals of burning shoes and wheels. Azalea then walks through a trailer park community where several locals stare at her as she passes by. Upon the beginning of the song's chorus, the video transcends into a playground scene where Azalea dances in an evening setting, with a fire-lit swing as her backdrop. In this segment, she wears a grey crop top and red slim-fit pants, with her hair styled in a bun. The next scene involves Azalea performing in a dance-off with her two female friends in front of a Freightliner Truck. Azalea sports a plum-coloured fur <b>coat</b> <b>over</b> a white mesh swimsuit. In the segment, the three engage in twerking and hair flicking actions.|$|E
500|$|There are differing {{accounts}} of Petrov's death. According to Aleksander Maslov, he was seriously wounded attempting {{to break out}} of the pocket and died on 10 October 1941. John Erickson states that he was wounded during the breakout and was hidden by his soldiers in a woodcutter's hut near Karachev, where he died of gangrene on 13 October. In 1956, Petrov's son, Alexander Petrov, investigated the circumstances of his death. Alexander concluded that his father had been shot through both hips during the breakout, taken to the village of Golynka and hidden in the house of the Novokreshchenovy family. By this time Petrov was suffering from gangrene and could not be moved. Novokreshchenov's wife reportedly threw an old <b>coat</b> <b>over</b> him when German troops searched the house, claiming he was her husband. Another group of Soviet soldiers moved him [...] to an isolated cabin. As the gangrene worsened, the soldiers and civilians decided to take him to Karachev for treatment. He rejected the idea and reportedly died ten days later. Petrov was buried near the Golynka village in the Karachevsky District. In 1956, he was reburied in the Bryansk cemetery.|$|E

500|$|Unlike most productions, it {{was filmed}} in near {{sequential}} order, {{as stated by}} Lennon in 1964. Filming began on 2 March 1964 at Marylebone station in London (sometimes misidentified as Paddington). The Beatles had joined the actors' union, Equity, only that morning. The first week of filming was on a train travelling between London and Minehead. On 10 March, scenes with Ringo were shot at the Turk's Head pub in Twickenham, and over the following week various interior scenes were filmed at Twickenham Studios. From 23 to 30 March, filming moved to the Scala Theatre, and on 31 March, concert footage was shot there, although the group mimed to backing tracks. The [...] "Can't Buy Me Love" [...] segment, which featured creative camera work and the band running and jumping around in a field was shot on 23 April 1964 at Thornbury Playing Fields, Isleworth, Middlesex.

500|$|In {{the words}} of jockey Sam Chifney, Waxy was a [...] "handsome, rich bay, with a white {{stocking}} on the off-hind [...] leg, good length, and especially beautiful quarters." [...] In {{the words of}} his exercise rider (who wrote an anonymous letter to The Sporting Magazine in 1828), Waxy was [...] "one of the finest formed horses, perfect in symmetry, beautiful in colour, admirable in all his paces, and of the finest temper when in work." [...] However, when Waxy was confined to a stall during the winter months, his temperament became unruly and unpredictable leading the anonymous writer to remark that, [...] "Oft has he kicked the lappets of my <b>coat</b> <b>over</b> my head." [...] One of the few, possibly only, surviving portraits of Waxy was painted by Francis Sartorius in 1794 or 1795, and the depiction was praised in commentary for Sporting Magazine for its [...] "neatness" [...] and for [...] "the truth of representation it so evidently display." [...] While most breeding stallions and racehorses of the era had stable companions, Waxy reportedly was fond of rabbits {{in his later years}} and [...] "was never happy without a rabbit in his paddock" [...] with one female rabbit making her nest {{in the middle of his}} stall and raising generations of rabbits at the site that were never harmed by Waxy.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Parkes, Lord Wilton and William Rathbone {{were the}} first to reach Huskisson. They found that a wheel had passed over his right calf and thigh, leaving his knee itself untouched. A flap of skin on his upper leg had been cut back, exposing the muscles, and the exposed arteries had not been severed but were flattened, pulsing with Huskisson's heartbeat. The damaged leg shook uncontrollably. Observers noted that Huskisson {{did not appear to be}} in pain, and instead lay {{watching}} the leg shake. Huskisson shouted [...] "This is the death of me". Parkes attempted to reassure him, but Huskisson replied [...] "Yes, I am dying, call Mrs Huskisson". A man threw his <b>coat</b> <b>over</b> William Huskisson's leg to spare Emily Huskisson from seeing the extent of his injuries, and she was helped from the carriage in which she had been sitting. In hysterics, she attempted to throw herself onto Huskisson, but was restrained by fellow passengers as Lord Wilton applied a makeshift tourniquet he had made using handkerchiefs and an elderly passenger's walking stick. Other passengers ripped the door of a nearby railway storeroom from its hinges, to serve as a makeshift stretcher. Huskisson was lifted onto the door, shaking his head and saying [...] "Where is Mrs Huskisson? I have met my death, God forgive me." [...] (Garfield, writing in 2002, gives his words as [...] "This is my death, God forgive me".) ...|$|E

500|$|Steiger portrayed a mastermind {{criminal}} {{seeking to}} obtain a $500,000 ransom, opposite James Mason and Inger Stevens, in Andrew L. Stone's Cry Terror! (1958) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Paul Beckley of the Herald Tribune had thought Steiger [...] "superbly laconic", but Dennis Schwartz dismissed the film as [...] "an ill-conceived attempt" [...] with [...] "too many coincidences and contrived plot points to sustain interest". The following year, Steiger appeared with Claire Bloom (whom he later married) in a Fay and Michael Kanin stage production of Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film, Rashomon, where he enacted {{the role of the}} bandit originally played by Toshiro Mifune. A major success, it was lauded by critics and nominated for three Tony awards. Robert Coleman of the Daily Mirror described Steiger's performance as [...] "magnificently animalish", while Kenneth Tynan of The New Yorker thought the acting helped set new standards for Broadway. The same year, Steiger portrayed iconic mobster Al Capone in the film of the same name. Steiger was particularly keen on demonstrating the showiness of Capone, speaking thunderously, slinging a camel-hair <b>coat</b> <b>over</b> his shoulders and wearing his hat at a jaunty angle. The film, noted for its deglamorized portrayal of the subject, earned Steiger a Laurel Award for Best Male Dramatic Performance nomination. Though Hutchinson, author of Rod Steiger: Memoirs of a friendship, perceived Steiger's portrayal of Capone {{to be more of a}} caricature, George Anastasia and Glen Macnow, authors of the book The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies, described it as one of the best screen portrayals of Capone.|$|E

His devotion has caused her to love him. She tries to change her position and the coat falls to the ground. She picks it up and the letter from England and the paper falls out.

She reflects and then draws the forged letter from her bosom and sees that it was written after the announcement of the marriage. It is all revealed to her. The sacrifice of Gerald — the double duty, love and a desire to uphold the honor of the proud English family. She cries to Gerald but cannot make him hear. In her desperation she tries to wheel her chair down the slope and it is overturned. Her cries bring Gerald and when he comes she shows him the newspaper and the letter. He is silent.
