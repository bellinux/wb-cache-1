50|$|The term {{chromic acid}} is usually {{used for a}} mixture made by adding {{concentrated}} sulfuric acid to a dichromate, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid chromium trioxide. This kind of chromic acid {{may be used as}} a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, H2CrO4 of which the trioxide is the <b>anhydride.</b> <b>Chromic</b> acid features chromium in an oxidation state of +6 (or VI). It is a strong and corrosive oxidising agent.|$|R

50|$|The Sarett reagent was {{originally}} prepared in 1953 by addition of <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride</b> to pyridine First, reagent grade pyridine must be cooled to 15-20 °C. Then, a small initial {{portion of the}} <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride</b> is carefully stirred into to the pyridine. Eventually, the brick-red anhydride will transform into the orange-yellow Sarett reagent in an exothermic reaction. At this point the remaining anhydride may be gradually stirred into the solution. This must be done very slowly so that the mixture never rises above 30 °C. The final product is a slurry of excess pyridine and the precipitated Sarett reagent, which {{can take up to}} an hour to prepare (per 100 g yield). The Sarett oxidation would then be carried out immediately in this mixture.|$|E
50|$|Hexavalent {{chromium}} plating, {{also known}} as hex-chrome, Cr+6, and chrome (VI) plating, uses chromium trioxide ({{also known as}} <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride)</b> as the main ingredient. Hexavalent chromium plating solution is used for decorative and hard plating, along with bright dipping of copper alloys, chromic acid anodizing, and chromate conversion coating.|$|E
50|$|The {{specific}} {{methods of}} the reagent's preparation are critical, as improper technique can cause {{the explosion of the}} materials. Some technical improvements to the original methodology have reduced the risks associated with preparation. One such recent improvement reduced the likelihood of explosion by using <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride</b> granules that would immediately sink {{below the surface of the}} cooled pyridine upon addition. It should also be mentioned that chromium trioxide is a corrosive carcinogen and therefore must be handled with extreme care.|$|E
40|$|A new green {{technology}} of producing <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride</b> with an electrochemical synthesis method was studied {{to solve the}} pollution problems in the traditional production process of <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> A self-made electrosynthesis reactor of pure titanium and stainless steel, with a multiple-unit metal oxides combination anode, a cathode of stainless steel, and a reinforced combination cation exchange membrane with perfluorosulfonic and perfluorocarboxylic polymers was used to carry out, the direct electrochemical synthesis experiment of <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride</b> from sodium dichromate. From the experimental results and the principle of electrochemical reaction, {{it was found that}} the process of electrochemical synthesis reaction of <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride</b> might be quantitatively followed by the variation of operating voltage measured macroscopically with reaction time. Operating voltages were experimentally measured at the different initial sodium dichromate concentrations of the anolyte in the electrosynthesis process of <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> and the variation of operating voltage with reaction time was discussed. The mathematical model of the variation of operating voltages with reaction time and the rate of change equations of operating voltage were established. The model characterizes the change of operating voltages in the electrosynthesis process of <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> and provideds the foundations for the further study and process monitoring of the electrochemical synthesis of <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride...</b>|$|E
40|$|A new green {{technology}} of producing <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride</b> with an electrochemical synthesis method was studied {{to solve the}} pollution problems in the traditional production process of <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> The anolyte used was sodium dichromate solution, and the anode used was a self-made combination electrode of titanium matrix with a multiple-unit metal oxides active coating. The electrochemical behavior of sodium dichromate solution on a combination electrode of titanium matrix was studied with cyclic voltammetry {{as a part of}} the fundamental researches of this technique. The electrooxidation reaction of 160 cycles indicated that the electrode possessed a very stable electrochemical behavior. The peak currents ip and peak potentials Ep of the oxidation peaks for sodium dichromate solution of different concentrations, i. e., water under the existence of sodium dichromate, were experimentally measured at different temperatures and sweep rates v on the electrode. The equations of peak current ip versus v 1 / 2 and peak potential Ep versus lnv were established, indicating that the electrode reaction was an irreversible diffusion-controlled reaction. The kinetic parameters and activation energy of electrode reaction was calculated, and the effects of temperature on the kinetic parameters and activation energy were preliminarily discussed...|$|E

40|$|Resistive, magnetoresistive and {{magnetic}} properties of four kinds of pressed CrO 2 powders, synthesized by hydrothermal method of <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride</b> have been investigated. The particles in powders constituted of rounded particles (diameter 120 nm) or needle-shaped crystals {{with an average}} diameter of 22. 9 nm and average length of 302 nm. All of the particles had a surface dielectric shell of varying thickness and different types (such as oxyhydroxide -CrOOH or chromium oxide Cr 2 O 3). For all the samples at low temperatures we found non-metallic temperature dependence of resistivity and giant negative magnetoresistance (MR).

40|$|The trace elements, Ca, Mg, Ba, Co, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, Sr, Zn, Al, Fe, Ni, Ti, Si and V, in K 2 CrO 4 were {{simultaneously}} {{determined by}} {{inductively coupled plasma}} atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Optimum spectral lines were selected for each analyzed element. The matrix effect was studied and eliminated through matrix matching. The {{results show that the}} linear correlations of standard curves are good (R- 2 = 0. 9986 - 1. 000) under the determined conditions. The recoveries of standard addition are in the range of 83. 7 %- 113. 0 %, and the relative standard deviations are lower than 9. 48 %(n= 9). Detection limits of these impurities are in the range of 0. 075 - 2. 625 mg. kg(- 1). The method is rapid, simple, accurate and credible, so it can be used for the determination of impurities in K 2 CrO 4 product. The results also show that there is relatively high content of Ca. Mg, Al and Si in K 2 CrO 4 product, so the K 2 CrO 4 product can't be directly used for the ion membrane electrochemical synthesis of <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride</b> and the product must be taken for further purification...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHexavalent {{chromium}} {{was recently}} prohibited in the European automotive industry, {{electrical and electronic equipment}} by two regulations of the European Parliament (End of Life Vehicles and RoHS). It is still {{allowed in the}} electrolytic baths for decorative chromium plating and hard chromium plating, but the regulation concerning the surface treatment industry was reinforced, in particular reclassifying the <b>chromic</b> <b>anhydride</b> amongst the very toxic substances. In addition, surface coatings deposited by thermal spraying have already been developed in the industry to replace the electrolytic process. But results are not always satisfactory for porosity and microstructure reasons. The contribution of laser cladding is also studied. This allows the formation of denser coatings. In fact, both processes appear to be very complementary. Thus, it is interesting to compare the environmental and technical results obtained with these two technologies. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} propose coatings, with a justified environmental behaviour, carried out by thermal spray processes (APS and HVOF) and laser cladding (with a diode laser) which could replace hard chromium coatings in order to resist wear and/or corrosion. The originality of this step lies in the optimization of the coating processes, in order to offer transferable alternatives to industrial production. To take into account the environmental properties of these coatings from the point of view of materials and processes, Life Cycle Assessment of the surface coating processes was established, which constitutes the genuine characteristic of the study. The ecodesign of surface coatings has not been reported in detail in the current literature. Thus two types of materials, stainless steel and self-fluxing NiCrBSi alloy, were chosen to be the coatings on a steel substrate. Then, chemical characterization (corrosion in salt spray test) was carried out in order to determine the alternative potential of dry coatings, especially NiCrBSi coatings, compared to electrolytic hard chromium plating...|$|E
