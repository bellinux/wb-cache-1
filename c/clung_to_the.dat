Locke threw the engine into reverse gear, a process which took ten seconds to engage. As Rocket continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked.

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom, the {{government}} became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence's recent invention, the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{the company}} <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} plateau upon which the Sattelberg mission was situated, as fresh {{supplies}} were brought up from the rear. The attack was resumed at 08:35 hours the next day, supported by heavy artillery and mortar fire, however, as the 2/48th crested the ridge they found the position unoccupied, with the Japanese having abandoned it the previous night. For his actions the previous day, Derrick was given the honour of raising the Australian flag over the mission and was later awarded a Victoria Cross—the battalion's fourth—to go with the Distinguished Conduct Medal he had received for actions during the fighting around El Alamein. Later, Derrick was sent to an Officer Training Unit, after which he was commissioned and, returned to the battalion as a lieutenant; this was a departure from usual Army policy and {{was the result of}} intensive lobbying on Derrick's behalf.|$|E

25|$|Cromwell's {{death in}} 1658 caused the English Republic to {{collapse}} into feuding {{military and political}} factions. Milton, however, stubbornly <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beliefs that had originally inspired him to write for the Commonwealth. In 1659, he published A Treatise of Civil Power, attacking {{the concept of a}} state-dominated church (the position known as Erastianism), as well as Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove hirelings, denouncing corrupt practises in church governance. As the Republic disintegrated, Milton wrote several proposals to retain a non-monarchical government against the wishes of parliament, soldiers, and the people.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by neoclassical tastes, the short-waisted dresses sported soft, loose {{skirts and}} were often made of white, almost {{transparent}} muslin, which was easily washed and draped loosely like the garments on Greek and Roman statues. Since the fabric <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body, revealing what was underneath, it made nudity à la grecque {{a centerpiece of}} public spectacle. Thus during the 1795–1820 period, it was often possible for middle- and upper-class women to wear clothes that were not very confining or cumbersome, and still be considered decently and fashionably dressed.|$|E
25|$|It fell to Brogan to {{implement}} sweeping changes.

The number of battalions in the Royal Australian Regiment was reduced from nine to six, but Brogan <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> divisional structure, which would remain until the 1990s. The Department of the Army was abolished, replaced by the new Department of Defence.

Brogan revived the position of Vice CGS, appointing Major General Francis Hassett, who would become his successor, to the post.|$|E

25|$|The fog {{lifted from}} the town around 10 a.m. and Sumner gave his order to advance an hour later. French's brigade under Brig. Gen. Nathan Kimball began to move around noon. They {{advanced}} slowly through heavy artillery fire, crossed the canal in columns over the narrow bridges, and formed in line, with fixed bayonets, behind the protection of a shallow bluff. In perfect line of battle, they advanced up the muddy slope until they were cut down at about 125 yards from the stone wall by repeated rifle volleys. Some soldiers {{were able to get}} as close as 40 yards, but having suffered severe casualties from both the artillery and infantry fire, the survivors <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. Kimball was severely wounded during the assault, and his brigade suffered 25% casualties. French's brigades under Col. John W. Andrews and Col. Oliver H.

25|$|The {{remaining}} eight crewmen <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wreckage {{throughout the}} night but by dawn the next morning, Captain Bell and seaman Bill Cunningham had succumbed to hypothermia and died, still afloat nearby in their life-jackets.

It was decided that each man should try {{to make his own}} way to shore, and so at intervals of maybe 15 minutes one-by-one the men left the floating planks and struck-out for the beach. Nagle, who didn't have a life-jacket, went first, followed by Thomsen and Fitzsimmons. After about an hour Fizsimmons passed the earlier two, still alive but near exhaustion, and at around 10am he stumbled onto Woonona beach where he flagged down a Hubbards Bakery truck driven by a Mr Hobbs, who took him to Bulli Police Station where he broke the news of the shipwreck.|$|E
25|$|For the slaves, the cabildo {{had many}} uses. They {{were able to}} collect money or pool {{resources}} to assist members in times of illness or death. Cabildos also had a religious purpose, they were the place where slaves could consult their deities and ancestors. For those slaves who <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> religious traditions of Africa, a cabildo {{was one of the}} few means of succor at their disposal. The cabildo represented Africa in foreign territory that would help slaves keep alive their faith. Cabildos were institutions that made possible the conservation of the idiosyncrasy, religion and culture of the African nations in Cuba. The songs, dances, and drum rhythms that were played for African deities in a land that was so hostile to the Africans slaves were the mechanism by which slaves were able to keep alive their Africanness and resist Spanish cultural hegemony.|$|E

25|$|At the 1917 National Convention of the Socialist Party, Spargo was {{the author}} of a {{minority}} resolution in the Committee on War and Militarism calling for American support of the Allied war effort as the least onerous alternative facing the socialist movement. This proposal was decisively defeated, garnering the support of only 5 delegates, in favor of the militant St. Louis Resolution, which called for an active struggle against the American war effort. Up until the party voted to ratify the St. Louis Resolution, Spargo <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hope that a moderate majority of the rank and file would endorse his own views of the European conflict. When, on the other hand, the party's membership enthusiastically endorsed the party's line established at the 1917 convention, Spargo decided to make a decisive exit from the organization. On May 30, 1917, he resigned his seat on the SP's governing National Executive Committee, followed three days later by his resignation from the party itself.|$|E
25|$|Although not all Afrikander Bond leaders liked Kruger, {{they were}} ready to support him whether or not he granted reforms and, by the same result, {{contrived}} to make Milner's position untenable. His difficulties were increased when, at the general election in Cape Colony, the Bond obtained a majority. In October 1898, acting strictly in a constitutional manner, Milner called upon William Philip Schreiner to form a ministry, though aware that such a ministry would be opposed to any direct intervention of Great Britain in the Transvaal. Convinced that the existing state of affairs, if continued, would end in the loss of South Africa by Britain, Milner visited England in November 1898. He returned to Cape Colony in February 1899, fully assured of Joseph Chamberlain's support, though the government still <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hope that the moderate section of the Cape and Orange Free State Dutch would induce Kruger to give the vote to the Uitlanders. He found the situation more critical than when he had left, ten weeks previously. Johannesburg was in a ferment, while William Francis Butler, who acted as high commissioner in Milner's absence, had allowed the inference that he did not support Uitlander grievances.|$|E
25|$|The palace was {{occupied}} by Pope Vigilius, the first pope of the Byzantine Papacy, in 547 during a papal visit to Constantinople. In 550, Vigilius decided that the Placidia Palace was not secure enough for his needs, and moved into the basilica of St. Peter of Hormisdas. From the basilica, Vigilius drafted a document of excommunication of Patriarch Menas and his followers, signed by another dozen Western bishops. Upon its publication, Comitas Dupondiaristes, the praetor of the Plebs, was dispatched to the basilica to arrest Vigilius and the African bishops with him. According to one account, Vigilius <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> altar, and as the guards attempted to drag him, it toppled, nearly crushing him. The praetor withdrew, leaving several bishops injured. The next day, a group of Byzantine dignitaries convinced Vigilius that no more harm would be done to him if {{he returned to the}} Placidia Palace, which he did. There, Vigilius was more or less placed under house arrest. On the night of December 23/24, 551, Vigilius fled across the Bosporus to the Church of St. Euphemia in Chalcedon. In February, the other bishops, but not Vigilius, were arrested. On June 26, the pope and the emperor reconciled and Vigilius returned to the Placidia.|$|E

2500|$|According to Finnish {{historians and}} {{political}} journalists, {{there were at}} least three reasons why Kekkonen <b>clung</b> on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Presidency.
