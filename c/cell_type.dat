5|$|Cytoplasmic {{polyadenylation}} {{requires the}} RNA-binding proteins CPSF and CPEB, and can involve other RNA-binding proteins like Pumilio. Depending on the <b>cell</b> <b>type,</b> the polymerase {{can be the}} same type of polyadenylate polymerase (PAP) that is used in the nuclear process, or the cytoplasmic polymerase GLD-2.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for {{lung cancer}} {{depends on the}} cancer's {{specific}} <b>cell</b> <b>type,</b> how far it has spread, and the person's performance status. Common treatments include palliative care, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Targeted therapy of lung cancer is growing in importance for advanced lung cancer.|$|E
40|$|Questions: What is the macroevolutionary {{relationship}} between body size, number of <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> and metabolism? Furthermore, {{why does the}} {{relationship between}} body size {{and the number of}} <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> hold between major metazoan clades but not within closely related taxa? Mathematical methods: Expand the allometric relationship between size and metabolism to include (1) the energetic costs of supporting an increased number of <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> and (2) the phylogenetic constraints governing the number of <b>cell</b> <b>types.</b> Key assumptions: An increase in organismal size selects for additional <b>cell</b> <b>types.</b> This is due to biophysical constraints and transport demands. The increase in <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> allows the organism to perform new functions. The extra <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> also require more intercellular networks. Therefore, the amount of energy required per unit of body mass should increase with the number of <b>cell</b> <b>types.</b> Phylogeny may also constrain the number of <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> within taxa. This constraint will limit the number of <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> to be approximately constant within a bauplan (a unique organismal form comprised of an anatomical and physiological design). Predictions: Organismal size should be positively correlated to the number of <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> across metazoan taxa. However, this relationship will not hold within clades due to energetic and phylogenetic constraints. The energetic constraint leads to a positive correlation between the number of <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> and metabolic intensity (the mass-specific rate of energy processing standardized to a given body size) across metazoan bauplans. Available data support these predictions. Metabolic intensity is positively related to the number of <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> in metazoan clades...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{challenges}} in generating in vivo like cultures or tissue in vitro is the difficulty in co-culturing different <b>cell</b> <b>types.</b> Because of the ability of 3D cell culturing by magnetic levitation to bring cells together, co-culturing different <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> is possible. Co-culturing of different <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> can be achieved {{at the onset of}} levitation, by mixing different <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> in before levitation or by magnetically guiding 3D cultures in an invasion assay format.|$|R
25|$|The term {{viral tropism}} refers to which <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> EBV infects. EBV can infect {{different}} <b>cell</b> <b>types,</b> including B <b>cells</b> and epithelial cells.|$|R
5|$|A nucleus {{typically}} contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2µm and 2.0µm {{depending on}} the <b>cell</b> <b>type</b> and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. CBs {{are involved in a}} number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.|$|E
5|$|Prognostic {{factors in}} NSCLC include {{presence}} of pulmonary symptoms, large tumor size (>3cm), nonsquamous <b>cell</b> <b>type</b> (histology), degree of spread (stage) and metastases to multiple lymph nodes, and vascular invasion. For people with inoperable disease, outcomes are worse {{in those with}} poor performance status and weight loss of more than 10%. Prognostic factors in small cell lung cancer include performance status, gender, stage of disease, and involvement of {{the central nervous system}} or liver at the time of diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{the chief}} actors within the cell, {{said to be}} {{carrying}} out the duties specified by the information encoded in genes. With the exception of certain types of RNA, most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act. Proteins make up half the dry weight of an Escherichia coli cell, whereas other macromolecules such as DNA and RNA make up only 3% and 20%, respectively. The set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or <b>cell</b> <b>type</b> is known as its proteome.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{have evolved}} a greater {{diversity}} of <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> in a multicellular body (100-150 different <b>cell</b> <b>types),</b> comparedwith 10-20 in plants, fungi, and protoctista.|$|R
50|$|During embryo {{development}} (embryogenesis), many <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> are present {{which are not}} present in the adult organism. These temporary cells are called progenitor cells, and are intermediate <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> which disappear during embryogenesis by turning into other progenitor cells, or into mature adult somatic <b>cell</b> <b>types,</b> or which disappear due to programmed cell death (apoptosis).|$|R
50|$|The {{anterior}} cochlear nucleus contains several <b>cell</b> <b>types,</b> which correspond {{fairly well}} with different physiological unit <b>types.</b> Additionally, these <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> generally have specific projection patterns.|$|R
5|$|Like chondrostean fish, {{the major}} immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes {{are believed to}} reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major <b>cell</b> <b>type</b> found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system {{similar to that in}} mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.|$|E
5|$|The total {{complement}} of proteins present {{at a time}} in a cell or <b>cell</b> <b>type</b> is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by analogy to the related field of genomics. Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis, which allows the separation {{of a large number of}} proteins, mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of a large number of proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. The {{total complement}} of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.|$|E
5|$|Type II endometrial carcinomas usually {{occur in}} older, post-menopausal people, in the United States {{are more common}} in black women, and are not {{associated}} with increased exposure to estrogen or a history of endometrial hyperplasia. Type II endometrial cancers are often high-grade, with deep invasion into the underlying uterine wall (myometrium), are of the serous or clear <b>cell</b> <b>type,</b> and carry a poorer prognosis. They can appear to be epithelial ovarian cancer on evaluation of symptoms. They tend to present later than Type I tumors and are more aggressive, with {{a greater risk of}} relapse and/or metastasis.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{technical}} comparison between quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and digital PCR, {{the expression of}} the rat gabrd gene was examined across three <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> in the somatosensory cortex: neurogliaform cells, fast spiking basket cells and pyramidal cells. [...] Gene expression was detected in all three <b>cell</b> <b>types,</b> but showed marked enrichment in neurogliaform cells versus the other <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> examined.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> {{appear to}} have {{transporters}} to import carnitine and export acyl-carnitines, {{which seems to be}} a mechanism to dispose of longer-chain moieties; however many <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> can also import ALCAR.|$|R
40|$|It is a {{challenging}} question {{to understand how}} different neuronal types are organized into a complex architecture in the cortex, an architecture which is also adapted in different regions to subserve very different functions. Recent developments in genetic and molecular techniques have opened up {{the possibility of using}} gene expression profiling for neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>typing,</b> with the aim of uncovering novel <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> and the underlying mechanisms which generate and maintain neuronal heterogeneity in the cortex. This review introduces some current ideas about neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> in the cortex and describes recent approaches to expression profiling for defining cortical neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R
5|$|Proteins are {{targeted}} for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue {{that requires the}} coordinated reactions of three enzymes. In the first step, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (known as E1) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule. This is then transferred to E1's active-site cysteine residue {{in concert with the}} adenylylation of a second ubiquitin. This adenylylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). In the last step, a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases (E3) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein. A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers (in the form of a polyubiquitin chain) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid. It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system. The number of E1, E2, and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and <b>cell</b> <b>type,</b> but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans, indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria (and related structures) {{are found}} in all eukaryotes (except one—the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.). Although {{commonly}} depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network {{in the majority of}} cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to <b>cell</b> <b>type.</b> A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria {{are found in}} human liver cells, with about 1000–2000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume. The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential, with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum. Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.|$|E
25|$|As a {{stem cell}} matures it {{undergoes}} changes in gene expression that limit the cell types {{that it can}} become and moves it closer to a specific <b>cell</b> <b>type</b> (cellular differentiation). These changes can often be tracked by monitoring the presence of proteins {{on the surface of}} the cell. Each successive change moves the cell closer to the final <b>cell</b> <b>type</b> and further limits its potential to become a different <b>cell</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{photovoltaic}} array space power (PASP) -Plus {{solar cell}} flight experiment is described, and the observed performances of different solar <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> {{during the first}} six months of their operation, are summarized. The solar <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> include single crystal and amorphous silicon, GaAs, several multijunction <b>cell</b> <b>types,</b> indium phosphide and GaAs/GaSb concentrator cells. The radiation degradation experienced by some of the solar <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> agrees with theoretical predictions. Other samples, including silicon, are degraded less than predicted.

40|$|The {{neoplastic}} {{cells from}} 30 cases of squamous {{carcinoma in situ}} of the uterine cervix have been cytologically subdivided into the following types : small type calls, large <b>type</b> <b>cells,</b> third <b>type</b> <b>cells,</b> large non-keratinizing cells, small cancer cells, keratinizing cancer cells, fiber cells and undifferentiated cancer <b>cells.</b> Small <b>type</b> <b>cells,</b> large <b>type</b> <b>cells</b> and third <b>type</b> <b>cells</b> were commonly seen in the cytologic preparations and one of these types comprised the predominant cancer cell in every case. The cases of mixed type with large and small <b>type</b> <b>cells,</b> large and third <b>type</b> <b>cells,</b> and large and keratinizing cancer cells were not common. Knowledge {{of the significance of}} such <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> may be helpful in making a correct cytologic diagnosis.

25|$|Other {{considerations}} for starting <b>cell</b> <b>type</b> include mutational load (for example, skin cells may harbor more mutations due to UV exposure), {{time it takes}} to expand the population of starting cells, and the ability to differentiate into a given <b>cell</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pluripotency {{in certain}} stem cells could {{also make it}} {{difficult}} to obtain a specific <b>cell</b> <b>type.</b> It is also difficult to obtain the exact <b>cell</b> <b>type</b> needed, because not all cells in a population differentiate uniformly.

40|$|Countless {{in vitro}} cell culture models {{based on the}} use of {{epithelial}} <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> of single lineages have been characterized and have provided insight into the mechanisms of infection for various microbial pathogens. Diverse culture models based on diseaserelevant mucosal epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> derived from gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and pulmonary organ systems have delineated many key host-pathogen interactions that underlie viral, parasitic, and bacterial disease pathogenesis. An alternative to single lineage epithelial cell monoculture, which offers more flexibility and can overcome some of the limitations of epithelial cell culture models based on only single <b>cell</b> <b>types,</b> is coculture of epithelial cells with other host <b>cell</b> <b>types.</b> Various coculture models have been described, which incorporate epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> in culture combination {{with a wide range of}} other <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> including neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes.

40|$|We {{describe}} recent {{progress toward}} defining neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> in the mouse retina {{and attempt to}} extract lessons that may be generally useful in the mammalian brain. Achieving a comprehensive catalog of retinal <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> now appears within reach, because researchers have achieved consensus concerning two fundamental challenges. The first is accuracy—defining pure <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> rather than settling for neuronal classes that are mixtures of types. The second is completeness—developing methods guaranteed to eventually identify all <b>cell</b> <b>types,</b> as well as criteria for determining when all types have been found. Case studies illustrate how these two challenges are handled by combining state-of-the-art molecular, anatomical, and physiological techniques. Progress is also being made in observing and modeling connectivity between <b>cell</b> <b>types.</b> Scaling up to larger brain regions, such as the cortex, will require not only technical advances but also careful consideration of the challenges of accuracy and completeness...|$|R
40|$|SummaryRegeneration {{starts with}} injury. Yet how {{injuries}} affect gene expression in different <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> and how distinct injuries differ in gene expression remain unclear. We defined the transcriptomes of major <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> of planarians—flatworms that regenerate from nearly any injury—and identified 1, 214 tissue-specific markers across 13 <b>cell</b> <b>types.</b> RNA sequencing on 619 single cells revealed that wound-induced genes were expressed either {{in nearly all}} <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> or specifically {{in one of three}} <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> (stem <b>cells,</b> muscle, or epidermis). Time course experiments following different injuries indicated that a generic wound response is activated with any injury regardless of the regenerative outcome. Only one gene, notum, was differentially expressed early between anterior- and posterior-facing wounds. Injury-specific transcriptional responses emerged 30  hr after injury, involving context-dependent patterning and stem-cell-specialization genes. The regenerative requirement of every injury is different; however, our work demonstrates that all injuries start with a common transcriptional response...|$|R
40|$|SummaryRelating the {{function}} of neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> to information processing and behavior is a central goal of neuroscience. In the hippocampus, pyramidal cells in CA 1 and the subiculum process sensory and motor cues to form a cognitive map encoding spatial, contextual, and emotional information, which they transmit throughout the brain. Do these cells constitute a single class or are there multiple <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> with specialized functions? Using unbiased cluster analysis, we show {{that there are two}} morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct principal <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> that carry hippocampal output. We show further that these two <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> are inversely modulated by the synergistic action of glutamate and acetylcholine acting on metabotropic receptors that are central to hippocampal function. Combined with prior connectivity studies, our results support a model of hippocampal processing in which the two pyramidal <b>cell</b> <b>types</b> are predominantly segregated into two parallel pathways that process distinct modalities of information...|$|R
