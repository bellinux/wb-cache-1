5|$|Andean {{cocks-of-the-rock}} face {{slightly larger}} predators than smaller songbirds. Predators {{are attracted to}} leks by the conspicuous behavior of the displaying males. The animals reported to prey on adult cocks-of-the-rock including hawk-eagles, hawks, forest-falcons, jaguar, mountain lion, ocelot and the boa <b>constrictor.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the {{recurrent}} nerve hooks {{around the}} subclavian artery or aorta, it gives off several branches. There is suspected {{variability in the}} configuration of these branches to the cardiac plexus, trachea, esophagus and inferior pharyngeal <b>constrictor</b> muscle.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of the Guianan cock-of-the-rock are harpy eagles, {{black-and-white}} hawk-eagles, black hawk-eagles, and slaty-backed forest falcons. Although {{these are}} the main predators, two species of owls, crested owls and spectacled owls, are also predators. Felines such as the jaguar, puma, and ocelot can also be predators, along with snakes such as the bird snake, tree boas, boa <b>constrictor,</b> tiger rat snake, and fer-de-lance.|$|E
25|$|Boa <b>constrictors</b> {{are very}} popular within the exotic pet trade, {{and have been}} both {{captured}} in the wild and bred in captivity. Today, most captive boa <b>constrictors</b> are captive-bred, but between 1977 and 1983, 113,000 live boa <b>constrictors</b> were imported into the United States. These huge numbers of wild-caught snakes have put considerable pressure on some wild populations. Boa <b>constrictors</b> have also been harvested for their meat and skins, and are a common sight at markets within their geographic range. After the reticulated python, boa <b>constrictors</b> are the snake most commonly killed for snakeskin products, such as shoes, bags, and other items of clothing. In some areas, they {{have an important role}} in regulating the opossum populations, preventing the potential transmission of leishmaniasis to humans. In other areas, they are often let loose within the communities to control the rodent populations.|$|R

5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves supply sensation to {{the larynx}} below the vocal cords, gives cardiac branches {{to the deep}} cardiac plexus, and branches to the trachea, esophagus and the inferior <b>constrictor</b> muscles. The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscles that can open the vocal cords, are innervated by this nerve.|$|E
5|$|The upper esophageal {{sphincter}} {{surrounds the}} upper part of the esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle but is not under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex. The primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal <b>constrictor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{considered}} to be a keystone species whose presence in the ecosystem maintains a healthy balance of organisms. In its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young of Cuvier's dwarf caiman are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons and other mammals. Adult caimans are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (Boa <b>constrictor).</b>|$|E

25|$|Boa <b>constrictors</b> {{can sense}} heat via cells in their lips, though {{they lack the}} labial pits {{surrounding}} these receptors seen in {{many members of the}} Boidae family. Boa <b>constrictors</b> also have two lungs, a smaller (nonfunctional) left and an enlarged (functional) right lung to better fit their elongated shape, unlike many colubrid snakes, which have completely lost the left lung.|$|R
5|$|Wildlife in pine rockland {{communities}} is diverse. In some forests, 15species of birds can be found. Common {{among them are}} the pine warbler (Dendroica pinus), the red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), and the eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna). More than 20species of reptiles and amphibians have been noted, such as the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), and southern black racer (Coluber <b>constrictor</b> priapus). Mammals such as the critically endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), American black bearFlorida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus), and several types of bats also live in the pine rocklands.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Bad News Brown and Jake Roberts {{began when}} Roberts sent Brown a {{birthday}} present on the April 22 episode of Wrestling Challenge. Upon opening the package, Brown found a rubber snake; {{it was revealed that}} Brown was afraid of snakes. On the May 5 episode of WWF Superstars, the two men agreed to a match; Brown later claimed that his fear of snakes was cured, although he was quickly proven wrong. On the July 28 episode of WWF Superstars, it was announced that Brown and Roberts face each other at SummerSlam with the Big Boss Man as a special referee. Brown also announced that he would bring 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats to counteract Roberts's boa <b>constrictor,</b> Damien.|$|E
5|$|The vagus nerves, {{from which}} the {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves branch, exit the skull at the jugular foramen and travel within the carotid sheath alongside the carotid arteries through the neck. The recurrent laryngeal nerves branch off the vagus, the left at the aortic arch, and the right at the right subclavian artery. The left RLN passes {{in front of the}} arch, and then wraps underneath and behind it. After branching, the nerves typically ascend in a groove at the junction of the trachea and esophagus. They then pass behind the posterior, middle part of the outer lobes of the thyroid gland and enter the larynx underneath the inferior <b>constrictor</b> muscle, passing into the larynx just posterior to the cricothyroid joint. The terminal branch is called the inferior laryngeal nerve.|$|E
25|$|Boa <b>constrictors</b> {{generally}} live {{on their}} own, {{and do not}} interact with any other snakes unless they want to mate. They are nocturnal, but they may bask during the day when night-time temperatures are too low. As semi-arboreal snakes, young boa <b>constrictors</b> may climb into trees and shrubs to forage; however, they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. Boa <b>constrictors</b> strike when they perceive a threat. Their bite can be painful, especially from large snakes, but is rarely dangerous to humans. Specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily. Like all snakes, boa <b>constrictors</b> in a shed cycle are more unpredictable, because the substance that lubricates between the old skin and the new makes their eyes appear milky, blue, or opaque, so that the snake cannot see very well, causing it to be more defensive than it might be otherwise.|$|R
50|$|This {{includes}} the following muscles: palatopharyngeus, palatoglossus, musculus uvulae, the pharyngeal <b>constrictors,</b> salpingopharyngeus plus others.|$|R
50|$|Both the nonvenomous boa <b>constrictors</b> {{and much}} of the {{colubrid}} species primarily kill their prey via constriction, grabbing their prey within their jaws before throwing coils of their muscular bodies around the prey item and squeezing a great amount of pressure, killing their prey by asphyxiation and ruptured blood capillaries. Boa <b>constrictors</b> are ambush hunters, while colubrids will vary between being either active hunters or ambush hunters.|$|R
5|$|During the {{following}} match, a covered cage sat at ringside, supposedly containing 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats, although {{the contents of}} the cage were not revealed. Bad News Brown controlled most of the early stages of his match against Jake Roberts. Roberts attempted to perform the DDT twice, including once when Brown was arguing with special referee Big Bossman, but Brown blocked the move both times. Outside the ring, Brown hit Roberts with a chair while the Big Bossman was not looking. Roberts gained the advantage by punching Brown repeatedly but was kicked to the outside after Brown reversed a DDT attempt into a back bodydrop. Brown hit Roberts with a chair again but was disqualified when the Bossman saw him. Brown tried to gain revenge after the match by attacking Roberts's boa <b>constrictor,</b> Damien, but the Bossman attacked Brown to save the snake.|$|E
5|$|In February 1987, Megadeth was {{the opening}} act on Alice Cooper's <b>Constrictor</b> tour, and the {{following}} month the band began its first headlining world tour in the United Kingdom. The 72-week tour was supported by Overkill and Necros, and continued in the United States. During the tour, Mustaine and Ellefson considered firing Samuelson for his drug abuse. According to Mustaine, Samuelson had become too much to handle when intoxicated. Drummer Chuck Behler traveled with Megadeth for the last dates of the tour as the other band members feared Samuelson {{would not be able}} to continue touring. Poland occasionally quarreled with Mustaine, and was accused of selling band equipment to buy heroin. As a result, Samuelson and Poland were asked to leave Megadeth in 1987, with Behler becoming the band's full-time drummer. Later that year, 16-year-old guitarist Jeff Loomis of Sanctuary auditioned for the band. Mustaine complimented Loomis' playing but considered him too young to join. Poland was initially replaced by Jay Reynolds of Malice, but as the band began working on its next record, Reynolds was replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young, when Megadeth was six weeks into the recording of its third album.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} snake Boa <b>constrictor</b> preys on O.couesi on Cozumel. Parasites {{recorded on}} O.couesi in Veracruz include unidentified ticks, mites, fleas, and fly larvae. The flea Polygenis odiosus {{was found on}} an Oryzomys couesi from Cozumel. Out of ten O.couesi in San Luis Potosí, five each were infected by the nematode worms Hassalstrongylus musculi and H.bocqueti, with about 25 worms per rat, and two were infected by one or two cestodes of the genus Raillietina. The mites Eubrachylaelaps circularis and Gigantolaelaps boneti have been found on Oryzomys couesi in Oaxaca, the sucking louse Hoplopleura oryzomydis in Nicaragua, the mites Laelaps oryzomydis, Echinonyssus microchelae, Ornithonyssus bacoti, Prolistrophorus frontalis, and Prolistrophorus bakeri in Colima, and the apicomplexan Eimeria couesii in Mexico. The species is infected by two hantaviruses—Catacamas virus in Honduras and Playa de Oro virus in western Mexico—which {{are related to the}} Bayou virus infecting the marsh rice rat, a common cause of hantavirus infections in the United States. No hantavirus infections in humans have been linked to O.couesi hantaviruses, however. Chiapas O.couesi easily survive experimental infection with several arboviruses, including the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, suggesting that the species may serve as a reservoir for that virus.|$|E

25|$|The boa <b>constrictor</b> (Boa <b>constrictor),</b> {{also called}} the red-tailed boa or the common boa, is a species of large, {{heavy-bodied}} snake that is frequently kept and bred in captivity. The boa <b>constrictor</b> {{is a member of}} the family Boidae, found in tropical North, Central, and South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean. A staple of private collections and public displays, its color pattern is highly variable yet distinctive. Ten subspecies are currently recognized, although some of these are controversial. This article focuses on the species Boa <b>constrictor</b> as a whole, and on the nominate subspecies B. c. <b>constrictor.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ten {{subspecies}} of Boa <b>constrictor</b> are described, {{but many}} of these are poorly differentiated and further research may redefine many of them. Some appear to be based more on location than biological differences, such as B. c. orophias (the St. Lucia boa).|$|E
25|$|In some regions, boa <b>constrictor</b> {{numbers have}} been {{severely}} hit by predation from humans and other animals, and over collection for the exotic and snakeskin trades. Most populations, though, are not under threat of immediate extinction, thus they are within Appendix II rather than Appendix I.|$|E
25|$|This species {{does well}} in captivity, usually {{becoming}} quite tame. It {{is a common}} sight in both zoos and private reptile collections. Though still exported from their native South America in significant numbers, they are widely bred in captivity. When kept in captivity, they are fed mice, rats, rabbits, chickens, and chicks {{depending on the size}} and age of the individual. Captive life expectancy is 20 to 30 years, with rare accounts over 40 years, making them a long-term commitment as a pet. The greatest reliable age recorded for a boa <b>constrictor</b> in captivity is 40 years 3 months and 14 days. This boa <b>constrictor</b> was named Popeye and died in Philadelphia Zoo, Pennsylvania, on April 15, 1977. Proper animal husbandry is the most significant factor in captive lifespan; this includes providing adequate space, correct temperatures and humidity, and suitable food items.|$|E
