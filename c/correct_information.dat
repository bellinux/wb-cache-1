25|$|Kaplan {{proposed}} that sexual dysfunction {{was based on}} intrapsychic, interpersonal, and behavioural levels. Four factors were identified that could {{have a role in}} the development of sexual dysfunction: 1) lack of <b>correct</b> <b>information</b> regarding sexual and social interaction, 2) unconscious guilt or anxiety regarding sex, 3) performance anxiety, and 4) failure to communicate between the partners.|$|E
40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} {{the effectiveness of}} a self-affirmation exercise on vaccine safety beliefs and intent to vaccinate future children. In Study 1, a sample of 585 parents with at least one child under the age of 18 in the home participated through Amazon's MTurk. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four conditions in a 2 x 2 design. Participants read either <b>correcting</b> <b>information</b> refuting a link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism or a control passage about bird feeding. Additionally, participants either completed a self-affirmation exercise where they reflected on their personal values or in a control condition in which they reflected on least-personally-important values that might be important to others. Participants exposed to the <b>correcting</b> <b>information</b> were less likely to believe that vaccines cause serious side effects, but no less likely to believe that the MMR vaccine causes autism. For parents with initially positive vaccine attitudes, there was no effect of condition on intent to vaccinate a future child. For parents with initially negative vaccine attitudes, self-affirmation was ineffective in the presence of <b>correcting</b> <b>information</b> and resulted in less intention to vaccinate in the absence of <b>correcting</b> <b>information.</b> This effect was partially replicated in Study 2 (N = 576), which provided no <b>correcting</b> <b>information</b> but otherwise followed the same procedure as Study 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} generating a control signal for a cochlea implant based on an audio signal, comprising a calculation (110) of first information on an activity pattern over time {{of a number of}} internal hair cells of an auditive model, arising from the audio signal. The method further comprises a filtering (120) of activity events described by the first information based on a recognition of a characteristic pattern in the activity pattern to give <b>corrected</b> <b>information.</b> The <b>corrected</b> <b>information</b> is then used as control signal for the cochlea implant, or the control signal is derived from the <b>corrected</b> <b>information.</b> Said method can be carried out by a computer programme or a corresponding device. By means of the above, for example, the auditive impression for patients with a cochlea implant can be significantly improved. A filtering of activity events, based on the recognition of a characteristic pattern in the activity pattern is particularly suitable to human hearing and permits the control of a cochlea implant such that the best possible speech recognition with the least possible energy use of a cochlea implant is achieved...|$|R
25|$|Motivation is {{a factor}} that {{encourages}} a person to perform and succeed at the task at hand. In an experiment done by Roebers, Moga and Schneider (2001), participants were placed in either forced report, free report or free report plus incentive groups. In each group, {{they found that the}} amount of <b>correct</b> <b>information</b> recalled did not differ, yet in the group where participants were given an incentive they had higher accuracy results. This means that presenting participants with an encouragement to provide <b>correct</b> <b>information</b> motivates them to be more precise. However, this is only true if the perception is that success is providing <b>correct</b> <b>information.</b> When it is believed that success is the completion of the task rather than the accuracy of that completion, the number of responses is higher, yet its accuracy is lowered. This shows that the results are dependent on how success is defined to the participant. In the referred experiment, the participants that were placed in the forced response group had the lowest overall accuracy; they had no motivation to provide accurate responses and were forced to respond even when they were unsure of the answer. Another study done by Hill RD, Storandt M, and Simeone C tested the impact of memory skills training and external reward on free recall of serial word lists. Effects similar to those reported in the previous study were seen in children—in contrast to older learners.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{findings}} of the official MAK investigation, the crash can be blamed on both the airport services, which did not inform the pilot about the reduced visibility in time due to organizational problems, and on the pilot, who did not give the dispatcher the <b>correct</b> <b>information</b> about his landing trajectory and, consequently, did not decide to stop the landing procedure and try to take another approach at the time he should have done so.|$|E
25|$|During the Turkey-PKK war, a {{photograph}} showing PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan with M. Yohanna, the Syriac Orthodox bishop of Aleppo, {{was used by}} two Turkish newspapers Tercüman and Sabah in 1994 to try to prove that Turkey's Armenian community and church were openly supporting and collaborating with the PKK. In May 1994, the newspaper Özgür Ülke (Free Country; the successor of the pro-Kurdish publication Özgür Gündem) released the <b>correct</b> <b>information</b> regarding the photograph and stated that it was taken during an open March 1993 meeting between Yohanna and the PKK, which was covered by the Kurdish news agency Kurdha and the magazine Özgür Halk (Free People). They {{said that it was}} found by Turkish security forces during a search in the rooms of the agency Özgür Gündem. The Turkish media also claimed that Armenia was hosting PKK training camps, but the allegations were proven to be untrue.|$|E

2500|$|... "Egocentric thinking" [...] {{refers to}} how {{individuals}} know {{more of their}} own personal information and risk {{that they can use}} to form judgments and make decisions. One difficulty, though, is that people have a large amount of knowledge about themselves, but no knowledge about others. Therefore, when making decisions, people have to use other information available to them, such as population data, in order to learn more about their comparison group. This can relate to an optimism bias because while people are using the available information they have about themselves, they have more difficulty understanding <b>correct</b> <b>information</b> about others.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Christian {{teaching}} of Father Richard Rohr, {{the concept of}} the third eye is a metaphor for non-dualistic thinking; the way the mystics see.

The mystical gaze builds upon the first two eyes—and yet goes further." [...] Rohr refers to this level of awareness as [...] "having the mind of Christ".|$|E

2500|$|The {{two-stage}} theory {{states that}} the process of recall begins with a search and retrieval process, and then a decision or recognition process where the <b>correct</b> <b>information</b> is chosen from what has been retrieved. [...] In this theory, recognition only involves the latter of these two stages, or processes, and this is thought to account for the superiority of the recognition process over recall. [...] Recognition only involves one process in which error or failure may occur, while recall involves two. [...] However, recall {{has been found to be}} superior to recognition in some cases, such as a failure to recognize words that can later be recalled.|$|E

2500|$|An {{incubation}} {{effect can}} be observed in TOT states, where the passage of time alone can influence the resolution of the state and result in successful recall. Also, the presence of a TOT state is a good predictor that the problem can be resolved correctly, although this has been shown to occur more frequently with older-young-adults than young-adults or seniors. This is evidence for both the metacognitive perspective as well as the psycholinguistic perspective. [...] It demonstrates the devotion of resources to searching memory, a source of cumulative information, for the desired <b>correct</b> <b>information,</b> and it also shows that we are aware of what information we know or do not know. This is why the current debate between the psycholinguistic view of TOTs as retrieval failure and the metacognitive view of TOTs as a tool for learning continues.|$|E
