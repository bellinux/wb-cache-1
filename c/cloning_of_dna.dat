Proteins are separated on a polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) containing {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS), renatured by removing SDS {{in the presence of}} urea, and blotted onto nitrocellulose by diffusion. The genomic DNA region of interest is digested by restriction enzymes selected to produce fragments of appropriate but different sizes, which are subsequently end-labeled and allowed to bind to the separated proteins. The specifically bound DNA is eluted from each individual protein-DNA complex and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Evidence that tissue-specific DNA binding proteins may be detected by this technique has been presented.

5000|$|MicroRNA {{sequencing}} (miRNA-seq) {{was developed}} {{to take advantage of}} next-generation sequencing or massively parallel high-throughput sequencing technologies in order to find novel miRNAs and their expression profiles in a given sample. miRNA sequencing in and of itself is not a new idea, initial methods of sequencing utilized Sanger sequencing methods. Sequencing preparation involved creating libraries by <b>cloning</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> reverse transcribed from endogenous small RNAs of 21-25 bp size selected by column and gel electrophoresis. [...] However, this method is exhaustive in terms of time and resources, as each clone has to be individually amplified and prepared for sequencing. This method also inadvertently favors miRNAs that are highly expressed. [...] Next-generation sequencing eliminates the need for sequence specific hybridization probes required in DNA microarray analysis as well as laborious cloning methods required in the Sanger sequencing method. Additionally, next-generation sequencing platforms in the miRNA-SEQ method facilitate the sequencing of large pools of small RNAs in a single sequencing run. miRNA-seq can be performed using a variety of sequencing platforms. The first analysis of small RNAs using miRNA-seq methods examined approximately 1.4 million small RNAs from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using Lynx Therapeutics' Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) sequencing platform. This study demonstrated the potential of novel, high-throughput sequencing technologies for the study of small RNAs, and it showed that genomes generate large numbers of small RNAs with plants as particularly rich sources of small RNAs. [...] Later studies used other sequencing technologies, such as a study in C. elegans which identified 18 novel miRNA genes as well as a new class of nematode small RNAs termed 21U-RNAs. [...] Another study comparing small RNA profiles of human cervical tumours and normal tissue, utilized the Illumina (company) Genome Analyzer to identify 64 novel human miRNA genes as well as 67 differentially expressed miRNAs. [...] Applied Biosystems SOLiD sequencing platform has also been used to examine the prognostic value of miRNAs in detecting human breast cancer.|$|E
40|$|The {{deletion}} of nine residues {{from the}} C-terminus of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) results in deposition of the mutant protein in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies {{and loss of}} chloramphenicol resistance in Escherichia coil. This folding defect is relieved by C-terminal fusion of the polypeptide with as few as two residues. Based on these observations, efficient positive selection for the <b>cloning</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> fragments has been demonstrated. The cloning vector encodes a C-terminally truncated CAT protein. Restriction sites {{in front of the}} stop codon allow the insertion of target DNA, resulting in the production of properly folded CAT fusion proteins and regained chloramphenicol resistance. The positive selection of recombinants is accomplished by growth of transformants on chloramphenicol-containing agar plates. The method appears particularly convenient for the <b>cloning</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> fragments amplified by the PCR because minimal information to restore CAT folding can be included in the primers. The cloning of random sequences shows that the folding defect can be relieved by fusion {{to a wide variety of}} peptides, providing great flexibility to the positive selection system, This vector may also contribute to the determination of the role of the C-terminus in CAT folding. status: publishe...|$|E

The four Cm plasmids (pCW 6, pCW 7, pCW 8, and pC 221) had molecular masses of 2. 6, 2. 8, 1. 9, and 2. 9 Mdaltons, respectively. The four Cm plasmids also differed both {{in the level of}} resistance to Cm and in susceptibility to retriction endonucleases.

40|$|To {{carry out}} {{efficient}} insertional mutagenesis in Listeria monocytogenes and {{to facilitate the}} characterization of disrupted genes, two novel derivatives of Tn 917 were constructed, Tn 917 -LTV 1 and Tn 917 -LTV 3. The derivatives (i) transpose at a significantly elevated frequency, (ii) generate transcriptional lacZ fusions when inserted into a chromosomal gene in the appropriate orientation, and (iii) allow the rapid cloning in Escherichia coli of chromosomal DNA flanking transposon insertions. The rapid <b>cloning</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> flanking insertions is possible because the transposon derivatives carry ColE 1 replication functions, a cluster of polylinker cloning sites, and antibiotic resistance genes selectable in E. coli (bla {{in the case of}} Tn 917 -LTV 1; neo and ble in the case of Tn 917 -LTV 3). The enhanced transposition frequency of Tn 917 -LTV 1 and Tn 917 -LTV 3 (about 100 -fold in Bacillus subtilis) is believed to be due to the fortuitous placement of vector-derived promoters upstream from the Tn 917 transposase gene. In L. monocytogenes, Tn 917 -LTV 3 transposed at a frequency of 8 x 10 (- 4) when introduced on a pE 194 Ts-derived vector and generated at least eight different auxotrophic mutations. Two nonhemolytic insertion mutants of L. monocytogenes were isolated, and DNA flanking the transposon insertions was cloned directly into E. coli, making use of the ColE 1 rep functions and neo gene carried by Tn 917 -LTV 3. Both insertions were shown to be within hlyA, the L. monocytogenes hemolysin structural gene. Although Tn 917 -LTV 1 and Tn 917 -LTV 3 were constructed specifically for genetic analysis of L. monocytogenes, their enhanced transposition frequency and convenience for <b>cloning</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> adjacent to sites of insertions make them the transposon derivatives of choice for insertional mutagenesis in any gram-positive bacteria that support replication of pE 194 Ts...|$|E

All the YACs hybridized within the Xq 24 -Xqter region, supporting {{the origin of the}} vast majority of the YACs from single human X-chromosomal sites. With assignments precise to ± 0. 5 bands, YACs were distributed among cytogenetic bands to roughly equal extents. Thus, there is no gross bias in the <b>cloning</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> from different bands into large YACs. To test band assignments further, hybridizations were carried out blind, and band positions were then compared with (1) probe localizations in cases in which a reported location was present in one of the YACs; (2) cross-hybridization of a labeled YAC with others in {{the collection}}; and (3) hybridization to a panel of DNAs from a series of hybrid cells containing Xq DNA truncated at various regions. Of 31 cases in which YACs contained a probe with a previously reported location, 28 in situ assignments were in agreement, and 14 other assignments, including one of the three discordant with probe localization, were confirmed by YAC cross-hybridization studies. Results with a group of nine YACs were further confirmed with a panel of somatic cell hybrid DNAs from that region. Five YACs hybridized both to Xq 25 and to a second site (four in Xq 27 and one in Xq 28), suggestive of some duplication of DNA of the hybrid cell and perhaps in normal X chromosomes. The in situ assignments are thus sufficient to place YACs easily and systematically within bins of about 7 – 10 Mb and to detect some possible anomalies. Furthermore, on the basis of expectations for random <b>cloning</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> in YACs, the assigned YACs probably cover more than 50 % of the total Xq 24 -Xq 28 region.
