5|$|In the mid-1970s, a bootleg {{containing}} rare {{singles and}} B-sides entitled The Dark Side of the Moo appeared, {{with a similar}} cover. Like Atom Heart Mother, the cover had no writing on it, although in this <b>case</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to protect the bootlegger's anonymity rather than any artistic statement. The album cover to The KLF's concept album Chill Out was also inspired by Atom Heart Mother.|$|E
5|$|The ZX Spectrum +3, {{released}} in 1987, looked {{similar to the}} +2A but featured a built-in 3-inch floppy disk drive (like the Amstrad CPC 6128) instead of the tape drive, and was in a black <b>case.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> launched in 1987, initially retailed for £249 and then later £199 and was the only Spectrum capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware.|$|E
5|$|Although single western towers {{are common}} in English parish churches, only one medieval cathedral, Ely, retains a {{centrally}} placed western tower, and in that <b>case,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> framed by two lower lateral towers, one of which has since fallen down. Ely, alone among England’s cathedrals, has a central feature over the crossing that somewhat resembles the polygonal vaulted lantern towers of Spain. This elaborate lantern-like structure known as “The Octagon” spans both the nave and aisles, and is thus said to have inspired Christopher Wren’s design for the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Its upper parts are supported by hidden wooden hammer-beams, an architectural device unique to English Gothic.|$|E

50|$|Palatalization is {{sometimes}} {{an example of}} assimilation. In some <b>cases,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> triggered by a palatal or palatalized consonant or front vowel, but in other <b>cases,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not conditioned in any way.|$|R
5000|$|Hyperhidrosis is {{excessive}} sweating, usually [...] to {{an underlying}} condition (in which <b>case</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> called secondary hyperhidrosis) and usually involving {{the body as}} a whole (in which <b>case</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> called generalized hyperhidrosis).|$|R
5|$|Congestion pricing {{has also}} been {{implemented}} for scheduled airline services. The British Airports Authority (BAA) has been a pioneer in implementing congestion pricing {{for all types of}} commercial aviation. In 1972 implemented the first peak pricing policy, with surcharges varying depending on the season and time of the day, and by 1976 raised these peak charges. London-Heathrow had seven pricing structures between 1976 and 1984. In this <b>case</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the US carriers that went to international arbitration in 1988 and won their case.|$|E
5|$|Echolocation {{probably}} first derived in bats from communicative calls. The Eocene bats Icaronycteris and Palaeochiropteryx had cranial adaptations suggesting {{an ability}} to detect ultrasound, implying they used echolocation. This {{may have been used}} at first mainly for communicative purposes or for mapping out their surroundings during their gliding phase, only being used for hunting insects while foraging on the ground or among vegetation. After the adaptation of flight was established, it may have been refined to target flying prey. Bats may have evolved echolocation through a shared common ancestor, in which <b>case</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> then lost in the Old World fruit bats, only to be regained in the horseshoe bats; or, echolocation evolved independently in both the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera lineages.|$|E
5|$|In {{the court}} <b>case,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> also cited that {{the design for}} winged {{toasters}} was not original and that the Berkeley Systems' design was itself derived from the Jefferson Airplane album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland, which also used flying toasters adorned with wings. Berkeley argued that the firm {{was unaware of the}} previous artwork until 1991, and that the album cover's toasters had clocks in addition to their wings. Jefferson Airplane later sued Berkeley Systems in turn {{for the use of the}} same flying toaster emblem. The rock group lost the case as they did not trademark the album cover at the time of publication.|$|E

5|$|Model's biographer, the {{military}} historian Steven Newton, {{argues that the}} best explanation for Model's behaviour {{is that he was}} not necessarily a Nazi, but an authoritarian militarist who saw in Hitler the strong leader that Germany needed. According to Newton, Model saw himself as the professional, apolitical soldier; he possessed a strong sense of German nationalism, with the accompanying tenets of racial prejudice against Slavs and Jews. This characterized many in the German officer corps, but in Model's <b>case</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by a cynical willingness to placate the Nazi regime to expedite his own goals.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, 1995 Tkach {{had surgery}} to remove his gall bladder. Shortly thereafter, he was readmitted to the {{hospital}} because of severe intestine and back pain. Surgeons then removed a grapefruit-size tumor from his intestines and discovered he had colon cancer. In a letter to ministers, dated September 6, Tkach {{announced that he was}} also diagnosed with bone cancer. He elected not to undertake radiation treatments. As Armstrong had done before him, Tkach named a successor to become pastor general in the event of his death. In that <b>case,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Tkach's son, Joseph Tkach Jr.|$|E
5|$|Julian was now {{faced with}} a finely-balanced {{judgement}} call. The safer option was to ignore Chnodomar's challenge and to keep his forces in their fortified bases and request and await reinforcements, if necessary until the following year's campaign season. But the performance of Barbatio and the imperial comitatus in the recent campaign cast doubt on whether such reinforcements would be supplied and on their value if they were. Such a course would also expose Gaul to a massive Germanic invasion just when the harvest was due. Alternatively, he could fight Chnodomar alone. This offered {{the prospect of a}} decisive victory, since the Alamanni forces were now, unusually, concentrated and not divided into many disparate bands. This argument was strongly made by Florentius, the praefectus praetorio Galliarum (governor-general of Gaul), who had the crucial job of ensuring the army's recruits, pay and supplies. The Romans almost always won pitched battles with barbarians, because of their superior equipment, organisation and training. But in this <b>case</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> clearly a high-risk option because of the Germans' massive superiority in numbers.|$|E
50|$|In some <b>cases</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{convenient}} {{to consider the}} loss due to distance and wavelength separately, but in that <b>case</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important {{to keep track of}} which units are being used, as each choice involves a differing constant offset.

5|$|Pattle's {{success in}} the air was overshadowed by events on the ground. The Allied forces were routed at Vevi and the Battle of the Metaxas Line had ended in total defeat for the Greek Army on 9 April. Covering the Greek forces from Larissa, Pattle claimed another Do 17 and SM.79 along with a Bf 109 damaged for his 35th and 36th aerial victories. Interceptions would now be more {{difficult}} for the port of Salonika fell. Observers at the port had been able to telephone his operations hut to warn him of approaching enemy aircraft over Mount Olympus. Pattle had to send pairs of fighters to patrol the area, which helped act as a rudimentary warning system. The effect was that there was little warning of impending attacks. The Germans, now operating from forward airfields, slipped through unnoticed. On 13 April, Pattle witnessed 15 Bf 109s strafe the airfield as three Hurricanes took off. Two veteran pilots were killed in the very brief battle in exchange for two Bf 109s. Pattle searched for the Hurricane pilots and found one fighter with a parachute beside it but no pilot. Pattle was to be further disheartened. One of the German pilots bailed out and Pattle watched in horror as the Greek soldiers guarding the airfield shot him dead as he floated down in his parachute. One of the Bf 109s crash-landed perfectly. He ordered that no-one should approach the Bf 109 in <b>case</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> rigged with explosives. The pilot was likely Hans-Jakob Arnoldy.|$|E
5|$|The balcony is {{topped by}} a niche {{consisting}} of allegorical figures of Justice and Truth, as well as triumphal sculptures of a winged female figure and a putto. Some parts of the sculptures, such as the scales held by Lady Justice, are now missing. The empty spaces between these figures contained Pinto's bust and coat of arms, but they were removed during the French occupation of Malta or in the early 19th century. It is not known how the bust of Pinto looked like, however {{it may have been}} either sculpted similar to the bust on the façade of Auberge de Castille or an original work. In either <b>case</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> probably made of bronze, and stood on a marble plinth which is still there. Similar to other busts of the time, {{it may have been the}} work of Jacques Saly. The triumphal figures are similar to those found on the 17th century funerary monument of Nicolas Cotoner sculpted by Domenico Guidi, but it is unknown who worked on the replica of the Castellania.|$|E
