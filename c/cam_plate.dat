The resulting speed difference between mainshaft and reverse idler gear produces gear noise grinding. The reverse gear noise reduction system employs a <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> which {{was added to the}} reverse shift holder. When shifting into reverse, the 5th/reverse shift piece, connected to the shift lever, rotates the <b>cam</b> <b>plate.</b> This causes the 5th synchro set to stop the rotating mainshaft.

50|$|In late 1915, Naval Lieutenant Victor Dybovsky of the 20th KAO {{invented a}} system of <b>cam</b> <b>plates</b> mounted on an engine's {{crankshaft}} that would prevent a machine gun from holing an aeroplane's propeller. Static tests at the Lux Aircraft Works proved its feasibility by November 1915; {{towards the end of}} the month, Morane-Saulnier G serial no. MS567 was forwarded to the 30th KAO for field testing. Poruchik Mikhail Shadsky flew test flights on both 9 and 29 December; cold thickened the machine gun's lubricant both times, preventing it from firing.|$|R

The experimental program was developed to study {{the use of interactive}} graphics systems for solving mechanical design problems. The program can handle almost all types of <b>plate</b> <b>cam</b> and follower mechanisms. A wide selection of motion curves permits the designer to specify any desired motion of a point of interest by synthesizing several curves into a displacement diagram...|$|R
50|$|The hammer {{action is}} {{provided}} by two <b>cam</b> <b>plates</b> that make the chuck rapidly pulse forward and backward as the drill spins on its axis. This pulsing (hammering) action is measured in Blows Per Minute (BPM) with 10,000 or more BPMs being common. Because the combined mass of the chuck and bit is {{comparable to that of}} the body of the drill, the energy transfer is inefficient and can sometimes make it difficult for larger bits to penetrate harder materials such as poured concrete. The operator experiences considerable vibration, and the cams are generally made from hardened steel to avoid them wearing out quickly. In practice, drills are restricted to standard masonry bits up to 13 mm (1/2 inch) in diameter. A typical application for a hammer drill is installing electrical boxes, conduit straps or shelves in concrete.|$|R
5000|$|The VTM-4 system's {{electronic}} control unit (ECU) determines torque {{which is to be}} distributed to the rear wheels, then electric current is sent to the two electromagnetic coils. The resulting magnetic field moves a rotating steel plate toward each fixed coil. Friction between that steel plate and an adjoining <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> causes the <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> to begin turning. As it does, three balls per clutch roll up curved ramps, creating an axial thrust against a clutch-engagement plate. This thrust force compresses the wet clutch plates, thereby engaging drive to the corresponding rear wheel. [...] Unlike mechanically actuated four-wheel drive systems, the VTM-4 system is infinitely variable. The amount of torque provided to the rear wheels is directly proportional to the electric current sent from the ECU and can be adjusted from zero to a preset maximum. This current constantly changes to deliver the optimum rear torque calculated by the ECU. An internal gear pump circulates VTM-4 fluid to cool and lubricate the clutches, bearings, and gears within the rear drive unit. Use of high-strength, low-weight materials such as diecast aluminum for the housing minimizes the bulk and weight of this hardware, helping to keep the weight of the entire all-wheel-drive system to about 212-pounds.|$|E
5000|$|In 1953, he {{followed}} {{this with the}} [...] "Simplex" [...] system, which used a single metal piece that could be rotated to either side on a <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> that allowed the boot to travel directly to the side. This was paired with a new design for the heel cable, which formerly looped around the entire boot to a lever at the front that provided tension. Marker's [...] "LD" [...] replaced this with just {{the portion of the}} binding {{at the rear of the}} boot, moving the lever to the cable itself.|$|E
50|$|For use on {{cars and}} light trucks, the rotary pump or {{distributor}} pump was developed. It uses a single injection cylinder driven from an axial <b>cam</b> <b>plate,</b> which injects into the individual fuel lines via a rotary distribution valve. Later incarnations {{such as the}} Bosch VE pump vary the injection timing with crankshaft speed to allow greater power at high crank speeds, and smoother, more economical running at slower revolution of crankshaft. Some VE variants have a pressure-based system that allows the injection volume to increase over normal to allow a turbocharger or supercharger equipped engine to develop more power under boost conditions.|$|E
40|$|Cam {{mechanisms}} {{are widely used}} in industry, in applications requiring quick-return and indexing motions. A current research effort at the Robotic Mechanical Systems Laboratory of McGill University's Centre for Intelligent Machines aims at the application of cam mechanisms as speed reducers. The accuracy required in these mechanisms is of the utmost importance, especially when cams are rotating at a high speed. In this thesis, the design for manufacturability of planar speed-reduction cam mechanisms is studied. In particular, the thesis focuses on a speed reducer with a rotating follower to couple shafts of parallel axes, termed planar Speed-o-Cam. Principles of the design for manufacturability are applied to Speed-o-Cam and a unified method for obtaining the optimum parameters satisfying the curvature constraints and pressure-angle bounds is developed. These two factors are relatively important because Numerically Controlled and Computer Numerically Controlled machine tools could be very sensitive to changes of curvature of the workpiece, especially when milling complex shapes {{such as those of}} <b>cam</b> <b>plates.</b> Cam-mechanism balancing is also studied because unbalance in a high-speed rotating element can cause severe vibrations and greatly affect the bearings and hence, the performance of the machine. This is done by not only adding counterweights, which unavoidably increase the weight and volume of the mechanism, but also by removing material...|$|R

In a {{variable}} displacement pump, if the vector normal to the <b>cam</b> plane (swash <b>plate)</b> is set {{parallel to the}} axis of rotation, there is no movement of the pistons in their cylinders.

50|$|The {{parking pawl}} locks the {{transmission}}'s output shaft to the transmission casing by engaging a pawl (a pin) that engages in a notched wheel on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main {{components of a}} parking pawl mechanism are the parking gear, parking pawl, actuator rod, cam collar, <b>cam</b> <b>plate,</b> pivot pin and parking pawl return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the parking pawl tooth collides and overrides the parking gear teeth (ratchets) until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached. Software controls are {{put in place to}} avoid this condition and engage the pawl only when the vehicle has come to a stand still.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used cam is the <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> (also known as disc cam or radial cam)which is cut out {{of a piece of}} flat metal or plate. Here, the follower moves in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the camshaft. Several key terms are relevant in such a construction of plate cams: base circle, prime circle (with radius equal to the sum of the follower radius and the base circle radius), pitch curve which is the radial curve traced out by applying the radial displacements away from the prime circle across all angles, and the lobe separation angle (LSA - the angle between two adjacent intake and exhaust cam lobes).|$|E
5000|$|The Madsen has {{a rather}} {{sophisticated}} and unique operating cycle. The machine gun uses a mixed recoil-operated locking {{system with a}} hinged bolt that is patterned after the lever-action Peabody Martini breechblock. The recoil operation is part short and part long recoil. After firing a round to start the open bolt firing cycle, the initial recoil impulse drives the barrel, barrel extension, and bolt to the rear. A pin {{on the right side}} of the bolt moves backward in grooves in an operating <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> mounted to the right side of the receiver. After 12.7 mm of travel, the bolt is cammed upward, away from the breech (the [...] "short" [...] portion of the recoil system). The barrel and barrel extension continue to move rearward to a point slightly exceeding the combined overall length of the cartridge case and projectile (the long portion of the recoil system, responsible for the weapon's low rate of fire).|$|E

40|$|A cassava stem {{cutting unit}} was {{developed}} to generate the design data for its use on a prototype of a cassava planter. It consisted of a 25. 5 cm circular saw blade, <b>cam</b> mechanism, bottom <b>plate,</b> electric motor (0. 75 kW) to operate saw blade and a motor (0. 37 kW). The cassava stems were fed manually into a feeding chute for free fall on to the bottom plate, and then these were cut by the circular saw operated by an electric motor. The cam mechanism operated by the cam motor, controlled the number of cuts by the circular saw. The cutting length could be adjusted between 15 and 30 cm by altering {{the position of the}} bottom plate. Test results indicated that the highest cutting quality of this unit at more than 60 number of circular saw teeth when operated at faster than 1, 200 rpm cutting shaft speed and slower than 50 rpm cam shaft speed. Cutting capacity depended on cam shaft speed. At 50 rpm cam shaft speed, minimum cutting capacity was found to be 5, 034 stakes per hour (40, 272 stakes per day of 8 h) with 83. 91 % cutting efficiency. The stems were undamaged when operated at these conditions and showed satisfactory germination performance...|$|R

In this work, wear of {{reinforced}} poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) polymer bushes in friction against 7075 {{aluminium alloy}} cam plates or titanium crankshafts is investigated {{in order to}} establish the application possibilities in transmission parts in humanoid robot joints under high load torque. The PEEK bush wear requires close examination as well as the input axis-output axis transmission error (backlash). Sliding wear tests were performed on bushes under 4000 kgfcm (392 Nm) load torque, while the <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> oscillated in the humanoid robot leg joint evaluation system.

40|$|A novel {{free piston}} expander-linear {{generator}} (FPE-LG) integrated unit was proposed to recover waste heat efficiently from vehicle engine. This integrated unit {{can be used}} in a small-scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system and can directly convert the thermodynamic energy of working fluid into electric energy. The conceptual design of the free piston expander (FPE) was introduced and discussed. A <b>cam</b> <b>plate</b> and the corresponding valve train were used to control the inlet and outlet valve timing of the FPE. The working principle of the FPE-LG was proven to be feasible using an air test rig. The indicated efficiency of the FPE was obtained from the p–V indicator diagram. The dynamic characteristics of the in-cylinder flow field during the intake and exhaust processes of the FPE were analyzed based on Fluent software and 3 D numerical simulation models using a computation fluid dynamics method. Results show that the indicated efficiency of the FPE can reach 66. 2 % and the maximal electric power output of the FPE-LG can reach 22. 7 W when the working frequency is 3 Hz and intake pressure is 0. 2 MPa. Two large-scale vortices are formed during the intake process because of the non-uniform distribution of velocity and pressure. The vortex flow will convert pressure energy and kinetic energy into thermodynamic energy for the working fluid, which weakens the power capacity of the working fluid...|$|E
40|$|Influenza Al/CAM virus {{undergoes}} abortive {{growth in}} FL cells, whereas X- 3311, a recombinant virus clone from the cross between CAM and NWS, {{is capable of}} complete replication in FL cells and plaque formation on FL monolayers (FL-marker). Clone 1 - 5 C- 4 cells are permissive for both viruses. When either clone 1 - 5 C- 4 or FL cells, which were mixedly infected with both ultraviolet-irradiated X- 3311 and active <b>CAM</b> viruses, were <b>plated</b> on FL monolayers, infective centers far exceeding in number those expected from the surviving X- 3311 virus were observed, i. e., the FL-marker of the irradiated parent was rescued. The significantly lower radiation sensitivity of FL-marker than that of infectivity indicates that {{only part of the}} genome is responsible for the FL-marker. The capability of X- 3311 virus to produce NP antigen and its infectivity were lost at the same time when the former was assayed under the condition of low multiplicity of infection. This suggests that only infectious virus is capable of producing NP antigen and that no stepwise inactivation of the viral genome occurs. It is also suggested that any lethal ultraviolet damage inflicted upon the viral genome prevents the expression of the portion of the genome coding for NP antigen...|$|R

The progeny were assayed both on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in tissue culture for resistance to representative viruses of the A, B, and tentatively defined C subgroups. Segregation ratios of resistance to A and B subgroup viruses agreed with the previously suggested hypothesis of single-autosomal-recessive genes controlling resistance to each subgroup. Mixed infection on the <b>CAM</b> and replicate <b>plate</b> infection in tissue culture with subgroup A and B viruses showed that resistance to the A and B subgroups was inherited independently. Assays with viruses tentatively classified as subgroup C {{indicated that they were}} largely composed of a mixture of subgroup A and B viruses or of particles possessing the host range specificity of both. However, virus stocks of the subgroup C category, as well as some stocks classified as subgroup B, produced small numbers of pocks or foci on individuals known to be resistant to subgroup A and B viruses.
