Production of coronatine and copper resistance were also found to be correlated for pv. glycinea in 19 field-isolates from leaf spots of plants in a soybean field and in 28 strains of a bacterial <b>culture</b> <b>collection.</b> Genomic diversity within pv. glycinea was investigated by plasmid profiling, DNA hybridization studies and PCR analysis.

In addition, cor- strains could be distinguished from coronatine-producing strains by a single unique band when amplified by random primer PCR.

Clinical isolates previously characterized by CAAT as serovar Copenhageni, serovar Castellonis, and as serovar Canicola were in agreement with PCR results. The clinical isolate previously characterized as serovar Pomona was not differentiated by PCR.

Thus, it is timely to remind photosynthesis researchers of the history and identity of this extraordinary photosynthetic bacterium, especially because a misguided attempt to rename it has introduced some confusion in the literature. R. centenum was first isolated in our laboratory from an enrichment culture inoculated with a sample collected at Thermopolis Hot Springs, Wyoming. In 1987, the type strain (designated Favinger/Gest), was deposited in the American Type <b>Culture</b> <b>Collection</b> (ATCC <b>no.</b> 43720) and two years later, we published a description of its general and unique properties (Favinger et al. 1989). Morphology, spectrum of photopigments, general physiology, and nutritional requirements placed the bacterium in the genus Rhodospirillum.

40|$|Acclimation of the {{photosynthetic}} apparatus {{to changes}} in the light environment was studied in the unicellular red alga Porphyridium cruentum (American Type <b>Culture</b> <b>Collection</b> <b>No.</b> 50161). Absolute or relative amounts of four photosynthetic enzymes and electron carriers were measured, and the data were compared with earlier observations on light-harvesting components (F. X. Cunningham, Jr., R. J. Dennenberg, L. Mustárdy, P. A. Jursinic, E. Gantt [1989] Plant Physiol 91 : 1179 - 1187; F. X. Cunningham, Jr., R. J. Dennenberg, P. A. Jursinic, E. Gantt [1990] Plant Physiol 93 : 888 - 895) and with measurements of photosynthetic capacity. Pmax, the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis on a chlorophyll (Chl) basis, increased more than 4 -fold with increase in growth irradiance from 6 to 280 μeinsteins·m− 2 ·s− 1. Amounts of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase, and cytochrome f increased in parallel with Pmax, whereas numbers of the light-harvesting complexes (photosystem [PS] I, PSII, and phycobilisomes) changed little, and ATP synthase increased 7 -fold relative to Chl. The calculated minimal turnover time for PSII under the highest irradiance, 5 ms, was thus about 4 -fold faster than that calculated for cultures grown under the lowest irradiance (19 ms). A change in the spectral composition of the growth light (irradiance kept constant at 15 μeinsteins·m− 2 ·s− 1) from green (absorbed predominantly by the phycobilisome antenna of PSII) to red (absorbed primarily by the Chl antenna of PSI) had little effect on the amounts of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase, ATP synthase, and phycobilisomes on a Chl, protein, or thylakoid area basis. However, the number of PSI centers declined by 40 %, cytochrome f increased by 40 %, and both PSII and ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase increased approximately 3 -fold on a thylakoid area basis. The substantial increase in ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase under PSI light is inconsistent with a PSI-mediated reduction of NADP as the sole function of this enzyme. Our results demonstrate a high degree of plasticity in content and composition of thylakoid membranes of P. cruentum...|$|R

Enrichment and isolation were carried out at 95 °C under a hydrostatic pressure of 42 MPa. CH 1 T cells are highly motile irregular cocci with a diameter of about 1 - 1. 5 µm. Growth was recorded within a temperature range of 80 to 108 °C and a pressure range of 20 to 120 MPa. Temperature and pressure optima for growth were 98 °C and 52 MPa respectively. No growth was observed under atmospheric pressures for temperatures ranging from 60 to 110 °C. Growth was observed from pH 6 to 9. 5 (optimum 7. 5 - 8) and salt concentrations from 2. 5 to 5. 5 % NaCl (optimum 3. 5 %). Strain CH 1 T is strictly anaerobic, growing on complex proteinaceous substrates (yeast extract, peptone, casein) or sucrose, starch, chitin, pyruvate, acetate and glycerol, without any additional electron acceptors. The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 49. 0 +/- 0. 5 mol%. Analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene revealed that strain CH 1 T belonged to the genus Pyrococcus.

40|$|Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium is an {{important}} enteropathogen that causes human morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is essential to study the interaction between Salmonella and the gut bacteria to elucidate the elements that influence {{the ability of the}} pathogen to overcome the colonisation barrier mediated by the gut microbiota and why Salmonella can persist in ‘healthy’ individuals in a carrier state after infection. In this study the effect of faecal bacteria on the growth and survival of S. Typhimurium was investigated. Initially, experiments involved co-cultures of the pathogen and single strains of intestinal bacteria obtained from culture collections; results showed that when E. coli reached its maximum concentration density, the growth of S. Typhimurium was halted. S. Typhimurium was then inoculated with multi-strain gut bacteria from <b>culture</b> <b>collections</b> and also with faecal samples in batch cultures mimicking the conditions of the human colon. A significant reduction of S. Typhimurium concentration was observed in mixed cultures with faecal samples from different human donors; however, bacteria obtained from <b>culture</b> <b>collection</b> had <b>no</b> effect on S. Typhimurium. Close proximity with faecal bacteria was required as the pathogen was not affected when it was separated from the faecal bacteria by a 0. 45 µm pore size membrane. S. Typhimurium was also affected in a continuous culture system. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that some of the functions associated with the genes expressed by S. Typhimurium during Salmonella inactivation were related to stress responses. Molecular profiling of faecal bacteria measured by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis did not show any change specifically associated to S. Typhimurium inactivation. It was not possible to identify the bacterial strains responsible for the inactivation of S.

Strain D 464, isolated from Brandon Acid Stream, Co, Durham, was selected for detailed study; the pH of the stream was 2. 6. The optimum yield of E. mutabilis D 464 in the basal medium at pH 2. 6, occurred at a photon flux density of 100 µmol m(^- 1) s(^- 1). All four strains (D 464, D 640, D 641, D 642) had optimum yields between pH 3. 4 and 4. 0. Adaptation to low and high pH was checked with strain D 464 and it was found that this strain could be adapted to grow at pH 1. 5. and at pH 8. 5. The nutritional requirements and tolerance to heavy metals of strains D 464, D 640 and D 641 was investigated under standard growth conditions and was found that Na (10 mg 1 (^- 1) to 25 mg l(^- 1)) improved yield. Strains D 464, D 640 and D 641 grew in the vitamin-free basal medium, however in the strain chosen for detailed study (D 464) adding vitamin B(_ 1) and B(_ 12) improved yield. Heterotrophic and photoheterotrophic growth was investigated using strains D 464, D 640 and D 641 and was found that they utilize the following organic carbon substrates, glucose, fructose, sucrose, glycerol, lactic acid and acetate. Yield was least in acetate. These strains also utilized β-alanine, Dl-asporagine, glycyl-glycine, urea, uric acid and ethanol-amine as sole nitrogen source in the presence of light but not in the dark. Using strain D 464 phosphatase activity was checked and was found that this strain had both acid and alkaline cell surface phosphatase activity.
