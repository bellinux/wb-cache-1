Different strains grown and tested under standard conditions showed great variations in enzyme activity although the amount of diaminopimelic acid in the cell hydrolysates was similar.

The enzyme was also found in a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa but not in Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis or Bacillus subtilis.

30|$|The {{occurrence}} of Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, Klebsiella sp. and Pseudomonas sp. during this study {{in drinking water}} is of primary importance because these constitute {{a major part of}} <b>coliform</b> <b>organism.</b> This result implies that the water samples were potentially contaminated from fecal sources and as such were not safe for consumption. Coliform is used as water quality indicator. According to WHO (2011), the number of faecal coliforms should not be observed in 100  ml of drinking water. In this study, 18.42 % drinking water samples for different areas showed that the presence of fecal coliforms (FCC), i.e., E. coli (Table  3), indicates the contamination of drinking water. Enteropathogenic E. coli causes diarrhea, food-borne disease and vomiting (Suthar et al. 2009). Moreover, E. coli is also responsible for urinary tract infection. Other coliforms such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are detected during this study where Enterobacter aerogenes creates food spoilage and Klebsiella pneumonia causes urinary tract infection and pneumonia. P. aeruginosa has been previously reported in the bottled water (Ahmed Ahmed et al. 2013; Svagzdiene et al. 2010). The organism may be harmful to newborns and elderly patients because it can multiply and reach to harmful number very quickly. Moreover, being a primary cause of disease Pseudomonas aeruginosa is often identified as an indicator of other bacterial contaminations of fecal origin (Warburton et al. 1994). Occurrence of coliforms shows the danger of fecal contamination and the consequent hazard of contracting disease through pathogenic organisms.|$|R

We reviewed our experience with this condition in 52 patients, who represented 0, 74 % of urology admissions between 1986 and 1991. There was a 3 : 2 male/female ratio, the age range was 7 - 76 years (mean 43 years), and the disease was more common among blacks and coloureds than among whites. Multiple sites of involvement were fairly common. Seventy-five per cent of patients had renal involvement and 17 % epididymal involvement. The commonest presenting complaints were urinary frequency and haematuria, although flank and scrotal pain were also reported by a number of patients. Physical examination seldom helped to suggest the diagnosis. On microscopic examination and culture of the urine, sterile pyuria was present in only 50 % of our patients and 29 % had positive cultures for a 'normal' <b>coliform</b> <b>organism.</b> Fifty patients underwent excretory urography and the findings were very varied. Patients were treated primarily with antituberculosis drugs, but 58 % also required some form of surgery; nephrectomy was the commonest operation.

40|$|The name B. coli mutabile was {{employed}} by Neisser (1906) to designate a non-lactose-fermenting <b>coliform</b> <b>organism</b> which suddenly acquired {{the capacity to}} ferment lactose. The muta-tion-like variation became manifest through the formation of secondary colonies on lactose agar. Subcultures from a secon-dary colony proved to be active fermenters while similar cultures from {{the remainder of the}} colony had no such capacity. Other workers have since shown that this mode of variation occurs {{in a wide variety of}} bacterial species and that various carbon com-pounds may be involved. Since the term "mutabile " denotes variation by mutation, Burri (1910) objected to it and proposed the name, "imperfec-tum, " for a form which varied to sucrose in a similar manner. While Burri's contention that the term is a misnomer may be well founded, it has been so widely used that it will doubtless survive. Our knowledge of bacterial variation has been extended through the study of various mutabile strains but there are still differences of opinion which are difficult, if not impossible, to harmonize. Previous workers have based their conclusions on experiments conducted with complex media containing peptone as well as the carbon compound to which variation occurs. Hence, it seems that little or nothing is known concerning the ability of such organisms to attack specific compounds when supplied as the sole source of carbon.
