25|$|Studies of {{military}} and civilian use of nuclear energy started in Sweden even {{before the end of}} 1945. In November 1945, the Atomic Committee (Atomkommittén, AC) was founded.

In 1947, the government established the atomic energy company AB Atomenergi, 57 percent owned by the Government and the remaining 43 percent owned by a number of private companies active in the mining, steel and manufacturing industries.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the working of the 'Lamfalussy committees' {{in the banking}} and the securities sectors, asking whether these are 'technical' committees or 'parapolitical' ones. These <b>committees</b> are composed <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> (national civil servants) discussing regulatory and supervisory issues in a technical policy area-financial services. However, the issues discussed have political salience. It is argued that these <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> tend to be argument-based (level 2) and evidence-based (level 3), even though politics, as opposed to expertise, enter the policy process under specific circumstances. This combination of politics and expertise originates a distinctive type of informal governance...|$|R

25|$|In 1664, {{during the}} study of the project, the Estates of Languedoc asked Riquet to put into {{practice}} his idea experimentally. He then built a test channel diverting water from the Sor to the Seuil de Naurouze. It was the Rigole de la plaine which he completed in 1665 and used to prove {{that it is possible to}} bring water to the highest points of the course of the canal. This was the event that reassured the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> that the king had set up on site to inspect the choices and plans prepared by Riquet. From that moment Louis XIV knew that the canal was technically feasible.|$|E
25|$|Brussels {{missed out}} in its {{bid for a}} single seat due to a weak {{campaign}} from the government in negotiations, despite widespread support from the people. The Belgian government eventually pushed its campaign and started large-scale construction, renting office space in {{the east of the}} city for use by the institutions. On 11 February 1958, the six governments concluded an unofficial agreement on the setting-up of community offices. On the principle that it would take two years after a final agreement to prepare the appropriate office space, full services were set up in Brussels in expectation of a report from the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> looking into the matter of a final seat.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> deemed Brussels {{to be the}} {{one option}} to have all the {{necessary}} features for a European capital: a large, active metropolis, without a congested centre or poor quality of housing; good communications with other member states' capitals, including to major commercial and maritime markets; vast internal transport links; an important international business centre; plentiful housing for European civil servants; and an open economy. Furthermore, it was located on the border between the two major European civilisations, Latin and Germanic, and was at the centre of the first post-war integration experiment: the Benelux. As a capital of a small country, it also could not claim to use the presence of institutions to exert pressure on other member states, it being more of a neutral territory between the major European powers. The Committee's report was approved of by the Council, Parliament and Commissions, however the Council was still unable to achieve a final vote on the issue and hence put off the issue for a further three years despite all the institutions now leading in moving to Brussels.|$|E

The consumer's {{right of withdrawal}} in case of hire purchase was strengthened in March 1974, and fixed prices for branded products were abolished by law in January that same year, which meant that manufacturers' recommended prices were not binding for retailers. In addition, a progressive anticartel law was passed. A 1969 law on explosive materials was supplemented by two orders; the first (made in November 1969) establishing a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> for explosive materials, while the second order (made the following month) included details {{for the implementation of}} the law on explosive materials. An Act of December 1959 on the peaceful use of nuclear energy and protection against its dangers was amended by an Act of June 1970 that established a tax levied for the costs for permissions and surveillance measures. The Law on Compensation for Measures of Criminal Prosecution and Penalties, passed in March 1971, provided for standardized compensation in certain situations. In addition, the budget for communications was increased.|$|E

Between 1957 and 1959, {{at the request of}} David Ben-Gurion, he chaired the Pedagogic Secretariat of the Education Ministry which was responsible for setting up new norms for Israeli secondary education. He fought against graded fees and for wider free compulsory education, and gave high priority to social integration and the rights of Sephardi students. During that time and as advisor to education minister Zalman Aranne afterwards, he helped draft the principles for teaching [...] "Jewish awareness" [...] that were incorporated into the primary and secondary school curricula. [...] In 1963-65, he chaired a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> bearing his name that recommended a radical reform of the entire Israeli education system. Its suggestions included making preschool enrollment universal for disadvantaged children, shortening elementary school to grades 1-6; admitting all pupils without tests into integrated junior high schools (grades 7-9), raising the age of free compulsory education to fifteen (later raised to eighteen), establishing two-year and three-year comprehensive schools that provided a choice of tracks towards either a vocational diploma or a matriculation certificate, further integrating students of different skills and social classes, and establishing a new curriculum division in the Ministry of Education and Culture. The plan was approved by the Knesset and government, which allocated substantial resources to it, and the program began to be implemented in the summer of 1968.|$|E
