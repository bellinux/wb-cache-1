50|$|The {{design is}} based on two {{separate}} roadways which are connected by crossbeams. A symphony bridge would have two pylons, which would be circular in hollow cross-section. The center of the bridge would be supported by a central cable (unlike the conventional two side cables of a suspension bridge) connected to the deck via hangers connected to the crossbeams. The cross-beams and hangers are triangular in form. On {{both sides of the}} suspension section, the bridge would be built as a cable-stayed bridge with cables from the pylon. The areas closest to the pylons would be constructed with <b>cantilever</b> <b>support.</b> The designers have stated that the bridge would allow for greater wind stability, more drag, faster construction time, lower cost, and increased access for inspections and maintenance.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} non-ideal clamping shapes on the dynamic behavior of silicon nanocantilevers. We fabricated silicon nanocantilevers using silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers by employing stepper ultraviolet (UV) lithography, which permits a resolution of under 100 nm. The nanocantilevers were driven by electrostatic force inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Both lateral and out-of-plane resonance frequencies were visually detected with the SEM. Next, we discuss overhanging of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>support</b> and curvature at the clamping point in the silicon nanocantilevers, which generally arises in the fabrication process. We found that the fundamental out-of-plane frequency of a realistically clamped cantilever is always lower than that for a perfectly clamped cantilever, and depends on the cantilever width and the geometry of the clamping point structure. Using simulation with the finite-elements method, we demonstrate that this discrepancy is attributed to the particular geometry of the clamping point (non-zero joining curvatures and a flexible overhanging) that is obtained in the fabrication process. The influence of the material orthotropy is also investigated and is shown to be negligible...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} develop a real-time automatic health monitoring technique for the identification and prediction of the location and the force magnitude of foreign object impact on composite structures with distributed sensor network. In the smart ensemble impact identification (EII) technique proposed, it consists of four sequential procedures, which are the sensor signal preprocessing (SSP), the forward system modeling (FSM), the inverse model operator (IMO) and the impact positioning. Subsequently, in our experimental cases, we considered the disturbed factor ― random interfering noises, and added the <b>cantilever</b> <b>support</b> condition into our experimental tests of a CFRP plate structure, meanwhile, we also used the small balls with the different materials and masses as the impactors. However under the various impact situations and external noise environment, the predictions for the accuracy of impact forces and locations using the EII technique were validated, and the evaluated errors all fell well within the satisfactory limited range, and also interpreted the EII technique that is competent to reconstruct precisely the input-force signal due to stochastic impact event and estimate the impact location effectively in complex practical environment...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: p. 82 - 83. The {{design of}} lateral support systems, {{in the context}} of surface excavations, are usually done using {{conventional}} (classical) methods of analysis. For these design procedures limit state assumptions are made concerning the lateral earth pressures acting on the structure to determine the support system characteristics. No information with regard to the deformation of the soil adjacent to the structure can be provided. The objective of this thesis is to examine the finite element method of analysis as an alternative design tool which is adaptable {{to a wide range of}} situations. Finite element models are developed to investigate the influence of the plastic flow rule, wall friction and the soil type on the behaviour of a <b>cantilever</b> <b>support</b> system. Subsequently, the effect of wall stiffness, prop stiffness and the application of prop loads on the performance of a multiple level support system is examined. The results from these studies focus on wall displacements, lateral earth pressures, bending moments, plastic strain patterns and surface settlements behind the wall. The investigation provides extensive information about the entire soil-structure interaction of the system. This potential of the finite element method can be used in the optimization of support system design...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports an all-silicon fully {{symmetrical}} z-axis micro-g accelerometer that is fabricated on a single-silicon wafer using {{a combined}} surface and bulk fabrication process. The microaccelerometer has high device sensitivity, low noise, and low/controllable damping {{that are the}} key factors for attaining micro g and sub-micro g resolution in capacitive accelerometers. The microfabrication process produces a large proof mass by using the whole wafer thickness and a large sense capacitance by utilizing a thin sacrificial layer. The sense/feedback electrodes are formed by a deposited 2 - 3 microns polysilicon film with embedded 25 - 35 microns-thick vertical stiffeners. These electrodes, while thin, are made very stiff by the thick embedded stiffeners so that force rebalancing of the proof mass becomes possible. The polysilicon electrodes are patterned to create damping holes. The microaccelerometers are batch-fabricated, packaged, and tested successfully. A device with a 2 -mm x 1 -mm proof mass and a full bridge support has a measured sensitivity of 2 pF/g. The measured sensitivity of a 4 -mm x 1 -mm accelerometer with a <b>cantilever</b> <b>support</b> is 19. 4 pF/g.

25|$|A common way to {{construct}} steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called anchor arms. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, {{there are four}} cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because {{of the need for}} more strength at the balanced <b>cantilever's</b> <b>supports,</b> the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.|$|R

40|$|Wafer bonding {{has been}} {{identified}} as a promising technique to enable fabrication of many advanced semiconductor devices such as three dimensional integrated circuits (3 D IC) and micro/nano systems. However, with the device dimensions already in the nanometer range, the lack of approaches to achieve high precision bonding alignment has restricted many applications. With this increasing demand for wafer bonding applications, a novel mechanical passive alignment technique is described in this work aiming at nanoprecision alignment based on kinematic and elastic averaging effects. A number of <b>cantilever</b> <b>supported</b> pyramid and V-pit microstructures have been incorporated into the outer circumference area of the to-be-bonded Si chips, respectively. The engagement between the convex pyramids and concave V-pits and the compliance of the <b>support</b> <b>cantilever</b> flexures result in micromechanical passive alignment which is followed by direct bonding between the Si chips.
