40|$|Abstract Background Most human cancers show {{inactivation}} of both pRB- and p 53 -pathways. While retinoblastomas are {{initiated by}} {{loss of the}} RB 1 tumor suppressor gene, TP 53 mutations have not been found. High expression of the p 53 -antagonist MDM 2 in human retinoblastomas may compromise p 53 tumor surveillance so that TP 53 mutations are not selected for in retinoblastoma tumorigenesis. We previously showed that <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF protein, which activates p 53 by inhibiting MDM 2, is low in retinoblastomas despite high mRNA expression. Methods In human fetal retinas, adult retinas, and retinoblastoma cells, we determined endogenous <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF mRNA, ARF protein, and miR- 24 expression, while integrity of p 53 signalling in WERI-Rb 1 cells was tested using an adenovirus vector expressing <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF. To study <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF biogenesis, retinoblastoma cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG 132, and siRNA against miR- 24. Results In human retinoblastoma cell lines, <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF mRNA was disproportionally high relative {{to the level of}} <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF protein expression, suggesting a perturbation of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF regulation. When <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF was over-expressed by an adenovirus vector, expression of p 53 and downstream targets increased and cell growth was inhibited indicating an intact <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF -p 53 axis. To investigate the discrepancy between <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF mRNA and protein in retinoblastoma, we examined <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF biogenesis. The proteasome inhibitor, MG 132, did not cause <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF accumulation, although <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF normally is degraded by proteasomes. miR- 24, a microRNA that represses <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF expression, is expressed in retinoblastoma cell lines and correlates with lower protein expression when compared to other cell lines with high <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF mRNA. Transient over-expression of siRNA against miR- 24 led to elevated <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF protein in retinoblastoma cells. Conclusions In retinoblastoma cells where high levels of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF mRNA are not accompanied by high <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF protein, we found a correlation between miR- 24 expression and low <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF protein. <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF protein levels were restored without change in mRNA abundance upon miR- 24 inhibition suggesting that miR- 24 could functionally repress expression, effectively blocking p 53 tumor surveillance. During retinal tumorigenesis, miR- 24 may intrinsically compromise the p 53 response to RB 1 loss. </p...|$|R

We previously showed that <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF can induce a p 53 -independent G 2 cell cycle arrest. In this study, we demonstrate that the activation of ATM/ATR/CHK signaling pathways contributes to this G 2 checkpoint and highlight the interrelated roles of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF and the Tip 60 protein in the initiation of this DNA damage-signaling cascade. We show that Tip 60 is a new direct <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF binding partner and that its expression is upregulated and required for ATM/CHK 2 activation in response to <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF.

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF and <b>p</b> 16 INK 4 a gene inactivation and its association with some clinocopathological parameters in colon cancer. The mutational and methylation status of the <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF and <b>p</b> 16 INK 4 a genes was analyzed in 60 primary colon carcinomas and 8 colon cancer cell lines. We have identified the first two reported mutations affecting exon 1 beta of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF in the HCT 116 cell line and in one of the primary colon carcinomas. Both mutations occur within the N-terminal region of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF, documented as important for nucleolar localization and interaction with Mdm 2. Tumor-specific methylation of the <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF and <b>p</b> 16 INK 4 a genes was found in 33 % and 32 % of primary colon carcinomas, respectively. Methylation of the <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF was inversely correlated with p 53 overexpression (p = 0. 02). <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF and <b>p</b> 16 INK 4 a gene methylation was significantly more frequent in right-sided than in left-sided tumors (p = 0. 02).

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{incidence}} of melanoma has risen dramatically {{during the past}} three decades, yet there has been little improvement in effective treatments for this intractable and aggressive disease. Melanoma tumours are notoriously resistant to apoptosis, a cell suicide program that is activated by most cancer therapies. This thesis explores the role of the melanoma susceptibility gene product <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF in promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, in order to resolve the impact of this tumour suppressor in melanomagenesis and melanoma susceptibility. The <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF tumour suppressor gene is mutated in almost half of all cancers, and germline mutations in <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF confer a greatly increased risk of developing melanoma. The primary function of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF is to relay oncogenic signals to p 53, a central regulator of cellular response to stress. There is conflicting evidence regarding the role of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF in promoting apoptosis. Much of the current evidence is based on murine studies, which may not translate accurately to humans due to important differences in animal physiology and the primary sequence and functions of the mouse and human ARF proteins. Furthermore, results from previous studies are often compounded by supra-physiological expression of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF, and are {{complicated by the fact that}} <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF shares its genomic sequence with the p 16 INK 4 a tumour suppressor gene. This study demonstrates that <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF expression in human cancer and primary cell lines promotes rapid p 53 -dependent cell cycle arrest, rather than apoptosis. As <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF expression did not induce apoptosis, we investigated if <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF could modulate the sensitivity of a cell to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents. Using a <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF-inducible U 2 OS osteosarcoma cell line model, we examined the impact of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF expression on the apoptotic response of the cell to a panel of thirteen cytotoxic agents. <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF expression increased apoptosis caused by a sub-set of agents, including trichostatin A, sodium butyrate, DRB, Adriamycin and UVB radiation. <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF-mediated chemosensitivity was p 53 - and caspase-dependent, and involved the loss of mitochondrial potential. While loss of mitochondrial potential was dependent on p 53, it was not blocked by caspase inhibition, demonstrating that caspases play a role downstream of mitochondrial depolarisation. Inhibition of individual components of the apoptotic program showed that <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF-mediated chemosensitivity was not strictly dependent on the pro-apoptotic Bax or Fas proteins. We also investigated whether <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF could sensitise melanoma to chemotherapeutics in vivo. We investigated the expression level of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF, <b>p</b> 16 INK 4 a and MITFm and mutation status of B-RAF, N-RAS and PTEN in melanomas from 30 patients that had undergone isolated limb infusion - a palliative therapeutic strategy that results in much higher response rates than systemic treatment. Expression of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF did not predict response to the drugs actinomycin D and melphalan. Instead, high expression of p 16 INK 4 a and presence of activating N-RAS mutation were independent predictors of response to high doses of these chemotherapeutic drugs. This work suggests that <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF analogues may be beneficial adjuncts in cancer therapy, but are unlikely to be effective as single agents. Additionally, <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF mimetics will only be effective in tumours with intact p 53 signalling. Melanomas frequently carry functional p 53, and may be susceptible to this mode of treatment providing the apoptotic pathway downstream of p 53 is intact or can be restored...|$|R

40|$|High-risk human {{papillomavirus}} oncoproteins E 6 and E 7 {{play a major}} role in HPV-related cancers. One of the main functions of E 7 is the degradation of pRb, while E 6 promotes the degradation of p 53, inactivating the <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF-p 53 pathway. pRb and <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF can repress ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription in part by targeting the Upstream Binding Factor 1 (UBF 1), a key factor in the activation of RNA polymerase I machinery. We showed, through ectopic expression and siRNA silencing of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF and/or E 7, that E 7 stimulates UBF 1 -mediated rDNA gene transcription, partly because of increased levels of phosphorylated UBF 1, preventing the inhibitory function of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF. Unexpectedly, activation of rDNA gene transcription was higher in cells co-expressing <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF and E 7, compared to cells expressing E 7 alone. We did not find a difference in P-UBF 1 levels that could explain this data. However, <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF expression induced E 7 to accumulate into the nucleolus, where rDNA transcription takes place, providing an opportunity for E 7 to interact with nucleolar proteins involved in this process. GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed interactions between <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF, UBF 1 and E 7, although <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF and E 7 are not able to directly interact. Co-expression of a pRb-binding-deficient mutant (E 7 C 24 G) and <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF resulted in EC 24 G nucleolar accumulation, but not in a significant higher activation of rDNA transcription, suggesting that the inactivation of pRb is involved in this phenomenon. Thus, <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF fails to prevent E 7 -mediated UBF 1 phosphorylation, but could facilitate nucleolar pRb inactivation by targeting E 7 to the nucleolus.

Among {{malignant}} gliomas, 60 %– 80 % show loss of <b>P</b> <b>14</b> ARF tumor suppressor activity due to somatic alterations of the INK 4 A/ARF genetic locus. The tumor suppressor activity of <b>P</b> <b>14</b> ARF is in part a result of its ability to prevent the degradation of P 53 by binding to and sequestering HDM 2. However, the subsequent finding of <b>P</b> <b>14</b> ARF loss in conjunction with TP 53 gene loss in some tumors suggests the protein may have other P 53 -independent tumor suppressor functions. Here, we report what we believe to be a novel tumor suppressor function for <b>P</b> <b>14</b> ARF as an inhibitor of tumor-induced angiogenesis. We found that <b>P</b> <b>14</b> ARF mediates antiangiogenic effects by upregulating expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase– 3 (TIMP 3) in a P 53 -independent fashion.

Aim of this work was, to explore both mechanisms of <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF-mediated apoptosis in human cancer cells. Therefore, the pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl- 2 protein family members were analyzed towards expression levels and function after <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF-expression in <b>p</b> 53 -deficient and p 53 -proficient tumor cells. Upon <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF-expression in <b>p</b> 53 -proficient tumor cells the proapoptotic BH 3 -only protein Puma is rapidly induced at both the mRNA and the protein level. Furthermore, <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF triggers the N-terminal conformational change of Bax protein which translocates from the cytosol to the cytoplasm of mitochondria. This is followed by activation of mitochondria, by the breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of proapoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c, activation of caspase cascade and execution of apoptosis. Apoptosis induction by <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF critically depends {{on the presence of}} Puma. Moreover, Puma-deficient tumor cells are almost completely resistant towards <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF-induced apoptosis. However, the sensitivity of Puma-deficient cells to <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF-induced apoptosis is fully restored by functional reconstitution of Puma. Interestingly on the other hand, the p 53 -independent induction of mitochondrial apoptosis by <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF is fully independent from the BH 3 -only proteins like Puma and other proapoptotic proteins like Bax. Thus, <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF is triggering the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling by activating the Bax-homolog Bak, which is facilitated by the down-regulation of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl- 1 and Bcl-xL. The inhibition of two endogenous Bak inhibitors leads to activation of Bak and therefore leads to induction of mitochondrial apoptosis in the absence of BH 3 -only protein regulation. Furthermore, we were also able to show the sensitivity towards Bak-mediated induction of apoptosis after inhibition of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl- 1 in death ligand TRAIL-(tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand) triggered apoptosis. Taken together, these data indicate that, dependent on protein status of p 53, and the expression of proapoptotic Bax and Bak, <b>p</b> <b>14</b> ARF is capable to trigger distinct signaling pathways in tumor cells.
