The <b>cabbage</b> <b>aphid</b> can be distinguished by its waxy coating and its dense colonies on young growth, while the green peach aphid is dispersed around the brassica plant, occurring mainly on the older leaves of its host.|$|E
50|$|Diaeretiella rapae is a {{cosmopolitan}} parasitoid of {{many species of}} aphids, but especially the <b>cabbage</b> <b>aphid,</b> Brevicoryne brassicae. It is the only species in the genus Diaeretiella.

50|$|Brevicoryne brassicae, {{commonly}} known as the <b>cabbage</b> <b>aphid</b> or cabbage aphis, is a destructive aphid (plant louse) native to Europe that is now found in many other areas of the world. The aphids feed on many varieties of produce, including cabbage, broccoli (especially), Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and many other members of the genus Brassica, but do not feed on plants outside of the Brassicaceae family. The insects entirely avoid plants other than those of the Brassicaceae family, even though thousands may be eating broccoli near strawberries, the strawberries will be left untouched.|$|E
25|$|This process iterates {{throughout}} the summer, producing multiple generations that typically live 20 to 40days. Thus, one female hatched in spring may produce thousands of descendants.

In one experiment, 100% of melon aphids were killed after exposure to an aqueous solution containing 0.025% hexaethyl tetraphosphate and 0.025% sodium lauryl sulfate. 99% of aphids can be killed by 0.3 grams of a 10% solution of the chemical in methyl chloride in 1000 cubic feet, and 100% of aphids can be killed by twice the amount of solution. 96% of apple aphids can be killed be exposure to an aqueous solution of 0.1% hexaethyl tetraphosphate and 0.05% sodium lauryl sulfate. Dust containing 3% hexaethyl tetraphosphate at a concentration of 40 pounds per acre can kill some bean <b>aphids.</b> 100% of <b>cabbage</b> <b>aphids</b> can be killed by an aqueous solution of 0.1% of the chemical and 0.05% sodium lauryl sulfate. <b>Cabbage</b> <b>aphids</b> can be quickly killed by a spray containing one pint of the chemical per 100 gallons of water.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cabbage</b> <b>aphids</b> {{produce a}} {{myrosinase}} (beta-thioglucoside glucohydrolase) enzyme in head and thoracic muscles; the aphids also uptake glucosinolates, particularly sinigrin, from the plants {{on which they}} feed, storing the glucosinolates in their haemolymph. (Glucosinolates are natural defenses for plants in the order Brassicales against pests and herbivores.) The combination of the glucosinolates and the myrosinase enzyme produces a violent chemical reaction that releases the mustard oil chemical allyl isothiocyanate. The defense mechanism has a dramatic {{negative effect on the}} survival of the larval ladybird predator Adalia bipunctata. The chemical defence of the aphids has been likened to a [...] "walking mustard oil bomb".|$|R
50|$|Like {{many species}} of ladybirds, the {{transverse}} ladybird {{plays an important role}} in agriculture as it preys on a wide array of plant-eating insects which damage crops, particularly early in the growing season. Among those insects hunted include {{many species of}} aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), Aphis affinis, cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora), cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), milkweed aphid (Aphis nerii), spirea aphid (Aphis spiraecola), leafcurling plum aphid (Brachycaudus helichrysi), <b>cabbage</b> <b>aphid</b> (Brevicoryne brassicae), Cervaphis quercus, Cervaphis rappardi indica, turnip aphid (Lipaphis pseudobrassicae), Macrosiphoniella yomogifoliae, potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae), rose aphid (Macrosiphum rosae), Melanaphis donacis, Melanaphis sacchari, Myzus nicotianae, green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), Pentalonia nigronervosa, corn aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis), Sitobion rosaeiformis, Taoia indica, Toxoptera aurantii, Therioaphis ononidis, Therioaphis trifolii, Uroleucon compositae and Uroleucon sonchi, species of leafhopper including Empoascanara indica and Idioscopus clypealis, the scale insect species Orthezia insignis, the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), and oriental leafworm moth (Spodoptera litura).|$|E
50|$|Brassicaceae contain glucosinolates {{as well as}} myrosinases {{inside their}} cells. When the cell is damaged, the myrosinases hydrolises the glucosinolates, leading to the {{synthesis}} of isothiocyanates, which are compounds toxic to most animals, fungi and bacteria. Some insect herbivores have developed counter adaptations such as rapid absorbtion of the glucosinates, quick alternative breakdown into non-toxic compounds and avoiding cell damage. In the whites family (Pieridae), one counter mechanisme involves glucosinolate sulphatase, which changes the glucosinolate, so that it cannot be converted to isothiocyanate. A second is that the glucosinates are quickly broken down, forming nitriles. Differences between the mixtures of glucosinolates between species and even within species is large, and individual plants may produce in excess of fifty individual substances. The energy penalty for synthesising all these glucosinolates may {{be as high as}} 15% of the total needed to produce a leaf. Bittercress (Barbarea vulgaris) also produces triterpenoid saponins. These adaptations and counter adaptations probably have led to extensive diversification in both the Brassicaceae and one of its major pests, the butterfly family Pieridae. A particular cocktail of volatile glucosinates triggers egg-laying in many species. Thus a particular crop can sometimes be protected by planting bittercress as a deadly bait, for the saponins kill the caterpillars, but the butterfly is still lured by the bittercress to lay its egg on the leaves.A moth that feeds on a range of Brassicaceae is the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella). Like the Pieridae, it is capable of converting isothiocyanates into less problematic nitriles. Managing this pest in crops became more complicated after resistance developed against a toxin produced by Bacillus thuringiensis, which is used as a wide spectrum biological plant protection against caterpillars. Parasitoid wasps that feed on such insect herbivores are attracted to the chemical compounds released by the plants, and thus are able to locate their prey. The <b>cabbage</b> <b>aphid</b> (Brevicoryne brassicae) stores glucosinolates and synthesises its own myrosinases, which may deter its potential predators.|$|E

Characterization of spatial {{distribution}} patterns of pests in large-scale agricultural fields is important because these patterns affect the sampling effort needed to accurately detect and estimate their population density. In this study, we conducted experimental releases of alate cabbage aphids (Brevicoryne brassicae L.) into centers of small plots of canola (Brassica napus L.), and their gradual spread over a 7 -wk period was characterized. The small-plot experiment demonstrated gradient effects from plot centers and a nonrandom vertical distribution, with initial colonization occurring on the abaxial side of lower canopy leaves and, later, highest numbers of cabbage aphids occurring on racemes. We also conducted large-scale distribution analyses of <b>cabbage</b> <b>aphid</b> infestations in two commercial canola fields, using visual inspection and sweep net sampling.

Another method to prevent pests from entering the crop may be the growing trap plants in the field margins.

The cabbage looper, a lepidopteran migrant from the south, arrives late in the season and usually becomes an additional threat. Cabbage maggot, flea beetle, <b>cabbage</b> <b>aphids,</b> and onion thrips are other insect pests that warrant control measures. Cabbage is also sporadically infected by diseases such as black rot, black leg, downy mildew, club root, and sugar beet cyst nematode, any of which can result in substantial crop loss. Growers must protect their crop from these pests by any means available. Presently, pesticides are the most widely used and effective means of crop protection. However, total reliance upon pesticides, to the exclusion of other control tactics, can be inefficient. Strict adherence to pesticides and regular repetitive spraying may result in: increased pest resistance to pesticides; detrimental effects on non-target organisms; environmental pollution; potential hazard to the pesticide applicator, farm worker, and consumer; spiraling treatment costs; and uneconomical use of energy. Since processing cabbage (for sauerkraut) need not be cosmetically perfect, a certain amount of leaf damage by Lepidoptera or diseases is acceptable. This allows growers to treat sauerkraut cabbage less often than fresh market cabbage (approximately 4 vs 8 sprays/field/season, respectively). Since the return per acre of processed cabbage is considerably less than that of fresh market cabbage ($ 736 and $ 3, 500, respectively), sauerkraut growers must be more economical in their crop protection practices...|$|R

The treatments comprised of 0. 4 mm and 0. 9 mm pore diameter agronet covers maintained either by (i) opening thrice a week between 9. 00 am and 5. 00 pm or (ii) permanently covered except during routine crop maintenance, unprotected cabbage sprayed with insecticide and unprotected cabbage without any insecticide application (control). Agronet maintained permanently covered [u 1] significantly reduced populations of <b>cabbage</b> <b>aphids,</b> diamondback moth, <b>cabbage</b> looper, mites, and leaf miners at P= 0. 05. Agronet covers reduced insecticide sprays per crop cycle from 11 to 1 and improved marketable cabbage head numbers by between 15. 0 - 43. 5 % compared to the control and 2. 1 - 27. 3 % compared to spraying with insecticides. Marketable head weight was higher by between 28. 7 - 130. 1 % under agronets compared to the control and by 9. 3 - 95. 4 % compared to spraying with insecticides. The highest cabbage marketable yields and net income on sales were obtained under the 0. 9 mm pore diameter agronet maintained permanently covered which gave the highest cost benefit ratio of 1 : 17. 1 in season one and 1 : 26. 2 in season two. These results present permanent use of 0. 9 mm pore diameter agronets as a viable technology in reducing insect pest infestation and cost of cabbage production.

40|$|Experimental {{data on the}} {{relationship}} between plant patch size and population density of herbivores within fields often deviates from predictions of the theory of island biogeography and the resource concentration hypothesis. Here we argue that basic features of foraging behaviour can explain different responses of specialist herbivores to habitat heterogeneity. In a combination of field and simulation studies, we applied basic knowledge on the foraging strategies of three specialist herbivores: the <b>cabbage</b> <b>aphid</b> (Brevicoryne brassicae), the cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae L.) and the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L.), to explain differences in their responses to small scale fragmentation of their habitat. In our field study, populations of the three species responded to different sizes of host plant patches (9 plants and 100 plants) in different ways. Densities of winged cabbage aphids were independent of patch size. Egg-densities of the cabbage butterfly were higher in small than in large patches. Densities of diamondback moth adults were higher in large patches than in small patches. When patches in a background of barley were compared with those in grass, densities of the <b>cabbage</b> <b>aphid</b> and the diamondback moth were reduced, but not cabbage butterfly densities. To explore the role of foraging behaviour of herbivores on their response to patch size, a spatially explicit individual-based simulation framework was used. The sensory abilities of the insects to detect and respond to contact, olfactory or visual cues were varied. Species with a post-alighting host recognition behaviour (<b>cabbage</b> <b>aphid)</b> could only use contact cues from host plants encountered after landing. In contrast, species capable with a pre-alighting recognition behaviour, based on visual (cabbage butterfly) or olfactory (diamondback moth) cues, were able to recognise a preferred host plant whilst in flight. These three searching modalities were studied by varying the in flight detection abilities, the displacement speed and the arrestment response to host plants by individuals.

Results showed both irritant and repellent effects of the alphacypermethrin-treated net on Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and its parasitoid Aphidius colemani (Haliday) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Under Þeld conditions, there were no pests on cabbage protected with the repellent net. The repellent net allowed combining a visual and repellent barrier against aphids. Because of this additive effect, repellent nets allowed covering cabbage permanently with adequate protection against all pests. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
