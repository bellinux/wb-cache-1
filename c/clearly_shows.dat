5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> Favaloro overwhelmed by {{the corruption of the}} health system and feeling that he could not fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} this information, it is {{unlikely}} that Cairano, at his death, was able to pass on an artistic legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola, whose Madonna and Child, signed and dated 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before. This appears to be a nostalgic and naive tribute to a master, who apparently had bequeathed an artistic footprint that his collaborators not only replicated tirelessly but also felt unable to evolve further.|$|E
5|$|Up to the pontificate of Pope Alexander III (1159–1181), all the {{cardinals}} who were {{appointed to the}} external episcopal sees, resigned their membership in the College of Cardinals after receiving episcopal consecration, which <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> that the episcopate was considered a higher dignity than that of cardinal-priest or deacon. On the other hand, the bishops were never appointed cardinals. Certainly, the episcopate and cardinalate were considered incompatible dignities. However, during Alexander’s pontificate a change is apparent; although there were still the cases of {{the cardinals}} leaving the College of Cardinals after assuming episcopal office (Lombardo of Benevento, Rainaldo of Gaeta), there also appeared members of the College who were simultaneously cardinals and bishops. Perhaps Alexander III followed here an example of his rival, Antipope Victor IV, who in 1162 appointed Aicardo Cornazzano bishop of Parma and cardinal-priest. The first such instance in the legitimate obedience was Conrad of Wittelsbach, who was appointed cardinal-priest of S. Marcello in December 1165 and subsequently promoted to the suburbicarian see of Sabina, but continued to act also as archbishop of Mainz. Archbishop of Reims Guillaume aux Blanches Mains was named cardinal priest of S. Sabina in 1179, but retained archdiocese of Reims; similarly bishops Giovanni of Toscanella, Ruffino of Rimini and Gerardo of Novara, elevated to the cardinalate in 1189, 1190 and 1211 respectively. On the other hand, when cardinal-priest Uberto Crivelli was elected and consecrated archbishop of Milan in 1185, he retained his cardinalate and his Roman titulus (S. Lorenzo in Damaso). The posts of cardinal and bishop were no longer considered incompatible with each other. Moreover, the rank of cardinal-priest or cardinal-deacon became {{equal to that of}} bishop. However, it seems that the elected, but not yet consecrated, bishops who were appointed cardinals were generally obliged to resign their sees.|$|E

25|$|Few {{images of}} medieval {{football}} survive. One engraving {{from the early}} fourteenth century at Gloucester Cathedral, England, <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> two young men running vigorously towards {{each other with a}} ball in mid-air between them. There is a hint that the players may be using their hands to strike the ball. A second medieval image in the British Museum, London <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> a group of men with a large ball on the ground. The ball clearly has a seam where leather has been sewn together. It is unclear exactly what is happening in this set of three images, although the last image appears to show a man with a broken arm. It is likely that this image highlights the dangers of some medieval football games.|$|E

25|$|The Church of Scientology {{claims that}} their belief system is {{different}} from Christianity because it is based “solely on reason” and that its members “possess a practical system of ethics and justice.” The church likewise claims that “anything religious teachers said or Buddha promised, even the visions of Christianity, are attained in Scientology as a result.” Muck, Netland and McDermott emphasize that this <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> that Scientology is incompatible with Christianity.|$|E
25|$|The {{paintings}} in the Upper Church of the Basilica of St. Francis, Assisi, are examples of naturalistic painting of the period, often ascribed to Giotto himself, but more probably the work of artists surrounding Pietro Cavallini.
