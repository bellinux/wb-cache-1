2500|$|The {{seat of a}} Windsor {{chair is}} an {{essential}} part since it provides the stability to both the upper and lower portions. The thickness of the seat allows the legs to be anchored securely into their respective tapered sockets, providing the undercarriage with strength and stability. A timber that will provide the strength and stability whilst also allowing it to be shaped, in order to achieve the desired look and feel, requires a strong durable timber, with interlocking grain, to provide the right characteristics. [...] English Windsors typically have elm seats because its interlocking grain gives good <b>cross-grain</b> strength that resists splitting where holes are placed close {{to the edge of a}} seat. There are no real satisfactory alternatives to elm although other woods have been tried, for example, oak and ash in Britain and various types of pine in the USA. [...] Because of elm's strength compared to pine, tulip poplar or bass, English Windsor chair seats are usually not as thick as American Windsors. [...] The English Windsor chair seats are not saddled (or dished) as deeply as their American counterparts- partly because of elm's relative strength, and partly because elm is comparatively more difficult to sculpt than the softer woods chosen by American chair makers. Woodwrights use tools such as the adze, scorp or inshave to form the hollowed out, form fitting, ergonomic top of the seat.|$|E

5000|$|Crystal {{inclusions}} in diamonds {{occurs in}} the form of lines known as graining. Graining {{should not be confused with}} a rough diamonds natural grain lines [...] Graining forms due to the improper crystallization of the diamond or when a diamond is twinned. Twinned diamonds are two diamonds that have grown together and causes <b>cross-grains</b> within the diamond during its growth / crystallization process. Twinning causes natural lines, planes or <b>cross-grains</b> in a diamond. Graining can't be removed during the polishing process of a diamond as it is a natural plane within the diamond. <b>Cross-graining</b> also makes the polishing process extremely difficult for diamond cutters as a diamond only cuts against its natural grain lines and never with the grain. One will always find graining in rough diamonds known as [...] "Macle's". Macles are easily identified by its triangular shape. The graining line on the Macle is a natural cleaving plane where the diamond can easily be split in half. Diamonds with graining will never be graded as Flawless as its maximum grade would only fetch Internally Flawless (IF). Although graining seems like a severe flaw it is not visible with the naked eye and does not impact the overall brilliance or quality of a diamond.|$|R

Smaller thinner plywoods and lower quality plywoods (see Average-quality plywood photo below and right) may only have their plies (layers) arranged at right angles to each other, though some better quality plywood products will by design have five plies in steps of 45 degrees (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees), giving strength in multiple axes.|$|R

Progressive collapse is avoided by providing sufficient redundancy so that any single elements can be removed. Designing a building constructed from load bearing panels creates a number of opportunities. Any internal wall can become a party wall and have a significant portion removed from the surface area as openings. This simple flexibility allowed for different plan types up and down the building and an animated façade where windows were placed according to the best advantage.|$|E

5000|$|The maul is most {{commonly}} struck onto a flush-cut section of log, usually standing on end atop a splitting stump or other suitable base. Most cut sections can be split {{in a single}} downward chop of the maul, splitting the wood apart along its grain. Mauls regularly become stuck in the log for several reasons, such as the wood not being struck with adequate force, the wood containing hidden knots, or the length of wood being too long. Unlike an axe, mauls are effective longer after the edge dulls, as the primary mechanism {{is that of a}} wedge pushed through along the wood grain, and not a <b>cross-grain</b> chop of an axe. In some cases, longer logs may be split while they rest length-wise on the base or ground. Mauls often become stuck in logs mid-split requiring a [...] "full-lift" [...] chop to be used. This involves the chopper reswinging the maul, but this time lifting the half-split log while still attached to the embedded maul, often requiring one or two additional full-lift chops. Another technique for splitting upright logs of thicker diameter is to land the maul's full force off-center of the log, usually removing 1/4 of the mass of the log. When repeated, large logs that would ordinarily cause the maul to be embedded on a center-strike can be handled easily. Additionally, as the temperature gets colder, the fibers in the log become more brittle making the logs easier to split.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this review, we briefly {{introduce}} our in situ atomic-scale mechanical experimental technique (ASMET) for transmission {{electron microscopy}} (TEM), which can observe the atomic-scale deformation dynamics of materials. This in situ mechanical testing technique allows the deformation of TEM samples through a simultaneous double-tilt function, making atomic-scale mechanical microscopy feasible. This methodology is generally applicable to thin films, nanowires (NWs), tubes and regular TEM samples to allow investigation {{of the dynamics of}} mechanically stressed samples at the atomic scale. We show several examples of this technique applied to Pt and Cu single/polycrystalline specimens. The in situ atomic-scale observation revealed that when the feature size of these materials approaches the nano-scale, they often exhibit “unusual” deformation behaviours compared to their bulk counterparts. For example, in Cu single-crystalline NWs, the elastic–plastic transition is size-dependent. An ultra-large elastic strain of 7. 2 %, which approaches the theoretical elasticity limit, can be achieved as the diameter of the NWs decreases to ∼ 6 nm. The crossover plasticity transition from full dislocations to partial dislocations and twins was also discovered as the diameter of the single-crystalline Cu NWs decreased. For Pt nanocrystals (NC), the long-standing uncertainties of atomic-scale plastic deformation mechanisms in NC materials (grain size G less than 15 nm) were clarified. For larger grains with G<∼ 10 nm, we frequently observed movements and interactions of <b>cross-grain</b> full dislocations. For G between 6 and 10 nm, stacking faults resulting from partial dislocations become more frequent. For G<∼ 6 nm, the plasticity mechanism transforms from a mode of <b>cross-grain</b> dislocation to a collective grain rotation mechanism. This grain rotation process is mediated by grain boundary (GB) dislocations with the assistance of GB diffusion and shuffling. These in situ atomic-scale images provide a direct demonstration that grain rotation, through the evolution of the misorientation angle between neighbouring grains, can be quantitatively assessed by the dislocation content within the grain boundaries. In combination with the revolutionary Cs-corrected sub-angstrom imaging technologies developed by Urban et al., the opportunities for experimental mechanics at the atomic scale are emerging...|$|E
40|$|The Gravity Lineations Intraplate Melting Petrologic and Seismic Expedition (GLIMPSE) Experiment {{investigated}} {{the formation of}} a series of non–hot spot, intraplate volcanic ridges in the South Pacific and their relationship to <b>cross-grain</b> gravity lineaments detected by satellite altimetry. Using shipboard gravity measurements and a simple model of surface loading of a thin elastic plate, we estimate effective elastic thicknesses ranging from ? 2 km beneath the Sojourn Ridge to a maximum of 10 km beneath the Southern Cross Seamount. These elastic thicknesses are lower than predicted for the 3 – 9 Ma seafloor on which the volcanoes lie, perhaps due to reheating and thinning of the plate during emplacement. Anomalously low apparent densities estimated for the Matua and Southern Cross seamounts of 2050 and 2250 kg m? 3, respectively, probably are artifacts caused by the assumption of only surface loading, ignoring the presence of subsurface loading in the form of underplated crust and/or low-density mantle. Using satellite free-air gravity and shipboard bathymetry, we calculate the age-detrended, residual mantle Bouguer anomaly (rMBA). The rMBA corrects the free-air anomaly for the direct effects of topography, including the thickening of the crust beneath the seamounts and volcanic ridges due to surface loading of the volcanic edifices. There are broad, negative rMBA anomalies along the Sojourn and Brown ridges and the Hotu Matua seamount chain that extend nearly to the East Pacific Rise. These negative rMBA anomalies connect to negative free-air anomalies {{in the western part of}} the study area that have been recognized previously as the beginnings of the <b>cross-grain</b> gravity lineaments. Subtracting the topographic effects of surface loading by the ridges and seamounts from the observed topography reveals that the ridges are built on broad bands of anomalously elevated seafloor. This swell topography and the negative rMBA anomalies contradict the predictions of lithospheric cracking models for the origin of gravity lineaments and associated volcanic ridges, favoring models with a dynamic mantle component such as small-scale convection or channelized asthenospheric return flow. <br/...|$|E
