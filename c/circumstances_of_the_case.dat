She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E

Ankarette's grandson Roger Twynyho received from Edward IV a full retrospective pardon for Ankarette, and the petition he submitted to the king in 1478 describes fully the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> well illustrating the quasi-kingly high-handedness of Clarence which was ultimately not tolerated by the king.|$|E

Oliver Perry Temple, a fellow attorney and Whig, wrote of Arnold's courtroom tactics: [...] "By ridicule on the one hand, and impassioned appeals on the other, he constantly excited laughter or tears, while his power of invective was simply terrible." [...] Temple noted that Arnold occasionally won cases when facts and evidence were against him by stubbornly seizing on a trivial <b>circumstance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> and focusing <b>the</b> jury's attention on it.|$|R
25|$|In addition, a {{fair hearing}} may also include the rights to legal representation, to {{cross-examine}} witnesses, and to be given reasons for a decision; and a presumption in favour of an oral hearing. An applicant claiming a breach of the fair hearing requirement has {{to prove that he}} or she suffered substantial injustice since {{there is no such thing}} in law as a technical breach of natural justice. The requirements of fair hearing depend on the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> such as the nature of the inquiry, the rules governing the tribunal, and the subject matter being dealt with.|$|E
25|$|The {{applicant}} had patently {{been informed}} of the accusation against him and of {{the progress of the}} proceedings before the Italian courts, notwithstanding {{the fact that he had}} absconded. Furthermore, the applicant, who had deliberately chosen to remain on the run after escaping from prison, had received effective assistance during the proceedings from several lawyers specially appointed by him. Hence, the Italian and subsequently the French authorities had been entitled to conclude that the applicant had unequivocally waived his right to appear and be tried in person. The French authorities had therefore taken due account of all the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> and of the Court’s case-law in granting the extradition request made by the Italian authorities: manifestly ill-founded.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} was announced on March 18, 1963, and delivered by Justice Hugo Black. The {{decision was}} announced as unanimous {{in favor of}} Gideon. Three concurring opinions were written by Justices Clark, Douglas and Harlan. The Supreme Court decision specifically cited its previous ruling in Powell v. Alabama. Whether or not the decision in Powell v. Alabama applied to non-capital cases had sparked heated debate. Betts v. Brady had earlier held that, unless certain circumstances were present, such as illiteracy or stupidity of the defendant, or an especially complicated case, {{there was no need}} for a court-appointed attorney in state court criminal proceedings. Betts had thus provided selective application of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the states, depending on the circumstances, as the Sixth Amendment had only been held binding in federal cases. Gideon v. Wainwright overruled Betts v. Brady, instead holding that the assistance of counsel, if desired by a defendant who could not afford to hire counsel, was a fundamental right under the United States Constitution, binding on the states, and essential for a fair trial and due process of law regardless of the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

25|$|Following {{the hearing}} of an appeal, the Court may confirm, reverse or vary the trial court's decision. It may also order a retrial; inform the High Court of its opinion on a matter {{and send it}} back to that court for further {{proceedings}} to be taken; or make any other order as it thinks just, exercising any power that the trial court might have exercised. The Court also has power to quash the sentence passed by the trial court and substitute a more or less severe sentence in its place. A trial court's judgment, sentence or order may only be reversed or set aside if it was legally incorrect or against the weight of the evidence. A sentence may only be altered if it is manifestly excessive or inadequate in the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Even if the Court feels that a point raised in an appeal might be decided in the appellant's favour, it may dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice took place. The Court generally only issues a single judgment, though separate judgments may be given if the presiding Judge of Appeal so directs.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal only hears appeals from {{decisions}} of the High Court made when the latter is exercising original criminal jurisdiction. In other words, matters heard by the High Court on appeal from the State Courts cannot be further appealed to the Court of Appeal, though questions of law may be reserved for determination by the Court (see below). A person convicted in the High Court can appeal against the conviction, the sentence or both, unless he or she pleaded guilty in which case only an appeal against the extent or legality of the sentence is permitted. In the latter situation, the Court of Appeal may nonetheless permit the person who pleaded guilty to appeal against conviction if it believes that {{this is in the}} interests of justice. The Public Prosecutor may appeal against an acquittal or the sentence imposed on an accused person. The Court is entitled to summarily reject an appeal if the grounds of appeal do not involve any question of law, the conviction is supportable by the evidence, and {{there is nothing in the}} <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> which raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the conviction was right or leads the Court to think the sentence should be reduced. The summary rejection of an appeal may only be done upon the unanimous decision of the Judges of Appeal.|$|E

50|$|Where a {{contract}} {{does not contain}} an express right to terminate, courts may find that the contract includes an implied right for one or both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties to terminate the contract.

'Holy shit' is our evaluation of the situation in the country. This opinion is not blasphemy." [...] Their lawyers stated that the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> had revived the Soviet-era tradition of the show trial.

500|$|The Court voted 8-1 {{to reverse}} the Illinois Appellate Court to hold {{the actions of the}} police {{officers}} at question constitutional. Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion which upheld the search. Due to the specific <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the police needed to prevent the investigation scene from being contaminated. Breyer wrote that the Court found [...] "no case in which [...] held unlawful a temporary seizure that was supported by probable cause and was designed to prevent the loss of evidence while the police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonable period of time." [...] Moreover, McArthur's argument that his decision to remain on his porch and not allow the police entry did not amount to [...] "a constructive eviction". Instead, Breyer noted that the Court found in a prior case that the doorway of a house is in a 'public place' and thus not subject to warrant rules. He noted in conclusion that the hard-to-contest fact of probable cause made it difficult to accept McArthur's claims.|$|E

Methods:A cross-sectional observational study {{was performed in}} the Intoxication Control Center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> São Paulo City Hospital. We evaluated 6535 medical consults of intoxication cases involving prescription and over-the-counter drugs in 2001. We selected and analyzed <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> involving AEDs. Statistical analysis was performed in order to evaluate <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> different drug types and <b>the</b> <b>circumstance</b> <b>of</b> drug exposure. Results:The most frequently observed AEDs were phenobarbital, carbamazepine, diazepam, and clonazepam. <b>The</b> frequency <b>of</b> intoxication <b>cases</b> among different age groups did not significantly differ according to the drug type. The circumstances involving AEDs intoxication were analogous to <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> intoxication involving all other medications (p> 0. 05). Conclusions:There are {{a large number of}} intoxications involving AEDs.

[...] However, the court dismissed such claims for two reasons. Firstly, {{there was no evidence}} that Pearlberg's [...] "actual name was used on the job postings or in connection with the pornographic websites." [...] Secondly, the court found that Pearlberg's claim was out of [...] "the reach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statute". New York's Civil Rights Law § 51 was cited as holding that [...] "any person whose name...is used with this state for advertising purposes or for <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> trade without <b>the</b> written consent such person(emphasis added)" [...] could bring an action for damages. However, there was not any indication, whatsoever, that Kuperwicz had used Pearlberg's name for advertising purposes. To vividly illustrate what was meant by [...] "advertising purposes", the court quoted earlier precedents that held to qualify for advertising purposes a given person's name must appear [...] "in a publication which, taken in its entirety, was distributed for use in, or as part of, an advertisement or solicitation for patronage of a particular product or service".
