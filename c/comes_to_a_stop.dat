5|$|One further {{variation}} {{places a}} 6-sided die (although other sided die {{could also be}} used) {{on top of the}} bottle. If the bottle is knocked over and the die knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop.</b> This adds a random effect to hitting the bottle and in practice often results in players only striking the bottle in combination with other point-scoring shots.|$|E
5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are turned from the prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, into a tight turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> on the brake run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E

25|$|Stopping sight {{distance}} is the distance traveled during perception-reaction time (while the vehicle driver perceives a situation requiring a stop, realizes that stopping is necessary, and applies the brake), and maneuver time (while the driver decelerates and <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop).</b> Actual stopping distances are also affected by road conditions, {{the mass of}} the car, the incline of the road, and numerous other factors. For design, a conservative distance is needed to allow a vehicle traveling at design speed to stop before reaching a stationary object in its path. Typically the design {{sight distance}} allows a below-average driver to stop in time to avoid a collision.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Walden has noted, in its 2005 Comprehensive Plan, the {{difficulties}} {{created by the}} oblique intersection at {{the eastern end of}} the Route208 concurrency. Traffic on northbound 208 <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> sign at the intersection, where 52 comes in from the right at a slightly lower grade and a sharp angle, with the view mostly blocked by a building. It is also just opposite one of two curb cuts for a busy ]. At rush hour, the traffic light at the nearby northern end often backs cars up along 52 for some distance, making the turn into the gas station difficult, especially when vehicles on 52 make the left turn into the curb cut.|$|E
500|$|The {{objective}} of Asteroids is to destroy asteroids and saucers. The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. Once the ship begins {{moving in a}} direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. [...] The ship eventually <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, {{at the risk of}} self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.|$|E

The music video for [...] "Rumors" [...] premiered on October 14, 2004 and October 20, 2004 through Disney Channel and MTV. In the beginning of the video, Lohan is followed by paparazzi as she is entering her car. It is revealed that this is a Lindsay-look-alike, and that the real Lohan is entering another car to go to a club. The car <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop,</b> and she then steps into an elevator and sings the first verse of the song, while she is filmed by a CCTV camera in the elevator. The next sequence shows her running through a hallway, dressed up, before getting into the club. There, she dances in the crowd, where she takes a picture of one of the paparazzi herself to get back at him. In the next sequence, she is walking slowly through the club where she finds the man who seems to be her boyfriend. She takes a seat next to her lover and they begin kissing and touching each other, all the while being constantly filmed by cameras in the club. While Lohan sings the second chorus, she is trapped in a cage {{in the middle of the}} club and the whole crowd is watching her. After this Lohan is shown dancing in the club with her friends. At the end of the music video Lohan and her friends enter the top of a high-rise and perform a dance routine while helicopters are circling around them. Finally Lohan gets into a helicopter and escapes. In the end, she throws her camera away with all the pictures taken of her.|$|E

2500|$|The train dispatches {{from the}} station, during this audio {{of a man}} saying [...] "join us" [...] is played and the ride {{immediately}} enters into a sweeping drop 180-degrees to the left. Partway through this drop, riders encounter a heartline roll, the ride's first inversion. The train then <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> on block brakes, before ascending the first lift hill. Upon reaching the top, the train drops into another 180-degree right turn before banking into the second inversion, a downward corkscrew. The train drops straight down into the next two inversions – two consecutive dive loops – before travelling over an airtime hill into a third Dive loop. Upon exiting the dive loop, the train traverses a sidewinder before entering a reverse sidewinder, which has the same track configuration as a sidewinder, however the trains travel through it in the opposite direction. The ride then travels through another corkscrew before reaching {{the second set of}} block brakes.|$|E

2500|$|Route 75 was a {{proposed}} freeway in the U.S. State of New Jersey in the Newark area in 1960s and 1970s. [...] It {{was designed to}} connect the existing Route 21 freeway north of Newark with Interstate 78, U.S. Route 1-9, and Newark Airport. [...] The state of New Jersey applied for interstate status for the route in 1970, but construction of the road remained stalled in courts throughout the 1970s. [...] In 1973, the state of New Jersey and the Federal Highway Administration shelved plans for the route, and in 1997, the state of New Jersey officially removed the route from its route logs. [...] Despite its removal, vestiges of Route 75 still remain. [...] The first example is Exit 13 on Interstate 280 eastbound in Newark. [...] The exit is an enormous three lane ramp, while through traffic on I-280 has only two lanes. [...] The ramp <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> at a traffic light on First Street, just south of Orange Street. Also, at Exit 56 off Interstate 78, large flyover ramps meant for a freeway diverge from the roadway, but terminate at city streets.|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{thickness}} variation has many causes, {{but there are}} three primary mechanisms which contribute the most to the propagation of disc {{thickness variation}}s connected to uneven pad transfer. The first is improper selection of brake pads for a given application. Pads which are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking {{for the first time}} in cold weather, often are made of materials which decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in uneven deposition of material onto the brake disc. Another cause of uneven material transfer is improper break in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc as a whole) every time the pads are changed on a vehicle. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven pad material transfer is known as [...] "pad imprinting." [...] This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break-down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken in brake system (with properly selected pads), this transfer is natural and actually is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> and the driver continues to apply the brakes, the pads will deposit a layer of material in the shape of the brake pad. This small thickness variation can begin the cycle of uneven pad transfer.|$|E
