30|$|How {{firms can}} {{trade-off}} between {{internal and external}} sources for innovation is a standing impasse for managers. Hence, motives of these two groups differ significantly. Professionals work under firms’ management whereas <b>crowds</b> <b>work</b> staying {{outside the scope of}} firms’ control boundary. Thus, traditional human resources frameworks are not applicable for crowd management. It is also necessary to explore implicit benefits of crowdsourcing such as marketing, public relation, intelligence, building long-term relation with participants, and probably most importantly shifting locus of cost of ideation from firms to crowds. Monetary incentives might be more relevant to attract crowds from low income regions. Insight into the optimum structures and processes to identify single or several best ideas from a large number of ideas is necessary. The knowledge regarding the degree of benefits for contributors in different types of crowdsourcing platforms is not well-grounded in the literature. Crowdsourcing in B&M disciplines is still in a nascent stage. Scholars need to engage actively to enrich this field.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crowds</b> <b>works</b> {{by making}} each node seem equally {{likely to be}} the {{initiator}} of the message. As we said each node joins the network by starting a jondo (from [...] "John Doe"), which is a small process that will forward and receive requests from other users. When the jondo is started all nodes in the network are informed of the new node's entrance, and will begin to select him as a forwarder. To actually send a message a node chooses randomly (with uniform probability) from all nodes in the network and forwards the message to them. Upon receiving the message the node flips a biased coin (with probability [...] ) and if it lands heads forwards it to another random node, otherwise it forwards it to the final destination. Each node when forwarding to another node records the predecessor and in this way a tunnel is built, this is used for the communication between the sender and the receiver.|$|R

40|$|While Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) {{helped launch}} the paid <b>crowd</b> <b>work</b> {{industry}} eight years ago, many new vendors now offer {{a range of}} alternative models. Despite this, little <b>crowd</b> <b>work</b> research has explored other platforms. Such near-exclusive focus risks letting AMT's particular vagaries and limitations overly shape our understanding of <b>crowd</b> <b>work</b> and the research questions and directions being pursued. To address this, we present a cross-platform content analysis of seven <b>crowd</b> <b>work</b> platforms. We begin by reviewing how AMT assumptions and limitations have influenced prior research. Next, we formulate key criteria for characterizing and differentiating <b>crowd</b> <b>work</b> platforms. Our analysis of platforms contrasts them with AMT, informing both methodology of use and directions for future research.

On the other hand, in unpaid crowdsourcing, there is a very crucial additional step, which was the most challenging based on our experience: gather the crowd.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} that the current understanding of crowdsourcing may not be broad enough to capture the diversity of <b>crowd</b> <b>work</b> during disasters, or specific enough to highlight the unique dynamics of information organizing by the crowd in that context.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{analyzes}} five social curation tools, {{chosen for}} having a relevant number of users and for being subject of other academic studies.

Crowds prevents a web server from learning any potentially identifying information about the user, including even the user's IP address or domain name.

40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} the Internet and the {{widespread}} proliferation of electronic devices {{has resulted in}} flourishing microtask crowdsourcing marketplaces, such as Amazon MTurk. An aspect that has remained largely invisible in microtask crowdsourcing is that of work environments; defined as the hardware and software affordances {{at the disposal of}} crowd workers which are used to complete microtasks on crowdsourcing platforms. In this paper, we reveal the significant role of work environments in the shaping of <b>crowd</b> <b>work.</b> First, through a pilot study surveying the good and bad experiences workers had with UI elements in <b>crowd</b> <b>work,</b> we revealed the typical issues workers face. Based on these findings, we then deployed over 100 distinct microtasks on CrowdFlower, addressing workers in India and USA in two identical batches. These tasks emulate the good and bad UI element designs that characterize crowdsourcing microtasks. We recorded hardware specifics such as CPU speed and device type, apart from software specifics including the browsers used to complete tasks, operating systems on the device, and other properties that define the work environments of crowd workers. Our findings indicate that crowd workers are embedded in a variety of work environments which influence the quality of work produced. To confirm and validate our data-driven findings we then carried out semi-structured interviews with a sample of Indian and American crowd workers from this platform. Depending on the design of UI elements in microtasks, we found that some work environments are more suitable than others to support crowd workers. Based on our overall findings resulting from all the three studies, we introduce ModOp, a tool that helps to design crowdsourcing microtasks that are suitable for diverse <b>crowd</b> <b>work</b> environments. We empirically show that the use of ModOp results in reducing the cognitive load of workers, thereby improving their user experience without effecting the accuracy or task completion time...|$|E

40|$|Construction {{and mining}} worksites pose unique {{challenges}} to workers and equipment operators {{due to their}} dynamic and unstructured nature. Narrow haul roads, <b>crowded</b> <b>work</b> spaces and presence of workers and equipment in close proximity, combined with large blind spots and overall poor visibility afforded to operators lead to collisions and run-over-type accidents between equipment, workers, and other entities that may be present on the jobsite. Operations that involve machine-infrastructure interaction, {{particularly in the case}} of concealed infrastructure such as excavation and drilling lead to unintended strikes between the equipment’s end-effector and the infrastructure. Such accident-prone scenarios can be avoided by providing operators with real-time feedback and warnings using 3 D visualization and proximity monitoring of the entities present in the equipment’s vicinity. Thus the jobsite in the real world is abstracted and represented in a 3 D virtual world. However, this requires the ability to create a seamless link between real-world sensors present on the equipment and/or the jobsite and the virtual environment. This paper describes a non-restrictive acquisition allocation framework that allows position and orientation sensor streams from construction and mining job sites to be used for updating 3 D virtual scenes in real-time for providing vital collision avoidance warnings to equipment operators...|$|R
40|$|The Wisdom of the Crowd advocates that {{decisions}} collectively made by {{a diverse}} crowd could be better than those {{made by a}}n elite group of experts. The Wisdom of the Crowd puts preconditions on this to work correctly.
