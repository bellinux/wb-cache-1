This measure allows us to test hypotheses from the literature on interfirm knowledge transfer <b>in</b> <b>alliances,</b> with interesting results: we find support for some elements of this ‘received wisdom’—equity arrangements promote greater knowledge transfer, and ‘absorptive capacity’ helps explain the extent of technological capability transfer, at least <b>in</b> some <b>alliances.</b> But the results also suggest limits to the ‘capabilities acquisition’ view of strategic alliances. Consistent with the argument that alliance activity can promote increased specialization, we find that the capabilities of partner firms become more divergent in a substantial subset of alliances...|$|R

40|$|Objective—To {{examine the}} link between {{therapeutic}} alliance and youth outcomes. Method—The study was conducted at a group-home with 112 youth with a disruptive-behavior diagnosis. Therapeutic alliance was collected routinely via youth and staff report. Outcome data were collected using youth and staff reports of externalizing behavior as well as behavioral incidents occurring during care. Outcome data were collected following intake into services and at 6 and 12 months of care. Data were analyzed to examine (1) if youth behavior problems at intake were predictive of therapeutic alliance and (2) if <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>alliance</b> were predictive of subsequent youth outcomes. These were conducted with a 6 -month service-delivery model and replicated with a 12 -month model. Results—There was some support for the first hypothesis, that initial levels of youth externalizing behavior would be related to alliance ratings; however, most of the effects were marginally significant. The second hypothesis, that <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> therapeutic <b>alliance</b> would be related to subsequent youth outcomes, was supported for the 6 -month model, but not the 12 -month model. Conclusions—Changes <b>in</b> therapeutic <b>alliance</b> may be predictive of youth outcomes during care.

In fact, this welcome and stimulating study remains highly relevant {{to the analysis of}} third world foreign policies. David's central argument is that alliance decisions must be considered in relation, not merely to a classical 'balance of power' theory concerned only with national security, but rather to the overall balance of political forces with which the leader has to contend, including domestic threats which are often more important than external ones. Given this perspective, which he awkwardly entitles 'omnibalancing', David concludes that <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>alliance</b> can generally be explained as a rational response to the ruler's personal security needs. Though much of the argument is slanted to appeal to US policymakers operating in a bipolar framework, this theme remains as relevant as ever, and could equally be applied to third world states' reactions to IMF structural adjustment policies or demands for democratization.

This article reviews the different models for the analysis of foreign policy, using the conceptual framework of Hermann (1990) as its starting point. This framework suggests the existence of four graded levels of change which allow for studying forms of change which are subtle but important in foreign policy; it also offers a reasoned analysis for testing the relative importance of their sources. This conceptual framework can be situated in the traditional division of levels of analysis: the characteristics of the leader, bureaucratic proposer, internal adjustment, and external impact; and, while it does not provide a conclusive answer, it may be a useful tool in clarifying the ways of using empirical evidence and establishing the relative importance of the sources of <b>change</b> <b>in</b> foreign policy orientation...|$|R

I integrate an inductive study of a technology shock and concomitant collaboration activity with existing research on alliances and networks to build a set of arguments about how technology shocks will influence <b>alliance</b> behavior, how <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>alliance</b> behavior will influence the global technology collaboration network, and about how each of these changes is likely to influence the innovative outcomes of firms.

Findings suggest that when measured by observational coders, initial levels of alliance and client involvement remain relatively stable throughout different treatments for child anxiety in community settings.

This paper report and discuss the results of an explorative study of five innovation driven alliances concerning the role of alliance structures during the early phases in the innovation process when the tension is expected to be most intensive.

Using insights from new institutional economics, this chapter explores {{to what extent}} the alliance governance association with interfirm knowledge transfer is sensitive to an evolving industry norm of collaboration connected to the logic of open innovation. The chapter examines 1, 888 dyad-year observations on firms engaged <b>in</b> technology <b>alliances</b> <b>in</b> the U. S. information technology industry during 1980 – 1999. Using fixed effects linear models, it analyzes longitudinal <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>alliance</b> governance association with interfirm knowledge transfer, and how such <b>changes</b> vary <b>in</b> magnitude across bilateral versus multipartner alliances, and across computers, telecommunications equipment, software, and microelectronics subsectors. Increases <b>in</b> industry-level <b>alliance</b> activity during 1980 – 1999 improved the knowledge transfer performance of contractual technology agreements relative to more hierarchical equity joint ventures. This effect was concentrated in bilateral rather than multipartner <b>alliances,</b> and <b>in</b> the software and microelectronics rather than computers and telecommunications equipment subsectors. Therefore, an evolving industry norm of collaboration may sometimes make more arms-length governance of a technology alliance a credible substitute for equity ownership, which can reduce the costs of interfirm R&D. Overall, the chapter shows that the performance of material practices that constitute innovation ecosystems, such as interfirm technology alliances, may differ over time subject to prevailing institutional norms of open innovation. This finding generates novel implications for the literatures on alliances, open innovation, and innovation ecosystems...|$|R
