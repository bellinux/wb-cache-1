40|$|AbstractFour plant {{functional}} types (PFTs) {{were used}} to compare the vegetation structure of an alien-invaded Acacia nilotica savanna with one of negligible invasions. Heights, <b>canopy</b> <b>covers</b> and species richness of three native PFTs (woody plants, grasses and herbs) and one alien PFT (woody plants) were measured in 14, 1 -m 2 quadrats sampled in a stratified-random pattern in a 400 -m 2 plot demarcated in each savanna. In the uninvaded plot, mean heights of native PFTs were stratified. In the invaded plot, the mean height of aliens extended into the native woody stratum with the lower range of native woody PFT heights reduced to the grass stratum. Discriminant analysis of <b>canopy</b> <b>covers</b> and species richness of the four PFTs revealed significant differences in composition between plots with the alien PFT being the most important variable correlated with these differences. Univariate analysis confirmed the dominance of alien woody plants in the invaded plot but also showed significant reductions in the <b>canopy</b> <b>covers</b> and species richness of native herbs and grasses compared to those in the uninvaded plot. These results suggest that PFTs can rapidly measure small-scale, spatial differences in the physiognomy, composition and species richness of A. nilotica savannas when invaded by alien woody plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of aquaculture system should meet the community’s basic need economically by {{taking into account}} the carrying capacity and environmental sustainability. The {{development of}} the environmentally friendly system such as silvofishery is being promoted by government however its yield has not reached the target yet. Dissolved oxygen availability is an important indicator which determines the success of the aquaculture system. The objective of the research was to determine dissolved oxygen availability on traditional pond systems using silvofishery pattern. Time series data collection was conducted once in 14 days with 2 measuring times; in the morning (06. 00 am) and in the evening (06. 00 pm) for 112 days. The research was conducted at four different silvofishery pond patterns, Pond Pattern 1 (0 % mangrove <b>canopy</b> <b>covered),</b> Pond Pattern 2 (35 % mangrove <b>canopy</b> <b>covered),</b> Pond Pattern 3 (67 % mangrove <b>canopy</b> <b>covered),</b> and Pond Pattern 4 (75 % mangrove <b>canopy</b> <b>covered).</b> Measurement was observed openly in the pond (in situ) with parameters: dissolved oxygen, temperature, Water pH, Salinity, Transparency, Wind Speed, and Depth of Water Table, while chlorof i l-a was ex-situ measured. The result from each parameter was compared to optimum concentration rate for shrimp growth. From the experiment, Pond Pattern 1 showed the most satisfaction results. Its dissolved oxygen availability during the research was ≥ 4 mg/L which was 5. 88 mg/L ± 0. 48 mg/L in the evening (06. 00 pm) and 4. 33 mg/L ± 1. 24 mg/L in the morning (06. 00 am). It was also supported by optimum condition of other parameters such as temperature, Water pH, Salinity, Wind Speed, and Depth of Water Table. However, it was not supported by fertility and transparency of water. Thus, the traditional pattern of conservation still needs additional technology to maintain adequate dissolved oxygen availability for optimum shrimp growth. </div...|$|R

25|$|It can {{sometimes}} be found in dry and rocky watercourses, but is most often found in clusters on rocky jump-ups and colluvial slopes of rocky mesas with weathered silcrete rocks and loamy soils. The most dense populations of this species are found on the lower slopes that have high water retention because of deep colluviums. The altitude of the known locations of G. kennedyana is between 140 m and 200 m and is found on slopes that vary from 10˚, which is relatively flat to a steep slope of 75˚.

25|$|Trees {{should not}} be labeled as polluters because their total {{benefits}} on air quality and emissions reduction far outweigh the possible consequences of BVOC emissions on ozone concentrations. Emission of BVOCs increase exponentially with temperature. Therefore, higher emissions will occur at higher temperatures. In desert climates, locally native trees adapted to drought conditions emit significantly less BVOCs than plants native to wet regions. As discussed above, the formation of ozone is also temperature dependent. Thus, {{the best way to}} slow the production of ozone and emission of BVOCs is to reduce urban temperatures and the effect of the urban heat island. As suggested earlier, {{the most effective way to}} lower temperatures is with an increased <b>canopy</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E

25|$|Cocoa beans may be {{cultivated}} under shaded conditions, e.g. agroforestry. Agroforestry {{can reduce}} the pressure on existing protected forests for resources, such as firewood, and conserve biodiversity. Agroforests act as buffers to formally protected forests and biodiversity island refuges in an open, human-dominated landscape. Research of their shade-grown coffee counterparts has shown that greater <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> in plots is significantly associated to greater mammal species richness and abundance. The amount of diversity in tree species is fairly comparable between shade-grown cocoa plots and primary forests. Farmers can grow a variety of fruit-bearing shade trees to supplement their income to help cope with the volatile cocoa prices. Though cocoa has been adapted to grow under a dense rainforest canopy, agroforestry does not significantly further enhance cocoa productivity.|$|E
25|$|Igapó is {{primarily}} characterized by seasonal inundation caused by abundant rainfall; in some areas, trees can be submerged {{for up to}} 6 months of the year. These ecosystems are relatively open and feature over 30% <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> with an average canopy height ranging from 20–25 m; sparse measurements of trees can reach 33–36 m. Tree composition includes a varied mixture of leaf types and seasonality. Development of tree communities within the freshwater swamp forests rely heavily on microtopography and flooding intensity. Swamp forests can have harsh environments, in which only a few adapted species are able to sustain life or dominate over other tree species. One of the tree species mostly found in freshwater swamp forests are legume trees, in which most swamp forests have high single legume species populations. Legume trees in these forests {{are thought to be}} abundant in nitrogen fixation, which is most common in waterlogged locations and is thought to be a favorable trait when experiencing seasonal and/or constant waterlogging.|$|E
