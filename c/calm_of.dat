5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} to land, Greta initially maintained a well-defined structure. The hurricane continued generally west-northwestward {{due to the}} ridge to the north, and initially was expected to enter the Bay of Campeche. After passing through the Bay Islands off northern Honduras, Greta weakened slightly while approaching Belize, and made landfall near Dangriga at 0000UTC on September19, with winds of about 110mph (175km/h). The <b>calm</b> <b>of</b> the eye was reported for three to five minutes there. Rapidly weakening over land, the hurricane deteriorated to tropical depression status over Guatemala within 12hours of landfall. A large high pressure area from the Carolinas to the central Gulf of Mexico turned Greta southwestward toward the eastern Pacific Ocean. At 0000UTC on September20, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) took over responsibility for issuing advisories while Greta was 30mi (50km) from the coast. Soon after, the depression emerged over the warm waters of the eastern Pacific and re-intensified. At 0600UTC, the depression re-attained tropical storm status and named Olivia by the EPHC. After initially moving to the north, Olivia began executing a slow counterclockwise loop. Based on observations from nearby ships and radar, it is estimated Olivia attained hurricane status early on September22. While tracking towards the Mexican coastline, the system weakened below hurricane threshold; between 1900 and 2000UTC, Olivia made landfall about 60mi (95km) east of Salina Cruz. Early on September23, Olivia dissipated over the Mexican state of Chiapas.|$|E

Originally craving was considered to be the root cause of samsara, which could be stilled by the practice of dhyana, leading to a <b>calm</b> <b>of</b> mind which according to Vetter is the liberation which is being sought.|$|E

25|$|By {{early on}} September9, Hortense was {{upgraded}} to a hurricane, while curving northwestward. Around 0600UTC {{on the following}} day, the storm made landfall near Guánica, Puerto Rico with winds of 80mph (130km/h); this made it the first hurricane landfall on the island since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Initially, most tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated Hortense would pass south of the island and instead strike the Dominican Republic. After two hours, Hortense emerged into the Mona Passage and brushed the eastern tip of Dominican Republic; Punta Cana near the eastern tip of the country reported the <b>calm</b> <b>of</b> the eye on September10. Land interaction with Hispaniola weakened the storm slightly, though it would soon re-strengthen.|$|E

500|$|Depictions of the Nativity changed {{significantly}} in European art following St Bridget's {{visions of the}} event. According to Upton, the scene [...] "became a source of emotional reward for one's faith, a private vision in response to one's contemplation." [...] In Bridget's version of the event, Mary does not lie in a bed while giving birth. The event occurs in a cave, where, dressed in white, Mary kneels or stands in devotion before the infant lying on the ground. Joseph holds a candle to illuminate the birth. Robert Campin's c. 1420 Nativity is representative of Bridget's narrative; the cave has been substituted by a shed with animals, Mary's handmaidens are present, while angels and shepherds rejoice. Christus simplified the narrative: removing the handmaidens and relegating the animals to the background. Mary's white dress is replaced with a deep-blue robe. His Nativity is somber and subdued, an embodiment of the [...] "austere <b>calm</b> <b>of</b> timeless worship." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1969 Messagier {{elaborated}} a technique he called [...] "le Gel" [...] {{in an effort to}} perfect a certain number of compositions whereby nature itself (e.g., temperature, hydrometry, condensation, and decomposition) would intervene in the creative process. These paintings were realized outside of his studio at the Moulin de Lougres between two streams, where the <b>calm</b> <b>of</b> the land was superimposed with the turbulent current of the water and air. For Messagier the process was equivalent to sculpting air, and the works became replicas of air itself influenced by liquid. Both solid and liquid would intermingle, one born from the other. His goal had been the reconciliation between art and life, between man and nature. Both abstraction and figuration could play a role. This was not the pitting of human nature against nature itself, but the fusion of the two. From the early 1950s Messagier had put into question the utility of debating the concepts of abstraction and figuration. Now both had been surpassed.|$|E
2500|$|The Buddhist {{tradition}} has incorporated two traditions {{regarding the use}} of dhyāna (meditation, Pali jhāna). There is a tradition that stresses attaining prajñā (insight, bodhi, kenshō, vipassana) as the means to awakening and liberation. But it has also incorporated the yogic tradition, as reflected in the use of jhana, which is rejected in other sutras as not resulting in the final result of liberation. Schmithausen discerns three possible roads to liberation as described in the suttas, to which Vetter adds the sole practice of dhyana itself. According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, the earliest Buddhist path consisted of a set of practices which culminate in the practice of dhyana, leading to a <b>calm</b> <b>of</b> mind which according to Vetter is the liberation which is being sought. Later on, [...] "liberating insight" [...] came to be regarded as equally liberating. This [...] "liberating insight" [...] came to be exemplified by prajna, or the insight in the [...] "four truths," [...] but also by other elements of the Buddhist teachings.|$|E
