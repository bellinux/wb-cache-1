40|$|Knowledge of the {{structural}} condition of a highway pavement is important for pavement management at both the network level and the project level, particularly when the system monitoring, evaluation, and decision-making are {{to be made in}} a context of multiple criteria that include structural condition. A key aspect of the performance criteria for multiple criteria decision making is that the criteria must be amenable to scaling {{so that it can be}} duly incorporated in the overall utility function. The unbounded nature of existing structural performance indicators inhibits their use in such decision making contexts. Also, most of the existing indicators are cumbersome and/or too costly to measure as they require extensive coring, ground penetrating radar, or deployment of other expensive equipment to obtain the needed parameters for their computation. To address this gap in the literature, the present thesis developed an index to assess {{the structural}} <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> using deflection data from Falling Weight Deflectometer measurements. The newly developed index is termed “structural strength index” (SSI). The scale selected was a logistic scale that was developed on the basis of cumulative distribution of deflection numbers on the Indiana state highway network. Using this scaling formula, the value of structural condition for a given pavement section can be established given the deflection in mils. Furthermore, taking cognizance of the fact that deflection data (and thus SSIs) are not available at all pavement sections, the thesis developed statistical regression models by which the structural <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> could be estimated given its basic characteristics such as functional class, age, and drainage condition. The developed index can be used as one of the performance measures for evaluating alternative investments that seek to enhance pavement structural condition, at both the project level and the network level. ...|$|E

40|$|Quality of {{bond between}} layers of asphaltic {{concrete}} {{course is a}} key element to ensure the performance of a modern asphalt pavement. A proper interlayer bond ensures the structural integrity of the pavement and prevents possible distresses from occurring within the designed service life.

Generally, bond development is closely related to the design factors and construction factors. This paper however focused on the construction factors only, hoping to provide some useful information which might be overlooked by the contractors during construction but is of extreme important especially in enhancing the bond development in the asphalt layers.

The present study focuses on developing a relationship between the roughness and other surface distresses of PMGSY roads. Accordingly, eight PMGSY roads were selected in Jhunjhunu and Churu districts of Rajasthan, India. Distress data was collected for every 50 m separately. Roughness data was collected using Bump Integrator, which was calibrated using MERLIN on the couple of selected study stretches. Unevenness data was also collected from a newly laid stretch of pavement, and the value thus obtained was subtracted from the observed unevenness values of the test stretches, to get the net effect of the distresses on the pavement condition.

40|$|Many {{important}} decisions are {{necessary in order}} to successfully provide and manage a pavement network. At the heart of this process is the prediction of needed future construction events. One approach to providing a single numeric on the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> network is the use of pavement remaining service life (RSL). However, many issues exist with the current RSL terminology and resulting numeric that complicate proper interpretation, interagency data exchange, and use. A major source of uncertainty in the current RSL definition is {{the use of the term}} “life ” to represent multiple points in the pavement construction history. The recommended path to consistency involves adopting terminology of time remaining until a defined construction treatment is required (i. e., RSL is replaced by remaining service interval (RSI)). The term “RSI” has the ability to unify the outcome of different approaches to determine needs by focusing on when and what treatments are needed and the service interruption created. This report provides guidelines for implementing the RSI concept as a replacement to the current remaining life terminology for pavements. The RSI concept is broken down into a series of steps that follow a logical progression. Examples of the concept are presented using pavement engineering methodologies in current use. Suggestions are also provided based on the results of the RSI process. While this report focuses on pavements, it is also applicable to other types of transportation infrastructure. A companion report presents the framework for replacing the current RSL terminology with one based on more exact construction event terms.

As the road is usually to stay operational while the works are underway, proper schedule, construction methods, and traffic management have to be planned to ensure work safety and minimize traffic disturbances throughout the road network. One of the key aspects is determining the transport cycle of asphalt concrete carriers and reclaimed material carriers. The cycles are the basis for planning the number of trucks and other machines involved in the process. Additionally, the fluctuation of traffic volume {{in the time of}} works, the concept of dispatching loaded and unloaded carriers, and resulting decisions on transport routes, should be considered with respect to the schedule of pavement works.

The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate Bina Marga Pd T- 05 - 2005 -B Guideline in designing overlay thickness by comparing the guideline with EVERSERIES program. The location of the study was TMII – Cibubur segment of Jagorawi toll road. For the purpose of the research, two-way (direction A and B) deflection data along the segment together with 5 -year traffic volume data were collected. In determining overlay thickness, EVERSERIES program firstly evaluated the existing deflection and pavement temperature data and used them in backcalculation process to produce elastic moduli. The moduli, together with traffic volume data, then were used to calculate the overlay thickness. On the other hand, Bina Marga Guideline calculated manually the overlay thickness based on the category of deflections. The results showed that Bina Marga Guidelines always produced less thickness than EVERSERIES program, i. e. 7. 2 and 7. 12 cm for direction A and B, respectively, compared with thicknesses produced by EVERSERIES, that is, 11. 9 and 10. 29 cm for direction A and B, respectively.

40|$|Asphalt {{pavements}} deteriorate {{with traffic}} (especially heavy trucks) and time. Maintenance and overlaying may solve minor to medium pavement distress problems. When the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> becomes badly deteriorated, {{reconstruction of the}} pavement may become an economic and feasible solution. Reconstruction of a pavement requires removal of pavement surfaces. On-site use of recycled asphalt pavement materials has obvious benefits from economic, to environmental, to sustainability points of view. One attractive option is to use recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) materials as base courses with a thin new overlay. However, RAP has its limitations; for example, it creeps under a sustained load due {{to the presence of}} asphalt binder. A preliminary study conducted by the principal investigators has shown that the use of geocell to confine RAP minimizes creep of RAP under a sustained load. However, the performance of geocell-reinforced RAP as a base course overlaid by an asphalt surface is unknown. This research will utilize the geotechnical test box available at the University of Kansas to simulate the reconstruction of damaged asphalt pavements by geocell-reinforced RAP bases overlaid by a thin asphalt layer and evaluate their performance under cyclic loading. The main objectives of this research are to confirm the concept of using RAPs with geocells to reconstruct damaged pavements by heavy trucks and examine the benefit of geocells to the pavement life as compared with unreinforced base courses. In this research, at least four test sections will be constructed in the geotechnical test box including control sections and geocell-reinforced sections. The properties of RAP including asphalt binder content and viscosity, aggregate properties, compaction curve, and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) will be evaluated in the laboratory. The subgrade will be prepared using an artificial soil by mixing Kansas River sand with Kaolin and compacted at an intermediate strength (i. e., 5 % CBR).

40|$|Cost {{effective}} {{maintenance of}} pavement sections requires timely preventive maintenance and planned rehabilitation treatments. Knowledge {{of the increase}} in condition due to application of treatment and the loss of condition after treatment are essential when deciding the maintenance and rehabilitation treatments. Any error in formulating these values can cause significant changes in recommendations provided. Many researchers have developed pavement performance prediction models; however, less research has been done on the impact of treatment actions on the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> section after treatments. The objective of the research is to develop equations, using deterministic empirical method, that predict the increase in pavement condition and rate of decrease in pavement condition after treatment actions with respect to pavement condition just before the treatment. The equations are developed for different treatments and different functional class, and surface type combination to quantify the impact of the treatment for the use in pavement management system. These equations can be used to quantify the effects of different treatments for the use in pavement management system. Numerical illustration is presented using the data from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission-Pavement Management System software developed by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) located in Oakland, California. A relation is observed between increase in pavement condition and pavement condition just before treatment for different treatments and different functional class and surface type combination. Hence the equations to determine the trend in increase in pavement condition for different treatments and different functional class and surface type combination are developed. For rate of decrease in pavement condition, due to large variability in the data the loss of pavement condition per year could not be related to pavement condition just before treatment. Hence the equations to determine the trend in loss in pavement condition after treatment could not be developed. The developed equations can be efficiently used to predict increase in pavement condition due to application of the treatment and the loss of pavement condition after treatment...|$|E
40|$|Resilient modulus (MR) of soils is well-accepted and {{essential}} parameter for structural design of flexible pavements using the Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). A comprehensive laboratory study is undertaken {{to evaluate the}} moisture, suction effects and durability performance on resilient modulus (MR) and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of lime treated clayey subgrade soils. Two subgrade soils: the AASHTO class A- 6 and A- 7 - 6 are collected from US 491 road site in New Mexico. Cylindrical soil specimens are prepared according to NCHRP 1 - 28 A at three lime percentages: 0 %, 5 % and 7 % which are selected based on pH test. MR tests on lime treated soils are conducted with a modified stress sequence incorporated in the AASHTO T 307 procedure based on past literature and laboratory experience gained in this study. However, MR test is performed on the untreated soils following the AASHTO T 307 stress sequences for subgrade soils. Test samples are prepared at three different molding moisture contents: optimum moisture content (OMC), dry state (OMC- 2 %) and wet state (OMC+ 2 %). It is shown {{that the effects of}} moisture on MR and UCS values of lime treated soils are less than those on untreated soils. Test results reveal that MR and UCS values increase due to lime treatment depending on soil type and lime dose. A filter paper method is used to directly determine the total and matric suctions of soils at different moisture states in this study. It is observed that all suction components (total, matric and osmotic) increase due to lime addition on untreated subgrade soils. Test results show approximately 15 % increase of osmotic suction proportion to total suction after lime treatment to untreated soils. Finally, an existing MR constitutive model is revised by incorporating total suction. The revised model is shown to have better predictive capability over existing traditional stress-dependent resilient modulus models. For durability study, samples are prepared at optimum water content and tested after subjected to 10 and 20 freeze-thaw (F-T) cycles in a controlled environmental chamber. MR and UCS results of F-T samples are compared with no F-T damage samples. It is seen that resilient modulus values of untreated soils reduces significantly (> 80 %) after 20 F-T cycles. Lime stabilization shows less than 35 % reduction in MR values due to F-T action, thus exhibit less damage than untreated soils. In addition, field saturation state is simulated in the laboratory to observe the worst wetting <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> during the service life.

40|$|Manual {{pavement}} condition surveys are gradually replaced by more comprehensive automated surveys conducted by multi-function highway evaluation vehicles. Highway evaluation vehicles are generally equipped with laser profiling, land navigation, and imaging sub-systems. The imaging system {{consists of three}} cameras; forward-view and side-view digital area-scan cameras for capturing images of traffic signs and right-of-way safety features, and a pavement digital line-scan or area-scan camera for capturing images of the pavement surface. In addition to the 3 -laser and accelerometer-based profiling system, these vehicles are also equipped with differential global positioning equipment (DGPS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for cross-slope, curvature and grade measurements. Digital imaging systems installed in automated highway evaluation vehicles are generally designed on modular basis where subsystems by different manufacturers are assembled to customize the system and fulfill the users 2 ̆ 7 needs while minimizing the cost. In most such cases, manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 specifications for a subsystem would not be reliable {{with respect to the}} eventual performance of that subsystem as part of the entire assembly. On the other hand, no guidelines are available for performance evaluation of imaging systems as assemblies of discrete subsystems. Moreover, images acquired by digital cameras can become contaminated by random noise affecting their quality and the ability of identifying important features. These issues have surfaced during the development and testing of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) highway evaluation vehicle. This first phase of the work involved in this dissertation research concerns the study of basic criteria for evaluation of image quality through measurement of well-defined properties of images such as color reproduction, tone reproduction, detail reproduction, as well as the levels of noise, and optical distortion. Standard and reliable methods that can be adopted for evaluation of the above properties are discussed first. Then, by applying the above evaluation criteria to the imaging systems of the FDOT highway evaluation vehicle, it is shown how the sources of images sub-quality can be recognized and the optimum settings achieved. The second phase of the dissertation research is focused on the investigation of the sources of noise that can affect the digital line-scan distress images. As a result of this study, a novel technique was developed to filter out noise present in pavement distress images by using intensity measurement obtained from a standard grayscale target. In addition, a detailed experimental study was conducted to investigate the effect of the speed of evaluation and lighting conditions on the accuracy and repeatability of digital line-scan images in representing the actual distress <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement.</b> The conclusions drawn from the second phase can be used to minimize the effect of noise on digital images of pavement distress and to improve the accuracy of evaluation of pavement cracks based on digital images.

40|$|Temperature and {{moisture}} are very essential parameters when describing the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement.</b> In most cases, a high moisture content involves a decreased bearing capacity and, consequently, a shorter durability of the pavement. A frozen pavement {{has a greater}} bearing capacity than the corresponding construction in spring or late autumn. However, the freezing itself also implies strains to the pavement, as it heaves to different extent and in different directions {{in connection with the}} frost heave. The properties of an asphalt concrete pavement vary dramatically according to temperature. Cold asphalt concrete is hard, stiff and brittle, and therefore, cracks easily occur, whereas its bearing capacity decreases at high temperatures as softening progresses. Emphasizing the asphalt concrete, a numerical model has been developed for calculation of temperatures for summer condition, by means of recorded values for solar radiation, air temperature and wind velocity. Further, in order to also model temperatures and other conditions, occurring in the pavement during winter, a frost heave module has been developed and included in the model. The aim of this is to gain a better insight into the freezing process of a road structure. The model also provides an efficient tool for a better understanding of important factors related to frost depth and frost heave. A modified version of the model, is tested for falling weight deflectometer analysis. Input here, is a series of measured pavement surface temperatures and the output is calculated temperature distributions for the asphalt layer. Measuring equipment, developed at VTI, has been used to, in the field, automatically record frost heave and pavement temperature distribution. Furthermore, equipment for freezing tests in laboratory has also been developed. Experiences from such tests and field measurements have been used when developing the numerical model for freezing of pavements. At the laboratory freezing tests, a special interest has been devoted to water intake rate and heave rate related to cooling rate. The experiences, obtained from both the laboratory tests, as well as the field observations, have been compared to what has been reported in literature. Temperatures obtained from the numerical model for summer and winter temperatures have turned out to correspond well to measurements of pavement temperatures at all test sections studied, 12 in US and 3 in Sweden. The freezing tests in laboratory have shown, that a strong frost heave can exist without addition of external water to the samples. The natural water content is, consequently, sufficient to provide enough water for the heave. This "in-situ" water can be redistributed in the structure, thus providing water to the frozen portion of the profile to cause significant frost heave. Frost heave caused by a process like this, is not bound to uptake of external water, which normally is assumed in the relevant literature. Frost heave in freezing tests is often explained by 10 % volume expansion of the freezing water, which is sucked up by samples during the test. The freezing tests in laboratory have also shown, that the ratio (heave/water uptake) increases with frost susceptibility, i. e. the most frost susceptible soils require comparatively less added water for the heaving. The freezing tests in laboratory and field tests, have also shown that the relation between heave rate and heat extraction rate at the frost front, is weak. This is also in contradiction to what normally is stated in literature. The weak relation is found during longer periods of continous frost penetration. However, when heat extraction rate is varied at short time intervals, a strong dependency between heave rate and heat extraction rate is found. Godkänd; 2002; 20061113 (haneit...|$|E

As a consequence, the difference between these two design methods is quantified. For <b>a</b> verification <b>of</b> the results obtained from the MEPDG, the 1993 AASHTO guide is used. Subsequently, by using the MEPDG for rehabilitation, a maintenance strategy based on two resurfacings of wearing course of pavement is also investigated, and its effect on the extension of service life <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> in contrast with zero-maintenance is shown. Therefore, this work provides the knowledge for locally implementing the MEPDG with significant success both for the assumption of zero-maintenance and resurfacing treatments during the service life <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the pavement model test box (PMTB) testing method and its suitability {{for determining the}} stiffness modulus, fatigue and permanent deformation properties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> structure constructed with a cementitiously stabilized granular base layer of 250 mm thickness and a clay subgrade layer of 330 mm thickness that are required for the design <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> structure involving these materials. A new laboratory PMTB test setup with extensive instrumentations to measure soil deformations and strains is presented in this paper. The suitability of this testing arrangement for determining the stiffness, fatigue and permanent deformation characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> structure was examined by studying the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> granular base material stabilized with 1. 5 % general blend (GB) cement-flyash and a clay subgrade material. The test was continued at <b>a</b> frequency <b>of</b> 3 Hz up to 8 millions load cycles and measured horizontal tensile strain {{at the bottom of}} the stabilised base layer was used to determine the fatigue life of the stabilised layer. This study indicates that the deformation and strain measurement setups used for PMTB testing is suitable for undertaking cyclic load PMTB tests to determine the stiffness, fatigue and permanent deformation properties of the materials reliably...|$|R

Discusses the {{objective}} {{of this study was to}} develop an equation to determine the penetrometer penetration rate (DN) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> consisting <b>of</b> Bitumen Stabilised Material layers are constructed. The aim is to use laboratory results of Bitumen Stabilised Material and study the relations between the Indirect Tensile Strength and the Unconfined Compressive Strength. With the relations a penetrometer penetration rate (DN value in millimetre per blow) can be determined. This will enable the designer to apply the strength-balance concept on <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> consisting <b>of</b> Bitumen Stabilised Materials. As indicated previously it was found during the design stages that only the Indirect Tensile Strength data on the Bitumen Stabilised Material was available. Developing an equation to convert the Indirect Tensile Strength data to a DN value will allow the designer to apply the strength-balance concept and adjust the design for improved performance life <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement...</b>|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> {{management system}} for low-volume roads {{is a difficult}} task. There are many interrelated activities that must be considered, such as planning, design, construction, maintenance, and pavement evaluation. This paper addresses the evaluation and maintenance components <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pavement</b> management system for low-volume roadways and provides a process for programming maintenance on paved roads in National Forests. Various aspects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maintenance program are discussed, including {{the effects of the}} organizational structure, maintenance policies, economic considerations and decision criteria. The paper presents a procedure to rank forest roads according to predefined pavement evaluation criteria. Four categories of pavement evaluation information are treated, namely pavement performance, pavement distress, structural capacity, and safety. Procedures for quantifying these categories are developed and discussed. Examples are provided to illustrate each step of the procedure. Data requirements, collection methods and appropriate equipment are also described and their use discussed...|$|R
