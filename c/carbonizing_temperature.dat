40|$|Samples {{of rubber}} seed shells were {{carbonized}} at varying temperatures (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 °C) {{for three hours}} each and sieved through a 150 μm screen. The portion of the rubber seed shell carbon that passed through the screen was characterized in terms of loss on ignition, surface area, moisture content, pH, bulk density, and metal content and used in compounding natural rubber. The characterization shows that the pH, conductivity, loss on ignition and the surface area increases with the increases of the heating temperature, unlike the bulk density which decreases. The compound mixes were cured using the efficient vulcanization system. Cure characteristics of compounds and physico-mechanical properties of the vulcanisates were measured {{as a function of}} filler loading along with that of N 330 carbon-black filled natural rubbers. The results showed that the cure times, scorch times and the torque gradually increased, with increasing the filler content for rubber seed shell carbon-filled natural rubber, with the filler obtained at <b>carbonizing</b> <b>temperature</b> of 600 °C tending to show optimum cure indices. The physicomechanical properties of the vulcanisates increase with filler loading. The reinforcing potential of the carbonized rubber seed shell carbon was found to increase markedly for the filler obtained at the temperature range of 500 - 600 °C and then decreases with further increase in temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{insulation}} panels {{developed in}} our previous study are composed of wood shavings cold-pressed into a mat with a density of around 100 kg/m 3 without any binder. This elastic mat is lapped with plastic film that works as a damp proof course and is installed between studs or joists of timber frame houses. In the fireproof test of this insulation panel, it was observed that our insulation panels remained unbroken between studs after they burned, which suggests that a wood shaving elastic mat can hardly shrink in its compressive direction. This led to the present research work, carbonizing our insulation panels for better insulation capacity and durability since changes of macro and micro-pores caused by carbonization may provide our panels with better insulation capacity and carbonization itself can remove a risk of decay. In this paper, thermal conductivities of the panels are discussed in relation to their manufacturing factors such as initial panel density and <b>carbonizing</b> <b>temperature.</b> Panels with an initial density of 150, 200, 250 and 300 kg/m^ 3 and with a size of 200 by 200 by 50 mm were manufactured and then, they were carbonized at five different temperatures of 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 ℃. A good panel formability was obtained at a combination of 200 - 300 kg/m^ 3 and 400 - 500 ℃. The smallest thermal conductivity was 0. 044 W/mK and it was obtained at a combination of 250 kg/m^ 3 and 400 ℃ that satisfied above mentioned manufacturing conditions with good panel formability. This thermal conductivity was 20 % less than that of our previous woods having panels. Macro-pore distributions of the panel sections were obtained by micrograph and image analysis. The results revealed that carbonizing at 400 ℃ provides the panels with less macro-pore of 3 mm^ 2 and over which may cause air convection resulting in a higher thermal conductivity. Furthermore, water adsorption isotherm at 20 ℃ was determined, and {{it was found that the}} hygroscopicity was lower than before carbonizing and was different between 400 ℃　and 700 ℃. One reason for better insulation capacity of carbonized panels is thought to be less hygroscopic and much micro porous inside wood shavings than our previous panels...|$|E

Hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa) samples carbonized at 500 °– 1100 °C {{were exposed to}} gas mixtures of toluene and α-pinene at 20 °C. The samples carbonized at 500 °– 700 °C only adsorbed toluene, whereas those carbonized at 800 °– 1100 °C adsorbed both toluene and α-pinene. Analysis of the surface structure of the carbonized wood by nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature indicated that the sample carbonized at 700 °C had micropores mainly 0.6 nm in diameter and few mesopores, whereas the samples carbonized at 900 °C and 1100 °C had mesopores and micropores larger than 0.8 nm in diameter. With the sample carbonized at 700 °C, the flat-shaped toluene molecules could probably penetrate into the narrower pores, 0.8 nm in diameter, whereas the bulky globular-shaped α-pinene molecules could not. Carbonization at temperatures higher than 900 °C probably enlarged the pore size and thereby reduced the selectivity of adsorption. The results revealed that wood <b>carbonized</b> below activation <b>temperature</b> has a unique flat-pore structure that seems {{to work as a}} kind of molecular sieving carbon, successfully removing only the harmful volatile organic compound (VOC), toluene, and leaving behind a pleasant aroma of α-pinene in the atmosphere.|$|R
