40|$|Summary Immunodeprived mice {{survived a}} high, {{otherwise}} lethal dose of cyclophosphamide (Cy) provided {{they had been}} "primed " with a low dose (50 mg kg- 1) of the drug 4 days earlier. These combinations were then tested on 2 oat <b>cell</b> <b>xenograft</b> lines (which are known to reproduce the chemotherapeutic responses of the parent tumours) grown in immunodeprived mice. In {{the treatment of the}} first oat <b>cell</b> <b>xenograft,</b> 200 mg kg-I Cy produced a growth delay of 34 days in the unprimed group and 45 days in the primed group. At a dose of 300 mg kg-I a growth delay could not be assessed in the control group as 16 / 17 of these unprimed mice bearing this xenograft died. However, 14 / 22 tumours went into complete remission in this group before death occurred. In contrast only 3 / 16 deaths occurred in the group of mice that were primed before receiving the same challenge dose. In these animals 19 / 26 tumours went into complete remission and were still completely absent when the experiment was terminated at 60 days. Using the second oat <b>cell</b> <b>xenograft,</b> 300 mg kg- Cy produced a growth delay of 27 days. However, at this dose level all the animals were dead by day 46. In mice which had been primed with 50 mg kg-I Cy 4 days before the administration of 300 mg kg- 1 a growth delay of 32 days was achieved and 2 / 9 animals were alive at day 60. This study shows that priming allows larger doses of Cy to be given to immunodeprived mice bearing human tumour xenografts than would normally be tolerated and that the priming does not alter the anti-tumour efficacy of the large challenge dose as measure...|$|E

The transplanted donor-specific islet cells were functional to maintain euglycemia, since removal of the grafts at from 100 to 180 days in selected individual chimeras uniformly resulted in return of the diabetic state.

Rsf- 1 enhanced paclitaxel resistance via nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in ovarian cancer cells and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This study assessed {{the function of}} Rsf- 1 in the modulation of the sensitivity of NSCLC to paclitaxel via the NF-κB pathway. Methods: The mRNA and protein levels of the related genes were quantified by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Rsf- 1 silencing was achieved with CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing. Cell cycle, migration and proliferation were tested with flow cytometry, transwell test and CCK 8 test. Cell apoptosis was analyzed with flow cytometry and quantification of C-capase 3. The parameters of the tumors were measured in H 460 <b>cell</b> <b>xenograft</b> mice. Results: Rsf- 1 was highly expressed in H 460 and H 1299 cells. Rsf- 1 knockout caused cell arrest at the G 1 phase, increased cell apoptosis, and decreased migration and cell proliferation. Rsf- 1 knockout increased the inhibition of cell proliferation, the reduction in cell migration and the augment in cell apoptosis in paclitaxel treated H 460 and H 1299 cells. Rsf- 1 knockout further enhanced the paclitaxel-mediated decrease in the volume and weight of the tumors in H 460 <b>cell</b> <b>xenograft</b> mice. Helenalin and Rsf- 1 knockout decreased the protein levels of p-P 65, BcL 2, CFLAR, and XIAP; hSNF 2 H knockout decreased the protein level of NF-κB p-P 65 without altering Rsf- 1 and p 65 protein levels, while Rsf- 1 and hSNF 2 H double knockout decreased the level of NF-κB p-P 65, in H 1299 and H 460 cells.

Alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been shown to induce the differentiation of neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib inhibits cell growth and angiogenesis in NBs. Here, we investigated the synergistic effect between bortezomib and ATRA in inducing NB cell differentiation in different NB cell lines. Bortezomib combined with ATRA had a significantly enhanced antiproliferative effect. This inhibition was characterized by a synergistic increase in neuronal differentiation. At the same time, the combination therapy showed little neuronal toxicity which was assessed in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells by the MTT assay, PI staining. The combination of bortezomib and ATRA triggered increased differentiation through the activation of proteins, including RARa, RARb, RARc, p-JNK and p 21, compared with ATRA treatment alone. Using JNK inhibitor SP 600125 to block JNK-dependent activity, the combination therapy-induced neuronal differentiation was partially attenuated.

It is well recognised that seminal plasma contains an abundance of inflammatory mediators, which are identified as regulators of tumour growth.

PSMA expression was evaluated by 68 Ga-PSMA 11 PET/CT and quantified by flow cytometry of tumor fine needle aspirations before treatment and on days 23, 29, 34, and 39 post-therapy induction. For the RLT combination approach, mice bearing C 4 - 2 tumors {{were treated with}} 10  mg/kg ENZ or vehicle for 21  days before receiving either 15  MBq (84  GBq/μmol) 177 Lu-PSMA 617 or vehicle. DNA damage was assessed as phospho-γH 2 A.X foci in tumor biopsies. Reduction of tumor volume on CT and survival were used as study endpoints.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Overexpression of Aurora A and B {{has been}} {{reported}} {{in a wide range of}} tumor types, including gastric cancer. Anti-angiogenesis has been considered as an important therapeutic modality in advanced gastric cancer. Here we identified a novel compound TY- 011 with promising antitumor activity by targeting mitotic kinases (Aurora A and B) and angiogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (VEGFR 2). Methods HTRF® KinEASE™ assay was used to detect the effect of TY- 011 against Aurora A, Aurora B and VEGFR 2 activities. Docking simulation study was performed to predict the binding mode of TY- 011 with Aurora A and B kinases. CCK- 8 assay was used to test cell growth. Cell cycle and cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Gastric cancer <b>cell</b> <b>xenograft</b> mouse models were used for in vivo study. TUNEL kit was used to determine the apoptosis of tumor tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis and HUVEC tube formation assay were performed to determine the anti-angiogenesis ability. Immunofluorescence and western blot were used to test protein expression. Results TY- 011 was identified as a potential Aurora A and B inhibitor by HTRF® KinEASE™ assay. It effectively inhibited cellular Aurora A and B activities in a concentration-dependent manner. TY- 011 occupied the ATP-binding site of both Aurora A and B kinases. TY- 011 demonstrated prominent inhibitory effects on proliferation of gastric cancer cells. TY- 011 treatment induced an obvious accumulation of cells at G 2 /M phase and a modest increase of cells with > 4  N DNA content, which then underwent apoptosis. Meaningfully, orally administration of TY- 011 demonstrated superior efficacy against the tumor growth in gastric cancer <b>cell</b> <b>xenograft,</b> with ~ 90 % inhibition rate and 100 % tumor regression at 9  mg/kg dose, and TY- 011 did not affect the body weight of mice. Interestingly, we observed that TY- 011 also antagonized tumor angiogenesis by targeting VEGFR 2 kinase. Conclusions These results indicate that TY- 011 is a well-tolerated, orally active compound that targets mitosis and angiogenesis in tumor growth, and provides strong preclinical support for use as a therapeutic for human gastric cancers...|$|E
40|$|Advanced nasopharyngeal {{carcinoma}} (NPC) has a {{poor prognosis}} {{because of the}} lack of an effective treatment. Here we explored the efficiency and the molecular mechanisms of combined treatment with triptolide and ionizing radiation for treating NPC. Human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (CNE) cells were treated with triptolide, ionizing radiation, or triptolide plus ionizing radiation in vitro. Tumor potency was examined in an in vivo CNE <b>cell</b> <b>xenograft</b> mouse model, which was treated as above. Our results demonstrated that triptolide caused a significant reduction in cell growth and colony number, and induced a marked apoptosis that was further enhanced with increasing doses of ionizing radiation. Combination treatment synergistically reduced tumor weight and volume without obvious toxicity. Western blot analysis in vitro and in vivo showed that triptolide induced apoptotic protein Bax expression and inhibited phosph-NF-κB p 65, Bcl- 2 and VEGF proteins without affecting other NF-κB related protein expression. In conclusion, our findings revealed that triptolide plus ionizing radiation had synergistic anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis effects in NPC via down-regulating NF-κB p 65 phosphorylation. The combination therapy may provide novel mechanism insights into inhibit NPC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are known}} to induce apoptosis {{in a variety of}} cancer cells, including colon, prostate, breast and leukemia. Among them, aspirin, a classical NSAID, shows promise in cancer therapy in certain types of cancers. We hypothesized that aspirin might affect the growth of liver cancer cells since liver is the principal site for aspirin metabolism. Therefore, we investigated the effects of aspirin on the HepG 2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line in vitro and the HepG 2 <b>cell</b> <b>xenograft</b> model in BALB/c nude mice. We found that treatment with aspirin inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis involving both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways as measured by DNA ladder formation, alteration in the Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio, activation of the caspase activities and related protein expressions. In vivo antitumor activity assay also showed that aspirin resulted in significant tumor growth inhi-bition compared to the control. Oral administration of aspirin (100 mg/kg/day) caused a significant reduction in the growth of HepG 2 tumors in nude mice. These findings suggest that aspirin may be used as a promising anticancer agent against liver cancer...|$|E
40|$|We {{show here}} that the {{antidiabetic}} agents metformin and phenformin and the AMPK activator AICAR exert strong anti-tumoural effects on tPTEN-/- lymphoma cells and on human T-ALL cell lines and primary samples. The compounds act by inhibiting tumour metabolism and proliferation and by inducing apoptosis in parallel with an activation of AMPK and an inhibition of constitutive mTOR. In tPTEN-/- cells, the drugs potentiated the anti-leukaemic effects of dexamethasone, and metformin and phenformin synergised with 2 -deoxyglucose (2 DG) to impair tumour cell survival. In vivo, metformin and AICAR strongly decreased the growth of luciferase-expressing tPTEN-/- <b>cells</b> <b>xenografted</b> in Nude mice, demonstrating that metabolism targeting could be a potent adjuvant strategy for lymphoma/leukaemia treatmen...|$|R
50|$|Although NOV {{inhibits}} {{the proliferation}} of cancer cells, it appears to promote metastasis. Nov overexpression results in reduced tumor size in glioma <b>cells</b> <b>xenografts,</b> but enhances metastatic potential in xenotransplanted melanoma cells. NOV expression {{is associated with a}} higher risk of metastasis and worse prognosis in patients with cancers such as Ewing’s sarcoma, melanoma, and breast cancer. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), NOV is downregulated {{as a consequence of the}} kinase activity of BCR-ABL, a chimeric protein generated through the chromosomal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22. Forced expression of NOV inhibits proliferation and restores growth control in CML cells, suggesting that NOV may be an alternate target for novel therapeutics against CML.|$|R
