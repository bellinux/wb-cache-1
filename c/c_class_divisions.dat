40|$|Introduction: Dental arch width {{measurement}} {{is needed}} to determine diagnoses and orthodontic treatment planning of Angle <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 1 and <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 2  malocclusions that have narrow maxillary dental arch generally. Dental arch width in this study was measured by maxillary and mandibular intercanine width.  This study aimed to compare the differences of intercanine width between Angle <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 1 and <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 2 malocclusions. Methods: Descriptive comparative research with total samples of 67 study models, consisted of 34 <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 1 cases and 33 <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 2 cases. The minimum age of the samples chosen was 13 years old with no history of orthodontic treatment. A non probability consecutive sampling technique was used. Results: Study results showed the avarage maxillary and mandibular intercanine width of <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 1 were 33, 99 mm and 26, 33 mm. Average maxillary and mandibular intercanine width of <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 2 were 34, 77 mm and 25, 37 mm.
