The conflict escalated in the early 1990s, as Yitzhak Rabin's government adopted a more aggressive posture on Iran. Rhetorical conflict additionally heated up during the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who made inflammatory statements against Israel. Other factors which have contributed to the escalation of tensions include Iran's development of nuclear technology relative to Israel's long-stated Begin Doctrine, Iranian funding of groups like Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas, and alleged involvement in terrorist attacks such as the 1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and the 1994 AMIA bombing, alleged Israeli support for groups like People's Mujahedin of Iran or Jundallah and alleged covert operations in Iran including assassinations and explosions.|$|E

Increasingly, scholars depict young people not as a monolithic group with identical attitudes towards nationalism, but as individuals and small group constellations, sometimes within larger organizations, with behaviors ranging from conformity to apathy and shades of dissent and resistance. Political regimes have faced challenges harnessing and controlling young people’s energy and enthusiasm as citizens and nationalists in times of war, <b>cold</b> war, <b>peace</b> and memory work. As scholars have argued for some time, typical sites of youth nationalism include the school classroom, the military, leisure activities and youth groups or movements.

However, Syria is still anti-democratic, economically backward and a conflict-prone state. The main thesis of this work is that Syrian political and strategic culture {{is one of the major}} obstacles to Syria's transformation into a democratic, peaceful and prosperous country. The most immediate problem faced by Syria is the urgency for liberalization at home and peace in the region. However, President Hafiz al-Asad's personal way of thinking, the Ba'th ideology, and the political system all impede Syria from undergoing necessary structural transformations and concluding the Middle East peace process with a viable peace agreement. This is because liberalization and peace put the survival of Asad's dictatorship at stake. As a result, it is plausible to argue that Syria will not be a partner of the new world order as long as Asad or his clique remains in power. [URL] Turkish Land Force...|$|R

40|$|In 1989 – 1991 the geo-ideological contestation {{between two}} blocs was swept away, {{together}} with the ideology of civil war and its concomitant Cold War played out on the larger stage. Paradoxically, while the domestic sources of Cold War confrontation have been transcended, its external manifestations remain {{in the form of}} a ‘legacy’ geopolitical contest between the dominant hegemonic power (the United States) and a number of potential rising great powers, of which Russia is one. The post-revolutionary era is thus one of a ‘cold peace’. A <b>cold</b> <b>peace</b> is a mimetic cold war.

A <b>cold</b> <b>peace</b> is accompanied by a singular stress on notions of victimhood for some and undigested and bitter victory for others.

The war in Ukraine is accompanied by the fortification of its border with Russia, while the Baltic republics are creating the foundations for what is an embryonic new ‘iron curtain’ dividing the Atlantic community from Eurasia. Elsewhere fences are being built to halt the flow of refugees and migrants. These new barriers symbolize the failure to build a Europe ‘whole and free’ in the post-Cold War era, {{and the failure of}} the era of globalization to create the conditions for security and development in Europe’s neighborhood. The spate of ‘walling’ reflects not the strength of national sovereignty but its weakness, and not the power of the Atlantic community to spread prosperity, peace and security but the opposite.

40|$|The {{need for}} a greater {{understanding}} of the motivations behind third party mediation efforts forms the backdrop of this thesis. Awareness about such drives could possibly pave the way for a deeper understanding of other aspects of mediation efforts, such as {{the success or failure of}} intervention. Since the end of the <b>Cold</b> War, <b>peace</b> and reconciliation has been seen as one of the pillars in Norwegian foreign policy. As a result, Norway has invested considerable resources in efforts to promote peaceful resolutions in distant intrastate conflicts. The peace mediation in Sudan represents such an effort. Norway played a key role in the negotiations between the government of Khartoum and the Sudanese People Liberation Movement (SPLM). This thesis explores the motivations and rationale behind Norway’s involvement in the Sudan peace process between 2002 and 2011. By undertaking a multi-level analysis within the framework of foreign policy several aspects related to peace efforts are explored. This thesis argues that Norway’s aspiration for the Sudan peace engagement steams both from national identity and value-based efforts to support peace and reconciliation, and from a more strategic interest in promoting Norway’s interests in international relations. The US’ renewed interest in the conflict in the aftermath of the 9 / 11 attacks created a window of opportunity for Norway to engage, and the peace engagement in Sudan was to a large extent due to ambitious individuals within the bureaucracy...|$|R

About [...] of the remaining oil sands are considered recoverable at current prices with current technology. The city of Fort McMurray developed nearby to service the oil sands operations, but its remote location in the otherwise uncleared boreal forest became a problem when the entire population of 80,000 had to be evacuated on short notice because of the 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire which enveloped the city and destroyed over 2,400 homes.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the need for a {{critical}} view and evaluation of 25 years with Norwegian third party mediation efforts {{from the beginning of the}} 1990 s until today. Since the end of the <b>Cold</b> War, <b>peace</b> and reconciliation has been considered an important part of Norwegian foreign policy. From the beginning of the 1990 s Norway started investing considerable resources in peace negotiations in distant intrastate conflicts, primarily as a facilitator between conflicted parties. The peace negotiations in Guatemala, Sri Lanka and the Balkans are among peace processes where Norway has played a key role during the negotiations. Even if Norwegian diplomats tend to highlight Norway’s accomplishments in these efforts, a closer look at the results of 25 years of Norwegian peace diplomacy however shows that the efforts by Norway alone is not necessarily sufficient to reach the goal of a final peace agreement. If a successful peace process is defined as a process where the result of the negotiations is a permanent and durable peace agreement, the processes based on Norwegian efforts have a significant lack of successful cases. Based on the same definition of a successful negotiation process, the Norwegian mediation efforts in the peace negotiations in Guatemala and the Balkans are considered as two successful cases. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, represents an unsuccessful case. An awareness about Norway’s strengths and weaknesses in these peace efforts can help developing certain conditions that are necessary for more successful outcomes in prospective peace negotiations where Norway is planning on playing a significant role as facilitator. The aim of this thesis is to find a recipe for such successful peace negotiations with Norway representing the role as a third party. Norway can play an important role as a facilitator in the preliminary phases of the negotiations, but a mediators need for significant political leverage and political power in the final phases seems crucial for a successful outcome and a final peace agreement...|$|R
