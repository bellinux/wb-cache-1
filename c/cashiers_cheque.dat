25|$|Following {{the initial}} issues of pataca {{banknotes}} in 1906, the new currency was supplemented {{the following year}} by 10 and 25 pataca notes, and in February 1920, 5, 10 and 50 avo notes were added. In 1923, the Banco Vui Hang introduced 10 pataca notes which stated that they were backed by Cantonese 20 cent coins. These notes were followed until 1934 by <b>cashier's</b> <b>cheques</b> issued by various banks in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1000 dollars, presumably equivalent to the pataca. The BNU issues were augmented by 1 and 20 avo notes in 1942, and in 1944, 500 pataca notes were introduced. Also in 1944, further <b>cashier's</b> <b>cheques</b> were issued, denominated 1000 yuan and NC$5000. The 25 pataca note was discontinued after 1958.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cashier's</b> <b>cheques</b> and banker's drafts, {{also known}} as bank cheques, banker's cheques or treasurer's cheques, are cheques issued against the funds of a {{financial}} institution rather than an individual account holder. Typically, the term cashier's check {{is used in the}} US and banker's draft is used in the UK and most of the Commonwealth. The mechanism differs slightly from country to country but in general the bank issuing the cheque or draft will allocate the funds at the point the cheque is drawn. This provides a guarantee, save for a failure of the bank, that it will be honoured. <b>Cashier's</b> <b>cheques</b> are perceived {{to be as good as}} cash but they are still a cheque, a misconception sometimes exploited by scam artists. A lost or stolen cheque can still be stopped like any other cheque, so payment is not completely guaranteed.|$|R
