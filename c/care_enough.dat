500|$|Near {{the end of}} the project, Moore {{realized}} that the story bore some similarity to [...] "The Architects of Fear", an episode of The Outer Limits television series. The writer and Wein argued over changing the ending, and when Moore refused to give in, Wein quit the book. Wein explained, [...] "I kept telling him, 'Be more original, Alan, you've got the capability, do something different, not something that's already been done!' And he didn't seem to <b>care</b> <b>enough</b> to do that." [...] Moore acknowledged the Outer Limits episode by referencing it in the series' last issue.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the segment, Daniel Victor of The New York Times said [...] "Donald Drumpf" [...] was [...] "a funny label", but {{stated that}} the Trump family had changed its name in the 17th century, so the surname change could not be {{attributed}} to the presidential candidate. He also pointed out that many American entertainers and politicians, including Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford and rival presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, had changed their names. CNET's Chris Matyszczyk called the segment a [...] "lengthy excoriation" [...] of Trump and commented that Oliver's intents extended past [...] "mere satire", influencing Americans to <b>care</b> <b>enough</b> to vote against Trump.|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the Millennium Group was a real-life organization called the Academy Group, which consisted of retired law enforcement agents working as a private investigative firm. Millennium creator Chris Carter {{had come to know}} members of the Academy Group through contacts he had made with the Federal Bureau of Investigation while researching his earlier television series The X-Files. The Academy Group focused on offender profiling, which shaped the main Millennium Group characters of Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). Describing his initial inception of the Group, Carter has stated [...] "they believe that all this random violence we see these days, there may actually be some order in the chaos [...] These guys think that, if they <b>care</b> <b>enough,</b> that they can stem the tide of this thing".|$|E

500|$|Burns was incredulous that Emma and Carl {{had not yet}} consummated their four-month-old marriage, {{and criticized}} their going to a {{substitute}} teacher for relationship advice, something that Benigno also found stupid. Slezak and VanDerWerff disliked the episode's portrayal of Emma, since the recently seen [...] "stronger, less neurotic, and altogether more appealing Emma", as Slezak put it, was inconsistent with her depiction here. One of the few positive comments was from Canning, who singled out Emma's ignorance of what an [...] "afternoon delight" [...] actually was. The reviewers were more enthusiastic about the pairing of Puck and Lauren, though somewhat divided. MTV's Emily Exton called them her [...] "favorite couple of the evening" [...] and cited [...] "the ridiculous logic that they share". Canning called their scenes [...] "a hoot", though Benigno said he was [...] "still not buying" [...] the relationship. A third couple, that of the resurrected pairing of Finn and Quinn, was in Harper's [...] "didn't love" [...] column, and VanDerWerff couldn't bring himself to <b>care</b> <b>enough</b> to comment on it.|$|E
500|$|A dress {{rehearsal}} {{was held on}} May 2, two days before taping. Several NBC executives watched the rehearsal and were concerned that Monica did not <b>care</b> <b>enough</b> about Paul to sleep with him on their first date. NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer believed that the audience would perceive her as [...] "a slut". Crane, Kauffman and Warner Bros. executives disagreed, and surveyed the other people watching the rehearsal to support their position. Despite the audience agreeing with them, {{they had to take}} NBC's considerations into account in case they lost the commission; they rewrote Monica's lines to show that she cared about Paul. NBC also wanted a scene removed that implied the supposedly-impotent Paul was getting an erection, as it would violate network standards. Crane and Kauffman rewrote the scene and found they preferred the new version, as it made the scene [...] "smart and subtler". They sought to protect other parts of the script, some major and some minor; NBC wanted two of the pilot's three storylines downplayed to subplots, but the writers were adamant that all three should carry equal weight. They also favored not cutting the [...] "Mr. Potato Head" [...] line. Their final script draft was completed on May 3.|$|E

2500|$|Byrne and {{his family}} contributed most of the funds in support of House Bill 148 in Utah, {{a bill that would}} allow the state to provide funding {{vouchers}} for students who decide to leave public schools for private schools. In January 2008, it was reported that Byrne and his parents contributed about $4 million to the pro-voucher campaign, or three-quarters of its $5.4 million funding. Opponents of vouchers, funded mostly by the teacher unions, spent $4 million; approximately $3 million came from the National Education Association. When that bill was defeated in a statewide referendum (62% opposing vs. 38% favoring), the Salt Lake Tribune reported that Byrne [...] "called the referendum a 'statewide IQ test' that Utahns failed." [...] He said, [...] "They don't <b>care</b> <b>enough</b> about their kids. They care an awful lot about this system, this bureaucracy, but they don't <b>care</b> <b>enough</b> about their kids to think outside the box." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since the game's {{unveiling}} {{there have}} been multiple leaks revealing content featured within Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes, primarily from stores marketing the game. Target inattentively leaked the release date of the game, September 23, 2014, in a flyer. Venom was also leaked by the flyer, as the character had never been revealed prior. Walmart later leaked that multiple characters including the Guardians of the Galaxy would be playable in the game. Walmart did so by listing multiple characters, Playset packs and Starter Packs on their website. Another image was leaked, showcasing Star-Lord and Gamora figures. On the leaks, Vignocchi stated [...] "Yeah, this year we definitely had a challenge with retail – putting out the sku plans and having those accessible by managers prior to announcements. But at the same time, as we've said internally – well, people <b>care</b> <b>enough</b> to talk about it, so we know we’re doing something special!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Rosenberg {{has called}} Maus [...] "arguably my best friend" [...] and [...] "my very first fan", and in turn, Maus called him [...] "the zeitgeist embodied. He is {{the figure of}} this {{situation}} and of this time, of the cloud, of the spectacle gone online." [...] For a time, Maus {{was a member of}} the Haunted Graffiti stage band, and he collaborated with Rosenberg on the title track of Lover Boy (2002). He said that Rosenberg came up with most of the lyrics for [...] "Big Dumb Man" [...] (2000) and [...] "The Law" [...] (2003), but was not credited [...] "because neither of us <b>care</b> <b>enough</b> about any 'official' credit." [...] The two backed Animal Collective's Panda Bear (Noah Lennox) for his solo tour of Europe, where Maus served as keyboardist. He attempted to submit his work to several labels, including Kill Rock Stars and Animal Collective's Paw Tracks, but was rejected. Eventually, while touring London with Rosenberg, he encountered agents from Upset the Rhythm, who agreed to distribute his music.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first few}} seconds {{are the most}} crucial and {{controversial}} of the disaster. Survivors insist that a female official immediately stood up and shouted: [...] "Students sit down; don’t move. Let the leaders walk out first (...) [...] " [...] (Note: In Chinese, the order: 让领导先走 has since became a popular internet catch phrase, meaning the government officials have priority over ordinary folks in times of emergency). She has since been identified in online articles as Kuang Li (况丽), who was vice-director of the state petroleum company’s local education centre, though {{there has been no}} official confirmation of this. [...] The teachers obeyed, and the children remain seated. [...] By the time the about 20 Communist Party officials had filed out through the only opened emergency exit, when all the other exits remained locked, it was too late. Teachers hurried the pupils out of their seats to other exits, only to find that the emergency exit doors were locked, and no one seem to <b>care</b> <b>enough</b> to get them opened. [...] Parents and survivors alleged that Kuang took refuge in a ladies’ cloakroom that could have sheltered 30 people and barred the doors behind her. [...] A 10-year-old boy said [...] "My teacher asked me to run out of the theatre, but when I stood up the hall was smothered in smoke and fire. The power then cut out. People could see nothing. The place was full of crying and shouting." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 40th Canadian Federal Election {{campaign}} officially {{began at}} 8:20a.m. Eastern Daylight Time when Governor General Michaëlle Jean accepted Stephen Harper's request to dissolve Parliament and call an election for October 14, 2008. The party leaders jumped {{right into the}} campaign, with Stéphane Dion attacking the Conservative's record, presenting the Liberal plan, and rejected the accusation by Harper that the Liberal party is a risky choice. Jack Layton took a more forceful approach than previous elections, in which the New Democratic Party has just tried to maintain {{a high number of}} seats in Parliament to influence government. Layton has made it clear he will campaign for the position of prime minister itself this time, but also returned to a longstanding NDP theme: alleged abuses by big business. He promised to stop what he called [...] "ripoffs" [...] by big oil, cellphone and banks, and his attacks are expected to focus on the Conservatives and all but ignore the Liberals. Elizabeth May of the Green Party said Canadians would <b>care</b> <b>enough</b> about the environment to vote for her party, as long as she was able to get into the television debates. Stephen Harper has stated his objection to including the Green Party into television debates because of the similar policies of the Green and Liberal party, and how it would be unfair. Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe said the Conservatives must be prevented from winning a majority, and the BQ is the only party that can do that. Duceppe compared Harper to US President George W. Bush, and said the government is incompetent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact of}} the coordinated action was {{generally}} considered to be significant. Yochai Benkler of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society stated that the January 18 blackout was [...] "a very strong public demonstration to suggest that what historically was seen as a technical system of rules that only influences the content industry has become something more," [...] further adding [...] "You've got millions of citizens who <b>care</b> <b>enough</b> to act. That's not trivial." [...] California House member Darrell Issa called the collective effort an unprecedented means for upsetting a backroom lobbying effort, and the immediate political efficacy of the widespread online protest was characterised in terms of a sleeping giant having awakened and of a new player being in town. [...] One Silicon Valley lobbyist said the content industry had [...] "a lot to learn," [...] noting that they don't have grassroots support: [...] "There are no Facebook pages to call your congressman to support PIPA and SOPA." [...] The New York Times, which framed the netizens' revolt in terms of the new economy versus the old economy, headlined the activism as a [...] "political coming of age for the tech industry." [...] (James Grimmelmann, an Associate Professor at New York Law School, opined two months later that [...] "Legal systems are like Soylent Green: they're made out of people. [...] If you want to protect civil liberties using law, you need to get people on your side who share your vision of what law stands for. [...] That's why the SOPA protests were so effective. They converted an argument about justice into real-world political power.") ...|$|E
