40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} on 15 castrated males and 10 females of Casertana pig slaughtered at a live weight ranging from 130 to 250 kg. Rheological and colorimetric characteristics were determined on the muscles Caput longum <b>tricipitis</b> <b>brachii</b> (CL), longissimus dorsi (LD), psoas maior (PM) anconeus (PA), supraspinatus (SS) after storage at - 20 °C for 120 d. Statistical analysis considered live weight as covariate and sex, muscle and interaction as fixed factor (GLM procedure, SAS). Results showed that females have darker meat than castrated males. LD muscle showed the lowest value of a* and b* and was chracacterized by the greater lightness with the lowest chroma and the highest hue value. On the other hand, PA was the darkest muscle and showed the worst rheological traits. PM exhibited the lowest hardness and chewiness value. Sex did not significantly affect rheological characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out on 6 buffalo calves reared in a farm near Salerno and {{slaughtered}} at 14 ± 16 months of age. The following muscles [Caput longum <b>tricipitis</b> <b>brachii</b> (CloTB), Gluteobiceps (Gb), Semitendinosus (St), Semimembranosus (Sm) and Longissimus dorsi (LD) ] were analysed by Texturometer and Warner Bratzler Shear instruments. For each muscle were collected: (a) samples of 40 mm of diameter and 13 mm of height to determine hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, chewiness and total moisture release, parallely to direction of muscle fibres, by Texturometer; (b) samples of 2. 54 cm of diameter and 2 cm of lenght to determine the shear force, resistance and work, using Warner Bratzler Shear installed on Instron 1140. The Gb was hardest muscle requiring the greatest work of chewiness; the St showed the highest shear force value. On the contrary, CloTB was less hard and showed lower work and total moisture release...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the structural and qualitative variations induced by two cooking procedures (electric griddle and microwave oven) 6 buffalo males of 17 {{months of age}} were slaughtered. On Caput longum <b>tricipitis</b> <b>brachii</b> (CLoTB), Gluteobiceps (Gb), Longissimus dorsi (LD), Semimembranosus (Sm) and Semitendinosus (St) muscles morphometric characteristics of FG, FOG and SO fiber types and some quality indicators (rheological and colour characteristics) were measured. The results showed that Semitendinosus has {{a higher percentage of}} FG and FOG fibers, CLoTB has an even distribution of the three fibre types, whereas the LD has a high percentage of FG. With both cooking procedure the cross sectional area (CSA) value of CLoTB, LD and Sm decreases by about 60 % whereas cooking on electric griddle causes a decrease in CSA value of St and Gb muscles of an additional 10 and 6 % respectively, compared to microwave cooking. Cooking determined a levelling {{of the value of the}} qualitative characteristics of the meat: the significant differences found for the raw meat as regards toughness, shear force and chewiness become not significant with both cooking procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} on 5 muscles (Caput longum <b>tricipitis</b> <b>brachii,</b> Longissimus dorsi, Pars parameralis gluteobicipitis, Semimembranosus, Semitendinosus) of 36 Italian Friesian cull cows divided into 2 groups: 18 had a finishing period of 90 days and 18 did't. Nine carcasses of each group were electrically stimulated 1 hour after slaughter [20 Volts (50 Hz) for 1 min. ]. All the right sides were cut after 7 d of ageing (0 ÷ 4 °C) while {{the left side of}} stimulated carcasses were hot boned 2 hours after slaughter. 	The most important results are summarized as follows: 1. 	the meat of cows from finishing group has more water holding capacity and is 'lighter' [higher reflectance percentage at level of visible spectrum (380 - 700 nm) ]; 2. 	the electrical stimulation does not influence the values of hardness and of chewiness but the meat of cows without finishing has a higher water holding capacity if the carcass has been stimulated; moreover the meat of electrically stimulated carcass is 'lighter'; 3. 	the type of boning (cold or hot) does not influence the rheological and colour characteristics of meat; 4. 	the muscle is important in determining the value of studied characteristics showing a marked histochemical individuality...|$|R
40|$|Biochemical {{adaptations of}} limb myofibres to {{intensive}} bipedal hopping were investigated using the five-toed jerboa Allactaga elater {{as a model}} {{in comparison with the}} rat. Immunofluorescence methods included immunoreactivity to anti-fast and anti-slow MHC and troponin I. There is no specialization of triceps <b>caput</b> <b>mediale</b> for postural function in the minute non-locomotor forelimbs, unlike quadruped mammals. The various elbow extensor heads and the flexor muscles are alike with regard to fibre type population and cross-sectional areas of each type of fibre. The extensor muscle in the elongated hindlimbs of the five-toed jerboa, at both the knee and the ankle joints, differ from each other extensively. One head, made up of an extremely high percentage of type I, fatigue-resistant fibres, is suited to postural function. Two extensor heads at each joint contain a very high percentage of type IIB fibres (having the greatest maximal velocity of contraction) and are able to produce the powerful acceleration needed to trigger the leap. The relative cross-sectional areas of the myofibres are characteristic of hopping locomotion: predominance in number of one type of myofibre in a muscle accompanies greater cross-sectional area, which increases muscle efficiency in either postural or accelerative function of the muscle...|$|R
40|$|Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) meat is {{not widely}} used in the diet, but it is {{recently}} reconsidered due to its valuable nutritional qualities. New strategies aiming {{to improve the quality}} of buffalo meat have to be applied particularly to face the problem of lipid peroxidation, one of the most important causes of meat food deterioration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the lipid oxidation of buffalo meat (muscles Caput longum <b>tricipitis</b> <b>brachii,</b> Longissimus dorsi and Semimembranosus), coming from animals fed with two different amount of vitamin E (600 IU/die and 1500 IU/die for 102 - 123 days) considering, as markers for lipid oxidation, the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) by HPLC-UV and TBA test. Moreover it was evaluated, by HPLC-DAD, vitamin E concentration in the meat samples. Muscles coming from animals with vitamin E supplementation were in mean 2 times more enriched of vitamin E than control (p < 0. 05). Meat from buffalo fed with 600 IU/die vitamin E had significant lower MDA concentration in comparison with control (in mean - 53 %, n= 4). Both for MDA and vitamin E concentrations not significant differences were found between the supplementation of 600 IU/die and 1500 IU/die. It is concluded that dietary supplementation with Vitamin E is a promising strategy to prevent lipid oxidation of buffalo meat and to prolong its shelf-life...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of fatty acids, CLA, triglycerides and cholesterol in intramuscular fat depots of buffalo meat was determined using high-resolution gas chromatography {{to investigate the}} influence of dietary vitamin E content. Three groups of Italian Mediterranean buffalo calves were fed on three diets with high (H), low (L) and zero (Z) vitamin E contents. The animal were slaughtered at 15 months and three muscles were dissected on the half-carcass: Longissimus dorsi (LD), <b>Tricipitis</b> <b>brachii</b> (TB) and Semimembranosus (Sm). Lipid extracts from muscles (g/ 100 g f. m. : 0. 82 for LD, 0. 66 for TB and 0. 48 for Sm) were used to quantify the amount (mg/ 100 g of lipids) of fatty acids, total conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and cholesterol. The effects of dietary vitamin E content were significant (P< 0. 05) but marginal. Comparison of lipid extracts from muscles showed that C 18 : 2 and total CLA were higher respectively in TB and Sm muscles when vitamin content was low. Also Cholesterol content variation was affected by low dietary vitamin E: LD muscle has a lower cholesterol concentration for diet L. The different vitamin content of two diets did not significantly influence the {{composition of}} triglycerides. Considering the low lipid concentrations (< 1 g/ 100 g of fresh muscle) none of the meat muscles {{should be considered a}} significant source of CLA...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNumber of work related {{musculoskeletal}} disorders due to ergonomics risks among workers in Europe, including Latvia, is growing. Employees {{in health care}} professions admit physical load and discomfort in various body parts after the shift. According to Eurostat statistical data 60 % of total work related diseases are attributed to {{musculoskeletal disorders}} in Latvia. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the muscle fatigue caused by physical load for surgeons, anaesthetists and geneticists in one of the largest Hospitals in Latvia. The research involved 9 surgeons, 9 anaesthetists and 7 geneticists with chronic pain (for four months or more) in the neck, shoulders, arms, hands and legs. All of them agreed to take part in myotonometric measurements. The main results included NMQ-E inquiry data analysis and proved that all participants most frequently complain of feeling discomfort after work, particularly, fatigue or muscle pain in the neck, shoulders, arms, hands and legs. Myotonometric measurement results show that geneticists’ muscle tone at the end of the working week has increased in the shoulder region muscles and slightly in wrist/hands muscles (m. extensor digitorum; m. flexor carpi radialis). Muscle tone of the surgeons increased in wrist, hand and shoulder region, as well as in legs at the end of the working week: m. flexor carpi radialis; m. tibialis anterior; m. gastrocnemius (<b>caput</b> <b>mediale),</b> but anaesthetists’ muscle tone increased in shoulder region and in legs. Hence research participants (surgeons, anaesthetists, geneticists) are subjected to long and intensive work in compulsory work positions, which has impact on fatigue of various muscle groups...|$|R
40|$|Skeletal {{muscle mass}} loss has a broad impact on body {{performance}} and physical activity. Muscle wasting occurs due to genetic mutation as in muscular dystrophy, age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia) {{as well as}} in chronic wasting disorders as in cancer cachexia. Food restriction reduces muscle mass underpinned by increased muscle protein break down. However the influence of dietary restriction on the morphometry and phenotype of forelimb muscles in a genetically modified myostatin null mice are not fully characterized. The effect of a five week dietary limitation on five anatomically and structurally different forelimb muscles was examined. C 57 /BL 6 wild type (Mstn+/+) and myostatin null (Mstn-/-) mice were either given a standard rodent normal daily diet ad libitum (ND) or 60 % food restriction (FR) for a 5 week period. M. triceps brachii Caput laterale (T. lateral), M. triceps brachii Caput longum (T. long), M. triceps brachii <b>Caput</b> <b>mediale</b> (T. medial), M. extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) and M. flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) were dissected, weighted and processed for immunohistochemistry. Muscle mass, fibers cross sectional areas (CSA) and myosin heavy chain types IIB, IIX, IIA and type I were analyzed. We provide evidence that caloric restriction results in muscle specific weight reduction with the fast myofibers being more prone to atrophy. We show that slow fibers are less liable to dietary restriction induced muscle atrophy. The effect of dietary restriction was more pronounced in Mstn-/- muscles to implicate the oxidative fibers compared to Mstn+/+. Furthermore, peripherally located myofibers are more susceptible to dietary induced reduction compared to deep fibers. We additionally report that dietary restriction alters the glycolytic phenotype of the Mstn-/- into the oxidative form in a muscle dependent manner...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to characterize two pig ancient autochthonous genetic types (AAGT) [Casertana (CT) and Calabrese (CA) ] at H-FABP (Heart- Fatty Acid Binding Protein) loci {{as well as to}} evaluate the associations of qualitative and quantitative meat traits. H-FABP is a candidate DNA segment coding protein (gene) for intramuscular fat depot (IMF). The identification of haplotypes suitable for IMF may represent a valid tool for molecular assisted selection (MAS) to improve meat qualitative traits functional to human well being and welfare. Genotyping was performed on 150 pigs (100 CT and 50 CA) reared at ConSDABI Experimental Farm by PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction – Restriction Fragment Lenght Polymorphism) method. Three diallelic point mutations were investigated: one located in a 700 bp sequence in the 5 ’upstream region (HinfI restriction site) and two in a 850 bp sequence, about 300 bp apart, located in intron 2 (HaeIII and MspI restriction sites, respectively) of the H-FABP DNA segment; in total, these mutations map in a region of about 7. 000 bp and may define a three locus haplotype. Some qualitative characteristics (colour and rheological traits) were detected on Psoas Major, Longissimus dorsi, Caput longum <b>tricipitis</b> <b>brachii</b> and Supraspinatus muscles of 59 CT and 50 CA. Experimental data were analyzed using carcass weight as covariate (SAS package) and the significance of comparisons between the estimated mean values was tested by Student’s t test. 27 possible haplotypes taking into account the diallelic polymorphism of each locus were calculated. The results, in the limits of the observation field, showed some haplotypes ‘AAGT- exclusive’ [3 in Casertana (HHDdAA; HHDDAa; HHddaa) and 2 in Calabrese (hhddAA; hhddaa) ] and a different incidence of the common haplotypes: in CT the most frequent was HHddAa (38 %) while in CA was HhddAa (22 %). The relation between genetic structure of H-FABP loci and quanti-qualitative characteristics of meat evidenced the association between H-FABP loci and fatty traits. CA carriers of HhddAa haplotype evidenced a significant higher backfat weight (19. 11 kg) in comparison with carriers of HHddaa haplotype which showed the lower fatness (6. 35 kg); furthermore, the former haplotype also affected the fatness in other cuts (jowl and belly). Animals with the hhddAA haplotype evidenced a higher thickness of backfat at shoulder level (79. 41 mm), while HhddAa showed the lowest value in the Calabrese AAGT. A different chromatic behavior of meat was observed in relation to both muscle type and haplotype. In Casertana, meat of HHDdAA carriers was lighter as consequence of the highest lightness value (43. 44; P< 0. 05) while in Calabrese the HHDdAa haplotype was associated with a higher lightness value (45. 84; P< 0. 05). The statistical analysis did not evidence associations between haplotype and dissection data...|$|R
