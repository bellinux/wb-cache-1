40|$|Abstract In aquatic ecosystems, macrophytes and {{phytoplankton}} are main primary producers, {{in which}} macrophyte {{plays an important}} role in maintaining clear water state, while phytoplankton often dominates in turbid waterbodies. In the present study, the growth and photosynthetic activity of the submerged aquatic plant Ceratophyllum oryzetorum Kom. in different <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> of cyanobacterial bloom are studied. The results show that the plant length and fresh mass of C. oryzetorum are promoted by low cyanobacterial <b>cell</b> <b>densities.</b> Medium and high cyanobacterial <b>cell</b> <b>densities,</b> on the contrary, act as inhibitory.

25|$|Gas vacuoles are membrane-bound, {{spindle-shaped}} vesicles, {{found in}} some planktonic bacteria and Cyanobacteria, that provides buoyancy to these cells by decreasing their overall <b>cell</b> <b>density.</b> Positive buoyancy is {{needed to keep the}} cells in {{the upper reaches of the}} water column, so that they can continue to perform photosynthesis. They are made up of a shell of protein that has a highly hydrophobic inner surface, making it impermeable to water (and stopping water vapour from condensing inside) but permeable to most gases. Because the gas vesicle is a hollow cylinder, it is liable to collapse when the surrounding pressure increases. Natural selection has fine tuned the structure of the gas vesicle to maximise its resistance to buckling, including an external strengthening protein, GvpC, rather like the green thread in a braided hosepipe. There is a simple relationship between the diameter of the gas vesicle and pressure at which it will collapse - the wider the gas vesicle the weaker it becomes. However, wider gas vesicles are more efficient, providing more buoyancy per unit of protein than narrow gas vesicles. Different species produce gas vesicle of different diameter, allowing them to colonise different depths of the water column (fast growing, highly competitive species with wide gas vesicles in the top most layers; slow growing, dark-adapted, species with strong narrow gas vesicles in the deeper layers). The diameter of the gas vesicle will also help determine which species survive in different bodies of water. Deep lakes that experience winter mixing expose the cells to the hydrostatic pressure generated by the full water column. This will select for species with narrower, stronger gas vesicles.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} the digestive activities of the mammalian GI tract are controlled, in part at least, by biologically active compounds released from endocrine cells in the mucosa of the GI tract itself. Despite this, comparatively few studies have been made of the endocrine cells in the GI tract of sheep. There is also a paucity of information about the suitability and reliability of histochemical and immunohistochemical methods for the identification of GI endocrine cells in sheep. The aims of this study were to: (a) establish reliable techniques for identifying endocrine cells in the GI tract of sheep, (b) use these techniques to investigate the effects of age on the distribution and densities of various GI endocrine cells, and (c) investigate possible changes in endocrine <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> due to infection with the helminth parasite Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Initially, various histochemical and immunohistochemical staining techniques were investigated for their suitability for identifying endocrine cells in mucosal samples from reticulum, rumen, body and antral regions of the abomasum, three duodenal sites, ileum, colon and caecum, as well as the pancreas, of adult animals. As a result, the De Grandi technique was selected to estimate argyrophilic <b>cell</b> <b>densities,</b> EC <b>cells</b> were identified by the fast garnet technique, and ECL cells by their silver staining and morphological characteristics. The PAP immunohistochemical technique was used to identify G, S, and A cells, using antisera to gastrin, secretin, and pancreatic glucagon, respectively. No endocrine cells of any type were found in the reticulum or rumen. Argyrophilic <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> were greatest in the abomasal body and proximal duodenum, then decreased distally. EC <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> were highest in the duodenum, although, like argyrophilic cells, they were found throughout the abomasum and intestines. In contrast, ECL cells were confined to the abomasal body. Greatest <b>densities</b> of G <b>cells</b> occurred in the abomasal antrum and proximal duodenum; they were absent from the abomasal body, ileum and large intestine. S cells were confined in their distribution to the small intestine. Pancreatic islets of Langerhans contained A cells, as well as cells with slight argyrophilia; the identity of the latter cells was not determined. A cells were also found in exocrine acini, but these were the only cells in the exocrine portion of the pancreas that were stained by any of the histochemical or immunohistochemical techniques used. No A cells were identified in the mucosa of the GI tract. These studies also clearly established that ovine G cells are not argyrophilic. This finding is in contrast to those reported for most mammalian species with a simpler form of stomach. The effects of age on endocrine <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> were studied using the tissues from 100 - 110 day old foetuses, 2 week and 24 week old lambs, and adult sheep. All endocrine cell types identified in adult sheep were also present at the other ages. However, in the foetuses, endocrine <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> were lower than in other age groups. The most notable age-related trend was that antral G <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> increased with increasing age. In contrast, from 2 weeks of age, there was a decrease in intestinal G <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> with increasing age. It was also clear that D <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> were much higher in 2 week old lambs than for any other age group. Possible explanations for these age-related changes in endocrine <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> are discussed. D (somatostatin containing) cells were located throughout the abomasum and intestines of all nonadult animals and in pancreatic islets of 2 and 24 week old lambs. The effects on endocrine <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> of an experimental infection with 40, 000 T. colubriformis larvae was investigated in 40 week old lambs. Although the resultant infestation was mild, there was a significant (P< 0. 001) increase in argyrophilic <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> in the proximal small intestine. Specific identification of the argyrophilic cell type(s) which had increased was not possible, however, the most likely candidates were D 1, X and K cells. It was concluded from these studies that endocrine cells, similar in morphology and staining characteristics to those of other mammalian species, occur within the mucosa of the abomasum, small and large intestine of sheep. Greatest <b>densities</b> of endocrine <b>cells</b> occur in the abomasum and proximal duodenum. Cell types identified in the GI tract included EC, ECL, G, S and D cells, while D and A cells were identified in pancreatic islets.

At low <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> neither strain was capable of measurable growth on casein in liquid media, and we have calculated that the average concentration of hydrolyzed casein in the medium was indeed too low to support growth. At low <b>cell</b> <b>densities,</b> growth on hydrolyzed casein (Casitone) was normal and independent of cell concentration. Demonstration of cooperative growth at higher <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> supports the suggestion that the communal behavior of myxobacteria results in more efficient feeding...|$|R
40|$|Human Fas ligand (hFasL) is of {{considerable}} interest {{since it is}} a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that induces programmed cell death, or apoptosis. In this study Dictyostelium discoideum was used to produce a soluble form of the human Fas ligand. The recombinant cells were adapted to a modified synthetic FM medium, called SIH medium. Cells adapted to the SIH medium reached about 2 times higher <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> and hFasL concentrations on this medium compared with cells growing on the standard complex medium HL- 5 C. Even higher values were achieved by a dissolved oxygen-controlled fed-batch cultivation in a conventional stirred bioreactor on SIH medium. <b>Cell</b> <b>densities</b> of up to 5. 5 × 10 ^ 7 ml− 1 and a maximum hFasL concentration of 148 µg l− 1 were obtained. These results were further improved by means of continuous cultivation of D. discoideum in a bioreactor equipped with cell retention by microfiltration. At low space velocity very high <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> of up to 2. 4 × 10 ^ 8 ml− 1 and hFasL concentrations of up to 205 µg l− 1 were achieved. ...|$|R
