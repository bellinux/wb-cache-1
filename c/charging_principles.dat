40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, many discussions have centred around the issue of {{interconnection}} rates and their economic impact on the market. Interconnection charging in Europe is still based mainly on the calling party pays (CPP) principle combined with element based charging (EBC). Due to the convergence of the classical PSTN/ISDN and the IP world to next generation networks (NGN), the different <b>charging</b> <b>principles</b> and systems are being reviewed to determine the optimal solution for the future. In its working program for the year 2008, the Austrian Regulatory Authority (RTR) launched an industry working group on <b>charging</b> <b>principles</b> and systems for wholesale services. This paper highlights some of the central issues of the discussions {{that have taken place}} and contains the authors’ views and conclusions. 1 Further, the paper identifies possible charging systems, as well as economic assessment criteria for these systems and how the different charging systems may be evaluated with respect to those criteria. Regarding the usefulness of industry working groups, the work has shown that these lead to a higher degree of transparency between regulator and market players as well as a better understanding between the market players themselves. The main drawback is that working groups are time consuming and that {{it is almost impossible to}} agree on meaningful outcomes. Regarding the assessment of the charging models it was possible to derive a set of 10 criteria according to which charging systems can be evaluated. There was a rather broad consensus on the delineation of charging models as well as the economic criteria. When it comes to the results of the evaluation, the discussions brought forward very controversial views amongst the participants. No common views could be achieved on which the charging model fulfills the defined criteria in the best manner. Interconnection, NGN, <b>charging</b> <b>principles,</b> CPP, Bill&Keep. ...|$|E

40|$|Classically, silver (Ag) halides {{have been}} used to {{understand}} thermodynamic principles of the charging process and the corresponding development of the electrical double layer (EDL). A mechanistic approach to the processes on the molecular level has not yet been carried out using advanced surface complexation modeling (SCM) as applied to metal (hydr) oxide interfaces. Ag halides and metal (hydr) oxides behave quite differently in some respect. The location of charge in the interface of Ag halides is not a priori obvious. For AgI(s), SCM indicates the separation of interfacial charge in which the smaller silver ions are apparently farther away from the surface than iodide. This charge separation can be understood from the surface structure of the relevant crystal faces. Charge separation with positive charge above the surface is due to monodentate surface complex formation of Ag+ ions binding to I sites located at the surface. Negative surface charge is due to the desorption of Ag+ ions out of the lattice. These processes can be described with the charge distribution (CD) model. The MO/DFT optimized geometry of the complex is used to estimate the value of the CD. SCM reveals the EDL structure of AgI(s), having two Stern layers in series. The inner Stern layer has a very low capacitance (C- 1 = 0. 15 +/- 0. 01 F/m(2)) in comparison to that of metal (hydr) oxides, and this {{can be attributed to the}} strong orientation of the (primary) water molecules on the local electrostatic field of the Ag+ and I- ions of the surface (relative dielectric constant epsilon(r) approximate to 6). Depending on the extent of water ordering, mineral surfaces may in principle develop a second Stern layer. The corresponding capacitance (C- 2) will depend on the degree of water ordering that may decrease in the series AgI (C- 2 = 0. 57 F/m(2)), goethite (C- 2 = 0. 74 F/m(2)), and rutile (C- 2 = infinity), as discussed.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 32 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 8 - 11 July 2013 "Transport and Sustainable Infrastructure", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Long term sustainable transport, including infrastructure costs and recovery, as well as associated externalities, has become an increasing concern in recent years due to social and environmental issues. This paper considers infrastructure provision costs and {{the significance of the}} so-called ‘hidden costs’ which can benefit one transport mode at the expense of another and lead to inefficient transport pricing. It is important to consider the cost and value of each transport mode in terms of long-term sustainability, energy efficiency and environmental issues. Finally, consideration must be given to service quality to the user – whether in the private or in the commercial world. Many of the costs of providing freight and passenger road and rail transport services have been externalised in the past and passed on to the public in general – including non-users of transport. This should be seen as a de-facto form of cross-subsidisation which can lead to decisions being made for infrastructure investments which may seem appropriate in the immediate short term, but which may have negative effects in the long term. Infrastructure costs include the cost of providing railways and the public transport infrastructure of roads, both rural and urban, as well as the ways of redeeming these costs from users. Fair infrastructure <b>charging</b> <b>principles</b> must be applied which consider the following points: · The capital cost the rail system, as well as road infrastructure development and the overall costs to the economy in general; · The contribution to pavement wear and tear costs by various users, and · Space occupation and other infrastructure facilities for specific users. In addition, transport cost externalities must also be considered and they include: · Accident costs; · Congestion costs; · Exhaust emission and pollution costs including Greenhouse and carbon issues; · Noise costs; · Traffic policing costs, and · Energy efficiency and resource consumption. Consideration is given to these issues and their relevance to South African conditions in this study. Background details relating to earlier studies which have appeared are included since many are not well known. Extracts from these reports support many of the conclusions drawn in this paper. It {{is important to note that}} quantification of some external costs has been difficult and controversial in the past but more sophisticated scientific evaluation is advancing such work at a rapid rate. It is also important to appreciate the fact that internalising some of these costs may not be considered ‘politically correct’ or justifiable but it is important to be aware of the consequences of these costs – broadly and across society in general.

40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with research for the analysis and modeling of interconnection costs in telecommunications based on {{a case study of}} Tanzania. The research formed the basis for recommending the review of the current interconnection charges. Chapter 1 of the thesis started to introduce the United States of America's (USA) Reform Act of 1996,which was the first Act in the world that liberalised the telecommunications markets and opened them up to competition in the USA. The competition brought up interconnection of telecommunications networks and associated costs, which is the focus of the research. Chapter 2 provided for the design and architecture of the interconnection of telecommunications networks m the liberalized and competitive telecommunications markets in terms of types of interconnection models, interconnection components, types of services, interconnection costs and call route types and factors. In chapter 3 the thesis presented the telecommunications development in Tanzania from 1888 to date covering the period of the monopoly era where there was no interconnection of the telecommunications networks and the post-monopoly era where there is interconnection of the telecommunications networks. The chapter also presented the growth of the mobile networks over time in terms of number of mobile phones and mobile density. Chapter 4 discussed <b>charging</b> <b>principles,</b> call routing and operations of the international roaming and non-international roaming services referred to as the One Network concept, which was launched simultaneously in East Africa (Tanzania, Kenyaand Uganda) by the Zain GSM mobile network operator {{for the first time in}} the world on 26 th September, 2006. Review of the existing generic interconnection cost models developed by the British Telecommunications Company Limited and Europe Economics' Consulting Firm was presented in Chapter 5. The review formed the basis for collecting data from Tanzania. Chapter 6 presented the analysis of the data collected from Tanzania. The analysis revealed that the interconnection costs per minute for the five competitive telecommunications network operators for 2007 - 2009 were far below the interconnection charges per minute set by the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority for the same period. Chapter 7 concluded that the interconnection charges per minute for the telecommunications industry in Tanzania for 2007 - 2009 have been set over and above the interconnection costs per minute obtained from the analysis of the collected data. The research reviewed the existing generic interconnection cost models mentioned above and identified the interconnection cost estimation methods. The research then collected audited operators' accounts and traffic throughput in minutes from the five competitive telecommunications network operators in Tanzania for 2007 - 2009. It analysed the data and gave results, which showed a big percentage difference of an average of at least 300 % between the interconnection costs obtained from the analysis of the collected data and the interconnection charges set by the Regulator. The research results have justified insufficient interconnection regulations currently used by the Regulator in Tanzania. Hence, the need for the objective and accurate interconnection cost estimation methodology for setting up the cost based interconnection charges have been confirmed by this research.

40|$|We analyse {{the reform}} {{process in the}} German railway sector. We {{take a look at}} the process and the outcome of the reform and compare it with the {{theoretical}} findings. The regionalisation of the regional rail passenger services is of a special importance to us. We scrutinise the contracts for the provision of these services and try to find interrelations between the different contract elements. A further emphasis is placed on the influence of the European Commission on the reform process. We analyse the European Commissions policy on railway infrastructure charges and the <b>charging</b> <b>principles</b> to be found in the member states. In the following we summarise the contents of the three subsequent chapters. In chapter 2, we analyse the rail reform process that started in the year 1994. Our focus is set on the long-distance passenger transport and the freight transport, while the regional rail passenger transport is left to chapter 3. We identify the main stakeholders and their interests. The negotiations between the politicians and the managers of the railway company in the reform process are analysed using a bargaining model. Assuming opportunistic behaviour of politicians, we explain some issues of the railway reform in Germany. We adapt a model which was developed by Shleifer & Vishny in 1994. Public firms are seen as a vehicle for the government to win elections. State-owned enterprises produce benefits for the politicians in the form of excess employment or other output. If the government chooses to cut its control over the firm, there is still the possibility to influence the firm by subsidies. We present some evidence that the model’s prediction were realised with the corporatisation in 1994. It can be acknowledged as far as the employment is concerned, as it rapidly decreased after 1994. In long-distance passenger transport and in freight transport, restructuring processes were pursued. The performance in both segments decreased after 1994, at least in terms of market shares. There is also evidence that infrastructure was closed down after the commercialisation. However, the effect of the commercialisation on the infrastructure is not as eminent as for the employment or the transport services, as a total closing down of rail infrastructure has to be approved by the authorities. Another question is whether the commercialisation of the DB AG led to an increase in subsidies, as predicted by the model. We find that the model’s predictions are ambiguous if there is a simultaneous increase in the political costs of subsidies, which is quite likely to have happened. As a part of the reform of the German rail sector, the organisation of the local and regional rail services was changed in 1996. The intention was to create a more transparent procurement of the transport services. In chapter 3, we describe the institutional framework and the market structure. Our special focus is on the design of the contracts between the public authorities and the railway undertakings. These contracts are analysed using a unique data base. They exhibit a remarkable heterogeneity not only in terms of duration and network size but also concerning the degree of service specification and risk allocation. We try to establish interrelations between some design features of the contracts. In a first regression, we find that the contract duration is dependent on the annual train kilometres, the time span between the publishing of the tender and the start of the services, and the provision of public instruments to mitigate the risk from rolling stock investment. For a second estimation, we create a measure for the completeness of the service contracts. We find that the completeness is determined by the time span between the publishing of the tender and the start of the services, the provision of demand information, and the obligation to become a member of the regional public transport association. The rail infrastructure of each of the European Union’s member states is used by different rail undertakings. The allocation of this infrastructure capacity is done using charging systems. The European Commission has strived to open the railway markets since the beginning of the 1990 s by influencing the price regulation. The core element of the “First Railway Package” was a directive to shape the charging systems across the member states. In chapter 4, we identify standard pricing principles do be used for rail infrastructure. The economic aims of the pricing principles are contrasted with the content of the above mentioned directive. Scrutinizing the charging systems of different member states it is found that there is a broad variety in terms of the level of charges and their structure. We use the theoretical and empirical findings to formulate recommendations to enhance the rail infrastructure charging systems...|$|E

Equally, they can increase network investment through inappropriate siting, potentially leading to expensive network upgrading and expansion. This cost/benefit of embedded generator is not reflected {{by any of the}} existing distribution network charging model. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a long-run marginal cost pricing (LRMC) model for distribution network that can price both real and reactive power and reflect the long-term cost/benefit to a network from a network user. The developed model is adopted from Investment Cost Related Pricing (ICRP) that is used by the UK's transmission network operator, reflecting the marginal cost to a network from a nodal generation/ demand increment. The ICRP model for the UK's transmission networks only prices real power as it is based on DC power flow. In this paper, the paper extended the ICRP <b>charging</b> <b>principle</b> to pricing reactive power. The economic efficiency of the proposed charging model is demonstrated on a subset of a practical distribution system and validated through the comparison with the two charging models: 1) current yardstick distribution charging model; 2) ICRP model based on the DC power flow. This paper results from work undertaken in a project on distribution charging methodologies for Western Power Distribution (WPD). The views in the paper expressed are not those of WPD...|$|R
