25|$|Before the 1880s {{mortality}} rates in lying-hospitals would reach unacceptably high levels {{and became an}} area of public concern. Much of these maternal deaths were due to Puerperal fever, at the time commonly known as <b>childbed</b> <b>fever.</b> In the 1800s Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis noticed that women giving birth at home had a much lower incidence of <b>childbed</b> <b>fever</b> than those giving birth by physicians in lying-hospitals. His investigation discovered that washing hands with an antiseptic solution before a delivery reduced <b>childbed</b> <b>fever</b> fatalities by 90%. So {{it was concluded that}} it was physicians who had been spreading disease from one labouring mother to the next. Despite the publication of this information, doctors still would not wash. It was not until the 20th century when advancements in aseptic technique and the understanding of disease would {{play a significant role in}} the decrease of maternal {{mortality rates}} among many populations.|$|E
25|$|On 20 May 1851, Semmelweis {{took the}} {{relatively}} insignificant, unpaid, honorary head-physician {{position of the}} obstetric ward of Pest's small Szent Rókus Hospital. He held that position for six years, until June 1857. <b>Childbed</b> <b>fever</b> was rampant at the clinic; at a visit in 1850, just after returning to Pest, Semmelweis found one fresh corpse, another patient in severe agony, and four others seriously ill with the disease. After taking over in 1851, Semmelweis virtually eliminated the disease. During 1851–1855, only eight patients died from <b>childbed</b> <b>fever</b> out of 933 births (0.85%).|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1861, Semmelweis {{suffered}} from various nervous complaints. He {{suffered from}} severe depression and became absentminded. Paintings from 1857 to 1864 show a progression of aging. He turned every conversation {{to the topic}} of <b>childbed</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E

50|$|In May 1590, in {{the urgency}} of an {{outbreak}} of <b>child</b> <b>fever,</b> a hospital {{was established in the}} Fédons. The latter was used for only three to four months, and was forgotten until discovered by the preliminary works for the LGV Méditerranée during spring 1996.|$|R
2500|$|Medications {{that lower}} fevers are called {{antipyretic}}s. [...] The antipyretic ibuprofen {{is effective in}} reducing <b>fevers</b> in <b>children.</b> [...] It {{is more effective than}} acetaminophen (paracetamol) in children. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen may be safely used together in <b>children</b> with <b>fevers.</b> [...] The efficacy of acetaminophen by itself in <b>children</b> with <b>fevers</b> has been questioned. [...] Ibuprofen is also superior to aspirin in <b>children</b> with <b>fevers.</b> Additionally, aspirin is not recommended in children and young adults (those under the age of 16 or 19 depending on the country) due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.|$|R
25|$|A few <b>childbed</b> <b>fever</b> case stories, {{described}} below, did not {{fit well}} into Semmelweis's theory and led him to expand it, also to comprise other types of decaying organic matter, for instance secretions from an infected knee or from a cancer tumor.|$|E
25|$|In fact, Semmelweis was {{warning against}} all {{decaying}} organic matter, not just against a specific contagion that originated from victims of <b>childbed</b> <b>fever</b> themselves. This misunderstanding, {{and others like}} it, occurred partly because Semmelweis's work was known only through secondhand reports written by his colleagues and students. At this crucial stage, Semmelweis himself had published nothing. These and similar misinterpretations would continue to cloud discussions of his work throughout the century.|$|E
25|$|As {{accounts}} of the dramatic reduction in mortality rates in Vienna were being circulated throughout Europe, Semmelweis had reason to expect that the chlorine washings would be widely adopted, saving {{tens of thousands of}} lives. Early responses to his work also gave clear signs of coming trouble, however. Some physicians had clearly misinterpreted his claims. James Young Simpson, for instance, saw no difference between Semmelweis's groundbreaking findings and the British idea suggested by Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1843 that <b>childbed</b> <b>fever</b> was contagious (i.e. that infected persons could pass the infection to others). Indeed, initial responses to Semmelweis's findings were that he had said nothing new.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{resistance}} DeLee faced from his colleagues over his standardized, invasive approach to delivery, forceps {{began to appear}} in routine obstetric practice in the 1930s. Social forces increased DeLee's influence and accelerated the use of mechanical interventions in childbirth. As childbirth was still beset with problems such as <b>childbed</b> <b>fever,</b> physicians were asserting their superiority over non-physician birth attendants, and mechanical interventions in obstetrics set their profession apart from midwivery. In an age of increasing reliance on technology, urban women were increasingly likely to choose a hospital birth attended by a physician rather than a traditional home birth with a midwife.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous {{application}} of Labarraque's chlorine and chemical base solutions was in 1847, when Ignaz Semmelweis used chlorine-water (chlorine dissolved in pure water, which was cheaper chlorinated lime solutions) to disinfect the hands of Austrian doctors, which Semmelweis noticed still carried the stench of decomposition from the dissection rooms to the patient examination rooms. Long before the germ theory of disease, Semmelweis theorized that [...] "cadaveric particles" [...] were transmitting decay from fresh medical cadavers to living patients, and he used the well-known [...] "Labarraque's solutions" [...] as the only known method to remove the smell of decay and tissue decomposition (which he found that soap did not). The solutions proved {{to be far more}} effective antiseptics than soap (Semmelweis was also aware of their greater efficacy, but not the reason), and this resulted in Semmelweis's celebrated success in stopping the transmission of <b>childbed</b> <b>fever</b> ("puerperal fever") in the maternity wards of Vienna General Hospital in Austria in 1847.|$|E
500|$|On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft {{gave birth}} to her second daughter, Mary.

After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September. Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft, [...] "I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again." [...] She was buried at Old Saint Pancras Churchyard, where her tombstone reads, [...] "Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: Born 27 April 1759: Died 10 September 1797." [...] (In 1851, her remains were moved by her grandson Percy Florence Shelley to his family tomb in St Peter's Church, Bournemouth.) Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north-east of the church just north of Sir John Soane's grave.

2500|$|Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis {{discovered}} in 1847 that hand-washing {{with a solution}} of chlorinated lime reduced the incidence of fatal <b>childbed</b> <b>fever</b> tenfold in maternity institutions.

2500|$|Semmelweis's key {{claim was}} that {{physicians}} contaminated their hands with [...] "cadaveric particles" [...] {{in the morgue}} while conducting autopsies. [...] He pointed out that ordinary washings with soap did not remove these particles, because the hands could retain a stench for several days in spite of such washings. [...] When physicians later carried out gynaecological examinations, the cadaveric particles were absorbed by the patient, in particular if they {{came into contact with}} the freshly exposed uterus, or with genital tract lesions caused by the birth process. [...] Semmelweis was convinced that every case of <b>childbed</b> <b>fever</b> was caused by resorption of cadaveric particles. [...] With this etiology, Semmelweis identified <b>childbed</b> <b>fever</b> as purely an iatrogenic diseasethat is, one caused by doctors.

2500|$|In October 1847, {{a patient}} was {{admitted}} with discharging medullary carcinoma [...] of the uterus. She was assigned the bed {{at which the}} rounds were always initiated.

40|$|Background: Fever {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons for parents to seek medical {{attention}} for their child. Parents are commonly very concerned about their <b>child’s</b> <b>fever</b> and sometimes this overconcern can almost reach the level of a phobia. This is due to a widely accepted belief that fever is a disease on its own. Many parents believe that fever can cause different harmful effects to a child. The aim of this study was to determine how much Slovenian parents know about fever, whether they have any fears and anxieties when their <b>child</b> has experienced <b>fever</b> and to determine how they treat febrile children at home. Our main hypothesis was that in Slovenia there is a parental overconcern over <b>fever</b> in <b>children.</b> Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 24 questions was administered to parents who brought their child to a routine visit in two pediatric dispensaries. During October 2003 and January 2004 we managed to obtain 76 filled-out questionnaires. Results: 14 % of parents said they were very worried and an additional 72 % were somewhat worried about potential consequences of fever. 49 % believe fever can cause brain damage and 18 % believe this can be caused by temperatures below 41 °C. 8 % of parents overdose paracetamol, 33 % use an incorrect technique of sponging and 38 % awaken their child at night. Conclusions: In Slovenia there also exists a fever phobia. Slovenian parents are undereducated about the meaning, causes end effects of fever and they often deal with their <b>child’s</b> <b>fever</b> overwhelmingly and improperly. </p...|$|R
