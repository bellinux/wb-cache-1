5000|$|... "The {{aircraft}} descended continuously at {{a steady}} rate {{over a period of}} 13½ minutes and the pointers would have been in continuous motion throughout, increasing the likelihood of misreading. The <b>cross</b> <b>hatching</b> in this type of altimeter first appears in a window in the 10,000ft disc at an indicated altitude of 26,666ft and the edge of the <b>cross</b> <b>hatching</b> would have been visible within 2 minutes of the aircraft beginning its descent. At 10,000ft the <b>cross</b> <b>hatching</b> completely fills the window and it remains filled as long as the aircraft is below 10,000ft. Thus the <b>cross</b> <b>hatching</b> would have been visible to the crew for a period of about 9½ minutes before the aircraft passed through FL60 and {{it is a matter of}} conjecture whether it was still an effective warning to them at that stage of the descent."With this type of altimeter it is not difficult to read an indication of 6,000ft as 16,000ft if particular note is not made of the position of the 10,000ft pointer.

50|$|The {{base of a}} {{reciprocating}} {{internal combustion}} engine is the engine block, which is typically made of cast iron or aluminium. The engine block contains the cylinders. In engines {{with more than one}} cylinder they are usually arranged either in 1 row (straight engine) or 2 rows (boxer engine or V engine); 3 rows are occasionally used (W engine) in contemporary engines, and other engine configurations are possible and have been used. Single cylinder engines are common for motorcycles and in small engines of machinery. Water-cooled engines contain passages in the engine block where cooling fluid circulates (the water jacket). Some small engines are air-cooled, and instead of having a water jacket the cylinder block has fins protruding away from it to cool by directly transferring heat to the air. The cylinder walls are usually finished by honing to obtain a <b>cross</b> <b>hatch,</b> which is better able to retain the oil. A too rough surface would quickly harm the engine by excessive wear on the piston.|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Dammar is {{a natural}} resin that used anciently in varnish production. The use of dammar natural resin in coating is limited by {{undesirable}} properties for application in coating where it is considered very brittle. Due to dammar's brittle nature, an aged dammar coating can be easily scratched or abraded. Approach: Dammar natural resin could be modified into Silicone-Dammar by using a solvent {{in order to improve}} the coatings mechanical properties. The modified Silicone-Dammar (SD) was coated on aluminum q-panel and adhesion was evaluated using <b>cross</b> <b>hatch</b> test, impact test and pull off test, while the hardness of coating was investigated by nano-indentation test. Results: Results from <b>cross</b> <b>hatch</b> test, impact test and pull off test show that coating material with 15 % wt. of dammar (SD 15) was the optimum composition which exhibits good adhesion of modified Silicone-Dammar to the metal substrate. SD 15 also could be considered as a soft and flexible polymer coating with hardness value of 1. 624 GPa after undergoing the nano-indentation test. Conclusion: A modified Silicone-Dammar coating system with varied compositions of dammar has been prepared and adhesion and hardness have been evaluated. It is found that 15 % wt. of dammar in the coating material (SD 15) exhibits good adhesion to aluminum substrate and soft and flexible in nature...|$|E

30|$|The {{next two}} higher-energy PL peaks at 1.344 and 1.377 eV {{originate}} from the WL and the CHP, respectively. The highest-energy PL peak at 1.42 eV {{is the second}} WL formed in the denuded zones between the <b>cross</b> <b>hatches.</b> The second WL {{is different from the}} first WL that gives rise to the 1.344 -eV PL peak. The first WL is the WL between the over-critical InAs 3 D dots and the underlying InGaAs CHP layer which exists only above the MDs. The second WL is the thin InAs 2 D film between the InGaAs CHP layer and the overlying GaAs capping layer which exists only in the denuded zones between the <b>cross</b> <b>hatches.</b> This peak is absent in sample C because there are no denuded zones: the critical thickness for QD formation has been reached across the surface, including the areas between the <b>cross</b> <b>hatches.</b> The presence of two WLs is thus unique to sample D, but we believe that it is a general phenomenon for all Stranski-Krastanow QDs grown on cross-hatch patterns. Their existence which has not been identified until now possibly explains the more complex carrier dynamics than those exhibited in conventional QDs [32, 33]. Sample D is subject to ex situ annealing, and the results are reported in the last subsection.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the influence of curcumin dye natural colorant on adhesion, mechanical, thermal and electrochemical properties of blend poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) - acrylic polyol. Design/methodology/approach - Extracted curcumin yellow dye colorant from Curcuma Demostica was mixed with PMMA-acrylic polyol blended polymer in the volume ratios of 9 : 1, 8 : 2 and 7 : 3. The mixtures were applied on pre-treated cold-roll mild steel panels. All of the paint coating samples were subjected to potential time measurement (PTM), rapid impact deformation, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), <b>cross</b> <b>hatch</b> and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) tests. Findings - The addition of curcumin dye colorant was able to improve the adhesion, flexibilities and resistance against electrolytes penetration of the blended poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) - acrylic polyol polymer paint system. <b>Cross</b> <b>hatch</b> test studies showed that high amount of curcumin dye colorant (AP 30 paint system) had the lowest peel-off coating area from the substrate. The FTIR test had confirmed the high concentration of hydroxyl group in the AP 30 sample. The hydroxyl group was able to promote hydrogen bonding between coating substrate interface. The AP 30 sample had the highest coating flexibilities when tested with rapid impact test. This {{was due to the}} lowest glass transition value T-g which indicated lowest cross linking density in the coating molecules structure. In the PTM test, AP 30 paint system had shown the highest rate electrolytes penetration within the AP sample. Research limitations/implications - The composition of curcumin dye colorant in the polymer blend is limited from 10 percent to 30 percent pigment volume concentration. Increasing the amount of lawsone pigment will result inhomogeneous mixtures. Originality/value - The AP paint system is suitable for interior applications. This paint system has to be mixed with suitable additive materials to improve its performance for exterior purpose...|$|E

40|$|The {{cylinder}} liner surface texture, widely {{generated by the}} honing technique, contributes a lot on engine functional performances (friction, oil consumption, running-in, wear etc.). In order to improve these functional performances, different honing processes are being developed. These different honing processes generate surfaces with various texture features characteristics (roughness, valleys depth, valley width, <b>cross</b> <b>hatch</b> angle, etc.). This paper addresses a comparison of ring-pack friction for cylinder texture with different cross-hatch angles and valley sizes. It takes in consideration the mutual effect of valley depth and honing angle. A numerical model is developed to predict friction within the cylinder ring-pack system in mixed lubrication regime and a morphological method is used to characterize groove depth.

Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin (DGEBA) was treated with different stoichiometry variations of polyamidoamine adducts (ARADUR-PA 450) as a curing agent at ambient temperature to fabricate four different formulations of epoxy coatings (DGEBA-PA 450). The cured epoxy coatings were applied on glass and steel substrates for mechanical and corrosion characterizations, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{by means}} of Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM), X-ray {{diffraction}} analyzer (XRD) and <b>Cross</b> <b>hatch</b> scanning analysis, the Structure and mechanism of cracking and spalling for Super 304 H steel oxide films in high temperature steam were investigated. With the oxidation proceeding, the surface of Super 304 H steel specimens is covered by {{a large amount of}} tiny holes, which causes the occurrence of an outer oxide layer. The Super 304 H oxide film generally has a double-layer structure: the outer layer mainly for iron oxide Fe 3 O 4, also being covered by a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, and the inner layer with the FeCr 2 O 4 spinel phase as primary component. Because of the inhomogeneity of oxide distribution, large amounts of smaller gaps appear in the Super 304 H steel oxide films. Due to the differences among the outer layer, the inner layer and steel matrix in thermal expansion coefficient, when the steam temperature around the specimen changes periodically, the stress variation arise in the Super 304 H steel and oxide films, which causes the cracking and spalling of oxide films...|$|E
