25|$|The 2nd Parachute Brigade {{was warned}} for an {{operation}} in Greece, {{to replace the}} retreating German Army and ensure law and order was maintained until a government could be formed. The 127 PFA plan was for a small detachment of one officer and nine other ranks to be attached {{to each of the}} parachute battalions. A section and a surgical team would accompany brigade headquarters in the first lift and a section would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the second lift. Two jeeps with medical equipment would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the brigade's glider force.|$|E
25|$|Tipper {{made his}} debut on 23 June against Gloucestershire, and his 42 {{in the first}} innings helped avert a crisis; he had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the score on 27/5, but his {{steadying}} knock helped the team to 201. He also took 2/49 in Gloucestershire's own first innings (his first victim being Alfred Dipper), but second time around he was out for 3 and he took no more wickets before the game finished in a draw.|$|E
25|$|The three {{serial killers}} ineptly destroy {{the cake and}} fail {{to make a new}} one. Satan's {{assistant}} Demonius finds a cake the exact size and shape of an Acura TSX as a last-minute substitute. Satan is infuriated that he did not receive the right cake. When Demonius points out that his guests are having fun regardless, Satan flies into a rage. The guests get upset and start to leave, and Satan realizes that, in trying to have a party like the girls on My Super Sweet 16, he became like one of them. He tells the crowd that he is sorry and invites everyone into the party, including the Catholic priests. Having arrived in Los Angeles, Butters uses a make-up mirror to summon Biggie Smalls to the party, who asks Butters to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> him as thanks.|$|E

25|$|By 1810, {{the city}} of Oaxaca had 18,000 inhabitants, most of whom where mestizos or mixed indigenous/European. During the Mexican War of Independence the {{government}} of this area remained loyal to the Spanish Crown. When representatives of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla came to meet with them, they were hanged and their heads left out in view. Some early rebel groups emerged in the state, such as those led by Felipe Tinoco and Catarino Palacios, {{but they were also}} eventually executed. After 1812, insurgents began to have some success in the state, especially in the areas around Huajuapan de León, where Valerio Trujano defended the city against royalist forces until José María Morelos y Pavón was able to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> support to keep the area in rebel hands. After that point, insurgents had greater success {{in various parts of the}} state, but the capital remained in royalist hands until the end of the war.|$|E
500|$|In Nashville, Swift {{worked with}} {{experienced}} Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers. She eventually formed a lasting {{working relationship with}} Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought that the sessions were [...] "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write {{about what happened in}} school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the most incredible hooks". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: [...] "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through".|$|E
500|$|King is {{credited}} {{as one of}} the first bowlers to utilise swing bowling deliberately. Other bowlers in his time could sometimes get the ball to swing, but King w{{as one of the}} first to do so at will with an old or new ball. He made use of a lethal delivery which he called the [...] "angler", a product of his experience as a baseball pitcher, to confuse the English batsmen. He would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the ball clasped above his head in both hands as would a baseball pitcher. He was famous for his late swing—in and out—and would produce the in-swinger with his right hand coming down from a point over his left shoulder. He described it as an in-swinger which, if properly bowled, would change direction sharply in the last 10 or [...] of flight. King used this ball only sparingly and only against good batsmen. After a tour to Philadelphia by an Australian side in 1896, George Giffen said [...] "the Philadelphians really have some high-class players, but it was the fact of their bowlers playing us with baseball curves that upset our batsmen." ...|$|E

500|$|Inside Soap held a poll to {{see which}} of the new Moon family members, Eddie, Tyler or Anthony, its readers were most looking forward to seeing. Anthony came last with 12% of the vote. During an Inside Soap feature on the Moon {{brothers}} vs the Mitchell brothers, Kate Woodward said [...] "Two sexy brothers to shake up Albert Square? That sounds familiar! But are Anthony and Tyler really the new Grant and Phil Mitchell?" [...] Lapinskas commented on this, saying [...] "It's {{a lot of pressure}} to put us both under, but what a duo to be compared to!... Phil and Grant were in the show together for at least 10years, and they were fantastic– so to be linked to them is phenomenal. It really is a lot to live up to, but Tony and I are hoping to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> out own energy and bring something completely new to EastEnders. Rachel Tarley from the Metro said [...] "it's nice to have a bit of fresh blood in the soap, especially since the appearance of another one of his siblings always seems to leave Michael a little more demented than he was before. Lapinskas revealed to the Daily Mirror that because of his role in EastEnders, he is recognised in public, calling the experience [...] "surreal". Cecile Metcalf of the Daily Mail branded Anthony [...] "the loveable rogue of the square, with a cheeky answer for everything".|$|E
500|$|The album's earlier {{sessions}} {{produced a}} little material {{that has made}} the final cut. West had brought a majority of his usual production crew onto the project, the same crew that had assisted in the creation of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. One of the main exceptions was producer No I.D., who felt that the two artists weren't pushing forward enough with the music. In an interview with Complex, No I.D. commented about the project that [...] "you're going to sell, because you're already big. But you guys are important to push this forward. Push intelligence and decadence and all of the above forward in a creative manner." [...] While his advice was acknowledged to a degree, he ultimately had very little part in the finished project. In January 2011, they regrouped and rented a block of rooms at the Mercer Hotel in New York City and invited a select group of producers and recording artists. Chauncey [...] "Hit-Boy" [...] Hollis, who produced the track [...] "Niggas in Paris", said of recording at the hotel, [...] "There was music going on in every room. I had a room where I was cranking out beats, and then I'd go into the main room with Jay and [...] and play beats for them. Kanye is really hands-on. I would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> a beat and he'd be like, 'Take this out, slow it down.' It would make it sound 100 times better. Jay would then mumble different flows to the beat".|$|E
500|$|Heffron became Premier, being {{sworn in}} with his cabinet on 23 October 1959 at Government House, Sydney by Governor Sir Eric Woodward. However, his time as Premier was marked by {{significant}} tensions within the Labor Party in NSW and nationally, where although a split involving the Democratic Labor Party had been avoided during Cahill's term, the sectarian and factional undercurrent in the party was very much present in what was increasingly perceived as a tired and divided government. Indeed, the 68-year-old Heffron's government consisted mostly of MPs and Ministers who had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> McKell after the 1941 election. In parliament, Heffron tended to reflect this by leaving most of the speaking roles to his deputy Jack Renshaw and local government and highways minister Pat Hills. It was clear to many that the aged Heffron's best days as a politician were behind him, as future Labor political advisor Richard Hall noted in The Bulletin: [...] "In the House he tends to ramble on, recalling past glories as Minister for Education or Minister for Emergency Services in answer to questions. In an age where clichés cloak most politicians, Heffron throws them out {{as though they were}} devastating retorts, although occasionally the old radical has shown his teeth, flashed into anger, and for a few minutes reminded us that this was the great mob-orator who led many bitter strikes." [...] His old nemesis Jack Lang also took the opportunity to take a last swipe at him, ridiculing Heffron in his newspaper, Century, as [...] "Mr Magoo". On 14 October 1960, Heffron presided over the official opening of Warragamba Dam, the completion of which meant that it became the primary reservoir and the first reliable water supply for the whole Sydney catchment. At the opening, Heffron declared: [...] "We have come along way from the Tank Stream, Sydney's first water supply".|$|E

Hunt spoke out weeks later and stated that the Chiefs were his [...] "No. 1 priority" [...] and that [...] "to have the best chance of success in 2008, having Carl here makes a lot of sense."

2500|$|Discussing the {{influences}} behind the album and performances, Perri listed [...] "love" [...] as the album's major inspiration.

She continued, [...] "Because I write with piano or guitar, I would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> vocals and one instrument and we'd start from the ground up and add things." [...] Additional influences of the album include Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, James Taylor, Elton John, and The Beatles. Perri [...] "mushed it all together in my brain and made Lovestrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then he adds, [...] "Like I said, when I said collaborative, on the {{new record}} we did this all four of us in a room.

So it is a full band collaboration, much more than ever." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the U.N. {{offensive}} {{moved across}} the 38th parallel into North Korea, {{it was found that}} the squadron's pilots often had to fend for themselves since the Mustangs couldn't outrun the communist jets it would encounter. [...] However the Mustang had the advantage of out-turning the MiGs and could fly lower than the jets. [...] Also the MiGs would run out of fuel in a few minutes and turn back while the squadron's Mustangs could return to flying photo-reconnaissance. The squadron had much success with a technique called [...] "Circle 10", whereby the pilots flew a ten-mile radius circle around [...] an area where enemy activity was sighted the night before. The pilots would fly in the next day and note if something was out of place; [...] the pilots of the 45th then would notify F-84 Thunderjet fighter-bomber pilots who would be dispatched to destroy enemy equipment or emplacements. Also the pilots of the 45th would often join in, using the Mustang's ground attack capabilities to shoot up targets of opportunity until the Thunderjets would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> napalm bombs.|$|E
