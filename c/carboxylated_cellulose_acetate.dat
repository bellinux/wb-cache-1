A special field for using <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> is the synthesis of porous, spherical particles, so called cellulose beads. Different types of technical <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> were used and their ability to form such cellulose beads was characterized. First the different types of <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> were characterized by means of solubility; turbidity and degree of substitution. In addition the molar mass and the distribution of substituents along the polymeric chain were analyzed. Next, the cellulose beads were synthesized within an emulsion process using these different <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates.</b> Then the properties (particle size, porosity, morphology) of the cellulose beads were determined.

Acetyl esterases {{have been identified as}} the principal enzymes, initiating <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> degradation as a prerequisite for endoglucanase-catalyzed <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> depolymerisation. Acetyl esterases are provided by nature to deacetylate naturally occurring partly acetylated polysaccharides, i. e. xylan and chitin. Accordingly they are not designed to attack high DS <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate.</b> Under these circumstances acetyl esterases require a pretreatment of <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate,</b> leading to some reduction in DS, in case highly substituted material should be degraded.

40|$|Static {{headspace}} gas chromatographic (SHS-GC) {{analysis was performed}} to determine the release of 13 odorants in hydrocolloid model systems containing original or regio-selectively <b>carboxylated</b> <b>cellulose</b> at different pH values. The release of most odor compounds was decreased in the hydrocolloid solutions compared to control, with the amounts of 2 -propanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, and 2, 3 -butanedione released into the headspace being less than those of any other odor compound in the hydrocolloid model systems. However, there was no considerable difference between original cellulose-containing and carboxylated-cellulose containing systems in the release of most compounds, except for relatively long-chain esters such as ethyl caprylate and ethyl nonanoate. The release from the original and <b>carboxylated</b> <b>cellulose</b> solutions controlled to pH 10 {{was significantly higher than}} that from solutions adjusted to pH 4 and 7 in the case of some esters (ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, butyl propionate, ethyl caproate) and alcohols (2 -propanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol), in particular, ethyl butyrate and 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol. In contrast, the release of 2, 3 -butanedione from both the original and <b>carboxylated</b> <b>cellulose</b> solutions was increased at pH 4 and 7 compared to that at pH 10 by about 70 % and 130 %, respectively.

He also pioneered the influential technique of injection moulding. In 1904, He created and patented the first safety film with Becker, (cellulose diacetate) from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. It was used to manufacture cellulose diacetate cinematographic film, which Eastman Kodak and the Pathé Fréres began to use in 1909. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> film became the standard in the 1950s, preferred over the highly flammable and unstable nitrate film (better known as celluloid).|$|R
