The Sullivan Museum houses {{state of the art}} <b>conservation,</b> <b>storage,</b> and display facilities for the wide variety of Norwich University artifacts and memorabilia.

2500|$|In the 1950s {{and again}} in the 1980s, the need {{appeared}} for the museum, which had seen a steady growth of the number of its displayed artefacts in every domain, to gain more space by using available surface more appropriately, and was each time addressed as far as the classified character of the building in itself could allow. When that same need appeared again in the 2000s, the city of Colmar decided to add supplementary buildings. [...] As the museum's official website used to state before the opening of the 2015 extension : [...] "Today the museum covers a surface area of about 5,620 m², including exhibition spaces (4,000 m²), <b>conservation,</b> <b>storage</b> and other work areas (1,370 m²), and offices (250 m²)". Between 2009 and 2015, the adjacent, Neo-Baroque former baths building was transformed into an annex of the museum, connected to the old building by a series of underground exhibition rooms. A new building for temporary exhibitions was also added while the former cloister was once again thoroughly renovated and its interior spaces redistributed. The total area open to the public was thus enlarged to , at an official cost of 44 M€, although it appeared {{at the end of the}} year 2016 that the final cost was actually of 48,7 M€, a fact which infuriated Colmar's long-time mayor, Gilbert Meyer. The opening of the enlarged museum took place on 12 December 2015.|$|E

30|$|The {{reservoir}} operation schedule (with Guide Curve and integrated approach as adopted by DVC Authority) {{was used for}} simulating the operation of system of reservoirs in integrated manner, starting from 1 st June (beginning of water year in India).

The operation schedule invokes attempt to maintain <b>conservation</b> <b>storages</b> of the reservoirs full (throughout the month of October) so as to ensure conservation requirement up to the end of summer (or up to the onset of monsoon i.e. the first week of June) along with some carry-over storage if onset of monsoon is delayed.|$|R
5000|$|The Second French Empire {{coincides with}} a great {{expansion}} of archaeology in France. Napoleon III is passionate of history and archeology, and orders digs, most notably in Alesia and Gergovia, to complete his biography of Caesar.

50|$|Construction on the dam {{began in}} October 1981 {{and the river}} was closed the same month in 1983.

50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1962 and {{finished}} in 1965.

40|$|Land use {{intensity}} {{is an important}} indicator of human activities, so we quantified the land use intensity and five ecosystem services (soil conservation, water <b>conservation,</b> carbon <b>storage,</b> net primary productivity (NPP), and crop production) in 13 subbasins of the Tabu River Basin in an agro-pastoral ecotone in central Inner Mongolia. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationships among ecosystem services and {{the responses of the}} services to the impact of land use intensity. The primary conclusions were as follows: (1) All five ecosystem services gradually diminished from the upper to the lower reaches of the Tabu River Basin; (2) Water conservation exhibited a trade-off relationship with soil conservation, NPP, and crop production, but it exhibited a synergistic relationship with carbon storage. There were also synergistic relationships between soil <b>conservation,</b> carbon <b>storage,</b> NPP, and crop production; (3) As land use intensity increased, soil conservation, NPP and crop production monotonically increased. In contrast, water conservation exhibited a monotonically decreasing trend, and carbon storage followed a unimodal curve; (4) In this region, suitable ecosystem services were sustained at a land use intensity of approximately 3. 95...|$|R

50|$|Many {{dams and}} their {{associated}} reservoirs are designed completely or partially {{to aid in}} flood protection and control. Many large dams have flood-control reservations in which {{the level of a}} reservoir must be kept below a certain elevation before the onset of the rainy/summer melt season to allow a certain amount of space in which floodwaters can fill.

Considering both alpha-numeric passwords and passwords consisting of any printable ASCII character, we show that we are able to optimize the rainbow table performance through an improvement of up to 26. 13 % in terms of password recovery success rate, and an improvement of up to 28. 57 % in terms of <b>storage</b> <b>conservation,</b> compared to the original rainbow tables...|$|R
