40|$|Many {{changes have}} taken place since the SCP safety {{strategy}} was formulated; {{it needs to be}} revised or replaced. Four concepts would aid in the shift from a rigid, ecelctic, schedule-driven, all-or-nothing program to an incremental, evolving, and experimental but integrated program. These are a simple safety case, reversability, demonstrability, and decoupling operations <b>of</b> a <b>repository</b> from operation <b>of</b> reactors. A simple safety case based on containment can be made for a repository at Yucca Mountain. This containment strategy is based on the dryness of openings at Yucca Mountain, Extended Dry heat management, and long-lived containers. Reversibility is technically believable at Yucca Mountain because of extended retrievability and drift emplacement, if an MRS were co-located with the repository. Because the rock is unsaturated, extended retrievability is technically feasible at Yucca Mountain. Demonstrability could be improved at Yucca Mountain by planning for incremental progression toward operation and <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> a <b>repository,</b> possibly including a shift to underground retrievable storage.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} current design concept for the Engineered Barrier System (EBS), {{in concert with}} the current {{understanding}} of the geologic setting to assess whether enhancements to the required performance of the EBS are necessary.

40|$|The Nuclear Waste Policy Act {{as amended}} in 1987, states that any high- level {{radioactive}} waste (HLW) and Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) repository (hereafter {{referred to as}} the repository) shall be designed and constructed to permit retrieval. Reasons for retrieval include public health and safety, environmental concerns, and recovery of economically valuable contents SNF. The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires that HLW and SNF must be retrievable starting at any time up to 50 years after start of emplacement. The U. S.

40|$|Heating of {{the rock}} mass by the spent fuel in the {{proposed}} repository at Yucca Mountain will cause extra amounts of natural radon to diffuse into the fracture system and to migrate faster to the accessible environment.

The suitability of the site was confirmed by the Swiss Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (HSK) in 1996. In addition to a federal licence, for a repository a mining concession for use of underground space has to be granted by the Canton in a public referendum.

40|$|Based {{on general}} {{arguments}} {{presented in this}} report, nuclear criticality was eliminated from performance assessment calculations for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), a repository for waste contaminated with transuranic (TRU) radioisotopes, located in southeastern New Mexico. At the WIPP, the probability of criticality within the repository is low because mechanisms to concentrate the fissile radioisotopes dispersed throughout the waste are absent. In addition, following an inadvertent human intrusion into the repository (an event that must be considered because of safety regulations), the probability of nuclear criticality away from the repository is low because (1) the amount of fissile mass transported over 10, 000 yr is predicted to be small, (2) often there are insufficient spaces in the advective pore space (e. g., macroscopic fractures) to provide sufficient thickness for precipitation of fissile material, and (3) there is no credible mechanism to counteract the natural tendency of the material to disperse during transport and instead concentrate fissile material in a small enough volume for it to form a critical concentration. Furthermore, before a criticality would {{have the potential to}} affect human health after <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repository</b> [...] assuming that a criticality could occur [...] it would have to either (1) degrade the ability of the disposal system to contain nuclear waste or (2) produce significantly more radioisotopes than originally present.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a process for}} performing preclosure criticality analyses for a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. These analyses will be performed {{from the time of}} receipt of fissile material until permanent <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repository</b> (preclosure period). The process describes how criticality safety analyses will be performed for various configurations of waste in or out of waste packages that could occur during preclosure as a result of normal operations or event sequences. The criticality safety analysis considers those event sequences resulting in unanticipated moderation, loss of neutron absorber, geometric changes, or administrative errors in waste form placement (loading) of the waste package. The report proposes a criticality analyses process for preclosure to allow a consistent transition from preclosure to postclosure, thereby possibly reducing potential cost increases and delays in licensing of Yucca Mountain. The proposed approach provides the advantage of using a parallel regulatory framework for evaluation of preclosure and postclosure performance and is consistent with the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approach of supporting risk-informed, performance-based regulation for fuel cycle facilities, ''Yucca Mountain Review Plan, Final Report'', and 10 CFR Part 63. The criticality-related criteria for ensuring subcriticality are also described as well as which guidance documents will be utilized. Preclosure operations and facilities have significant similarities to existing facilities and operations currently regulated by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; therefore, the design approach for preclosure criticality safety will be dictated by existing regulatory requirements while using a risk-informed approach with burnup credit for in-package operations...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion {{of nuclear}} waste glass in {{unsaturated}} conditions {{is expected to}} occur upon the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repository</b> galleries during disposal cell saturation in the proposed French disposal site. The objectives of the present work were to determine the alteration kinetics of the SON 68 reference in such conditions. Vapor hydration tests were conducted using thin, polished SON 68 glass coupons contained in stainless steel autoclaves. Temperatures ranged between 90 °C and 200 °C and the relative humidity (RH) was maintained at 91 ± 1 %. Additional experiments at 175 °C and 80, 85, 90 and 95 % RH were also conducted to assess the role of RH on the glass corrosion rate. The {{nature and extent of}} corrosion have been determined by characterizing the reacted glass surface with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Elemental profiling of the glass hydrated at 90 °C was studied by TOF-SIMS. The chemical composition of the external layer depends on experimental conditions. The hydration rate at 90 °C (TOF-SIMS analysis) is 10 × higher than the generally accepted final rate of SON 68 in water at 90 °C (~ 10 − 4 g m− 2 d− 1). This may indicate that the glass hydration process cannot be simulated by experiments in aqueous solution with a high S/V ratio. Subsequent leaching (corrosion in an aqueous solution) of samples weathered in water vapor showed dissolution rate values higher than those of pristine glass.

This analysis is being prepared to document the technical issues associated with each type of measurement during the PC period. This analysis utilizes the ''Performance Confirmation Input Criteria'' (CRWMS M&O 1999 a) as its starting point. The scope of this analysis is primarily on the period after the start of waste package emplacement and before permanent <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repository,</b> a period lasting between 15 and 300 years after last package emplacement (Stroupe 2000, Attachment 1, p. 1). The primary objectives of this analysis are to: (1) Review the design criteria as presented in the ''Performance Confirmation Input Criteria'' (CRWMS M&O 1999 a). The scope of this analysis will be limited to the instrumentation related to parameters that require continuous monitoring of the conditions underground. (2) Preliminary identification and listing of the data requirements and parameters as related to the current repository layout in support of PC monitoring. (3) Preliminary identification of methods and instrumentation for the acquisition of the required data. Although the ''Performance Confirmation Input Criteria'' (CRWMS M&O 1999 a) defines a broad range of data that must be obtained from a variety of methods, the focus of this analysis is on instrumentation related to the performance of the rock mass and the formation of water in the repository environment, that is obtainable from in-situ observation, testing, and monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater flow {{transports}} possibly released radionuclides from underground repositories to the biosphere. It {{can also}} make construction difficult as is obvious from examining technical solutions for disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) in long subhorizontally bored holes (KBS- 3 H) and in very deep boreholes (VDH). The presence of intersected, water-bearing fracture zones requires concrete for sealing these parts of the holes while the rest contains canisters surrounded and separated by dense, expandable clay. Casting of the concrete should be preceded by grouting of the fractured rock using cementitious materials composed so that mutual physical and chemical interaction do not degrade either of them. For the sake of rock stability the horizontal holes have to be located at very moderate depth, 400 - 500 m, where the rock has a high average hydraulic conductivity, while the slimmer, steep holes reaching down to 4 km are kept stable by using clay mud in the construction phase and dense clay for long term performance. The rock at this depth is much less permeable than higher up and the groundwater sufficiently salt to be maintained there, causing only local thermally induced circulation of possibly contaminated water. The KBS- 3 H concept involves practical difficulties and risks in {{the installation of the}} clay seals and waste canisters, for which the risk of shearing by slip of frequently intersected steep fractures is a major threat after <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repository.</b> The VDH concept relies on effective sealing of {{the upper part of the}} deep holes and puts less demand on the seals in the lower, waste-bearing part, for which the buoyancy conditions of the groundwater make it a major barrier to upward migration of possibly released radionuclides.

40|$|Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, {{has stated}} {{that one of the}} nuclear waste legacy issues is ``The {{challenge}} of managing the fuel cycle's back end and assuring the safe use of nuclear power. '' Waste management (i. e., the back end) is a domestic and international issue that must be addressed. A key tool in gaining acceptance <b>of</b> nuclear waste <b>repository</b> technologies is transparency. Transparency provides information to outside parties for independent assessment of safety, security, and legitimate use of materials. Transparency is a combination of technologies and processes that apply to all elements of the development, operation, and <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> a <b>repository</b> system. A test bed for nuclear repository transparency technologies has been proposed to develop a broad-based set of concepts and strategies for transparency monitoring of nuclear materials at the back end of the fuel/weapons cycle. WIPP is the world's first complete geologic repository system for nuclear materials at the back end of the cycle. While it is understood that WIPP does not currently require this type <b>of</b> transparency, this <b>repository</b> has been proposed as realistic demonstration site to generate and test ideas, methods, and technologies about what transparency may entail at the back end of the nuclear materials cycle, and which could be applicable to other international repository developments. An integrated set of transparency demonstrations was developed and deployed during the summer, and fall of 1999 as a proof-of-concept <b>of</b> the <b>repository</b> transparency technology concept. These demonstrations also provided valuable experience and insight into the implementation of future transparency technology development and application. These demonstrations included: Container Monitoring Rocky Flats to WIPP; Underground Container Monitoring; Real-Time Radiation and Environmental Monitoring; Integrated level of confidence in the system and information provided. As the world's only operating deep geologic repository, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) offers a unique opportunity to serve as an international cooperative test bed for developing and demonstrating technologies and processes in a fully operational repository system setting. To address the substantial national security implications for the US resulting from the lack of integrated, transparent management and disposition of nuclear materials at the back-end of the nuclear fuel and weapons cycles, it is proposed that WIPP be used as a test bed to develop and demonstrate technologies that will enable the transparent and proliferation-resistant geologic isolation of nuclear materials. The objectives of this initiative are to: (1) enhance public confidence in safe, secure geologic isolation of nuclear materials; (2) develop, test, and demonstrate transparency measures and technologies for the back-end of nuclear fuel cycle; and (3) foster international collaborations leading to workable, effective, globally-accepted standards for the transparent monitoring <b>of</b> geological <b>repositories</b> for nuclear materials. Test-bed activities include: development and testing of monitoring measures and technologies; international demonstration experiments; transparency workshops; visiting scientist exchanges; and educational outreach. These activities are proposed to be managed by the Department of Energy/Carlsbad Area Office (DOE/CAO) as part of The Center for Applied Repository and Underground Studies (CARUS) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydraulic}} disturbances {{caused by}} the decay heat <b>of</b> the <b>repository</b> were studied by a transient simulation of groundwater flow, solute transport and heat transfer. The three phenomena were coupled, because the variations in the density and viscosity of water affect groundwater flow, whereas the density is dependent on salinity and temperature and the viscosity depends on temperature. The construction and operation <b>of</b> ONKALO and <b>repository</b> was not {{taken into account in}} the simulations, but the whole tunnel system to a depth of 520 metres was made hydraulically active {{at the beginning of the}} simulation and was assumed to be open for 100 years. The simulations continued for 2000 years after present. The results show that the decay heat of spent nuclear fuel raises the temperature <b>of</b> the <b>repository</b> and the surrounding bedrock several tens of degrees for many centuries. During the first 100 years the open ONKALO tunnels dominate the flow conditions in the vicinity <b>of</b> the <b>repository</b> and draw groundwater from all directions in the bedrock. After the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the tunnels th...|$|R

40|$|Underground {{nuclear waste}} storage {{repositories}} generally use steels and super alloys for various structural members and storage containers. These materials {{are susceptible to}} corrosion due to seepage of water. We studied rock bolt materials for reinforcing tunnels and containment materials for storing nuclear waste materials. In general, the design of underground support materials for tunnels are mainly based on mechanical behavior of the materials, but not much was known about {{the interaction of the}} seepage YM waters with the structural members under various conditions in the tunnels. The sources of water in the Yucca Mountain (YM) repository are due to rain fall (~ 5 %), perched and pore waters associated with the tunnel that contain various levels of chlorides, nitrate, sulfate, silicates and bicarbonates. The temperature of the tunnel is expected to increase initially and subsequently decreases after <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the YM <b>repository</b> due to nuclear waste radioactive decay. Our tests for corrosion were under 100 C to obtain a wide range of data at different temperatures and electrolyte concentrations. The rock bolts are generally embedded 10 to 12 feet deep inside the host-rock of the tunnel and water seepage through the rock pores creates an interface between the bolt material and water making it conducive to aqueous corrosion. The issues related to corrosion of the rock bolts and other structural materials are: (1) variation in the temperature of the tunnel over the years, (2) concentration of the ions present in the YM waters, (3) combination of temperature and detrimental anions that cause structural damage...|$|R
