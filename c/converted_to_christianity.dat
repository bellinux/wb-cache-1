After the defeat of the rebellions, the entire Crown of Aragon was now nominally <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christianity.</b> Mosques were demolished, first names and family names were changed, and the religious practice of Islam was driven underground.|$|E
5|$|According to Eusebius of Caesarea, Pamphilus of Caesarea {{was born}} into a rich family in Beirut {{in the latter half of}} the 3rd century and {{attended}} its law school. Pamphilus later became the presbyter of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers Aphian and Aedesius, born to a noble Lycian family. They <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christianity</b> while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.|$|E

5|$|Constantine {{made some}} new laws {{regarding}} the Jews, but {{while some of}} his edicts were unfavorable towards Jews, they were not harsher than those of his predecessors.

On the other hand, Jewish clergy were given the same exemptions as Christian clergy.|$|E
5|$|Early Dutch missionaries faced strong {{opposition}} among Torajans, {{especially among the}} elite, because the abolition of their profitable slave trade had angered them. Some Torajans were forcibly relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, {{where they could be}} more easily controlled. Taxes were kept high, undermining the wealth of the elites. Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, and only a few Torajans were converted. In 1950, only 10% of the population had <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christianity.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ecgric's successor, Anna, {{acted as}} a {{challenge}} to the increasing power of Penda throughout his reign. In 645, after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife, who was Penda's sister, Penda drove him from his kingdom and into exile. Anna was strong enough to offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court: whilst there he was <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christianity,</b> returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to his throne.|$|E
5|$|Hostile native {{tribes and}} {{distance}} from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from {{moving to the}} area. It was one of New Spain's least populated provinces. In 1749, the Spanish peace treaty with the Lipan Apache angered many tribes, including the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai. The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 and later helped to defeat the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes. With more numerous missions being established, priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes. By {{the end of the}} 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christianity.</b>|$|E

The population is still concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp, but new smaller communities (such as those in Ghent, Knokke, Waterloo and Arlon) have developed since 1945. Notable Belgian Holocaust survivors include François Englert, a joint recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013, and Paul Lévy, a well-known journalist (who <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christianity)</b> who was also responsible for the design of the European flag.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Æthelberht was <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christianity</b> before Augustine's arrival.

It also {{is possible}} that Bede had the date of Æthelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, Æthelberht died in 618, this {{would be consistent with}} his baptism in 597, which is in accord with the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.|$|E
