40|$|The <b>cream</b> <b>skimming?</b> <b>effect</b> in the {{insurance}} sector occurs when the insurer has the possibility to select individuals whose risk-adjusted per capita payment he considers to be above the expected cost level. To avoid this possibility of selection, the public authority has to determine a financing formula which takes account of the several determinants of costs, to create homogeneous payment groups. We consider the <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> <b>effect</b> at the hospital level, through the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and inpatient length of stay. The Belgian hospitals? financing of day of stay is based upon pathologies (APDRG) and age. The omission of SES may be an incentive for hospitals to select its patients. Our data set contains data from 60 Belgian hospitals for the year 1995, i. e. 466, 087 individual observations, with fully comparable explanatory variables such as pathology, age, length of stay and income, and also community- based observations on social isolation and quality of accommodation. We test the incidence of social factors on length of stay controlling for age, pathologies, type of hospital (public or private), occupation rate, and type of exit (death or transfer). The main outcome is that length of stay is decreasing with income, and is positively related to social isolation. Length of stay is also higher for unemployed or retired people, and for benefit-recipients. social factors, selection, cream skimming, length of stay, hospital...|$|E
40|$|This study {{constructs}} {{a dynamic}} {{model of the}} coexistence {{of public and private}} schools to study the impact of voucher programs when there are nonlinear peer group effects. The government provides public schools as well as tuition vouchers for households attending private schools. School quality depends on expenditure per student and peer quality within the school. When peer quality is nonlinear, more agents will choose public schools if peer quality is more substitutable, whereas more agents will attend private schools if peer quality is more complementary.

This framework results in a simple formula showing that the “cream-skimming” effect is increasing in the degree of heterogeneity within schools, the school choice takeup rate of strong students relative to weak students, and the importance of peers. We use the formula to investigate the effects of a voucher program on the high school graduation rate of the students who would remain in public school. We employ NELS: 88 data to measure the characteristics of public school students, to estimate a model of the private school entrance decision, and to estimate peer group effects on graduation. We supplement the econometric estimates with a wide range of alternative assumptions about school choice and peer effects. We find that the <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> <b>effect</b> is negative but small and that this result is robust across our specifications. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} recruitment {{practices to}} Samhall, a state-owned company that provides sheltered employment {{for individuals with}} severe work disabilities. Besides providing employment for disabled workers and rehabilitating them to employment outside Samhall, the company is expected to decrease its dependence on Government subsidies. This profitability goal may come into conflict with the recruitment goals, resulting in <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> <b>effects.</b> The job security offered at the company may also provide incentives {{at the individual level}} for using Samhall as a means of escaping unemployment rather than as an employer of last resort for the most disabled.

Individuals without disabilities tend to be hired by the company, which suggests creaming and is contrary to the guidelines. Finally, the Samhall hazard increases slightly with time in unemployment. This is consistent both with Samhall acting as an employer of last resort and the existence of incentives among individuals to use Samhall in order to escape unemployment. <p...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{documented}} that employer incentives, {{in form of}} experience rating, co-insurance or deductibles, could decrease the social insurance usage.

40|$|Under {{inadequate}} capitation formulae competing {{health insurers}} {{have an incentive}} for <b>cream</b> <b>skimming,</b> i. e., the selection of enrollees whom the insurer expects to be profitable. When evaluating different capitation formulae, previous studies used various indicators of incentives for <b>cream</b> <b>skimming.</b> These conventional indicators are based on all actual profits and losses or on all predictable profits and losses. For the latter type of indicators, this paper proposes, as a new approach, to ignore the small predictable profits and losses. We assume that this new approach provides a better indication {{of the size of}} the <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> problem than the conventional one, because an insurer has to take into account its costs of <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> and the (statistical) uncertainties about the net benefits of <b>cream</b> <b>skimming.</b> Both approaches are applied in theoretical and empirical analyses.

40|$|Background: <b>Cream</b> <b>skimming</b> can {{be defined}} as the {{selective}} treatment of patients that demand little resources while providing high economic refunds. We test whether <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> occurs after the introduction of DRG-based activity-based financing (ABF) in Norway in 1997 and if the problem further increases after the 2002 organizational reform where hospitals were turned into trusts. The DRG-system offers the same economic reimbursement for patients classified within day-surgical DRGs irrespective of whether the patient receives same-day treatment or in-patient care over several days. This both gives a potential for <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> and allow us to investigate <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> within the actual diagnoses. Method: Patient data from the period 1999 - 2005 is analyzed. Waiting time, as an indicator of patient selection, is analyzed as a function of severity within each diagnosis, controlling for age and gender of the patient, as well as institutional and time-dependent variables. Results: The analysis gives some evidence of <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> in the period of ABF, in particular within the lighter orthopaedic diagnosis. However, <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> does not increase after the 2002 organizational reform but is stable, or for some DRGs even reduced.

40|$|Risk-adjusted {{capitation}} payments (RACPs) to competing {{health insurers}} are {{an essential element}} of market-oriented health care reforms in many countries. RACPs based on demographic variables only are insufficient, because they leave ample room for <b>cream</b> <b>skimming.</b> However, the implementation of improved RACPs {{does not appear to be}} straightforward. A solution might be to supplement imperfect RACPs with a form of mandatory pooling that reduces the incentives for <b>cream</b> <b>skimming.</b> In a previous paper it was concluded that high-risk pooling (HRP), is a promising supplement to RACPs. The purpose of this paper is to compare HRP with two other main variants of mandatory pooling. These variants are called excess-of-loss (EOL) and proportional pooling (PP). Each variant includes ex post compensations to insurers for some members which depend to various degrees on actually incurred costs. Therefore, these pooling variants reduce the incentives for <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> which are inherent in imperfect RACPs, but they also reduce the incentives for efficiency and cost containment. As a rough measure of the latter incentives we use the percentage of total costs for which an insurer is at risk. This paper analyzes which of the three main pooling variants yields the greatest reduction of incentives for <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> given such a percentage. The results show that HRP is the most effective of the three pooling variants. competitive health insurance market risk-adjusted capitation payments <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> mandatory pooling...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cream</b> <b>skimming</b> is {{an illegal}} {{behaviour}} that consists in choosing to treat patients {{according to their}} ability to recover. It arises from the use of prospective payment schemes in an asymmetry of information framework. In this context in fact the provider can observe some relevant information (freely or at a cost) before making its effort which will then be used to its own advantage. The paper studies the scope for these types of behaviour in a mixed market for hospital care where the hospitals do not share the same objectives. We show that in this context <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> is made possible by the presence of two important elements: the public hospital prefers to treat high severity patients and the regulator is unable to enforce hard budget constraint rules. The paper adds an important dimension to the study of <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> as proposed by the traditional literature where asymmetry of information alone is considered the cause of this market failure.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse {{recruitment}} to sheltered employment for the disabled, with particular attention to <b>cream</b> <b>skimming,</b> i. e. whether the most able candidates are picked by programme organisers. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper recruitment practices and incentive structures at the state-owned Samhall company, Sweden's main provider of sheltered employment, are discussed. An econometric analysis is performed on a random sample of 10, 000 unemployed individuals, exploring the quality of the data on disability and the determinants of recruitment to the company. The findings regarding recruitment are related to Samhall's objectives. Findings – The findings in this paper regarding <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> is mixed; the prioritised groups, i. e. individuals with intellectual or psychic disabilities, are more likely to be hired than some, but not all, disability groups. Individuals without disabilities tend to be recruited by the company, which suggests creaming and is contrary to the guidelines. Research limitations/implications – The paper sees that the fact that disability tends to be difficult to define should be taken into account when recruitment practices to employment programmes for the disabled are analysed.

40|$|Critics {{of school}} choice argue that {{cream-skimming}} will worsen outcomes for {{those left behind}} in public schools, a dynamic that relies on a substantial degree of within-school heterogeneity. Since “high quality ” families may have already sorted themselves, or may represent {{a small fraction of}} the total, this paper will examine whether existing within-school heterogeneity leaves any scope for cream-skimming to operate. The first empirical section shows that the assumptions made by simulation studies over-estimate within-school heterogeneity by at least 20 % to 40 %, thus inflating the cream-skimming effect. The second empirical section asks, “given the current level of within-school heterogeneity, how strong would peer effects have to be to significantly worsen outcomes for those left behind?”. In order for <b>cream</b> <b>skimming</b> to lower math test scores by a decile, the peer effect would have to be larger than the effect of converting both parents from college graduates to high-school dropouts.

40|$|The {{presence}} of voluntary deductibles in the Swiss and Dutch mandatory health insurance {{has important implications}} for the respective risk equalization systems.

40|$|In general, {{competition}} enhances efficiency. On {{the market}} for health insurance free market competition, however, has unwanted side-effects.

In an attempt to enhance efficiency, the Dutch government in 1992 introduced price competition between social health insurers in combination with risk-adjusted capitation payments. Our estimation results indicate that this has not resulted in altering market shares. Relatively cheap insurers did not enlarge their market share at the expense of their relatively expensive competitors. The introduction of competition among social health insurers has not been the success the Dutch government hoped for. Experiences in Belgium and Germany show that the Dutch difficulties are not exceptional. When equity considerations are high valued features of a health insurance system, it is difficult to introduce competition. To enhance efficiency, we recommend that the current capitation formula should be refined and that the insurers should be given more room for selective contracting of health care providers...|$|R
