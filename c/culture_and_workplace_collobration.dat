MethodsParticipants were 298 hospital nurses in Busan, South Korea. We assessed nursing organizational <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>workplace</b> bullying among nurses using structured questionnaires from July 1 through August 15, 2014. ResultsMost participants considered their organizational culture as hierarchy-oriented (45. 5 %), followed by relation-oriented (36. 0 %), innovation-oriented (10. 4 %), and task-oriented (8. 1 %). According to the operational bullying criteria, the prevalence of workplace bullying was 15. 8 %. A {{multivariate logistic regression analysis}} revealed that the odds of being a victim of bullying were 2. 58 times as high among nurses in a hierarchy-oriented culture as among nurses in a relation-oriented culture [95 % confidence interval (1. 12, 5. 94) ].

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the connections between}} societal <b>culture,</b> corporate <b>culture,</b> <b>and</b> <b>workplace</b> design, highlighting the importance of employees' societal culture {{to the effectiveness of}} design within multinational corporations (MNCs). Models of <b>culture,</b> behavioral theories, <b>and</b> research on <b>workplace</b> design are reviewed to explore their inter-relations. An exploratory case study using the narrative method, describing the design process of a new office facility for the Latin American division of Discovery Networks International, is presented to illustrate the salient points discussed.

The considered case illuminates certain conflicts that arose when traditional corporate-culture-influenced design clashed with the societal culture of the new office's denizens. These conflicts manifested in areas involving (a) private space, (b) worker autonomy, (c) personal expression, and (d) hierarchical reinforcement.

40|$|<b>Workplace</b> health {{promotion}} <b>and</b> absence <b>culture</b> {{are more important}} than structural factors as determinants of local differences in sickness absence among social care employees in Swedish municipals Background In Sweden there are large unexplained differences in sickness absence between regions as well as between employers within the same trade. The aim was to study sickness absence differences between municipalities in their social care staff in relation to internal workplace factors as well as external structural factors in the local society.   Method A questionnaire with focus on perceived organizational climate, health, absence <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>workplace</b> {{health promotion}} (WHP) was sent out to 15, 871 social care employees in a random sample of 60 out of Sweden’s 290 municipalities. The response rate was 58 %. A database of the 60 municipalities was constructed with aggregated data from the questionnaire and official registers. Results In a Structural Equation Model analysis, lower sickness absence level was related to internal factors (access to and utilization of a broader repertory of WHP measures, a more restrictive absence <b>culture,</b> <b>and</b> better self-rated health) as well as external structural factors (lower rates of sickness absence in the population). Multivariate analyses indicate that WHP measures was the most important predictor followed by absence culture which, however, was mostly determined by external structural factors such as a more favorable situation concerning prosperity, labour market, and standardized mortality rate in the local society. Better self-rated health was determined by encouraging leadership mediated by better social climate at the workplace. Conclusions Although the staff sickness absence level is related to local structural factors beyond the control of the manager such as the level of sickness absence in the general population and the local absence culture, the managers’ measures concerning WHP, leadership and organizational climate matter irrespective of these external circumstances...|$|R

40|$|The issue whether {{male and}} female school leaders {{practice}} different leadership styles is a much-debated issue as the difference in leadership style is a key factor that may affect and influence as to whether women can be effective leaders. This is because men have long held these roles {{and it is only}} natural that people are concerned with the capability of female leaders. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the differences between the leadership styles of {{male and female}} school heads. The study involved one hundred and thirty-eight teachers and six school heads from six primary schools located in the district of Bintulu, Sarawak. The research instruments comprised of a questionnaire and semi structured interviews that helped triangulate the findings. The'Questionnaire administered upon both school heads and teachers was adopted from Oates’ (2010). The findings of this study revealed that that there is no obvious difference between the leadership style of male and female school heads. The results also indicated that there is no significant difference between leadership styles and gender thus indicating that gender does not affect leadership styles of school heads. It is personality, <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>workplace</b> that shape a person’s leadership styles. This study implies that since there is {{no significant difference between the}} leadership styles of both male and female school heads it is perhaps pertinent that people change the negative perception that women do not make good leaders.

40|$|Today, {{combining}} {{working life}} {{and family life}} is a real challenge for millions of Europeans ‘juggling’ with competing work and family responsibilities (and in particular care responsibilities) a relentless and often stressful part of everyday life. This challenge has become a prominent issue in Europe, at EU, national <b>and</b> <b>workplace</b> levels. The combination of work and family affects many aspects of society: national economic performance, job quality, gender equality, the welfare of children and others needing care as well as well-being {{and the quality of}} life. At the national level several factors fundamentally determine the opportunity an individual has to achieve work/life balance “capability”. These include: the quality of legal entitlements and service infrastructure, economic conditions and the level of unemployment, societal attitudes towards women and men taking up family-supportive initiatives, gendered expectations and egalitarian ideology.

40|$|Violence in the {{workplace}} has attracted widespread scholarly and media attention in the United States and Canada since the 1980 s. Governments and corporations {{on both sides of}} the border have identified this violence as a serious problem affecting the health and safety of workers. However, there is still much that is unknown about workplace violence. Is the problem of workplace violence more serious than it was today? How has it changed over time? What are the factors that have produced violence at work? How have workers, management, and governments defined violence at work? How have they approached the problem? This dissertation historicizes the phenomenon of workplace violence, investigating on-the-job violence in the North American automotive industry between 1960 - 1980. It embeds violence at work in its economic, political, and cultural contexts and investigates how violence shaped the North American <b>workplace</b> <b>and</b> identities of class, gender, and race on the job. A comparative, transnational approach is central to this study. If we seek to understand the structural factors causing workplace violence, the national context cannot be ignored. This is especially true when considering the US and Canada, two countries which are extraordinarily integrated economically but often contrasted socially and culturally. My research has uncovered a significant history of violence in the automotive <b>workplaces</b> of Detroit <b>and</b> Windsor, and shows that national and local contexts were crucial in determining the level of violence. Violence was a regular element of shop-floor <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>workplace</b> conflict in both countries, but was different in each. In Detroit, violence at work reached epidemic levels and was a major factor in the crisis that gripped the city 2 ̆ 7 s auto plants in the 1960 s and 1970 s. This was not the case in Windsor. Yet in both cities workplace violence became a major concern outside the factory when work-related murders seized national headlines and challenged citizens to understand these tragedies. The thesis demonstrates that, though the patterns and levels of violence were different in each place, violence was no aberration, no freak occurrence, but an ongoing phenomenon that influenced the labour process <b>and</b> <b>workplace</b> <b>culture</b> in both Detroit and Windsor...|$|R

40|$|Having {{made the}} case for an ethnographic study of how workers hear and use music, I now turn to connect the topic to bigger {{questions}} within industrial sociology, musicology, and cultural studies—questions regarding the nature of popular music in contemporary society, and questions regarding the links between <b>workplace</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>and</b> <b>workplace</b> resistance. In examining these questions, I use Small’s (1998) term “musicking” to denote social practices that involve music. For Small, whenever we are playing music, singing, listening to it, dancing to it, or writing it, we are musicking. Despite the broadness of this concept, so far most writers who have used the concept have tended to follow Small’s lead in focusing on performance as the “primary process” of musicking (113). But there is also a rich potential in seeing musicking in how music is received. Musicking is a term that opens a door into better seeing “music as social life,” to use the phrase of Turino (2008). Musicking as a conceptual lens leads us to focus on the situated meanings {{of the people who are}} musicking. As Small puts it (1998, 13), “the act of musicking establishes in the place where it is happening a set of relationships, and it is in those relationships that the meaning of the act lies. ” It is a term that emphasizes the active role of the person who is musicking. It sits well with John Cage’s argument that “most people mistakenly think that when they hear a piece of music that they’re not doing anything but that something’s being done to them. Now this is not true and we must arrange our music, our art, everything [...] . so that people realize that they themselves are doing it and not that something is being done to them” (quoted in DeNora 2003, 157) ...|$|R

Using {{the example of a}} workplace e-learning programme in Christchurch City Libraries, the study considers the whole process from development of the programme to delivery and evaluation and asks what factors impact upon effectiveness and engagement in a workplace e-learning programme. A number of factors including the organisational <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>workplace</b> environment, the development process, the learning environment, learner support, the e-learning environment and specific e-learning activities were examined. The study itself took place over a unique period of time as Christchurch recovered from several devastating earthquakes.

This study uses a Participatory Action Research approach with data collected and analysed {{from a variety of sources}} including interviews with programme developers, pre- and post-course questionnaires, online activity tracking tools, forum posts, trainee learning logs, the researcher’s reflective journal, and a participant focus group. The findings from the study suggest a number of elements that contribute to effective and engaging e-learning programmes in the workplace: a) workplace support of the programme by team leaders is essential but the trainee also needs to be in a position to negotiate for the actual time and resources required. b) Developing an online programme requires a different approach and skill set than designing and delivering face-to-face training and may best be managed as a product development project. c) The attractiveness and ease of navigation are important factors for trainees’ engagement with e-learning. d) Short, locally made videos of real-life workplace scenarios proved to both effective and engaging with trainees able to transfer skills to the workplace. e) A wide variety of e-learning activities promoted interest and engagement among learners. f) Consideration needs to be given to how workplace e-learning is evaluated to ensure skill transfer to the workplace is taking place...|$|R

Assessment in workplace learning is mainly formative and different stakeholders are involved in the assessment; namely students, teachers <b>and</b> <b>workplace</b> instructors. However, the guidelines for assessment are vague and call for a close cooperation between the stakeholders. This is demanding and has resulted in a variety of assessment practices. The study presented in this article is a qualitative study of students’ experiences with assessment in workplace learning periods in their first year in vocational education. The aim of the study is to give voice to students` experiences with assessment and illuminate how assessment supports their learning processes. Data was collected through focus group interviews with two groups of students in the Programme for Health and Social Care. The main findings indicate different assessment <b>cultures</b> in school <b>and</b> <b>workplaces.</b> This is expressed through the students’ perceptions of assessment, assessment criteria, tools for assessment and vocational knowledge. It is recommended that an open dialogue about the discontinuity in assessment between schools <b>and</b> <b>workplaces</b> is one of several measures necessary {{to bridge the gap between}} the stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Organizational Citizenship Behaviour (OCB) a key {{determinant}} of organizational success is getting prime {{focus in the}} research arena. The different antecedents and consequences of this discretionary behaviour are being considered as important for management of human resources. From among the different impacting variables explored through numerous researches, the relationship with workplace commuting, the daily travel between place of work and place of residence stands critical. The study focuses on finding out the impact of workplace commuting on citizenship behaviour of employees. Different dimensions of workplace commuting were identified and related with those of citizenship behaviour. Statistical analysis revealed the relationship between independent and dependent variable. Even though {{the relationship between the}} variables are rejected by the study, the negative correlation figures indicating lowering of citizenship behaviour as a result of <b>workplace</b> commuting <b>and</b> its different variables is worth noting. The study concludes by emphasizing the importance of further research including variables like <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> performance. <b>Workplace</b> Commuting; Organizational Citizenship Behaviour; Interpersonal Helping; Individual Initiative; Personal Industry; Loyal Boosteris...|$|R
40|$|The {{signs of}} a {{transition}} in the global gender order appear, in part, {{to be linked to}} the conjunctural shift in the global capitalist accumulation process. The main observation is that men’s traditional roles in the <b>workplace,</b> at home <b>and</b> in school have been eroding with the shift towards a knowledge-based and services world-economy. However, the transition in the gender order is more than merely a matter of economic adjustment and industrial respecialization. The transition {{has much to do with}} the impact of the antisystemic movements and changes in the politics of identity such as the rise of feminism and the women’s movement, the feminization of both male consumption <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> the <b>workplace,</b> the gay rights movement and the resistance to empire and racialized masculinities (Nurse 2004). These trends have evoked a counter-movement and a counter-discourse on male marginalization, demasculinization and the feminization of masculinity in core countries (Bly 1990) as well as in peripheral areas (Miller 1991). The erosion of the male superiority myth has specifically affected the hegemonic status of the white male subject. ...|$|R
