2500|$|The {{painting}} {{moves from}} a dark wilderness with shattered tree trunks on rugged cliffs in the foreground covered with violent rain clouds on the left to a light-filled and peaceful, <b>cultivated</b> <b>landscape</b> on the right, which borders the tranquility of the bending Connecticut River. In returning to painting landscapes, Cole was faced with the dichotomy of the untamed wilderness and land cultivated by man. While other painters of the Hudson River School would merge the two peacefully, Cole did not shy away from portraying the two as opposites and showing how the cultivation would destroy the natural wilderness, {{and as a result}} never meet in the painting. On the hill in the far background, logging scars in the forest can be observed, which appear to form Hebrew letters. This was first noticed by Matthew Baigell long after the landscape was painted. If viewed upside down, as if from God's perspective, the word shaddai is formed, [...] "The Almighty." [...] Cole gives himself a tiny self-portrait sitting on the rocks in the foreground with his easel.|$|E
60|$|The mere circumstance, however, {{that the}} book was one long and {{powerful}} innuendo against the Church, {{would not have been}} enough to secure its vast popularity. Attacks on the Church had become cheap by this time. The eighteenth century, as {{it is one of the}} chief aims of these studies to show, had a positive side of at least equal importance and equal strength with its negative side. As we have so often said, its writers were inspired by zeal for political justice, for humanity, for better and more equal laws, for the amelioration of the common lot,--a zeal which in energy, sincerity, and disinterestedness, has never been surpassed. Raynal's work was perhaps, on the whole, the most vigorous and sustained of all the literary expressions that were given to the great social ideas of the century. It wholly lacked the strange and concentrated glow that burned in the pages of the Social Contract; on the other hand, it was more full of movement, of reality, of vivid and picturesque incident. It was popular, and it was concrete. Raynal's story went straight to the hearts of many people, to whom Rousseau's arguments were only half intelligible and wholly dreary. It was that book of the eighteenth century which brought the lower races finally within the pale of right and duty in the common opinion of France. The engravings that face the title-page in each of the seven volumes give the keynote to the effect that the seven volumes produced. In one we see a philosopher writing on a column those old words of dolorous pregnancy, Auri sacra fames, while in the distance Spanish and Portuguese ships ride at anchor, and on the shore white men massacre blacks. In another we see a fair woman, typifying bounteous Nature, giving her nourishment to a white infant at one breast, and to a black infant at the other, while she turns a pitiful eye to a scene in the background, where a gang of negro slaves work among the sugar-canes, under the scourge and the goad of ruthless masters. A third frontispiece gives us the story of Inkle and Yarico, which Raynal sets down to some English poet, but as no English poet is known to have touched that moving tale until the younger Colman dramatised it in 1787, we may suspect that Raynal had remembered it from Steele's paper in the Spectator. The last of these pieces represents a <b>cultivated</b> <b>landscape,</b> adorned with villages, and its ports thronged with shipping; in the foreground are two Quakers, one of them benignly embracing some young Indians, the other casting indignantly away from him a bow and its arrows, the symbols of division and war.|$|E

40|$|Local species {{richness}} of butterflies {{can be expected}} to benefit from both local habitat properties as well as the availability of suitable habitats and source populations in the surrounding landscape. Whether local {{species richness}} is dependent on local or landscape factors can be assessed by examining the relationship between local and landscape species richness. Here we studied how local species richness is related to landscape-level species richness in landscapes differing in agricultural intensity. The relationship was linear for field boundaries in intensively <b>cultivated</b> <b>landscapes</b> and non-linear in less-intensively <b>cultivated</b> <b>landscapes.</b> In landscapes containing semi-natural grasslands (on average 4 % of overall land-use), the relationship was non-linear for field boundaries, but linear when considering local species richness of the grasslands themselves. These results show that local factors are more important than landscape factors in determining local species richness in landscapes which contained semi-natural grasslands. Local species richness was limited by landscape factors in intensively <b>cultivated</b> <b>landscapes.</b> This interpretation was supported by the relationship between local species richness and landscape-scale average mobility and generalist percentage of butterfly assemblages. We conclude that the management of field boundary habitat quality for butterflies is expected to be most effective in landscapes with semi-natural grasslands, the species composition of which in turn is dependent on the regional occurrence of grasslands. Based on our results, managing non-crop habitats for the conservation of habitat specialists and species with poor mobility will be most efficient in regions where patches of semi-natural grasslands occur...|$|R

40|$|Gardens {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the lives of European peoples living in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. By producing texts in which gardens and other <b>cultivated</b> <b>landscapes</b> are used as symbol and setting, medieval writers provide us with the opportunity to gain insight into the sociocultural conventions associated with these spaces in the late medieval period.

30|$|By {{applying}} these techniques, small-scale <b>cultivated</b> <b>landscapes</b> are maintained, which secures important ecological niches for a {{range of}} local plants and animals. For example, older farmers repeatedly claimed in their interviews that the biodiversity of mountain flowers, before the mechanization of agriculture, was much higher than today. The issue of biodiversity and agriculture was frequently brought up in interviews. One politically and emotionally charged question is how high the subsidy payments for extensive, ecologically sustainable agriculture should be. There is tension between farmers who prefer more extensive agricultural methods and those who do not; for example, some farmers prefer that certain steps in the working process, like scything, continue to be done by hand, while others prefer the use of machinery and intense fertilization.|$|R
