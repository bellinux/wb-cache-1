The <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>post</b> mortem changes <b>in</b> ostrich muscle was studied by following isometric tension, shortening and change in pH during the first 24 h post mortem within muscle strips from the muscularis gastrocnemius, pars interna at constant temperatures of 7 °C and 37 °C. Maximum shortening was significantly higher at 37 °C (33. 4 ± 3. 57 %) than at 7 °C (10. 7 ± 2. 63 %). The rate of rigor development was temperature dependent, reaching a maximum tension at 4. 08 ± 3. 89 h <b>post</b> mortem <b>in</b> muscle strips at 37 °C; while at 7 °C maximum tension was reached at 10. 5 ± 6. 47 h post mortem.
