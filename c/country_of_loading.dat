25|$|High {{voltages}} have disadvantages, such as {{the increased}} insulation required, and generally increased difficulty in their safe handling. In a power plant, energy is generated at a convenient voltage {{for the design of}} a generator, and then stepped up to a high voltage for transmission. Near the loads, the transmission voltage is stepped down to the voltages used by equipment. Consumer voltages vary somewhat depending on the <b>country</b> and size <b>of</b> <b>load,</b> but generally motors and lighting are built to use up to a few hundred volts between phases. The voltage delivered to equipment such as lighting and motor loads is standardized, with an allowable range of voltage over which equipment is expected to operate. Standard power utilization voltages and percentage tolerance vary in the different mains power systems found in the world. High-voltage direct-current (HVDC) electric power transmission systems have become more viable as technology has provided efficient means of changing the voltage of DC power. HVDC systems, however, tend to be more expensive and less efficient over shorter distances than transformers. Transmission with high voltage direct current was not feasible {{in the early days of}} electric power transmission, as there was then no economically viable way to step down the voltage of DC for end user applications such as lighting incandescent bulbs.|$|R

Dynamic fuzzy {{reliability}} {{models of}} mechanical components are proposed {{in this paper}} {{in the case of}} small samples <b>of</b> <b>load.</b> The proposed models are established based on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>load</b> obtained from a load history, which reflects the relationship among the occurrence frequency <b>of</b> <b>loads</b> with different magnitude in a given time period, rather than the distribution at each load application. To deal with the uncertainty of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>load</b> from a load history due to the randomness of the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>load</b> at each load application, the statistical parameters involved in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>load</b> are modeled as fuzzy variables.
