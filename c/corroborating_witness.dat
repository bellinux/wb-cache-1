50|$|Several {{years after}} the Boccia murder, Rupolo was arrested for the {{attempted}} murder of another mobster. Assured by his crime family that the victim would withdraw the charges, Rupolo turned himself in to the police. When the victim did not drop the charges, Rupolo felt betrayed by the family. Wanting to avoid 48 years in prison, Rupolo confessed to the Boccia murder and implicated Genovese in it. However, when the case came to trial, {{the court ruled that}} Rupolo's testimony was unreliable. In 1937, Genovese was forced to flee to Italy to avoid trial on this case. Rupolo was given nine years in prison for the Boccia murder. In 1944, Rupolo named mobster Peter LaTempa as a <b>corroborating</b> <b>witness</b> to Bocia's murder. Prosecutors now had a good witness to use against Genovese when they caught him.|$|E

5000|$|On May 1, 2014, the U.S. Department of Education {{released}} {{a list of}} 55 colleges being investigated for potential violations of federal law regarding sexual assault and harassment complaints. The list included Hobart and William Smith Colleges. [...] A New York Times article published in July {{of the same year}} detailed a case in which a student reported a sexual assault by three college football players two weeks into her first year; within two weeks the college's investigation cleared the two men accused, despite medical evidence, a <b>corroborating</b> <b>witness</b> to one of the incidents and discrepancies in the alleged perpetrators' accounts of the evening. The story also alleged that the members of the disciplinary panel that heard the case were uninformed about sexual assault and frequently changed the subject rather than hear the victim's account of events. Following the report, the colleges unveiled new initiatives and policies, including revising their sexual violence policies, creating a rape hotline and forming an Office of Title IX Programs and Compliance.|$|E
5000|$|Brownmiller's book {{is widely}} {{credited}} with changing public outlooks and attitudes about rape. It is cited as having influenced changes in law regarding rape, such as state criminal codes {{that required a}} <b>corroborating</b> <b>witness</b> to a rape, and that permitted a defendant's lawyer to introduce evidence in court regarding a victim's prior sexual history. Mary Ellen Gale, writing for The New York Times Book Review said that [...] "Against Our Will deserves {{a place on the}} shelf next to those rare books about social problems which force us to make connections we have too long evaded, and change the way we feel about what we know." [...] It was included in the New York Public Library's Books of the Century, which listed 100 books that greatly influenced different aspects of culture. The critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt gave the book a mostly positive review in The New York Times, noting that Brownmiller [...] "organized an enormous body of information into a multipurposed tool" [...] that gave a program for modernizing rape laws while considering the treatment of rape in war overly detailed and numbing.|$|E

The first witness, William Gant, identifies Barksdale, but the <b>corroborating</b> <b>witness,</b> a security guard named Nakeesha Lyles, changes her story and refuses to identify him. The jury therefore returns a not guilty verdict. Judge Phelan calls McNulty into his chambers, where McNulty reveals that he has noticed that D'Angelo's uncle Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell have been tied to many murders and tells Phelan that he believes they are major players in West Baltimore's drug trade. McNulty {{makes the point that}} nobody is investigating their organization, and Phelan calls Deputy Commissioner Burrell. Major Rawls is incensed by McNulty's evasion of the chain of command, and forces him to write the report which Burrell requests about the Barksdale murders.

40|$|ABSTRACT Using a more {{conversational}} analytical approach, {{this paper}} examines the various situated {{ways in which}} secondary school students, in interaction with teachers, describe and explain their disruptive classroom behaviour. The focus is on how students account for their behaviour and force accountability on teachers. Students gave accounts and made teachers accountable by dening disruptive behaviour in relation to schoolwork and claims about normality, and by drawing on common understandings about teacher identity. In doing so, various discursive devices were used such as extreme case formulations, introducing <b>corroborating</b> <b>witnesses,</b> deploying the notion of consistency, giving detailed descriptions, making category contrasts, and displaying uncertainty and incomprehension. The different accounts all worked {{in the direction of}} emphasising the role of the teacher, and the analysis raises questions about power relations in school and the empowerment of students...|$|R

5000|$|Witness {{testimony}} {{is a common}} form of evidence in law, and law has mechanisms to test witness evidence for reliability or credibility. Legal processes for the taking and assessment of evidence are formalized. Some witness testimony may be described as anecdotal evidence, such as individual stories of harassment {{as part of a}} class action lawsuit. However, witness testimony can be tested and assessed for reliability. Examples of approaches to testing and assessment include the use of questioning to identify possible gaps or inconsistencies. evidence of <b>corroborating</b> <b>witnesses,</b> documents, video and forensic evidence.

25|$|On July 8, 2017, Reinhart {{was arrested}} for battery after {{allegedly}} punching a bouncer. Reinhart's lawyer, Dina LaPolt, says of the incident that Reinhart was assaulted by bouncers at Lamplighter Inn in Palatine, Illinois without provocation and forcefully removed from the establishment while a friend in her party was violently beaten, sustaining multiple injuries. LaPolt expressed plans to take legal action against the bouncers involved in the incident. An active investigation into the event is underway, with police confirming on July 12, 2017, that a person was injured during the altercation, without revealing {{the identities of the}} injured person or their attacker. Reinhart appeared in court on August 2, 2017, and plead not guilty to a charge of misdemeanor battery. Her next court date is scheduled for October 6, 2017, at which time the case may go to trial. During the hearing, Reinhart's lawyer, Carmine Trombetta, described Reinhart as a victim, not a perpetrator in this case, and stated he is working on obtaining security footage to <b>corroborate</b> <b>witness</b> statements he already obtained in regards to the incident.|$|R
