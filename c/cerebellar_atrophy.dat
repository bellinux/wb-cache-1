25|$|Type 2 episodic ataxia (EA2) is {{characterized}} by acetazolamide-responsive attacks of ataxia with or without migraine. Patients with EA2 may also present with progressive <b>cerebellar</b> <b>atrophy,</b> nystagmus, vertigo, visual disturbances and dysarthria. These symptoms last from hours to days, in contrast with EA1, which lasts from seconds to minutes. Like EA1, attacks can be precipitated by emotional or physical stress, but also by coffee and alcohol. EA2 is caused by mutations in CACNA1A, which encodes the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel CaV2.1, and is also the gene responsible for causing spinocerebellar ataxia type-6 and familial hemiplegic migraine type-1. EA2 is {{also referred to as}} episodic ataxia with nystagmus, hereditary paroxysmal cerebellopathy, familial paroxysmal ataxia and acetazolamide-responsive hereditary paroxysmal cerebellar ataxia (AHPCA). There are currently 19 mutations associated with EA2, though only 3 have been characterized electrophysiologically, table 2 and figure 2. Of these, all result in decreased current through these channels. It is assumed that the other mutations, especially the splicing and frameshift mutations, also result in a drastic decrease in CaV2.1 currents, though {{this may not be the}} case for all mutations. CACNA1A is heavily expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum where it is involved in coupling action potentials with neurotransmitter release. Thus, decrease in Ca2+ entry through CaV2.1 channels is expected to result in decreased output from Purkinje cells, even though they will fire at an appropriate rate. Alternatively, some CACNA1A mutations, such as those seen in familial hemiplegic migraine type-1, result in increased Ca2+ entry and, thereby, aberrant transmitter release. This can also result in excitotoxicity, as may occur in some cases of spinocerebellar ataxia type-6.|$|E

40|$|Hereditary ataxias {{comprise}} {{a group of}} genetically heterogeneous disorders characterized by clinically variable cerebellar dysfunction and accompanied by involvement of other organ systems.

2500|$|Type-6 episodic ataxia (EA6) {{is a rare}} form of episodic ataxia, {{identified}} initially in a 10-year-old boy {{who first}} presented with 30 minute bouts of decreased muscle tone during infancy. He required [...] "balance therapy" [...] {{as a young child}} to aid in walking and has a number of ataxic attacks, each separated by months to years. These attacks were precipitated by fever. He has <b>cerebellar</b> <b>atrophy</b> and subclinical seizures. During later attacks, he also presented with distortions of the left hemifield, ataxia, slurred speech, followed by headache. After enrolling in school, he developed bouts of rhythmic arm jerking with concomitant confusion, also lasting approximately 30 minutes. He also has presented, at various times, with migraines. This patient carries a proline to arginine substitution in the fifth transmembrane-spanning segment of the gene SLC1A3. This gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) protein, which is responsible for glutamate uptake. In cell culture assays, this mutation results in drastically decreased glutamate uptake in a dominant-negative manner. This is likely due to decreased synthesis or protein stability. As this protein is expressed heavily in the brainstem and cerebellum, it is likely that this mutation results in excitotoxicity and/or hyperexcitability leading to ataxia and seizures. Mutations in EAAT1 (GLAST) have subsequently been identified in a family with episodic ataxia.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares {{data from}} normals and 5 groups of {{cerebellar}} patients collected in an at-tempt to quantify and characterize their postural sway while standing erect. It extends and supple-ments earlier work by Dichgans et al. (1976) and Mauritz et al. (1979). The results largely confirm {{those of the}} previous authors, describing patterns of sway abnormality that are specific to a given localization of the disease within the cerebellum. New is the differentiation of spinal ataxia in Friedreich's ataxia from anterior lobe <b>atrophies</b> and vestibulo-spinal <b>cerebellar</b> diseases. This study also gives a statistical analysis of the diagnostic importance of single sway parameters. The 5 patient groups represent he most com-mon localizations of diseases causing cerebellar symptoms: (1) Friedreich's disease, which is proto-typical for a disorder of spino-cerebellar fferents, (2) atrophy of the anterior cerebellar lobe, the spino-cerebellum, to which spino-cerebellar ffer-ents mainly project, (3) the vestibulo-cerebellum forming the lower vermis, (4) the cerebellar hemi-spheres, and (5) diffuse <b>cerebellar</b> <b>atrophies.</b> The pattern of recorded abnormalities has been evaluated as to the significance of every pathologi-cal result for localizing the causal disease. As a consequence of this, posturography is now a valua-ble tool in clinical diagnosis and quantitative documentation of postural ataxia for follow-up studies...|$|R
40|$|Clinical data on 244 probands with spinocerebellar types, 163 with late {{cortical}} <b>cerebellar</b> <b>atrophies</b> (LCCA), and 180 with olivopontocerebellar atrophies (OPCA) were analysed. Spinocerebellar {{cases were}} divided into three according to their estimated genetic mechanisms: recessive, dominant, or sporadic. Ages of onset were identical in sporadic spinocerebellar types, LCCA, and OPCA, the average being about 50. They showed highly correlated clinical patterns. In the light of other evidence, these diseases may represent a premature aging process in the central nervous system, probably determined multifactorially. Recessive spinocerebellar cases were very few. There were 127 cases of spinocerebellar types with dominant inheritance, characterised by age of onset around 33, colourful ocular signs, and spasticity. A large family with this disease was described in which 34 patients were affected through five generations. The computed tomograms showed an almost normal cerebellum and electronystagmograms indicated patterns of vestibulocular impairment. No necropsied case was available among the present material, but in pathological reports of similar cases, major lesions {{were found in the}} ventral and the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts, Clarke's columns, and the posterior columns in the spinal cord. This disease, or hereditary spastic ataxia, represented a fairly well-defined entity inherited dominantly among a group of cases with spinocerebellar types, and it was separable from LCCA or OPCA, not only on clinical and genetic grounds, but by a predominantly spinal involvement...|$|R
40|$|Family data on 299 probands with spinocerebellar types, 163 with late {{cortical}} <b>cerebellar</b> <b>atrophies</b> (LCCA), and 180 with olivopontocerebellar atrophies (OPCA) were analysed. Spinocerebellar types included {{cases with}} cerebellar ataxia combined with spasticity. Their family history was not compatible with sex linked inheritance.

The genetic ratio was 0. 5 for each decade at onset between 20 and 59, suggesting that these cases were dominant. The proportion of these familial cases, however, decreased with increasing age at onset, and there were quite a few sporadic cases among the elderly. LCCA and OPCA were considered to represent extremes of a correlated disease spectrum. Although they were weakly familial, single gene heredity was rejected. Sib recurrence rate was 7. 5 % for LCCA and 9. 4 % for OPCA. When calculated for different age groups at onset, the rates decreased with increasing age in the two diseases. The rates increased to 25 % and 20 %, respectively, given two sibs already affected, and to 37. 5 % and 22. 2 % when three were affected.

Frequently, atrophy of the cerebellum occurs. Many ataxias are autosomal dominant, but autosomal recessive (AR) disease occurs as well. Homozygosity mapping in a consanguineous family with three affected children with progressive <b>cerebellar</b> ataxia and <b>atrophy</b> revealed a candidate locus on chromosome 1, containing the CABC 1 /ADCK 3 (the chaperone, ABC 1 activity of bc 1 complex homologue) gene. CABC 1 /ADCK 3 is the homologue of the yeast Coq 8 gene, which {{is involved in}} the ubi-quinone biosynthesis pathway. Mutation analysis of this gene showed a homozygous nonsense mutation (c. 1042 C > T, p. R 348 X). Eight additional patients with AR <b>cerebellar</b> ataxia and <b>atrophy</b> were screened for mutations in the CABC 1 /ADCK 3 gene. One patient was compound heterozygous for the same c. 1042 C > T mutation and a second nonsense mutation (c. 1136 T > A, p. L 379 X). Both mutations created a premature stop codon, triggering nonsense mediated mRNA decay as the pathogenic mechanism. We found no evidence of a Dutch founder for the c. 1042 C > T mutation in AR ataxia.

In the research done by Trouillas in Lyon France, the pharmacology of cerebellar ataxia was examined by manipulating key components found at the nerve level within the cerebellum or the inferior Olive.

The clinical benefits presented in this study justifying the prescription of d-l-5-HTP or better with the l-5-HTP with benserazide to patients with certain cerebellar ataxias including that of Dyschronometria.

Therefore, any test helping in this differential diagnosis might have a potential clinical interest. In this study, {{our goal was to}} investigate the adaptation to increased inertia in patients with sOPCA exhibiting combined cerebellar and pyramidal signs, during the performance of fast wrist flexions. We found that these patients exhibited a hypermetria which remained unchanged after addition of inertia, because they were unable to increase neither their agonist activity (launching force), nor their antagonist activity (braking force). This contrasts with our previous findings in patients with CCA. In these latter, the hypermetria worsened when the inertial load of the hand increased because those patients were able to increase their agonist activity, but not their antagonist activity. The adaptation to inertia might thus help to differentiate CCA and sOPCA. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
