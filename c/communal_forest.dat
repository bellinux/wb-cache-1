40|$|Even {{though many}} {{communities}} in Tigray have {{developed their own}} institutions and methods of environmental management that enjoy great local legitimacy, the interventions by government and numerous projects {{in the name of}} development and environmental protection have generally failed to recognize this. Hence, a study on understanding the local forest management institutions and their role in conserving biodiversity of woody plants were carried out in Alamata woreda, southern zone of Tigray Region, Northern Ethiopia. This study attempted to compare vegetation composition of three <b>communal</b> <b>forests</b> with adjacent free grazing lands. Investigation of vegetation parameters was undertaken from 84 plots with size of 20 m x 20 m laid systematically along transect lines. Data from group discussion and 120 household surveys was also collected in order to understand their institutional arrangements and the perception of the local community towards <b>communal</b> <b>forests.</b> A total of 30 species of woody plants of trees were recorded in the three <b>communal</b> <b>forests</b> and six in the three free grazing lands. Comparing the diversity of woody species of trees, all the 3 <b>communal</b> <b>forests</b> are significantly different (P< 0. 01) from the free grazing lands. The local forest management institutions in the three study sites had clear boundary of forests, defined users, use rules, monitoring procedures, sanctions and conflict-resolution mechanisms among users. Ninety five of the respondents prefer the <b>communal</b> <b>forests</b> to continue {{under the control of the}} local people. All of the informants are happy about the way local institutions manage the <b>communal</b> <b>forests.</b> In addition, all agree with the rules and penalties. The Pearson chi-square test reveals that the educational level, age, sex, wealth, oxen possession and occupation of the respondents and their attitude and perception towards the <b>communal</b> <b>forests</b> are not significant at p< 0. 05. However, the survey proved that there is difference among the female household heads and male household heads in their participation in the meetings of the forest management.

40|$|In {{community}} forest, management {{the responsibility}} for making proper arrangements on both technical and organizational aspects rests with local villagers based on their objectives. Much {{progress has been made}} in obtaining a better understanding about these different objectives of local people for managing tree resources. The starting premise of this research is to tackle the issue of management of <b>communal</b> <b>forests</b> on sustainable basis for the sake of attaining pre-specified objectives by the rural communities. Singa locality was selected as a case study for this research. Despite the wide spread of community forestry activity in its different forms in the study area, the activity is challenged by the commitment participation of local inhabitants to guarantee sustainable development of the activity. The extensionists used to focus on nursery techniques and tree planting and ignore the other silvicultural operations. This situation becomes worse with the phase-out of the NGOs from the study area [...] The broad objective of this research is to assess the potentiality of managing the <b>communal</b> <b>forests</b> on sustainable bases. Two types of data were used to collect the necessary information, namely, primary and secondary data. The primary data was principally collected through interviews with the local people the secondary data includes FNC files, annual reports, projects documents and pervious studies conducted in the same sides. Although animal rearing is the main economic activity in the area, the local people proved to be able to establish <b>communal</b> <b>forests.</b> The FNC and the traditional leaders are the initiators of the idea of community forests in the study area. The different activities of community forestry were made through nafir (working party). The <b>communal</b> <b>forests</b> in the study area are established along the seasonal watercourses and low depressions (mayaa). The FNC encouraged the local people to conserve the tree resources through declaration of community forests and registration after the name of the villages. The main objective of the <b>communal</b> <b>forests</b> in the study area is to generate income for the development of the local communities through provision of public services. The management of the forests is mainly done by elected village committees, which are responsible for mobilization of local people, marketing of products and distribution of benefits. The main conclusion of the study is the possibility of replicating the model of <b>communal</b> <b>forests</b> in similar sites through the collaboration of the FNC and the traditional leaders. The villages' committees play a significant role in the management of the <b>communal</b> <b>forests.</b> The study also arrived to useful recommendations...|$|R

The scope of this researchfocuses on the assessment of geneder analysis according to the differentactivities of community forestry. The broad objective of this research isto assess how best to involve all stakeholders based on gender analysis in the innovation process of community forestry.

There is a general preference of mixed <b>communal</b> <b>forests</b> in which men and women work together; women are subjected to extension more than men due to their keenness to attend meetings.

50|$|Faid shared {{woodlands}} {{and wilderness}} {{with the town}} of Cochem, {{and from time to}} time, this caused problems. On 29 March 1546, Elector Ludwig von Hagen decreed that each townsman from Faid who wanted to build a new house had leave to remove from the <b>communal</b> <b>forest</b> two cartloads of wood; however, he had to announce his intention beforehand to the mayor in Cochem, who then sent along a sworn forestry officer who would then score each of the trees that the villager was allowed to cut. Firewood seemed to be a particular problem in the <b>communal</b> <b>forest,</b> so much so that in 1744 Cochem town council saw fit to refuse Faid dwellers the privilege of gathering firewood in the parts of the <b>communal</b> <b>forest</b> known as Daustert and Heinterwald, restricting their firewood gathering to Serberg, and then only on established firewood gathering days. The villagers, for their part, refused the new decree and kept gathering firewood in Daustert and Heinterwald, bringing about various incidents between the authorities and the townsmen. In one incident, a squad of armed men led by Cochem’s chronicler forced their way into a household whose owner’s daughter had been caught unlawfully gathering firewood, threw all his belongings about, and seized a calf that they found in a stall, it being the only thing of value. The Elector’s response {{in the face of the}} villagers’ complaints does not seem to have been very helpful, for they eventually went along with the decree.|$|E

Methods include a survey, focus groups, participant observation and adaptive collaborative management processes over a two-year period. Results revealed that while {{a higher percentage}} of men than women participate in the harvest of eight forest products, women participate substantially in product sales and have some control over income. A majority of men and women believe that women participate in decision-making, but that participation was of low efficacy. Women face significant obstacles to effective participation in forest decision-making in the community: weak community organization, pressure by spouses, difficulty organizing among themselves and informal sanctions. Improving meaningful participation of women in decision-making requires addressing challenges and obstacles at multiple levels; obstacles at the communal level, where the future of the forests will be decided, cannot be overcome without attention to the household...|$|R
