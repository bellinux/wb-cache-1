These are capable of sustaining supercurrents in magnetic fields in excess of 20 tesla - with all that implies for the superconducting magnet industry. We outline our attempts to measure transport critical currents in pulsed magnetic fields, up to the 50 T region, on practical artefacts such as coils. We also discuss pulsed magnet technology and describe promising attempts to model the effects seen in our measurements and draw optimistic conclusions about {{the viability of the}} technique for routine, quality assurance measurements well in excess of 20 T - the present day-to-day limit for continuous fields...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{solid-state}} electrochemical sensors {{have been}} designed using the Mg 2 + cation <b>conductors</b> <b>incorporating</b> novel solid-state reference electrodes for in-line monitoring of Mg in molten Al during the refining process and also for in-line monitoring of Mg content in molten Al in the alloying process. In this paper we report the preparation of Mg 2 + ion conductors, MgAl 2 O 4 and MgZr 4 (PO 4) 6, by the solid state ceramic synthesis route, measurement of their electrical properties using ac-impedance spectroscopy and application of the above cation conductors for designing novel electrochemical sensors for monitoring Mg dissolved in molten Al. The activation energy for Mg 2 + ion conduction in MgAl 2 O 4 is 2. 08 eV and in MgZr 4 (PO 4) 6 is 1. 7 eV, respectively. The sensors {{have been found to}} respond rapidly to change in Mg content in molten aluminium around 1000 K...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{conventional}} coaxial cables use braided {{copper wire}} forming the shield. This allows the cable to be flexible, {{but it also means}} there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better shield performance, some cables have a double-layer shield. The shield might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil shield covered by a wire braid. Some cables may invest in more than two shield layers, such as [...] "quad-shield", which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid. Other shield designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some shields are a solid metal tube. Those cables cannot be bent sharply, as the shield will kink, causing losses in the cable. When a foil shield is used a small wire <b>conductor</b> <b>incorporated</b> into the foil makes soldering the shield termination easier.|$|R

For magnetic metals, such as steel, an effective conductivity is introduced to account for the increase in ohmic loss due to the high-frequency permeability.

40|$|The {{development}} of {{voltage and current}} probes for measuring an electron beam's current and position associated with several microsecond-long pulses from advanced Linear Induction Accelerators requires a precision pulser that can deliver both high voltages and high currents to a diagnostics Test Line. Seven-stage, type-E PFNs have been utilized in both a transformer and 4 -stage Marx (plus/minus) configuration. The resulting 50 -ohm pulser delivers to the Test Line a repeatable 100 kV, ca. 2 {micro}s flat-top ({+-} 1 %), 2. 5 {micro}s FWHM pulse with a rise time of 175 ns and 500 ns for the transformer and Marx options, respectively. Methods of reducing the rise time for both options are discussed and modeled. The coaxial Test Line is insulated at up to two atmospheres with SF{sub 6 } and includes two transition regions to hold and test different diameter beam current and position monitors (BPMs). The center <b>conductor</b> <b>incorporates</b> both translation and tip/tilt with an accuracy of 100 {micro}m. Finally, the line is terminated in a matched radial resistor that provides a planar region at fields up to 40 kV/cm for the testing of voltage probes. Both the transformer and Marx options are modeled and compared to experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{family of}} the CuxNi 1 -x (pc) I alloys are new quasi-one-dimensional <b>conductors</b> that <b>incorporate</b> in their {{structure}} a dense array of local moments(Cu+ 2, S = 1 / 2) interacting with free carriers. The microwave conductivity (17 GHz) of these compounds being metallic at room temperature suddenly drops and shows a large positive magneto conductivity at low temperatures. The results on the alloys clearly indicate that the rapid decrease of the conductivity {{is closely related to}} the presence of the Cu+ 2 local moments. Al 1 these observations may possibly be consistent with a one-dimensional Kondo system...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} relations between the members in a choir, and between the members and their conductor. Each member has their own reason (or reasons) for being in the choir, and these reasons influence their choises and their attitudes. This paritcular choir is a chamber choir affiliated with a church in Norway. The church provides a rehersal room, and in return expects the choir to support the singing at Sunday services, and to give concerts. The choir also receives some financial support from the local church. For some members, the affialiation with the church is very important. It is part of their religious service. For others, the consequences of being connected with a church are not desirable, but accepted because they appreciate the conductor, the repertoire and the singing itself. Some members read music, others do not. Some members seem to be more valuable then others, as a result of gender and other values that are formed in the social field that this choir represents. The average age of both the women and the men in this chior is 55, 16 years. This is representative of their homogeny, with regards to both age and in fact social class. In this Thesis, i study the different practises in the choir, and discuss how these practises are influenced both by the church-affiliation, the homogeny of the members, {{and the role of the}} conductor. I analyse the different findings with main focus on the theories provided by Pierre Bordieu regarding social fields, different forms of capital, and the concept of habitus as form of social upbringing, thus shaping individual cognitive patterns of thought. I also use Michel Foucault´s theories on discourse and power to look at the values int the choir, and how hidden power shapes behaviour. Occasionally, i also refer to Michael Polany´s thoughts on tacit knowledge to point out how the choir and/or <b>conductor</b> <b>incorporates</b> knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} display either metallic or semiconducting properties. Both large, multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs), {{with many}} concentric carbon shells, and bundles or ÒropesÓ of aligned single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs), are com-plex composite <b>conductors</b> that <b>incorporate</b> many weakly coupled nanotubes that {{each have a}} different electronic structure. Here we demonstrate a simple and reliable method for selectively removing single carbon shells from MWNTs and SWNT ropes to tailor the properties of these composite nanotubes. We can remove shells of MWNTs stepwise and individually characterize the different shells. By choosing among the shells, we can convert a MWNT into either a metallic or a semiconducting conductor, as well as directly {{address the issue of}} multiple-shell transport. With SWNT ropes, similar selectivity allows us to generate entire arrays of nanoscale Þeld-effect transistors based solely on the fraction of semiconducting SWNTs. Carbon nanotubes exhibit several technolog-ically important characteristics. Metallic (m...|$|R
5000|$|Like many {{broadcast}} orchestras in Germany, {{the orchestra}} {{had a reputation}} for performing contemporary music. Past principal conductors included Sir Neville Marriner (1983-1989), who later held the title of principal guest conductor.

40|$|Abstract: Sulfonated {{polyetheretherketone}} {{has been}} used as polymer matrix for hybrid membrane formation with inorganic proton <b>conductors.</b> Membranes <b>incorporating</b> up to 40 % w/w of inorganic proton conductor, including amorphous silica, zirconium phosphate sulfophenylphosphonate and zirconium phosphate, have been prepared. The membranes have been characterised using powder X-ray diffraction and MAS NMR spectroscopy where appropriate, and conductivity measurements performed as a function of relative humidity (RH) at 100 °C and as a function of temperature at 100 % RH. In all cases, the presence of the inorganic particles leads to an increase in conductivity of the polymer membrane, and is without detriment to its flexibility. For example, PEEK-S-based membranes containing 10 % amorphous silica, 30 % zirconium phosphate or 40 % amorphous zirconium phosphate sulfophenylphosphonate present conductivities in the range 0. 03 – 0. 09 Scm- 1 at 100 °C/ 100 % RH. Polarisation characteristics for PEEK-S membranes containing 25 and 13 % w/w of zirconium phosphate under conditions of hydrogen/ oxygen and hydrogen/air respectively are reported, up to 120 °C...|$|R
40|$|The size of {{conductor}} in a distibution {{system is}} an important parameter as it determines the current density and {{the resistance of the}} line. A lower conductor size can cause high I 2 R losses and high voltage drop which causes a loss of revenue as consumer’s consumption lower and hence revenue is reduced. In this paper a new approach isproposed to optimally select the conductors for minimum loss in the distribution system. Differential evolution algorithm is used to select optimal conductor type for each feeder. The objective function modeled in this paper consists of sum of capital investment and capitalized energy loss cost. Voltage constraints and maximum currentcarrying capacity of the <b>conductors</b> are also <b>incorporated</b> in the objective function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulations are carried out on 32 bus system and results obtained are encouraging...|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} a scattering theory of weakly nonlinear thermoelectric transport through sub-micron scale <b>conductors.</b> The theory <b>incorporates</b> the leading nonlinear contributions in temperature and voltage biases {{to the charge}} and heat currents. Because of the finite capacitances of sub-micron scale conducting circuits, fundamental conservation laws such as gauge invariance and current conservation require special care to be preserved. We do this by extending the approach of Christen and Büttiker [Europhys. Lett. 35, 523 (1996) ] to coupled charge and heat transport. In this way we write relations connecting nonlinear transport coefficients {{in a manner similar}} to Mott's relation between the linear thermopower and the linear conductance. We derive sum rules that nonlinear transport coefficients must satisfy to preserve gauge invariance and current conservation. We illustrate our theory by calculating the efficiency of heat engines and the coefficient of performance of thermoelectric refrigerators based on quantum point contacts and resonant tunneling barriers. We identify in particular rectification effects that increase device performance. Comment: 10 + page...|$|R
40|$|In the potential-current representation, transmission-line {{parameters}} in the Transmission-Line Super Theory (TLST) do {{not have}} a direct physical meaning – they are gauge dependent, i. e. : they are different in the Lorenz and Coulomb gauge. However, they retain traces of their classical origin: They are constituted of capacitances and inductances for forward and backward running waves along the lines. Therefore their corresponding matrices are not symmetrical {{as in the case of}} classical transmission-line theory. In the charge-current representation the parameter matrices have a physical meaning: their elements consist of damping functions due to the non-uniformities of the lines and of the propagation functions along the lines, <b>incorporating</b> <b>conductor</b> and radiation losses. The transmission line parameters also contribute to the total radiated power of the lines. The attempt to quantize radiation locally, fails because radiation describes a long-range (integral) interaction, and therefore affects all conductor parts of all lines. However, it can be stated that at stronger inhomogeneities the local contributions to radiation increase, and are particularly recognizable along the risers...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a general procedure {{to extract the}} wave function of quasiparticles in AC-driven quantum <b>conductors.</b> By <b>incorporating</b> the Bloch-Messiah reduction into the scattering theory approach to quantum transport, we construct the many-body state from the scattering matrix, within which the wave function of quasiparticles can be extracted. We find that two kinds of quasiparticles can be excited, while {{both of them are}} superpositions of particle and hole states in the Fermi sea. Due to the electron number conservation, the quasiparticles are always created in pairs, resulting in particle-hole pair excitations in quantum conductors. We apply our approach to compare these particle-hole pairs excited in perfectly transparent quantum contacts and mesoscopic capacitors with single-level quantum dot. For the quantum contacts, multiple pairs can be excited, while the excitation probability of each pair increases as the strength of the driving field increasing. The particle(hole) components are always in phase (180 degrees out of phase) with the driving field. These features agree with the results obtained via the extended Keldysh-Green's function technique. For the mesoscopic capacitors, only one particle-hole pair can be excited, while the corresponding excitation probability undergoes an oscillation as the strength of the driving field increasing. A nonzero phase delay between the particle(hole) component and the driving field exists, which can be tuned via the dot-lead coupling in the mesoscopic capacitor. These features are very distinct from the case of quantum contacts, which {{can be attributed to the}} finite dwell time of electrons in the mesoscopic capacitor. We also find that our approach can also offer a general way to extract the wave function of quasiparticles from the Wigner function, making it helpful for the signal processing of relevant experiments in electron quantum optics...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{attempted}} to observe and understand the reorchestrations of the four Robert Schumann symphonies through the analysis of revisions found in the edited scores of several eminent conductors. To provide a faithful and effective performance of Schumann's orchestral conception, the conductor may {{find it necessary to}} alter certain features in his scores. Conductors have complained that Schumann's symphonies are ineffectual in many passages. This is the reason they are less frequently performed than they deserve. Four performance editions of the complete Schumann symphonies were chosen to form the basis for this study. They are: Gustav Mahler, Arturo Toscanini, George Szell, Felix Weingartner. The revisions of other <b>conductors</b> were <b>incorporated</b> as available and appropriate. These include: Fritz Reiner, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwangler, Georg Solti, Joseph Keilberth, Gotthold Lessing, Willem Mengelberg, Eugene Ormandy, Hans Pfitzner, Theodore Thomas, Max Reger, Fritz Busch. The study of Schumann's orchestration involved the investigation of his development as an orchestral composer, including the influence of the piano on his scoring and his understanding of the orchestra. The state of the orchestra in Schumann's time and his development as an orchestral composer were also studied in order to better understand his technique in terms of his orchestral experience. The study of the revisions reveals that Schumann's scoring was less successful than many other composers in providing an orchestration which supports and clarifies the structural logic of the composition. It thus becomes the conductor's responsibility to assume the role of editor to provide a faithful performance of the work. Analysis of the reorchestrations reveals changes concerning dynamic balance, clarity, timbre and style, as well as manner of performance. This study {{has attempted to}} provide vital information about the performing editions and the aesthetic effect achieved through alteration of the original Schumann scores...|$|R
