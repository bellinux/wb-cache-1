40|$|Ever since arsenic {{contamination}} of groundwater {{was discovered in}} Bangladesh in the 1990 ’s, several international organizations and NGOs have been constructing safe <b>water</b> <b>devices</b> for mitigating the associated problems. However, many such safe <b>water</b> <b>devices</b> were abandoned {{due to lack of}} maintenance. This article analyzes how and why the use of these devices had stopped, through the use of interviews made with officials of the device operating committees. It was found that, in one example, an active safe <b>water</b> <b>device</b> had a well-organized operating committee, headed by a leading member of the community who was held in high regard. In contrast, an inactive safe <b>water</b> <b>device</b> in a neighboring village was found to have an unstable organizing committee; in this case an unmotivated community leader who had his own access to safe drinking water. The maintenance of safe <b>water</b> <b>devices</b> therefore greatly depends on leadership in the community. A future concern should see the implementation of methods of sustainable device maintenance that is free from the issues of community unity and/or leadership. 国民の９割が地下水を飲用に利用しているバングラデシュでは 1990 年代に地下水砒素汚染が明らかになり問題になっている｡以降､国内外の機関によって対策活動として､安全な水を供給するための装置(代替水源装置) が建設されてきた｡しかし､建設された多くの代替水源装置において維持管理が適切に行われず結果的に放棄される例などが報告されている｡本研究は､代替水源装置の運営(維持管理) がどうして､どのように立ち行かなくなっていくのかということについて､装置の管理組合の役員にインタビューを行い､明らかにするものである｡順調に稼動している代替水源装置においては､尊敬されている人物が組合のリーダーを務めておりその人物を中心として利用世帯がまとまっていたり､日常的に装置のメンテナンスを行う人物の存在が見られた｡一方､維持管理が放棄されている代替水源装置においては､組合のリーダーや､コミュニティ全体に関連する問題が見られた｡今後､放棄される代替水源装置の数を減らし､代替水源装置によって安定的に安全な水を供給するためには､いいリーダーがいない､又はまとまって何かを解決することが難しいという地域社会において､どうすれば代替水源装置は安定的に稼動させることができるのかという点が重要な課題となるであろう...|$|R

There were 128 dairy farms participating in this study;For this study a novel method of sampling drinking water directly from drinking devices was utilized. There were 59 dairy farms using wells, 68 farms using rural water and 1 farm using spring water for the drinking water source. Contemporary production data was from DHIA records;The following parameters were measured, coliform, pH, total dissolved solids, nitrate, sulfate, and 22 minerals. A record of the type and amount of <b>watering</b> <b>devices</b> available for drinking water for lactating dairy cattle were taken.

Elevated sulfate concentration in drinking water has a positive effect on milk production;Information about how drinking water was provided was also recorded. Positive effects on milk production were an increasing linear inches per cow available for drinking, the use of cups as drinking <b>water</b> <b>devices</b> and an increasing frequency of cleaning of <b>water</b> <b>devices.</b> An increasing distance from the feed bunk to the first available <b>water</b> <b>device</b> and not using drinking cup devices had a negative effect on milk production;Additional relationships of drinking water quality and the performance of Iowa dairy cattle are being delineated...|$|R

The present {{study was conducted to}} determine the effect of Noni (Morinda citrifolia) fruit juice {{in drinking water}} on male broiler chicken performance. The study used 100 male broiler chicken at 3 days of age strain Platinum MB 202 produced by PT. Multi Breeder Adhirama Indonesia (Grup PT Jafpa Comfeed Indonesia) Bandar Lampung. The study was assigned into The Completely Randomized Design with 5 treatments and 4 replications. Chicken were housed in 20 unit colony cages in size 100 x 50 x 50 cm each. The treatments were level of noni fruit juice in drinking water; R 0 (control, chicken were not drunk noni fruit juice), R 1 (<b>chicken</b> drank <b>water</b> contained 2, 5 % noni fruit juice), R 2 (<b>chicken</b> drank <b>water</b> contained 5 % noni fruit juice), R 3 (<b>chicken</b> drank <b>water</b> contained 7, 5 % noni fruit juice) and R 4 (<b>chicken</b> drank <b>water</b> contained 10 % noni fruit juice). Chicken fed similar ration containing 23. 58 % crude protein and 3943 kkal/kg gross energy. The selected noni fruit were mature fruit or has color white yellowish. Ration and drinking water were offered ad libitum. During the experiment, chicken were vaccinated only by Vaccine ND on 4 days of age. Chicken were kept for 4 weeks. Parameters measured were feed consumption, drinking water consumption, body weight gain and feed conversion ratio. Collected data were analyzed by analysis of variance and significant effect on the parameters were tested by Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. Result of this study showed that there was not significant (P> 0, 05) effect noni fruit juice in drinking water on feed consumption, drinking water consumption, body weight gain and feed conversion ratio.
