25|$|If a {{group of}} neurons engages in {{synchronized}} oscillatory activity, the neural ensemble can be mathematically represented as a single oscillator. Different neural ensembles are coupled through long-range connections and form a network of weakly <b>coupled</b> <b>oscillators</b> at the next spatial scale. Weakly <b>coupled</b> <b>oscillators</b> can generate a range of dynamics including oscillatory activity. Long-range connections between different brain structures, such as the thalamus and the cortex (see thalamocortical oscillation), involve time-delays due to the finite conduction velocity of axons. Because most connections are reciprocal, they form feed-back loops that support oscillatory activity. Oscillations recorded from multiple cortical areas can become synchronized to form large scale brain networks, whose dynamics and functional connectivity can be studied by means of spectral analysis and Granger causality measures. Coherent activity of large-scale brain activity may form dynamic links between brain areas required for the integration of distributed information.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{physical}} {{systems can be}} modeled as sets of <b>coupled</b> <b>oscillators.</b> The motions of such oscillators can be decomposed into normal modes, like the vibrational modes of a piano string or the resonances of an organ pipe. On the other hand, equipartition often breaks down for such systems, {{because there is no}} exchange of energy between the normal modes. In an extreme situation, the modes are independent and so their energies are independently conserved. This shows that some sort of mixing of energies, formally called ergodicity, is important for the law of equipartition to hold.|$|E

40|$|Coupled oscillator-based {{networks}} are an attractive approach for implementing hardware neural networks based on emerging nanotechnologies. However, the readout {{of the state}} of a <b>coupled</b> <b>oscillator</b> network is a difficult challenge in hardware implementations, as it necessitates complex signal processing to evaluate the degree of synchronization between oscillators, possibly more complicated than the <b>coupled</b> <b>oscillator</b> network itself. In this work, we focus on a <b>coupled</b> <b>oscillator</b> network particularly adapted to emerging technologies, and evaluate two schemes for reading synchronization patterns that can be readily implemented with basic CMOS circuits. Through simulation of a simple generic <b>coupled</b> <b>oscillator</b> network, we compare the operation of these readout techniques with a previously proposed full statistics evaluation scheme. Our approaches provide results nearly identical to the mathematical method, but also show better resilience to moderate noise, which is a major concern for hardware implementations. These results open the door to widespread realization of hardware coupled oscillator-based neural systems.

2500|$|The {{cause of}} this {{behavior}} was that the two pendulums were affecting each other through slight motions of the supporting mantlepiece.

2500|$|When the Boeing 757-200 entered {{service in}} 1983, it was {{equipped}} with the first suitable ring laser gyroscope. This gyroscope took many years to develop, and the experimental models went through many changes before it was deemed ready for production by the engineers and managers of Honeywell and Boeing. It was an outcome of the competition with mechanical gyroscopes, which kept improving. The reason Honeywell, of all companies, chose to develop the laser gyro {{was that they were}} the only one that didn't have a successful line of mechanical gyroscopes, so they wouldn't be competing against themselves. The first problem they had to solve was that with laser gyros rotations below a certain minimum could not be detected at all, due to a problem called [...] "lock-in", whereby the two beams act like <b>coupled</b> <b>oscillators</b> and pull each other's frequencies toward convergence and therefore zero output. The solution was to shake the gyro rapidly so that it never settled into lock-in. Paradoxically, too regular of a dithering motion produced an accumulation of short periods of lock-in when the device was at rest at the extremities of its shaking motion. This was cured by applying a random white noise to the vibration. The material of the block was also changed from quartz to a new glass ceramic Cer-Vit, made by Owens Corning, because of helium leaks.|$|E

These networks lead to slow sequential switching between cluster states that is driven by noise and/or imperfections in the system.
