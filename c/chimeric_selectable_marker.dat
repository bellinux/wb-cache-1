40|$|This {{dialogue}} {{was held}} between the Guest Editors of the Special Issue on "Plant Transgenesis" of the Int. J. Dev. Biol. and Marc De Block. He {{was one of}} the first scientists worldwide to obtain transgenic plants transformed with the <b>chimeric</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> genes encoding neomycin phosphotransferase and bialaphos that confer resistance against the antibiotic kanamycin and the herbicide Basta®/glufosinate, respectively at the Department of Genetics of Ghent University and, later on, at the spin-off company, Plant Genetic Systems. Today, these two genes are still the most frequently utilized markers in transgene technology. Marc De Block chose to work on the improvement of crops in an industrial environment to help realize the production of superior seeds or products. He was part of the team that developed the male sterility/restorer system in canola (Brassica napus var. napus) that led to the first hybrid lines to be commercialized as successful products of transgene technology. In more than 30 years of research, he developed transformation procedures for numerous crops, designed histochemical, biochemical and physiological assays to monitor plant performance, and made original and innovative contributions to plant biology. Presently, he considers transgenic research part of the toolbox for plant improvement and essential for basic plant research...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{fundamental}} step {{in evolution}} was {{the transition from}} unicellular to differentiated, multicellular organisms. Volvocine algae {{have been used for}} several decades as a model lineage to investigate the evolutionary aspects of multicellularity and cellular differentiation. There are two well-studied volvocine species, a unicellular alga (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) and a multicellular alga with differentiated cell types (Volvox carteri). Species with intermediate characteristics also exist, which blur the boundaries between unicellularity and differentiated multicellularity. These species include the globular alga Eudorina elegans, which is composed of 16 – 32 cells. However, detailed molecular analyses of E. elegans require genetic manipulation. Unfortunately, genetic engineering has not yet been established for Eudorina, and only limited DNA and/or protein sequence information is available. Results Here, we describe the stable nuclear transformation of E. elegans by particle bombardment using both a <b>chimeric</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> and reporter genes from different heterologous sources. Transgenic algae resistant to paromomycin were achieved using the aminoglycoside 3 ′ -phosphotransferase VIII (aph VIII) gene of Streptomyces rimosus, an actinobacterium, under the control of an artificial promoter consisting of two V. carteri promoters in tandem. Transformants exhibited an increase in resistance to paromomycin by up to 333 -fold. Co-transformation with non-selectable plasmids was achieved with a rate of 50 - 100 %. The luciferase (gluc) gene from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps, which previously was engineered to match the codon usage of C. reinhardtii, was used as a reporter gene. The expression of gluc was mediated by promoters from C. reinhardtii and V. carteri. Heterologous heat shock promoters induced an increase in luciferase activity (up to 600 -fold) at elevated temperatures. Long-term stability and both constitutive and inducible expression of the co-bombarded gluc gene was demonstrated by transcription analysis and bioluminescence assays. Conclusions Heterologous flanking sequences, including promoters, work in E. elegans and permit both constitutive and inducible expression of heterologous genes. Stable nuclear transformation of E. elegans is now routine. Thus, we show that genetic engineering of a species is possible even without the resources of endogenous genes and promoters. </p...|$|E

40|$|Antibiotic <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> genes {{have been}} widely used to {{generate}} transgenic animals. Once transgenic animals have been obtained, the <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> is no longer necessary but raises public concerns regarding biological safety. The aim {{of this study was to}} prepare competent antibiotic <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> free transgenic cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). PhiC 31 intergrase was used to insert a transgene cassette into a "safe harbor" in the bovine genome. Then, Cre recombinase was employed to excise the <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> under the monitoring of a fluorescent double reporter. By visually tracking the phenotypic switch from red to green fluorescence, antibiotic <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> free cells were easily detected and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For safety, we used phiC 31 mRNA and cell-permeant Cre protein in this study. When used as donor nuclei for SCNT, these safe harbor integrated marker-free transgenic cells supported a similar developmental competence of SCNT embryos compared with that of non-transgenic cells. After embryo transfer, antibiotic <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> free transgenic cattle were generated and anti-bacterial recombinant human β-defensin- 3 in milk was detected during their lactation period. Thus, this approach offers a rapid and safe alternative to produce antibiotic <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> free transgenic farm animals, thereby making it a valuable tool to promote the healthy development and welfare of transgenic farm animals...|$|R
50|$|A <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> {{is carried}} by the vector to allow the {{selection}} of positively transformed cells. Antibiotic resistance is often used as marker, an example being the beta-lactamase gene, which confers resistance to the penicillin group of beta-lactam antibiotics like ampicillin. Some vectors contain two <b>selectable</b> <b>markers,</b> for example the plasmid pACYC177 has both ampicillin and kanamycin resistance gene. Shuttle vector {{which is designed to}} be maintained in two different organisms may also require two <b>selectable</b> <b>markers,</b> although some <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> such as resistance to zeocin and hygromycin B are effective in different cell types. Auxotrophic selection markers that allow an auxotrophic organism to grow in minimal growth medium may also be used; examples of these are LEU2 and URA3 which are used with their corresponding auxotrophic strains of yeast.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new plant vector system for repeated transformation (called MAT for multi-auto- transformation) in which a chimeric ipt gene, inserted into the transposable element Ac, {{is used as a}} <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> for transformation. <b>Selectable</b> <b>marker</b> genes conferring antibiotic or herbicide resistance, used to introduce economically valu- able genes into crop plants, have three major problems: (i) the selective agents have negative effects on proliferation and differentiation of plant cells; (ii) there is uncertainty regard- ing the environmental impact of many <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> genes; (iii) it is difficult to perform recurrent transformations using the same <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> to pyramid desirable genes. The MAT vector system containing the ipt gene and the Ac element is designed to overcome these difficulties. When tobacco leaf segments were transformed and selected, subse- quent excision of the modified Ac produced marker-free transgenic tobacco plants without sexual crosses or seed production. In addition, the chimeric ipt gene could be visually used as a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> for transformation of hybrid aspen (Populus sieboldii Populus grandidentata). The chi- meric ipt gene, therefore, is an attractive alternative to the most widely used <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> genes. The MAT vector system provides a promising way to shorten breeding time for genetically engineered crops. This method could be particu- larly valuable for fruit and forest trees, for which long generation times are a more significant barrier to breeding and genetic analysis...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of gene targeting, <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> are usually {{permanently}} introduced into the mammalian genome. Multiple gene targeting events in the same cell line can therefore exhaust the pool of markers available and limit subsequent manipulations or genetic analysis. In this study, we describe the combined use of homologous and CRE-loxP-mediated recombination to generate mouse embryonic stem cell lines carrying up to four targeted mutations and devoid of exogenous <b>selectable</b> <b>markers.</b> A cassette that contains {{both positive and negative}} <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> flanked by loxP sites, rendering it excisable by the CRE protein, was constructed. Homologous recombination and positive selection were used to disrupt the Rep- 3 locus, a gene homologous to members of the mutS family of DNA mismatch repair genes. CRE-loxP-mediated recombination and negative selection were then used to recover clones in which the cassette had been excised. The remaining allele of Rep- 3 was then subjected to a second round of targeting and excision with the same construct to generate homozygous, marker-free cell lines. Subsequently, both alleles of mMsh 2, another mutS homolog, were disrupted in the same fashion to obtain cell lines homozygous for targeted mutations at both the Rep- 3 and mMsh 2 loci and devoid of <b>selectable</b> <b>markers.</b> Thus, embryonic stem cell lines obtained in this fashion are suitable for further manipulation and analysis involving the use of <b>selectable</b> <b>markers...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{have tested}} a {{methodology}} {{for the elimination}} of the <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> gene after Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of barley. This involves segregation of the <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> gene away from the gene of interest following co-transformation using a plasmid carrying two T-DNAs, which were located adjacent to each other with no intervening region. A standard binary transformation vector was modified by insertion of a small section composed of an additional left and right T-DNA border, so that the <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> gene and the site for insertion of the gene of interest (GOI) were each flanked by a left and right border. Using this vector three different GOIs were transformed into barley. Analysis of transgene inheritance was facilitated by a novel and rapid assay utilizing PCR amplification from macerated leaf tissue. Co-insertion was observed in two thirds of transformants, and among these approximately one quarter had transgene inserts which segregated in the next generation to yield selectable marker-free transgenic plants. Insertion of non-T-DNA plasmid sequences was observed in only one of fourteen SMF lines tested. This technique thus provides a workable system for generating transgenic barley free from <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> genes, thereby obviating public concerns regarding proliferation of these genes...|$|R

40|$|A general {{method of}} gene {{transfer}} {{that does not}} leave behind a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> in the host genome is described.

After removal of the Cre-encoding locus by genetic segregation, plants were obtained that had incorporated only the desired transgene.

To overcome the limitation in <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> for the dermatophyte Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii (anamorph: Trichophyton mentagrophytes), we adapted the flippase (FLP) recombinase-recombination target (FRT) site-specific recombination system from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> recycling system for this fungus. Taking into account practical applicability, we designed FLP/FRT modules carrying two FRT sequences {{as well as the}} flp gene adapted to the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans (caflp) or a synthetic codon-optimized flp (avflp) gene with neomycin resistance (nptII) cassette for one-step marker excision. Both flp genes were under control of the Trichophyton rubrum copper-repressible promoter (PCTR 4). Molecular analyses of resultant transformants showed that only the avflp-harbouring module was functional in A. vanbreuseghemii. Applying this system, we successfully produced the Ku 80 recessive mutant strain devoid of any <b>selectable</b> <b>markers.</b> This strain was subsequently used as the recipient for sequential multiple disruptions of secreted metalloprotease (fungalysin) (MEP) or serine protease (SUB) genes, producing mutant strains with double MEP or triple SUB gene deletions.

Here, we describe the construction of a spontaneous self-excision binary vector using an oxidative stress-inducible modified FLP/FRT system and its successful application to produce marker-free transgenic rice plants with enhanced seed tocopherol content. To generate selectable marker-free transgenic rice plants, we constructed a binary vector using the hpt <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> gene and the rice codon-optimized FLP (mFLP) gene under the control of an oxidative stress-inducible promoter between two FRT sites, along with multiple cloning sites for convenient cloning of genes of interest.

Furthermore, α-, γ-, and total tocopherol levels were significantly increased in seeds of the marker-free transgenic TC line compared with those of wild-type plants.

40|$|A {{limitation}} of transfection of malaria parasites is {{the availability of}} only a low number of positive <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> for selection of transformed mutants. This is exacerbated for the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei as selection of mutants is performed in vivo in laboratory rodents. We here report the development and application of a negative selection system based upon transgenic expression of a bifunctional protein (yFCU) combining yeast cytosine deaminase and uridyl phosphoribosyl transferase (UPRT) activity in P. berghei followed by in vivo selection with the prodrug 5 -fluorocytosine (5 -FC). The combination of yfcu and a positive <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> was used to first achieve positive selection of mutant parasites with a disrupted gene in a conventional manner. Thereafter through negative selection using 5 -FC, mutants were selected where the disrupted gene had been restored to its original configuration {{as a result of}} the excision of the <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> from the genome through homologous recombination. This procedure was carried out for a Plasmodium gene (p 48 / 45) encoding a protein involved in fertilization, the function of which had been previously implied through gene disruption alone. Such reversible recombination can therefore be employed for both the rapid analysis of the phenotype by targeted disruption of a gene and further associate phenotype and function by genotype restoration through the use of a single plasmid and a single positive <b>selectable</b> <b>marker.</b> Furthermore the negative selection system may also be adapted to facilitate other procedures such as ‘Hit and Run’ and ‘vector recycling’ which in principle will allow unlimited manipulation of a single parasite clone.
