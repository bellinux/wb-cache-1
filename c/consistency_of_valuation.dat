The sale value accounting has various advantages. It can adapt to economic environment by evaluating assets on the sale value. It has logically <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> and additivity by measuring all assets, liabilities and capital on the same attribute that is cash equivalents. The sale value accounting can meet the important accounting criteria which are empirical testability and relevance by measuring empirical phenomena and relating decision making models. The real sale value accounting has an uniform measurement system and it can compare between companies and between periods in the real meaning by revising all accounting figures on a general price index. It can maintain the general purchasing power of shareholders and presents real in-come of the firm.

We are presenting {{a review of}} valuation practice development in our country. The transition to market economy, an emergence property transfers and markets in Lithuania stimulated an adoption and implication of consistent valuation methodology and new professional activity. Real estate services in a national and global business environment and investment decision are becoming of great importance. How do valuers estimate property values after 50 years of no property markets in Lithuania? How the European or globalised investors {{would like to see}} the property valuation in our country, in the Baltic States? An emerging valuation agenda drive to an opportunity for valuation standards: national law and guidance notes (1995 - 1999), regional standards (TEGoVA, 2000) and global valuation standards (IVSC, 2000 and 2001). The development of the market for asset calls for security in globalised capital markets and strengthens an impact of asset valuation and the role of valuers in decision–making process. This paper describes all the contributors involved in property transfers, property markets and investments decision–making process, in exploring issues of current interest, together with expected future concerns in regional and global capital markets. This paper includes five chapters, e. g. : 1. Property transfers from state sector to private sector and valuation aspects in Lithuania. 2. Property markets: cause or consequence of economic growth? 3. Property tax and mass appraisal issues: a need for methodology and standards. 4.

40|$|Multi-period risk functionals {{assign a}} risk value to discrete-time {{stochastic}} processes. While convexity and monotonicity extend in straightforward manner from the single-period case, {{the role of}} information is more problematic in the multi-period situation. In this paper, we define multi-period functionals {{in such a way}} that the development of available information over time (expressed as a filtration) enters explicitly the definition of the functional. This allows to define and study the property of information monotonicity, i. e. monotonicity w. r. t. increasing filtrations. On the other hand, time <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuations</b> is a favorable property and it is well-known that this requirement essentially leads to compositions of conditional mappings. We demonstrate that generally spoken the intersection of time consistent and information monotone valuation functionals is rather sparse, although both classes alone are quite rich. In particular, the paper gives a necessary and sufficient condition for information monotonicity of additive compositions of positively homogeneous risk/acceptability mappings. Within the class of distortion functionals only compositions of expectation or essential infima are information monotone. Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition and examples for compositions of nonhomogeneous mappings exhibiting information monotonicity...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} time <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> monetary <b>valuations,</b> {{also called}} monetary risk measures or monetary utility functions. Through {{a number of}} recent research contribu-tions, it has become clear that time consistency imposes strong constraints on families <b>of</b> monetary <b>valuations</b> conditioned on available information at different time instants. In this paper we add to these results by showing that consistent families <b>of</b> monetary <b>valuations</b> are already determined uniquely by the choice <b>of</b> the initial <b>valuation,</b> under suitable sensitivity assumptions; moreover, this statement holds even when the term “consistency ” is interpreted in a rather weak sense. The unique update rule is specified explicitly, and we characterize the existence of consistent updates for a given initial monetary valuation. We give examples of situations in which weak consistency is rel-evant. An application is given to the construction of consistent families <b>of</b> compound <b>valuations,</b> as an illustration of the additional flexibility under weak time consistency...|$|R

The focus is on those assets which are of a more non-market, public good nature. These assets, which are not commonly traded nor generate a definable income stream, give rise to the more complex valuation issues. The results of the first survey show that progress has been made towards accounting for, and <b>valuation</b> <b>of,</b> local authority infrastructural assets since a prior study by Bond (1996).

40|$|Location {{of product}} origin is an often-used {{marketing}} device by retailers. This approach {{is based on}} the assumption that location of origin signals something to consumers about the underlying quality (or other attributes) of the product. This can be an effective strategy if the signal matches the consumer valuat ion of the product after consumption. In the same vein, health advertising is used to increase demand for a product that exhibits “healthy ” dietary attributes. While there have been numerous studies examining the potential impacts of these attributes on demand, there have been few rigorous studies that examine the <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> consumer <b>valuations</b> <b>of</b> location of origin before and after they have actually consumed the product (or before and after health advertising). Results show that knowledge of location of origin of sweet potatoes does have an impact on consumer valuation.

40|$|In this {{teaching}} note, {{we present}} an integrated, consistent market-based framework for valuing finite cash flows. We derive the relevant cash flows from integrated financial statements, {{and based on}} Modigliani and Miller's (M & M) theories, we estimate the appropriate cost of capital and value the cash flows in seven different ways. The first five methods are variations of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method. The last two methods, the RIM and EVA, are interesting because they differ from the DCF methods. In particular, they apply a charge for equity (based on the book value of equity) to the net income or a charge for invested capital (based on the book value of invested capital) to the Net Operating Profit after tax (NOPLAT), roughly speaking. Happily, {{the results from the}} DCF methods are fully consistent with the RIM and EVA. Since the results from the seven methods must always match, calculating the (present) values with the seven methods is a powerful check on the <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>valuation</b> exercise. With the availability of computing resources, it is easy to implement the seven methods on a routine basis.

We used a questionnaire by Liu et al. (2009) and Choice Experiments (CEs) methodology to place values on coastal resources including coastal water, beaches, and sea birds in the Chinese Bohai Sea. Survey results showed that during spill response actions, coastal water, and beaches were of equal concern to Chinese households while sea birds were of somewhat less concern. Respondents with higher education and fewer children and those with relatively greater household income were more likely to state they were willing to pay for oil spill cleanup costs. Age of respondent was negatively correlated to willingness to pay for cleanup.

40|$|Governments {{around the}} world use monetised values of {{transport}} externalities to undertake project appraisal and cost–benefit analysis. However, because different types of benefits are monetised (e. g., travel time savings, preventing statistical fatalities, reliability, etc.) the question naturally arises {{as to whether they}} are consistent. That is, whether a “dollar is a dollar” as welfare economics requires, or whether spending money in one area carries a different disutility from spending money in another area. This would equate to a violation of fungibility, which is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution. The view that money is not fungible is explained in behavioural economics through theories of framing and mental accounting. This paper describes the results of a stated choice experiment designed to test the fungibility and <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> monetary <b>valuations</b> in transport. From a nationally representative sample, we elicit direct values for the three pairwise trade-offs between travel time, travel cost, and safety. We then show that in the context of our analysis, any trade-offs inferred on the basis of other trade-offs, as is common practice (e. g. inferring a safety vs time trade-off on the basis <b>of</b> monetary <b>valuations</b> for time and safety), produces biased results, suggesting that the assumption of fungibility does not hold. Specifically, we find that time is valued more highly when valued directly by cost than when traded with safety, and the reverse is true for safety...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> individual {{items in the}} economic balance sheet of a stand-alone company and subsequently {{as a part of}} acquisition. We define the economic balance sheet as a full set of assets, liabilities as well as synergies amongst the assets (stand-alone company view) and companies (transaction view), where the sum <b>of</b> their individual <b>valuations</b> has to equal to the overall value of the company. Hence we suggest that the management (and a valuer) should be able to decompose the company value into defined and controllable value components. Apart from identifying optimal methods for the individual valuation, the key for achieving this task is the internal (amongst the assets) as well as the overall consistency (vis-a-vis the overall company value). Compared to the overall-valuation approach, we demonstrate how the component approach can lead to more precise results, higher management discipline and accountability, and can serve as a tool for an a priori identification of overpayment as well as an instrument for controlling the value post transaction. We defined two primary types of synergies in terms <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> approach - Enhancement, improving current income potential and Future opportunities, mainly focusing on new projects - and proposed appropriate valuation approaches given their specifics. Since a large proportion <b>of</b> <b>valuations</b> on individual level is based on the income approach, setting a clear and consistent approach to discount rates was {{a vital part of the}} work. We propose a primary and, if not available, second-best rate for each component of the economic balance sheet. Although the synergies are probably of the highest commercial interest, the liabilities with external source of risk and deferred taxes on the individual level are areas generally neglected both by academics and practitioners. While the first one will have only but crucial impact on companies with decommissioning and similar liabilities, the latter is present almost in any itemized valuation, and its incorrect or purely isolated application affects the overall result and breaks the link to the overall company value. We analyze both topics and offer consistent valuation methods, although further research is required to refine them. We discuss WARA as one of the key tools for ensuring <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> itemized <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> the economic balance sheet. Lacking any theoretical background and interest from academic researchers, we first analyze simple concepts of the tool as they are used in practice and point out observed conceptual errors, oversimplifications and accounting-only approach. Not only that we propose complex consistent rules for WARA construction but we extend the concept from the focus on conventionally defined net assets to the full economic balance sheet, which is the only way how to relate the itemized valuation to the overall company valuation. Finally, we presented a case study based on real-life example which demonstrated practical applicability of proposed partial solutions as well as the overall approach to achieving consistency with the total company or transaction valuation. Although the analysis of individual items of the economic balance will be inevitably based on subjective assumptions to an extent, we have shown that proposed complex and consistent approach adds value to the strategic and transaction considerations. Also the preciseness of the tools will increase with the number of transactions performed as the parameters get calibrated...|$|R
