25|$|The {{emission}} lines seen on {{the spectrum}} of a Seyfert galaxy may come {{from the surface of}} the accretion disc itself, or may come from clouds of gas illuminated by the <b>central</b> <b>engine</b> in an ionization cone. The exact geometry of the emitting region is difficult to determine due to poor resolution of the galactic center. However, each part of the accretion disc has a different velocity relative to our line of sight, and the faster the gas is rotating around the black hole, the broader the emission line will be. Similarly, an illuminated disc wind also has a position-dependent velocity.|$|E

This had the <b>central</b> <b>engine</b> mounted above and clear of the high wing, the other two engines suspended below the wings. Unusually, they intended to offer a biplane equivalent, an option made easy by the monoplane's wing-engine configuration. They also investigated a slightly smaller version, the C.A.15B. These designs suggested to the Air Ministry that two otherwise identical aircraft could be built in monoplane and biplane versions to settle the constant dispute over which of these two configurations was the superior.

The compression lift provided five percent of the total lift. The wing included inboard camber to more effectively use the higher pressure field behind the strong shock wave. Unique among aircraft of its size, the outer portions of the wings were hinged, and could be pivoted downward by up to 65 degrees, acting almost as a type of variable-geometry wingtip device. This increased the aircraft's directional stability at supersonic speeds, shifted the center of lift to a more favorable position at high speeds, and strengthened the compression lift effect. With the wingtips drooped downwards, the compression lift shock wave would be further trapped under the wings.|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of optical re-brightenings and X-ray plateaus in the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) challenges the generic external shock model.

40|$|Abstract. I {{summarize}} the main characteristics of AGNs in nearby galaxies and present a physical picture of their <b>central</b> <b>engines.</b> 1. The “Top 10 ” Properties of Low-luminosity AGNs Although the physical nature of some low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) {{is still not}} fully understood, {{the weight of the}} recent cumulative evidence suggests that a significant fraction of them are genuinely accretion-powered sources. Here I identify the most important observational characteristics of these objects, which point to some novel insights on the structure of their <b>central</b> <b>engines.</b> (1) Demography. LLAGNs are very common. According to the Palomar survey (Ho, Filippenko, & Sargent 1997), over 40 % of nearby galaxies, and an even greater fraction of bulge-dominated systems, contain LLAGNs. (2) Low ionization. The dominant population (2 / 3) of LLAGNs have low-ionization state spectra. They are classified as either LINERs or transition objects. (3) Low accretion power.

For example, the observed radiation energies of some GRBs are equivalent to convert more than one solar mass energy into radiation completely. This is thousand times stronger than that of supernova explosion. Unconventional energy mechanisms and extremely high conversion efficiency for these mysterious events are required.

40|$|The X-ray {{emission}} of radio-loud (RL) AGNs {{is a powerful}} tool for probing the structure of the accretion flow in these objects. We review recent spectral and variability studies of RL AGNs, which show that these systems have systematically different X-ray properties than their radio-quiet (RQ) counterparts. Specifically, RL AGNs have weaker and narrower Fe K lines and weaker Compton reflection components above 10 keV. The nuclear continuum of RL AGNs in the 2 [...] 10 keV band is well described by a power law with photon indices ∼ 1. 8, similar to RQ AGNs of comparable X-ray luminosity. RL AGNs have little or no flux variability on short time scales (0. 5 days); however, flux and spectral variations are observed on time scales of weeks in two well-monitored objects, 3 C 390. 3 and 3 C 120. These properties strongly suggest that the <b>central</b> <b>engines</b> of the two AGNs classes are different. We discuss the implications of these observational results, in particular the possibility that the <b>central</b> <b>engines</b> of RL AGNs are harbor an ion torus (also known as an Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow or ADAF). We show that a beamed component from the jet is unlikely in the majority of sources. Moreover, the X-ray data provide evidence that the circumnuclear environs of RL and RQ AGNs also differ: large amounts of cold gas are detected in BLRGs and QSRs, contrary to Seyfert galaxies of similar X-ray luminosity where an ionized absorber seems to be the norm. The role of future X-ray missions in advancing our understanding of the <b>central</b> <b>engines</b> of RL AGNs is briefly highlighted.
