5|$|After {{the riot}} in Chicago and the {{subsequent}} trial, Ochs changed direction again. The events of 1968 <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics. Ochs thought that by playing the sort of music that had moved him as a teenager he could speak more directly to the American public.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Friedman {{graduated}} from Rutgers University, where he specialized {{in mathematics and}} economics and initially intended to become an actuary. During his time at Rutgers, Friedman became influenced by two economics professors, Arthur F. Burns and Homer Jones, who <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> modern economics could help end the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Crabtree’s {{observations}} had <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that,</b> {{despite their}} errors, Kepler’s Rudolphine Tables were {{superior to the}} commonly used Lansberg's tables, and {{he became one of}} the first converts to Kepler’s new astronomy. By 1637, he had convinced Horrocks of the superiority of the Keplerian system, and, using their own planetary observations, both men made many corrections to Kepler's tables, which Crabtree converted to decimal form.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Mainer and {{his wife}} settled in Flint, Michigan, where he found work at a General Motors factory. Although renouncing both the music {{industry}} and his trademark instrument, the banjo, he and Julia did continue to sing at gospel revival meetings. In the early 1960s, Molly O'Day <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he could use the banjo in gospel recordings, which spurred a series of religiously themed banjo albums beginning in 1961. He also began to record and tour with his wife.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} June 1961, General Maxwell D. Taylor, President John F. Kennedy's special {{military}} representative, had {{become interested in}} the prospect of erecting a physical barrier to halt the increasing infiltration of PAVN materiel (and later, manpower) through their Laotian logistical corridor and into the border regions of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). He then held talks with the Deputy Director of the Pentagon's Office of Special Operations, Edward G. Lansdale, who <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> a better solution to the infiltration dilemma would be the creation of mobile units to attack the infiltrators.|$|E
5|$|Blackfish {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> {{the women and children}} were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> {{cross-fertilisation}} {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
5|$|House {{was created}} by David Shore, who {{got the idea for}} the misanthropic title {{character}} from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Von Koenigswald {{also made}} several discoveries in Sangiran, Central Java, where more fossils of early humans were {{discovered}} between 1936 and 1941. Among the discoveries was a skullcap of similar size to that found by Dubois at the Trinil 2 site. Von Koenigswald's discoveries in Sangiran <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> all these skulls belonged to early humans. Dubois again {{refused to acknowledge}} the similarity. Ralph von Koenigswald and Franz Weidenreich compared the fossils from Java and Zhoukoudian and concluded that Java Man and Peking Man were closely related. Dubois died in 1940, still refusing to recognize their conclusion, and official reports remain critical of the Sangiran site's poor presentation and interpretation.|$|E

5|$|Bosh {{eventually}} {{chose to}} follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management. There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so. Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, {{but by the end}} of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he was ready for the NBA. He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career. He said he intends to obtain a college degree in the future, to fulfill a promise made to his mother.|$|E
5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina was too old to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.|$|E
5|$|General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz {{said the}} {{two-seater}} sports car {{being developed by}} Tesla, the Tesla Roadster, and the rapid advancement of lithium-ion battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, overcoming internal opposition. Lutz's initial idea was to develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and lack of public charging infrastructure, they could use a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, {{so it would be}} a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Davies {{completed}} his O-Levels and stayed at Olchfa with the ambition to study English literature at the University of Oxford; he abandoned his aspirations {{of becoming a}} comic artist after a careers advisor <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> his colour-blindness would make that path unlikely. During his studies, he participated in the WGYTC's assignments to create Welsh-language drama to be performed at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, including Pair Dadeni, a play based on the Mabinogion myth cycle, and Perthyn, a drama about community belonging and identity in early-1980s West Glamorgan. In 1981, he was accepted by Worcester College, Oxford to study English literature. At Oxford, he realised that he was enamoured with the narrative aspect of fiction, especially 19th-century literature such as Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|Isaac D'Israeli {{had never}} taken {{religion}} very seriously, but had remained a conforming member of the Bevis Marks Synagogue. His father, the elder Benjamin, was a prominent and devout member; it was probably from respect for him that Isaac did not leave when he fell out with the synagogue authorities in 1813. After Benjamin senior died in 1816 Isaac felt free to leave the congregation following a second dispute. Isaac's friend Sharon Turner, a solicitor, <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> although he could comfortably remain unattached to any formal religion it would be disadvantageous to the children if they did so. Turner stood as godfather when Benjamin was baptised, aged twelve, on 31 July 1817.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 1322, the English {{army was}} routed by the Scots, {{under the command}} of Robert the Bruce, at the Battle of Old Byland in Yorkshire. The English commander, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, was taken prisoner, while the king himself barely escaped capture. It was the worst defeat the English had {{suffered}} in the wars since the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Harclay had received a summons to join the royal army, but {{had not been able to}} bring his troops south in time to come to the king's rescue. The event <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the war against Scotland could not be won under the leadership of the present king. Instead he entered into direct negotiations with the Scots, without the king's sanction. On 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce at Lochmaben.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{occurred}} during Holy Week, 1799, amid rain and dense fog. Initially, the French {{were able to}} take, and hold, Ostrach and the nearby hamlet of Hoßkirch plus several strategic points on the Ostrach marsh. As the engagement began, Habsburg numerical superiority overwhelmed French defenses. By evening, the French left wing was flanked and Jourdan's men retreated from Ostrach to the Pfullendorf heights. On the next morning, as Jourdan considered a counter-attack, the weather broke, and he could {{look down on the}} Austrian battle array. The numbers and dispositions of the Austrians <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> any attack would be useless, and that he could not hope to maintain his position in the heights. As he withdrew, a portion of his right flank was cut off from the main force.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} {{steadily}} escalating development {{costs of the}} vehicle, Sinclair decided to raise capital by selling {{some of his own}} shares in Sinclair Research to fund a separate company that would focus on electric vehicles. A £12 million deal was reached in March 1983, of which £8.3 million was used to fund the establishment of the new Sinclair Vehicles company. Sinclair recruited Barrie Wills, a veteran former employee of the DeLorean Motor Company, to lead Sinclair Vehicles as its managing director. Although Wills initially expressed scepticism about the viability of an electric vehicle – his twenty-five years in the motor industry had <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> an electric car was never going to happen – Sinclair managed to convince him that the project would work. In 1984, Sinclair Vehicles' new head office was established in Warwick in the West Midlands, an area with a long-established link with the motor industry.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{received}} {{word of the}} landings the same day, but was informed that the number was 8,000 to 9,000 troops. This <b>convinced</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> it was the feint which he had predicted and therefore he only sent 1,500 more troops to Brooklyn, bringing {{the total number of}} troops on Long Island to 6,000. On August 24, Washington replaced Sullivan with Israel Putnam who commanded the troops on Long Island. Putnam arrived on Long Island the next day along with six battalions. Also that day, the British troops on Long Island received 5,000 Hessian reinforcements, bringing their total to 20,000. There was little fighting on the days immediately after the landing, although some small skirmishes did take place with American marksmen armed with rifles picking off British troops from time to time.|$|E
