[...] Present pay-for-performance systems measure good performance based on specified clinical measurements, such as glycohemoglobin for diabetic patients. Healthcare providers who are monitored by such limited criteria have a powerful incentive to deselect (dismiss or refuse to accept) patients whose outcome measures fall below the quality standard and therefore worsen the provider's assessment. Patients with low health literacy, inadequate financial resources to afford expensive medications or treatments, and ethnic groups traditionally subject to healthcare inequities may also be deselected by providers seeking improved performance measures.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} the monthly payment {{at the end of}} month N that is applied to {{principal}} paydown equals the amount c of payment minus the amount of interest currently paid on the pre-existing unpaid principal. The latter amount, the interest component of the <b>current</b> <b>payment,</b> is the interest rate r times the amount unpaid at the end of month N-1. Since {{in the early years of}} the mortgage the unpaid principal is still large, so are the interest payments on it; so the portion of the monthly payment going toward paying down the principal is very small and equity in the property accumulates very slowly (in the absence of changes in the market value of the property). But in the later years of the mortgage, when the principal has already been substantially paid down and not much monthly interest needs to be paid, most of the monthly payment goes toward repayment of the principal, and the remaining principal declines rapidly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{court found}} that its {{reasoning}} for the [...] "one year rule" [...] was well illustrated by {{the facts of the}} case before it. If the taxpayers in this situation were forced to deduct their rental payments on a prorated basis, the simplicity of the cash basis method of accounting was sacrificed for an inconsequential change in the timing of deductions. Under the prorated system the taxpayers could only deduct 1/12 of their rental payment in 1973. But in 1974, and every year until 1992, the taxpayers would be able to deduct both 1/12 of the <b>current</b> <b>payment</b> (for the month of December) and 11/12 for the preceding year's payment that covered the rental period in the current tax year (January-November); thus the taxpayers would be deducting 12/12 of rental payment—an entire year's worth of payments. So there was only a difference between the prorated deduction system and the [...] "one-year rule" [...] for the first and last year of the lease term.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Current</b> Tax <b>Payment</b> Act of 1943, Pub. L. 68, Ch. 120, 57 Stat. 126 (June 9, 1943), re-introduced the {{requirement}} to withhold income tax in the United States. Tax withholding had been introduced in the Tariff Act of 1913 but repealed by the Income Tax Act of 1916. The <b>Current</b> Tax <b>Payment</b> Act compelled employers to withhold federal income taxes from workers' paychecks and pay them directly to the government on the workers' behalf.

To check whether strict exogeneity holds with our data, we run the test suggested by Wooldridge (2010, p. 325), which amounts to adding the lead of the covariate of interest and test whether it is significant in the regression.|$|R
50|$|Government pension {{payments}} are financed through an 18.5% pension tax on all taxed incomes in the country, which comes partly from a tax category called a public pension fee (7% on gross income), and 30% {{of a tax}} category called employer fees on salaries (which is 33% on a netted income). Since January 2001 the 18.5% is divided in two parts: 16% goes to <b>current</b> <b>payments,</b> and 2.5% goes into individual retirement accounts, which were introduced in 2001. Money saved and invested in government funds, and IRAs for future pension costs, are roughly 5 times annual government pension expenses (725/150).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Because many <b>current</b> <b>payment</b> {{systems are}} poorly implemented, or of incompetence, private data of {{consumers}} such as payment details, addresses and their purchase history can be compromised. Furthermore, <b>current</b> <b>payment</b> systems {{do not offer}} any non-repudiable verification to a completed transaction, which poses risks to all the parties of the transaction – the consumer, the merchant and the financial institution. One {{solution to this problem}} was SET, but it was never really a success because of its complexity and poor reception from consumers. In this paper, we introduce a third party payment system that aims to preserve privacy by severing the link between their purchase and payment records, while providing a traceable transaction that maintains its integrity and is non-repudiable. Our system also removes much of the responsibilities placed on the merchant with regards to securing sensitive data related to customer payment, thus increasing the potential of small businesses to take part in e-commerce without significant investments in computer security. ...|$|E
