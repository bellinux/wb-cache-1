40|$|Functional MR Imaging (fMRI) is {{a widely}} used {{mechanism}} to non-invasively evaluate and assess neural activity in the brain, with echo planar imaging (EPI) the most common se-quence used in fMRI studies. EPI methods are attractive be-cause they provide functional imaging data of the whole brain at reasonable temporal resolutions. However, EPI is notori-ously susceptible to multiple artifacts.

40|$|Abstract: A new {{category}} of the compensatory eyecup movement is found in crayfish. The compensatory rotation of the eyecup around its longitudinal axis is induced by geotactic and/or optokinetic stimuli. Geotactically controlled compensation is mediated through the statocyst, and the compensatory process in full 3600 turn {{of the body is}} characterized by four distinct consecuitive phases: 1) positive compensation of high gain, 2) null compen-sation, 3) negative <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>recovery,</b> and 4) positive compensation of low gain. A large hysteresis is also observed. The eyecup will take quite different positions at the same body position depending on the direction of approach. In ordinary condition, the geotactic and optokinetic factors are found to operate synergetically to maintain the dorsoventral axis of the receptive visual surface parallel to the gravitational vertical. The gains of the two systems are separately measured experimentally as well as the gains in synergetic and antagonistic cases. A model of control system is proposed to describe the contribution of the two systems. The model well predicts the responses measured in the present experiment...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how and why other-customer misbehavior has a negative influence on customer satisfaction with the service firm. Design/methodology/approach - Data for this study were gathered by retrospective experience sampling. Findings - There are several important findings that can be obtained from the results. First, people consider another customer's failure to be the firm's responsibility when they perceive that the failure is under the firm's volitional control (i. e. controllability attribution). This controllability attribution leads to customer expectations of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> from dissatisfaction. Second, stability attributions about other-customer failures were not found to be significantly related to the firm's responsibility. Third, the severity of the other-customer failure experience bears no relation to the customer's service recovery expectation, but it is negatively related to satisfaction. Finally, the customer's evaluation of service is not only affected by the other-customer misbehavior, but also by how employees react to situations when other customers are unruly or potentially disruptive. Practical implications - Providing employees with the appropriate coping and problem-solving skills for working with problem customers is a key issue for service providers. More importantly, employees should be trained to help the affected customers, to alleviate any bad feelings caused by the other-customer's misbehavior. Originality/value - The paper suggests that employees in a service-providing firm may need to act as "police officers" to ensure that all their customers behave appropriately...|$|R
