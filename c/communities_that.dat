5|$|Another initiative, {{presented}} by the late Mayor Thomas Menino, is the Renew Boston Whole Building Incentive, which reduces {{the cost of living}} in buildings that are deemed energy efficient. This, much like the green housing developments, gives people of low socioeconomic status an opportunity to find housing in <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> support the environment. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to enlist 500 Bostonians to participate in a free, in-home energy assessment.|$|E
5|$|At Essex County Road11, Highway3 enters rural southwestern Ontario, and is {{dominated}} by farmland for much of its length through Essex County. The now four-laned route becomes divided as it follows the Essex Bypass around {{the southern edge of}} Essex, with commercial services lining the highway, primarily on the north side. Returning to farmland and narrowing to a two lane undivided road, the highway continues southeast, passing nearby, but avoiding, several small <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> the original highway travelled through.|$|E

5|$|London and the Thames {{were named}} in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe, who {{proposed}} {{the site for}} the capital of Upper Canada. The first European settlement was between 1801 and 1804 by Peter Hagerman. The village was founded in 1826 and incorporated in 1855. Since then, London has grown to be the largest Southwestern Ontario municipality and Canada's 11th largest metropolitan area, having annexed many of the smaller <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> surrounded it.|$|E

5|$|Small-scale {{wind power}} is the name given to wind {{generation}} systems with the capacity to produce up to 50kW of electrical power. Isolated <b>communities,</b> <b>that</b> may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint. Wind turbines {{have been used for}} household electric power generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas.|$|E
5|$|Swahili coastal {{settlements}} frequently conducted {{trade with}} the interior, obtaining goods for overseas trade or local consumption. However, isolated and small settlements have been interpreted as hinterlands that developed around and supported the economies of the larger settlements. Small settlements or hamlets were established between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries within the vicinity of Gedi including sites {{at the end of}} Mida Creek, Kiburugeni, Watamu, Shaka, and Kilepwa. These smaller settlements are thought to represent agricultural <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> provided Gedi with most of its agricultural produce.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{identify}} themselves as adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, Cao Đài or Roman Catholicism. Vietnamese Buddhists are mainly found among impoverished communities living in the Tonle Sap or the rural parts of Cambodia. As Vietnamese Buddhists derive their religious doctrines and beliefs from Chinese folk religion, they participate in religious rituals organised by Chinese Cambodians during festive seasons. Vietnamese <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> have settled down in Cambodia have adopted Khmer Theravada Buddhist practices to some extent. Vietnamese adherents of Roman Catholicism consist of descendants of refugees that fled the religious persecution {{during the reign of}} Tự Đức. They are split between city dwellers based in Phnom Penh and fishing <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> are based in Tonle Sap. Vietnamese Catholics make up about 90% of Cambodia's Roman Catholic community, and in the 1960s they had about 65,000 adherents in the country. Most of the Vietnamese Catholics were either deported to Vietnam or killed in March 1970, and it was only in 1990 that the Catholic church was allowed to re-establish itself in Cambodia. In 2005, there were about 25,000 Catholics in the country.|$|E

Iconoclasm, destruction, disputes within <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> led to violence, and radical challenge to {{all forms of}} faith were reported daily to Cromwell—developments he tried {{to hide from the}} King.

5|$|As {{the fifth}} book begins, the setting shifts briefly to North America. Following the Ural War, the Japanese had led an Asian {{occupation}} of western North America. The local populations, inspired by Native American beliefs and mythologies, react by leaving the cities for the wilderness and destroying the food factories and cities, eventually driving out the Asian occupation. In America and then globally people begin leaving cities {{in favor of}} the wild. Shamanism and the belief in ghosts reemerge amongst the populace, as does an oral tradition of story-telling. The draining of the cities grows into a settler movement: egalitarian <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> live in nature, characterized by gender equality and sexual liberation. In response to the threat this movement poses to the ruling Senates, political leaders in London hatch a plan to colonize Greenland, thereby channeling both the drive for technological innovation and the drive to settle new land.|$|E
5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E

5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting human trafficking in the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|New Brunswick seven rural communities, an {{increase}} from four {{as of the}} 2011 census following the incorporations of Kedgwick in 2012 and Cocagne and Hanwell in 2014. These seven rural communities had a cumulative population of 19,616 in the 2016 Census. New Brunswick's largest and smallest rural communities are Beaubassin East and Saint-André with populations of 6,376 and 772 respectively. Rural communities elect local councils and {{are responsible for the}} delivery of some local services, including administrative services, community planning and emergency measures. The province of New Brunswick ensures the delivery of other services including solid waste collection and recreation services unless the rural community chooses to take on these responsibilities.
