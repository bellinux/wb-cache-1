25|$|Barcelona {{is served}} by a {{comprehensive}} local public transport network that includes a metro, a bus network, two separate modern tram networks, a separate historic tram line, and several funiculars and aerial cable cars. Most of these networks and lines form a <b>coordinated</b> <b>fare</b> system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM), although they are operated {{by a number of}} different bodies. This integrated public transport is divided into different zones (1 to 6) and depending on usage various Integrated Travel Cards are available.|$|E

500|$|As Speyer and Gibb {{worked to}} restructure the debt, the UERL's general manager, Albert Stanley, {{appointed}} by Gibb in 1907, began to increase the UERL's income by improving management structures. With commercial manager Frank Pick, Stanley instigated a plan to increase passenger numbers; developing the [...] "Underground" [...] brand and establishing a joint booking system and <b>coordinated</b> <b>fares</b> throughout all of London's underground railways, including those not controlled by the UERL.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} airline alliances on airfares on nonstop hub-to-hub routes is investigated. Analytical {{results suggest that}} the net effect on airfares is uncertain. Empirical {{evidence}} shows that the impact of two of three alliances (Star and SkyTeam) on prices on transatlantic hub-to-hub routes is insignificant after controlling for other factors. Routes between oneworld alliance hubs, however, have significantly lower business class airfares compared to other routes. These results indicate that the impact of alliances on transatlantic hub-to-hub airfares varies depending on the alliance; possibly due to the ability of an alliance to <b>coordinate</b> <b>fares.</b> Alliances Airlines Competitive strategy Pricing...|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{line of the}} system, the S4, was an {{extension}} of an existing line that had been operated by the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn since 1992. It was extended in 1999 from Eppingen to Heilbronn and since 2001 it has continued over the new Heilbronn inner-city line (Heilbronner Innenstadtstrecke). In 2005, the line was extended to Öhringen, which is integrated into the Heilbronner Hohenloher Haller Nahverkehr ("Heilbronn Hohenlohe Hall local transport", HNV), a transport association (Verkehrsverbund) {{that is responsible for}} <b>coordinating</b> <b>fares</b> and transport investment. In 2013, the new S42 service was opened to Neckarsulm. Since 2014, this service has continued via Bad Friedrichshall to Sinsheim, while the new S41 service also runs via Bad Friedrichshall to Mosbach.|$|R

40|$|The Verkehrsverbund {{system of}} public {{transport}} organization offers {{a practical solution}} to the problem of providing integrated regional public transport service for the increasingly suburbanized metropolitan areas of Europe and North America. By carefully <b>coordinating</b> <b>fares</b> and services for all routes, all types of public transport, and all parts of the metropolitan region, Verkehrsverbund systems in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland have greatly improved the quality of the public transport alternative to the automobile. Five Verbund systems were chosen for detailed analysis: Hamburg, Munich, the Rhein-Ruhr region, Vienna and Zurich. This article documents the success of each Verbund in attracting more public transport riders and, in most cases, increasing or at least stabilizing public transport's share of modal split. It also analyzes the reasons for the success of the Verkehrsverbund, including service expansion, improvement in service quality, more attractive fares, and extensive marketing campaigns. The five case study systems offer lessons for other public transport systems facing similar challenges of dealing with increasing auto ownership and suburbanization. The article concludes with an analysis of the most challenging problem of all: public transport finance. As shown dramatically by the five case studies, the service improvements and fare structures needed for truly effective regional public transport require substantial government subsidy. Fiscal austerity at every government level is leading to subsidy cutbacks in most countries of Europe and North America. The five case study systems examined in this article provide lessons on how to deal most effectively with limited subsidy funds in order to minimize service deterioration, fare increases and ridership losses. ...|$|R
5000|$|Icelandair: In 1997, Southwest and Icelandair {{entered into}} {{interline}} and marketing agreements allowing for joint <b>fares,</b> <b>coordinated</b> schedules, transfer of passenger luggage {{between the two}} airlines in Baltimore and connecting passengers between several U.S. cities and several European cities.

5000|$|During {{this early}} period, the outer zones within Metro were {{relatively}} undeveloped and bus routes in them were sparse; but as development increased, there was pressure for lower suburban fares, and in 1962 the outer boundary of Zone 2 {{was extended to}} {{all the way to}} the Metro limit. Higher fares, still on a zonal basis along each radial route, now applied only on the few routes running beyond Metro; in effect, the zone boundaries outside Zone 2 had changed from semicircles to rough rectangles. (Eventually the zones along each remaining route beyond Metro were combined and the <b>fares</b> <b>coordinated</b> with those of adjacent transit agencies; see below.) ...|$|R
