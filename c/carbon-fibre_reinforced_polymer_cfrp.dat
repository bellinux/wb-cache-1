30|$|Two recent {{non-destructive}} testing (NDT) technologies {{for the investigation}} of <b>Carbon-Fibre</b> <b>Reinforced</b> <b>Polymer</b> (<b>CFRP)</b> surfaces before adhesive bonding were assessed and advanced as a contribution to an extended {{non-destructive testing}} (ENDT) approach of composite bonds {{in the frame of}} the European FP 7 project “ENCOMB – Extended non-destructive testing of composite bonds”. Comparing to freshly ground CFRP surfaces, release agent contamination of the surface as a scenario relevant during CFRP application was considered. Both Optically Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE) and Aerosol-Wetting-Test (AWT) showed a high potential as NDT tools detecting thin layers of a silicone-based release agent on <b>Carbon-Fibre</b> <b>Reinforced</b> <b>Polymer</b> (<b>CFRP)</b> surfaces. Investigations with either of these techniques applied to adherent surfaces before the adhesive bonding process allowed to indicate the inappropriate state of potential CFRP adherents, which according to Markatos et al. [23] was related to an application scenario reducing the joint strength of resulting adhesive joints.|$|E

40|$|A {{submarine}} is any naval {{vessel that}} {{is capable of}} propelling itself beneath the water {{as well as on the}} water surface. Submersibles are capable of operating for extended period of time underwater and are subjected to heavy hydrostatic pressure. The conventional submarines made up of high strength steel and concrete prevents them from going to greater depth owing to its large dead weight. In the present work, the pressure hull of submarine is considered both in isotropic and composite material. Materials that have high strength to weight ratio include carbon fibre composites. <b>Carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>polymer</b> (<b>CFRP)</b> is a very strong and light weight fibre reinforced polymer containing carbon fibers on various orientations.

40|$|The {{tailorable}} {{mechanical properties}} and high strength-to-weight ratios of composite sandwich panels make them {{of interest to}} the commercial marine and naval sector, however, further investigation into their blast resilience is required. The experiments performed in this study aimed to identify whether alterations to the composite skins or core of a sandwich panel can yield improved blast resilience both in air and underwater. Underwater blast loads using 1. 28 kg TNT equivalent charge at a stand-off distance of 1 m were performed on four different composite sandwich panels. Results revealed that implementing a stepwise graded density foam core, with increasing density away from the blast, reduces the deflection of the panel and damage sustained. Furthermore, the skin material affects the extent of panel deflection and damage, the lower strain to failure of <b>carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>polymer</b> (<b>CFRP)</b> skins reduces deflection but increases skin debonding. A further two panels were subjected to a 100 kg TNT air blast loading at a 15 m stand-off to compare the effect of a graded density core and the results support the underwater blast results. Future modelling of these experiments will aid the design process and should aim to include material damage mechanisms to identify the most suitable skins...|$|E

Double cantilever beam tests were performed {{in order to}} determine the interlaminar fracture energy of the CFRP composites, while the single edge-notched bend (SENB) specimen was employed to evaluate the fracture energy of the bulk polymers. The fracture energy of the bulk epoxy polymers increased from 173 J/m 2 for the unmodified polymer to a maximum of 1, 237 J/m 2 with the addition of 16 wt% of CSR nanoparticles. The toughening mechanisms were identified as (a) localised plastic shear yielding and (b) cavitation of the CSR particles followed by plastic void growth of the matrix. The steadystate propagation value of the interlaminar fracture energy of the CFRP composites increased with increasing nanoparticle concentration, from 1, 246 J/m 2 for the unmodified epoxy matrix to a maximum of 1, 851 J/m 2 with 4 wt% of silica nanoparticles and 8 wt% of CSR nanoparticles. Crack growth in the CFRP composites was dominated by fibre-bridging toughening mechanisms. The efficiency of the transfer of toughness from the bulk polymers to the carbon fibre composites was considered. The measured fracture energy of both bulk and composite materials decreased at a test temperature of - 80 °C, compared with room temperature, i. e. 20 °C. Nevertheless, the toughening effects of both the silica and CSR nanoparticles on the bulk epoxy polymers and the CFRP composites, compared with the unmodified epoxy polymers, were still evident even at the lower temperature. Indeed, the toughening effect of the silica nanoparticles was greater at - 80 °C than at room temperature...|$|E

This symposium hosted by SBPMat was organized by Welchy Leite Cavalcanti from Fraunhofer IFAM, Andréia Luísa da Rosa from Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), André Avelino Pasa from Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), and Silvio de Barros from Federal Center of Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET-RJ), and it {{was supported by the}} Brazilian Society of Adhesion and Adhesives (ABAA). The main focus was on design, control and characterization of hybrid polymer/solid state materials aiming at applications in optoelectronics, coatings and adhesives. Within the symposium, theoreticians and experimentalists discussed the present state of the art in the field and future trends. Diverse oral and poster contributions were presented by researchers from numerous universities, institutes and research centers. It may be highlighted that symposium A hosted various remarkable presentations by young researchers and - among them - several contributions which were at least partly supported within the program Science without Borders (Ciência sem Fronteiras) coordinated by CAPES (Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel), CNPq (National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development) and DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service). In order to disseminate the interdisciplinary and international work presented within Symposium A of the XIII Brazilian MRS Meeting, six contributions were selected along with the value added chain ranging from research and development towards applications of modern adhesion science. The papers were prepared and submitted to a peer review, and they result in the present Special Issue of AAS which accentuates mainly threefold strands leading to innovative adhesive joints. First physical, chemical and even biologically based processes for building functional adherents and surfaces are addressed, second the development of novel reactive polymers incorporating atmospheric carbon dioxide, and third the investigation of interactions between solid surfaces and polymers or ambient factors. Within, the addressed threefold strands, computer-supported design of reactive monomers and the arising polymers, quality assurance during the manufacture of functional surfaces and adhesive joints, and finally the implication of effective repair solutions are illustrated.

40|$|External {{post-tensioning}} {{can provide}} an effective structural reinforcement system {{for the design of}} new concrete structures and for the strengthening of existing structures. In most cases, the structural effectiveness of the external tendon is increased by using a deviated or harped tendon profile. <b>Carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>polymer</b> (<b>CFRP)</b> reinforcement has emerged as an alternative to steel because it is non-corroding and fatigue resistant. However, its use in external post-tensioning has been limited {{due to a lack of}} knowledge regarding the tensile-flexural behaviour of the tendons under typical harped profiles. Limited test data has shown a reduction in the tendon capacity resulting from the combination of tensile and flexural stresses at the deviator locations. Existing models for predicting the capacity of a deviated tendon appear to be either unconservative or excessively conservative, limiting the application of CRFP tendons as external post-tensioning. This thesis describes an experimental research study of the tensile-flexural behaviour of post-tensioned CFRP tendons subjected to harped profiles. The program studied the effect of tendon size, deviator size and harping angle on the tendon behaviour. The tendons were loaded to failure in a specially designed tension frame that accommodated a range of harped configurations. Both the flexural and overall behaviour of the tendon were observed and recorded throughout the tests. The experimental data illustrates the effect of harping variables on the tendon response and capacity, and reveals the potential for different failure modes dependent on the combination of variables. A comparison of the test data with existing analytical and design equations shows poor correlation between the predicted and measured values. The research program clearly points out the inadequacies of the current analytical models and the need for an analytical model that more accurately predicts the tensile capacity of deviated CFRP tendons. A primary and an extended model were developed within the research program based on the material properties and geometry of the tendon and structural mechanics. The new models were found to perform very well and were used to develop design equations for the reduced tensile strength of harped CFRP tendons as well as failure mode control guidelines for the avoidance of undesirable failure modes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>polymer</b> (<b>CFRP)</b> {{laminates}} {{are widely}} used in various engineering applications, such as in race cars and aircrafts, because they are light, stiff and strong. They commonly contain stress raisers {{in the form of}} holes and notches (for mechanical joining methods, routing of pipes and cables etc.) and are also often subjected to complex combined multi-axial stress conditions during service. Yet their notched multi-axial fracture behaviour remains largely unexplored. This is the main contribution of the thesis. First, a novel loading fixture for applying a wide range of in-plane loading modes is developed based on the popular Arcan’s method. Termed the ‘modified Arcan rig’, it utilises friction gripping to transfer loads into tabbed specimens. This loading fixture is used to test centre-notched multi-directional CFRP laminates under different combinations of tension and shear stresses. Together with penetrant-enhanced X-ray CT and laminate de-ply, the fracture behaviour of quasi-isotropic CFRP specimens is investigated for the following loading modes: pure tension, pure compression, in-plane shear, and combined tension and shear. Two notch geometries (sharp notch and circular hole) are investigated to allow for an assessment of the role of stress concentration upon strength and damage development to be performed. Three distinct fracture modes are observed in a tensile/compressive-shear stress space (termed Mechanism A, Mechanism B and Mechanism C). It is observed that quasi-isotropic specimens with a central sharp notch are consistently stronger than equivalent specimens with a central circular hole (for all stress states investigated). An underlying micromechanical explanation concerning the effects of damage upon strength is proposed. Second, a finite element (FE) model is developed using the commercial FE program, Abaqus FEA to simulate the observed progressive damage and failure in the quasi-isotropic specimens. The FE model employs independent material property data as inputs. Overall, good correlation between the simulations and the experiments is obtained, validating the FE strategy. The capabilities of the model are extended to predict the notched fracture behaviour of the specimens under combined compression and shear loading, for which experimental work has not been done by the author, but for which literature data exists. Finally, the effect of laminate lay-up upon the notched multi-axial fracture behaviour of the CFRP specimens is explored by considering a 0 ° ply-dominated lay-up, a ± 45 ° ply-dominated lay-up and a cross-ply lay-up, alongside the quasi-isotropic lay-up. Experiments reveal that all lay-ups exhibit Mechanisms A, B and C. However, the extent of damage in each Mechanism as well as the regime in which each Mechanism operates in (in the failure envelopes) strongly depend on the lay-up of the specimen. As expected, the tensile strengths and compressive strengths increase with the proportion of 0 ° plies. Surprisingly, the shear strengths do not scale with the proportion of ± 45 ° plies; the specimen geometry and material orthotropy are attributed as reasons for this. In contrast to the case of the quasi-isotropic lay-up, the extent of subcritical damage induced by the circular hole is not always lower than that induced by the sharp notch for the other lay-ups. The difference in the extent of damage between both notch geometries is reflected in the notched strengths of the lay-up in question. These experimental observations are adequately predicted by the FE strategy, which further validates it as a reliable predictive tool for composite fracture.
