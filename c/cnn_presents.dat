40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method for {{analyzing}} brain electrical activity in epilepsy is presented. It {{is based on}} neuronal complexity loss measures, using the parallel computing power of Cellular Neural Networks [1]. It will be shown, that an accurate approximation of a dimension measure D 2, which is an estimate of an effective correlation dimension, can be determined with CNN. It has been verified in several recent investigations [6, 7, 8] that changes of D 2 from successive data segments allow a reliable characterization of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the epileptogenic process. The <b>CNN</b> <b>presented</b> here is optimized with respect to future implementations as a VLSI realization. 1 Introduction Worldwide approximately 0 : 6 % of human beings suffer from epilepsy - half of them from a focal epilepsy.
