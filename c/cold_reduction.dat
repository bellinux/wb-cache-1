40|$|A {{fine-grain}} and high-strength Nb-IF steel under {{hot rolling}} {{was employed to}} {{study the effects of}} <b>cold</b> rolling <b>reduction</b> on <b>cold</b> rolling texture and formation of recrystallization texture. The results show that the main texture of the cold rolled steel is { 112 }, { 111 }, { 111 }, { 001 }. With the increasing reduction, texture components of the tested steel are not changed, and strength of the components increases. Ferrite grain size of the annealed test steel is refined, and its strength increases. The texture on the α-line of the annealed test steel weakens, and even some of the textures have gradually disappeared. With the increasing <b>cold</b> rolling <b>reduction,</b> the texture peak gradually moves from { 001 } to { 111 }. For the line of γ-orientation, texture peak moves from { 111 } orientation to { 111 } orientation, eventually the density of { 111 } orientation is stronger than that of { 111 } orientation. Recrystallization mechanism of the experimental steel is both oriented nucleation and selection growth, and with the increasing <b>cold</b> rolled <b>reduction,</b> the intensity of { 111 } surface texture increases, so the r value increases, and deep drawing performance is improved. ©, 2015, Editorial Office of Transactions of Materials and Heat Treatment.

40|$|Abstract. The {{ferritic}} rolling strategy {{allows for the}} production of two different hot strip grades, a "soft " and a "hard " hot strip. The "soft " hot strip is rolled in the upper ferrite region and a sufficiently high coiling temperature ensures direct recrystallisation in the coil. The "hard " hot strip is rolled at relatively lower temperatures in the ferrite temperature region and exhibits a strained microstructure with a desirable rolling texture. Furthermore, these ferritic rolled hot strips can be used as initial strip for subsequent cold rolling. The current investigation focuses {{on the development of the}} recrystalli-sation texture of cold rolled and annealed ferritic rolled hot strip for different <b>cold</b> <b>reductions.</b> For this purpose "soft " and "hard " hot strips were produced on a laboratory hot rolling mill. These strips were cold rolled with a total reduction of 40 to 80 % to a final thickness of 0. 5 mm. Subsequently the strips were subjected to simulated continuous annealing, using a salt bath furnace. The macro texture of both types of specimens was measured and correlated to the mechanical properties, including the Lankford values. A very different development of the recrystallisation texture and hence mechanical properties has been observed. However, both grades yielded improved deep-drawing properties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The plastic {{behavior}} of the //RD orientations, and specially that of the { 001 } orientation, under severe <b>cold</b> <b>reductions</b> is addressed. Based on the orientation dependence of the stored energy, the { 001 } orientation is known to lack from structured misorientation gradients and significant dislocation storage after plastic deformation which makes the former orientation not particularly prone to enhancing the recrystallization process. Recent evidences, however, indicate that { 001 } orientation plays a relevant role in the origin of {h 11 } orientations (predominantly { 311 } and { 411 } orientations) observed in the recrystallization texture of severely deformed IF steels. The complete understanding {{of the development of}} the recrystallized {h 11 } orientations in IF steels is, therefore, of relevance as it deteriorates the optimum γ-fibre texture required for deep-drawability applications. The plastic instability of { 001 } grains in a cross-rolled IF steel is evaluated in the present work. The extensive characterization of the deformed substructure along with partially recrystallized data confirmed the oriented nucleation origin of {h 11 } orientations from deformed { 001 } grains. Innovative crystal plasticity calculations accounting for the position of the grain boundary plane suggested that the recrystallized {h 11 } orientations could result from a low Taylor value nucleation criterion...|$|R

With this method during forming process, chip forming such as hobbing and broaching method is not involved. The manufacturing process is as follows; the tube which the sheet is formed and welded to by roll forming machine, is mounted on a suitable mandrel. This mandrel has an external toothing which corresponds to internal toothing of the final product. During axial moving and rotating of the workpiece, forming operation is carried out in lengthwise direction of the toothing. This forming rolls is positioned on the roll head and have a rolling axis vertical with the one of a mandrel. The total forming load needed in the <b>cold</b> <b>reduction</b> process is separated into numerous forming steps along the entire cylindrical length of the zone to be formed. In the process of cold forming on the profiled mandrel during the impact forming operation, material is pushed into depression of toothing of a mandrel mainly in a radial direction. Finally splines can be generated {{on the surface of}} components and overall elongated. If the process parameter such as the length of forming per 1 rotation of 1 roll is not optimized, the impact force from the rolls of the forming process causes geometrical defects. So the optimal parameters such as feeding and rotating speed of workpiece and the forming length should be properly determined.
