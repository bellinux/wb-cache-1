5|$|Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. Génessier and his {{assistant}} Louise, {{the woman who had}} disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden (it is explained that Louise is deathlessly loyal to Génessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face, leaving only a barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl <b>choker).</b> The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement. After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fiancé Jacques Vernon, who works with Dr. Génessier at his clinic, but hangs up without saying a word.|$|E
5|$|Jacques {{reports the}} call to the police, who have been {{investigating}} the disappearance of several young women with blue eyes and similar facial characteristics. The police have gained a lead concerning a woman who wears a pearl <b>choker,</b> whom Jacques recognizes as Louise. Inspector Parot, an officer investigating Edna's disappearance, coerces a young woman named Paulette Mérodon (recently arrested for shoplifting) to help investigate by checking herself into Génessier's clinic. After being declared healthy, Paulette leaves for Paris and is promptly picked up by Louise, who delivers her to Dr. Génessier. Génessier {{is about to begin}} surgery on Paulette when Louise informs him that the police want to see him.|$|E
5|$|After its {{removal from}} Operation Varsity, the {{division}} remained in reserve as the Allied armies advanced even further into Germany, moving to Oise, France, on 3 April for supply and administrative tasks. The division {{was scheduled to}} participate in several other airborne operations; however, these were all cancelled before they could take place. The first of these was Operation Arena, which envisioned landing between six and ten divisions into what was termed a 'strategic airhead' in the Kassel region of Northern Germany; the planners of the operations envisioned that the operation would deny a large swathe of territory to the German defenders and give the Allied armies a staging area for further advances into Germany. The 13th was chosen to participate, along with the 17th, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and the British 6th and 1st Airborne Divisions. A preliminary date for 1 May was set for the operation once all of the required airborne and air-landed infantry divisions had been located and supplied, but it was ultimately cancelled on 26 March due to the rapid movement of Allied ground forces negating {{the need for the}} operation. Two other airborne operations were planned to include the 13th. Operation <b>Choker</b> II was to be an airborne landing on the east bank of the Rhine near Worms, Germany; planning for the operation got to an advanced stage, and the division was only hours from taking off from airfields in France when the operation was cancelled due to Allied ground forces overrunning the proposed landing areas. Operation Effective was designed to land the 13th south of Stuttgart, seize a nearby airfield and create an airhead for further forces to land in near the Black Forest. The operation was scheduled for 22 April, but was cancelled on 18 April due to Allied units encircling the Black Forest region and making it unnecessary.|$|E

It attacks by reaching or leaping from its hiding space and grappling in order to, as its name suggests, choke the victim. <b>Chokers</b> speak Undercommon.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a time-study conducted near Grand Ronde, Oregon, to determine the production rates and total harvesting costs of a cable thinning in a young stand. The stand had a species mix of 48 percent western hemlock (Tsuga. heterophylla- (Raf.) Sarg.), 45 percent Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga meuziesil (Mirb.) Franco), and 7 percent white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. & Fiend.) Lindi.). The stand had an average age of 33 years, with a mean dbh of the total stand (over 1. 5 inches (3. 8 i cm) dbh) of 5. 7 inches (14. 48 cm). The mean dbh of the merchantable stems (over 6 inches (15. 84 cm) dbh) was 8. 3 inches. The yarder belonged to the small size class of yarders, and was rigged with a live skyline system using a selfclamping, manual slack-puliing carriage. Three hooking techniques consisting of three <b>chokers</b> with sliders, presetting three ring <b>chokers</b> andusing a toggle hook, and flying six ring <b>chokers</b> per turn were compared on a production basis. Regression equations were developed for the individual elements of the yarding cycles and for total cycle times ftr each hooking technique. Results indicate that there is {{no significant difference between the}} production rates of three <b>chokers</b> and sliders compared with three preset ring <b>chokers</b> and a toggle hook. There was a significant difierence between the production rates when using the three <b>chokers</b> and sliders compared with using six ring <b>chokers</b> and a toggle hook. The six ring <b>chokers</b> and toggle hook was about 13 percent faster per MBP. The total harvesting cost was compared with the mill value of the timber. The total harvesting cost included felling, limbing, and bucking cost, equipment move-in and move-out cost, yarding cost, loading cost, and hauling cost. Not included in the harvesting cost was road costs, engineering and layout costs, timber tax costs, or any profit and risk costs. The total harvesting cost came to 227. 90 per MBP. The weighted average mill price for the logs was 250. 24 per MBP...|$|R
25|$|In December 1937 Gustav's daughter–and Ferdinand's niece–Maria, {{married the}} young opera singer Fritz Altman. Ferdinand gave her Adele's jewelled <b>choker,</b> which had {{appeared}} in two of Klimt's paintings, as a wedding present. Ferdinand left Vienna for his Czechoslovakian castle in March 1938, following the Anschluss of Austria by Nazi Germany. That autumn, following the Munich Agreement, he realised he was not safe and left for Paris. In September the following year, he moved to neutral Switzerland where {{he lived in a}} hotel. In his absence the Nazi regime falsely accused him of evading taxes of 1.4million Reichsmarks. His assets were frozen and, in May 1938 a seizure order was issued that allowed the state to dispose of his property as they felt fit. His sugar factory was confiscated and turned over to the state, and went through a process of Aryanisation as Jewish shareholders and managers were replaced. His Viennese residence became an office of , the German railway company, while his castle in Czechoslovakia was taken after the German occupation as the personal residence of the Nazi general Reinhard Heydrich.|$|E
25|$|In Mound A {{the tomb}} is {{associated}} with a pit burial. All that remains in the pit burial of its original fill are worn igneous rocks, quantities of coarse sherds and human skull parts that had been cut through by the digging of the tomb. The tomb contains the remains of eight people. One corpse received special treatment, as evinced by the considerable amount of jewelry and the offerings left with it. The bodies were borne into the tomb on fabric mats or animal hides of which only traces remain. Among the objects found as offerings in the tomb were jade beads around the necks of two of the corpses, wafer-like disc shells forming a <b>choker</b> on one skeleton, jade earplug flares, an unusually large number of shells, a fine obsidian blade, a tortoise shell, metates, and various fine pottery pieces including a whistling jar and a carved tripod vessel. Several coarse brownware vessels heaped {{against the wall of the}} tomb probably originally contained food prepared for the after-life journey of the dead.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a short sample of Fantasia's song [...] "Crazy", another track from The Definition Of..., {{accompanied}} by images from a high school yearbook. A teenage Fantasia is introduced discussing love with her friends while having a party in her bedroom. She develops a crush on a classmate, while rejecting the romantic advances from other men. Following a time jump, Fantasia leaves her boyfriend after discovering {{that he has been}} cheating on her with another woman. Close-up images of singers Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin, and girl groups SWV and TLC are used throughout the video.

500|$|The {{character}} {{designs were}} created by Kazuma Kaneko. In keeping with the [...] "MegaTen Detective" [...] theme, Kaneko emulated the genre's hard-boiled elements in his character designs. Kuzunoha's character design {{was inspired by the}} first animated version of Japanese character Lupin III, the main protagonists of Tantei Monogatari and , and the titular character from The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Rei Reiho, who Kaneko later referred to as his favorite female character design, was created to be the main character's sidekick and consequently was portrayed as a strong character. Her appearance was influenced by Japanese model Kitaura Tomoe. Her <b>choker</b> necklace, which was hung with coins needed to cross the Sanzu River after death, was part of how Kaneko expressed the story's hard-boiled elements. The character Sid Davis was created as Ito wanted a black character in the game: the star mark on his forehead represented a pentagram, which resulted in him getting the production nickname [...] "shooting star". The name of true antagonist Inaruna was influenced by Sumerian mythology. She was originally going to be Princess Takiyasha, the legendary daughter of Taira no Masakado: while the explicit details were changed, Inaruna's character was still influenced by the tales surrounding Takiyasha. Her reincarnation in the form of Kumiko was a conscious reference to the Megami Tensei series' titular concept of reincarnation. Kumiko's early portrayal was far gentler than she was in the final game: given a high-class background, she would come across as a Yamato nadeshiko. Supporting character Dr. Victor was based on the titular protagonist of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. Future character designer Shigenori Soejima worked on the game a sprite designer. Devil Summoner would be his very first work within the Megami Tensei franchise.|$|E
