30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that most of the <b>cases</b> <b>involved</b> the middle talocalcaneal joint. Only two <b>cases</b> <b>involved</b> the {{posterior}} joint instead of the middle talocalcaneal joint, and both of these <b>cases</b> <b>involved</b> Type I coalitions. Four additional Type I cases exhibited coalition with middle/posterior involvement. All Type II and III coalitions involved only the middle talocalcaneal joint.|$|R
2500|$|The Dutch {{established}} a Court of Justice {{in the southern}} town of Tainan. [...] The Dutch colonists maintained a concept of legal dualism. [...] If the <b>case</b> <b>involved</b> Europeans, then Dutch law would take effect. [...] If the <b>case</b> <b>involved</b> aboriginals, aboriginal law would take effect. [...] If the <b>case</b> <b>involved</b> Han, then the customs of the Han people would take effect.|$|R
5|$|In special <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> unusually {{overweight}} trucks (which {{require special}} permits), not observing a bridge weight limit {{can lead to}} disastrous consequences.

5|$|The two {{aboriginal}} title <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> indigenous litigants {{to reach}} the Taney Court both involved the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians and the Tonawanda Reservation, both argued by John H.

5|$|As bishop, Burnell had a wall {{built around}} the cathedral at Wells, which helped to improve the {{security}} of the cathedral and its outlying buildings. He left the court each year at Lent, when he returned to his diocese and attended to its affairs. Peckham appointed Burnell to be his deputy when the archbishop went to Wales in 1282. It was probably Burnell who suggested a compromise in 1285 over the jurisdictions of the royal and ecclesiastical courts, which allowed royal officials to return <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> only religious matters to the church courts.|$|E
50|$|Most nonexclusionary {{discrimination}} <b>cases</b> <b>involve</b> applying discriminatory {{terms and}} conditions within the victim's current residential setting. The majority of these <b>cases</b> <b>involve</b> terms, conditions, and privileges relating to a current rental arrangement. These cases are often seen as unfairly raising the rent of a select group or allowing certain tenants privileges, like using a facility after hours or being lenient on pet policies. Many nonexclusionary discrimination <b>cases</b> <b>involve</b> the failure to provide equal access to services and facilities, such as purposely delaying or completely forgoing fixing a broken pipe. More {{terms and conditions}} <b>cases</b> <b>involve</b> discriminatory financing, loans, and appraisals of the individual or family's property, which is when the discriminatory actor {{takes advantage of the}} victim financially.|$|R

5|$|Judicial: India has {{a unitary}} three-tier {{independent}} judiciary that comprises the Supreme Court, {{headed by the}} Chief Justice of India, 24 High Courts, {{and a large number}} of trial courts. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre; it has appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts. It has the power both to declare the law and to strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution, as well as to invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court possessed {{jurisdiction}} {{in criminal cases}} only via writs of error from state courts, original writs of habeas corpus, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In three <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> certificates of division, the Marshall Court decided issues of double jeopardy, but did not clearly rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause. Similarly, the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The head of {{the legal}} system was officially the pharaoh, who was {{responsible}} for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> small claims and minor disputes. More serious <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.|$|E

5|$|This dictum, which {{established}} that corporations enjoyed personhood under the Equal Protection Clause, was repeatedly reaffirmed by later courts. It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth century, {{though it was}} challenged in dissents by justices such as Hugo Black and William O. Douglas. Between 1890 and 1910, Fourteenth Amendment <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> corporations vastly outnumbered those involving the rights of blacks, 288 to 19.|$|E
5|$|United States v. Lanza {{was one of}} {{a series}} of <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> Prohibition. Lanza {{committed}} acts allegedly in violation of both state and federal law, and was first convicted in Washington state court, then prosecuted in federal district court. He alleged the second prosecution in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Taft, for a unanimous court, allowed the second prosecution, holding that the state and federal governments were dual sovereigns, each empowered to prosecute the conduct in question.|$|E
5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E

5000|$|... 2004 19 February - 16 April, Faridpur District, Bangladesh: 36 {{cases with}} 27 {{fatalities}} (75% mortality). 92% of <b>cases</b> <b>involved</b> {{close contact with}} at least one other person infected with Nipah virus. Two <b>cases</b> <b>involved</b> a single short exposure to an ill patient, including a rickshaw driver who transported a patient to hospital. In addition, at least six <b>cases</b> <b>involved</b> acute respiratory distress syndrome, which has not been reported previously for Nipah virus illness in humans. This symptom is likely to have assisted human-to-human transmission through large droplet dispersal.|$|R
5|$|Chinese {{human rights}} lawyers have {{charged that the}} 610 Office {{regularly}} interferes with legal <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> Falun Gong practitioners, subverting the ability of judges to adjudicate independently. Attorney Jiang Tianyong has noted that cases where the defendants are Falun Gong practitioners are decided by the local 610 Offices, rather than through recourse to legal standards. In November 2008, two lawyers seeking to represent Falun Gong practitioners in Heilongjiang noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents. Other lawyers, including Gao Zhisheng, Guo Guoting and Wang Yajun have alleged that the 610 Office interfered with their ability to meet with Falun Gong clients or defend them in court.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro's first {{full-time}} political job came in , {{when she}} was appointed Assistant District Attorney for Queens County, New York, by her cousin, District Attorney Nicholas Ferraro. At the time, women prosecutors in the city were uncommon. Grumblings {{that she was the}} beneficiary of nepotism were countered by her being rated as qualified by a screening committee and by her early job performance in the Investigations Bureau. The following year, Ferraro was assigned to the new Special Victims Bureau, which prosecuted <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> rape, child abuse, spouse abuse, and domestic violence. She was named head of the unit in 1977, with two other assistant district attorneys assigned to her. In this role, she became a strong advocate for abused children. She was admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court Bar in 1978.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey prohibits plea {{bargaining}} in DUI cases unless the prosecutor {{believes there is}} insufficient evidence to prove the case, and New Jersey does not offer hardship (work) licenses for people convicted of DUI. Because DUI is not a criminal offense in New Jersey, defendants are ineligible for pretrial intervention (PTI) and other diversion programs. A previous DUI conviction, in New Jersey or another state, cannot be used to disqualify a person from such programs, and those charged with an indictable offense stemming from drunk driving (e.g. <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> serious injuries or eluding arrest) are eligible for PTI. A person convicted of DUI is barred from recovering accident-related damages from other drivers, but {{may be able to}} sue the business or person who served them alcoholic beverages.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} her {{traumatic}} childhood, Sidle has demonstrated compassion and empathy for victims of domestic violence, and fury against their abusers. She also has {{a soft spot for}} animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig. She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, perhaps {{because of her}} mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.|$|E
5|$|Points {{and lines}} {{may be viewed}} as special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> points and lines {{may be viewed as}} limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Justice is {{responsible}} for handling legal matters for the government. Its responsibilities include providing legal advice, criminal prosecution, civil representation, legal and policy drafting and reform and international legal co-operation between different jurisdictions. Apart from prosecuting criminal cases, lawyers of the Department of Justice act {{on behalf of the}} government in all civil and administrative lawsuits against the government. As protector of public interest, the department may apply for judicial reviews and may intervene in any <b>cases</b> <b>involving</b> the greater public interest. The Basic Law protects the Department of Justice from any interference by the government when exercising its control over criminal prosecution.|$|E
