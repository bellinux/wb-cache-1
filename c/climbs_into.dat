5|$|English doctor Maxwell (Shearsmith) {{settles into}} bunk 9E while {{travelling}} from Paris to Bourg-Saint-Maurice. Maxwell is disturbed first by Jorg (Pemberton), a drunk, flatulent German who <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> bunk 9D, then by Kath (Hesmondhalgh) and Les (Benton), a couple travelling to their daughter's wedding. Jorg is in Les's bed, but the couple climb into 9A. Australian backpacker Shona (Gunning) enters; she places her bag on bunk 9C then leaves, and Maxwell closes the door. Kath and Les, laughing at Maxwell, begin to undress on the bed. Les wakes Jorg, but understanding is limited until Maxwell translates. Jorg switches to 9F and Les <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> 9D.|$|E

5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to pretend that magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as a week off from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E

The southern trend reverses itself after this junction, with first NY26 and later NY12B joining US20 to create another three-route overlap. This persists for three very straight miles until both leave to the north {{in the town of}} Madison. After another , the highway crosses into Oneida County.|$|E

500|$|Despite the negativity, several reviews wrote {{positively}} of the episode's antagonistic beggar. Both TV Guide and UGO Networks listed him {{amongst the}} greatest monster-of-the-week characters in The X-Files. The UGO review, in particular, {{noted that the}} character was [...] "One of the series' more blatant allegories , as a legless Indian Mystic [...] literally <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> his victims to travel where he will. [...] Scully and Doggett investigate the bloody goings-on [...] and a gut-wrenching climax, though not entirely successful, still opens up some thorny issues over how we view weakness, deformity, race, and 'otherness.' ...|$|E
500|$|The scenes where Dwight <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> a box {{almost did}} not make the episode. Mike Schur, who wrote the episode, feared that Dwight {{climbing}} into the box would not only make the episode [...] "crazy broad," [...] but also make the rest of the episode look boring by comparison. After shooting the scene, however, he described it as [...] "the most natural thing in the world." [...] Phil Shaw, the stunt man for The Office, did most of the work in the box. Schur described Dwight's emergence from the box as his [...] "action hero" [...] moment. Daniels likened the scene to the movie Alien.|$|E
