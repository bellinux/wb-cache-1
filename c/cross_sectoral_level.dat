30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the causal relationship between electricity consumption and real output at the macro <b>level</b> and the <b>sectoral</b> <b>levels</b> in three main economic sectors, namely the agricultural, industrial, and services sectors in Egypt during the period 1971 – 2013. I use Johansen cointegration approach, vector error correction model, and Toda and Yamamoto (J Econom 66 : 225 – 250, 1995) approach. Empirical findings reveal the existence of a cointegration relationship between the variables at the macro <b>level</b> and the <b>sectoral</b> <b>levels.</b> At the macro level, there is bidirectional causality between real output and electricity consumption. Whereas at the <b>sectoral</b> <b>levels,</b> there exists bidirectional causality between electricity consumption and real output in the services sector and unidirectional causality running from real output in the industrial sector to electricity consumption. However, there is no causal relationship between electricity consumption and real output in the agricultural sector. These results can help policymakers in setting the appropriate electricity conservation policies that enhance economic growth at the macro <b>level</b> and the <b>sectoral</b> <b>levels</b> to prevent any possible adverse effect that may harm economic and social development. Additionally, ensuring a higher level of electricity generation needed for achieving high and sustainable economic growth is vital, where higher electricity generation can be provided through investing in clean technologies and renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar energy.|$|R

First, {{the data is}} analyzed using a novel method due to Phillips and Sul (2007) leading to different conclusions in comparison to past studies, and secondly <b>sectoral</b> <b>level</b> data is employed which to our knowledge has not been employed in the literature before. Applying the novel approach to panel data relating to fifteen major states of India for the period 1968 / 69 – 2008 / 09, the results display significant divergence in per capita income across states at the aggregate and <b>sectoral</b> <b>levels.</b> There is also evidence of convergence clubs and variations in the number and composition of clubs across sectors. While three clubs are identified at the aggregate <b>level,</b> at the <b>sectoral</b> <b>level</b> we find three clubs in the industrial sector, two clubs are identified in both the agriculture and services sectors.

40|$|Cointegration and vector error {{correction}} modeling approaches {{are widely used}} in electricity demand analysis. The study rigorously examines the determinants of electricity demand at aggregate and <b>sectoral</b> <b>levels</b> in Pakistan. In the backdrop of severe electricity shortages, our empirical findings give support {{to the existence of}} a stable long-run relationship among the variables and indicate that electricity demand is elastic in the long run to both income and price at aggregate <b>level.</b> At <b>sectoral</b> <b>level,</b> long-run income and price elasticity estimates follow this pattern except in agricultural sector, where electricity demand is found elastic to output but inelastic to electricity price. On the contrary, the coefficients for income and price are rather small and mostly insignificant in the short run. We employed temperature index, price of diesel oil and capital stock at aggregate and <b>sectoral</b> <b>levels</b> as exogenous variables. These variables account for most of the variations in electricity demand in the short run. It shows that mechanization of the economy significantly affect the electricity demand at macro level. Moreover, elastic electricity demand with respect to electricity price in most of the sectors implies that electricity price as a policy tool can be used for efficient use and conservation.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the long-run relationship of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) with the Gross Output (GO), Export (EX) and Labour Productivity (LPR) in the Indian economy at the <b>sectoral</b> <b>level</b> by using the annual data from 1990 - 91 to 2000 - 01. The study uses the Panel co-integration (PCONT) test and the results demonstrate that the flow of FDI into the sectors has helped to raise the output, labour productivity and export in some sectors but a better role of FDI at the <b>sectoral</b> <b>level</b> is still expected. Results also reveal that there is no significant co-integrating relationship among the variables like FDI, GO, EX and LPR in core sectors of the economy. This implies that when there is an increase in the output, export or labour productivity of the sectors it is not due to the advent of FDI. Thus, it could be concluded that the advent of FDI has not helped to wield a positive impact on the Indian economy at the <b>sectoral</b> <b>level.</b> Thus, in the eve of India's plan for further opening up of the economy, it is advisable to open up the export oriented sectors so that a higher growth of the economy could be achieved through the growth of these sectors. 1 I would express my appreciation to Dr Peter Pedroni who provided advice and suggestions in th...|$|R
