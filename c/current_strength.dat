25|$|The {{decision}} to abolish National Service {{was taken in}} 1957 with the 1957 Defence White Paper, which led to an enormous {{reduction in the number}} of soldiers between 1958–63, from about 330,000 to 165,000 by the end of National Service. In the decades that followed, cuts in the Army were the constant theme, although they were never on a large scale until the end of the cold war. Between 1963 and 1992, strength was reduced to 153,000. In 1990, the Government started another defence review, which concluded with the Defence White Paper of 1992. In a post-Soviet world, the white paper would again further reduce the army by 50,000, effectively ending the British Army of the Rhine. The <b>current</b> <b>strength</b> of the British army is approximately 102,000 regular personnel.|$|E

The attack at Montcornet, a key road junction near Laon, began around 4.30am on 17 May. Outnumbered and without air support, he lost 23 of his 90 vehicles to mines, anti-tank weapons or Stukas. On 18 May he {{was reinforced by}} two fresh regiments of armoured cavalry, bringing his <b>current</b> <b>strength</b> up to 150 vehicles.

2500|$|Ohm's law has {{sometimes}} been stated as, [...] "for a conductor in a given state, the electromotive force {{is proportional to the}} current produced." [...] That is, that the resistance, the ratio of the applied electromotive force (or voltage) to the current, [...] "does not vary with the <b>current</b> <b>strength</b> [...]" [...] The qualifier [...] "in a given state" [...] is usually interpreted as meaning [...] "at a constant temperature," [...] since the resistivity of materials is usually temperature dependent. Because the conduction of current is related to Joule heating of the conducting body, according to Joule's first law, the temperature of a conducting body may change when it carries a current. [...] The dependence of resistance on temperature therefore makes resistance depend upon the current in a typical experimental setup, making the law in this form difficult to directly verify. [...] Maxwell and others worked out several methods to test the law experimentally in 1876, controlling for heating effects.|$|E
2500|$|Stuart James Karppinen (born 13 June 1973) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who is the <b>current</b> <b>strength</b> and {{conditioning}} coach of the Australian national cricket team. Born in Townsville, Karppinen moved to Canberra with his family at a young age. He played for the Australian Capital Territory Under-19s at the 1991–92 Barclays Bank Australian Under-19 Championships, taking one wicket in his only match. He was first selected for the Australian Capital Territory senior side during the 1993–94 season, although the ACT did not at the time have either first-class or List A status, and thus only played state teams' Second XIs and other sides touring Canberra. Karppinen was also the recipient of an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship in 1997. The Australian Capital Territory {{was admitted to the}} Australian domestic limited-overs competition for the 1997–98 season, playing as the [...] "Canberra Comets". Karppinen played six matches for the team in their inaugural season, taking nine wickets with a best of 2/35.

2500|$|In 272, Bu Chan, the {{military}} commander stationed at Xiling (西陵), started a rebellion against Wu {{and sent a}} messenger to the Jin dynasty to express his wish to defect to Jin. When Lu Kang received news of the revolt, he immediately gave orders to his subordinates Zuo Yi (左奕), Wu Yan (吾彥), Cai Gong (蔡貢) and others to lead separate forces and head towards Xiling via shortcuts. He instructed his men to construct defensive structures {{all the way from}} Chixi (赤谿) to Gushi (故市) so as to form an encirclement around Bu Chan's position, {{while at the same time}} defending the area from attacks by Jin forces. He ordered them to work day and night to complete the construction works as if the enemy had already arrived, and his soldiers were all tired and worn out. Lu Kang's subordinates said, [...] "With our <b>current</b> <b>strength,</b> we can attack Bu Chan and destroy him before Jin forces arrive. Why are we exhausting ourselves by constructing defensive structures instead?" [...] Lu Kang replied, [...] "Xiling's fortifications are very stable and it has sufficient supplies. Besides, I was the one who oversaw the construction of Xiling's defences. If we attack it now, I don't think we can conquer it easily. If Jin forces show up and we don't have adequate defensive structures, we'll be trapped in between Bu Chan and Jin and have nothing to protect ourselves from the enemy." [...] The officers repeatedly urged Lu Kang to attack Xiling but Lu refused. Eventually, Lei Tan (雷譚), the Administrator (太守) of Yidu (宜都), came to see Lu Kang and used kind words to persuade him to attack Xiling. To prove that he was right, Lu Kang relented and ordered an assault on Xiling. As he expected, they did not succeed in capturing the city, so his officers gave up their idea of attacking and complied with Lu Kang's orders to construct the defensive structures.|$|E
