60|$|The sage {{desiring}} {{to think}} well and wisely about a poker will begin somewhat as follows: Among the live creatures that crawl about this star the queerest {{is the thing}} called Man. This plucked and plumeless bird, comic and forlorn, is the butt of all the philosophies. He is the only naked animal; and this quality, once, it is said, his glory, is now his shame. He has to go outside himself for everything that he wants. He might almost be considered as an absent-minded person who had gone bathing and left his clothes everywhere, so that he has hung his hat upon the beaver and his coat upon the sheep. The rabbit has white warmth for a waistcoat, and the glow-worm has a lantern for a head. But man has no heat in his hide, and the light in his body is darkness; and he must look for light and warmth in the wild, <b>cold</b> <b>universe</b> {{in which he is}} cast. This is equally true of his soul and of his body; he is the one creature that has lost his heart as much as he has lost his hide. In a spiritual sense he has taken leave of his senses; and even in a literal sense he has been unable to keep his hair on. And just as this external need of his has lit in his dark brain the dreadful star called religion, so it has lit in his hand the only adequate symbol of it: I mean the red flower called Fire. Fire, the most magic and startling of all material things, is a thing known only to man and the expression of his sublime externalism. It embodies all that is human in his hearths and all that is divine on his altars. It is the most human thing in the world; seen across wastes of marsh or medleys of forest, it is veritably the purple and golden flag of the sons of Eve. But there is about this generous and rejoicing thing an alien and awful quality: the quality of torture. Its presence is life; its touch is death. Therefore, it is always necessary to have an intermediary between ourselves and this dreadful deity; to have a priest to intercede for us with the god of life and death; to send an ambassador to the fire. That priest is the poker. Made of a material more merciless and warlike than the other instruments of domesticity, hammered on the anvil and born itself in the flame, the poker is strong enough to enter the burning fiery furnace, and, like the holy children, not be consumed. In this heroic service it is often battered and twisted, but is the more honourable for it, like any other soldier who has been under fire.|$|E

We also provide evidence that the Euclidean path integral over geometries with spherical topology is unstable with respect to formation of infinitely many wormhole-connected 4 -spheres. Consistency is restored by summing over all topologies, which leads to Coleman’s result. Coleman’s argument for determination of other parameters is reviewed and applied to {{the mass of the}} pion. A discouraging result is found that the pion mass is driven to zero. We also consider qualitatively the implications of the wormhole theory for cosmology.

40|$|Recently a {{covariant}} {{approach to}} <b>cold</b> matter <b>universes</b> in the zero-shear hypersurfaces (or longitudinal) gauge has been developed. This approach reveals {{the existence of}} an integrability condition, which does not appear in standard non-covariant treatments. A simple derivation and generalization of the integrability condition is given, based on showing that the quasi-Newtonian models are a sub-class of the linearized `silent' models. The solution of the integrability condition implies a propagation equation for the acceleration. It is shown how the velocity and density perturbations are then obtained via this propagation equation. The density perturbations acquire a small relative-velocity correction on all scales, arising from the fully covariant general relativistic analysis. Comment: 11 pages Revtex; to appear Phys.

40|$|We {{describe}} new {{scenarios of}} generating curvature perturbations when inflaton (curvaton) has significant interactions.
