Methods: Combination of <b>Candesartan</b> <b>Cilexetil</b> and Pioglitazone Hydrochloride has only one LC-MS/MS analytical method developed yet, so this UV method was novel for combined synthetic dosage of <b>Candesartan</b> <b>Cilexetil</b> and Pioglitazone Hydrochloride (1 : 2). This method utilizes methanol as a solvent. Zero crossing point (ZCP) of <b>Candesartan</b> <b>Cilexetil</b> and Pioglitazone hydrochloride were found to be 242. 00 nm and 327. 60 nm respectively. Hence, estimation of <b>Candesartan</b> <b>Cilexetil</b> and Pioglitazone Hydrochloride were done at 327. 60 nm and 242. 00 nm respectively.

40|$|The {{addition}} of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> (Atacand(R), Amias(R), Blopress(R), Kenzen(R), Ratacand(R)) to standard therapy for chronic heart failure (CHF) provided important clinical benefits at {{little or no}} additional cost in France, Germany and the UK, according to a detailed economic analysis focusing on major cardiovascular events and prospectively collected resource-use data from the CHARM-Added and CHARM-Alternative trials in patients with CHF and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Results of a corresponding cost-effectiveness analysis showed that <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> was either dominant over placebo or was associated with small incremental costs per life-year gained, depending on the country and whether individual trial or pooled data were used. Preliminary data from a US cost-effectiveness analysis based on CHARM data also showed favourable results for <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil.</b> Two cost-effectiveness analyses of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> in hypertension have been published, both conducted in Sweden. Data from the SCOPE trial in elderly patients with hypertension, which showed {{a significant reduction in}} nonfatal stroke with candesartan cilexetil-based therapy versus non-candesartan cilexetil-based treatment, were incorporated into a Markov model and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of _ 12 _ 824 per QALY gained was calculated (2001 value). Another modelled cost-effectiveness analysis of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> was based on the ALPINE trial, in which the incidence of new-onset diabetes was significantly lower in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension who were randomised to <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> (with or without felodipine) than among those who received hydrochlorothiazide (with or without atenolol). Although <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> was dominant over hydrochlorothiazide, the ALPINE cost-effectiveness analysis relied on a small number of clinical events and did not evaluate the incremental cost of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> per life-year or QALY gained. In conclusion, despite some inherent limitations, economic analyses incorporating CHARM data and conducted primarily in Europe have shown that <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> appears to be cost effective when added to standard CHF treatment in patients with CHF and compromised LV systolic function. The use of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> as part of antihypertensive therapy in elderly patients with elevated blood pressure was also deemed to be cost effective in a Swedish analysis, primarily resulting from a reduced risk of nonfatal stroke (as shown in the SCOPE study); however, the generalisability of results to other contexts has not been established.

40|$|Established primary {{hypertension}} {{is primarily}} characterised by elevated peripheral resistance {{and an increase}} in renal vascular resistance. Antagonism of angiotensin II may be a particularly relevant intervention in this condition, as angiotensin II is known to act both as a powerful vasoconstrictor and as a stimulus to vascular hyperthrophy. The aims of this study were to: - evaluate the acute and long-term effects of 16 mg <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> o. d., an angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor blocker, on systemic and renal haemodynamics and RAAS hormones in patients with mild and moderate hypertension, - assess the long-term effects on forearm haemodynamics and baroreceptor sensitivity and, finally, - compare the effects of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> 16 mg with the effects of losartan 50 mg and valsartan 80 mg on blood pressure, renal haemodynamics and RAAS hormones before and during intravenous angiotensin II infusion. Blood pressure was assessed intra-arterially and by ordinary mercury manometer. Cardiac output was measured using the dye dilution technique in the acute and long-term study. In the comparison between AT 1 receptor blockers, blood pressure was assessed with an ordinary mercury manometer. Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were obtained from PAH and 51 CrEDTA clearance and forearm blood flow by mercury strain gauge plethysmography. Baroreceptor sensitivity was calculated from beat-to-beat changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate. A single oral dose of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> induced systemic and renal vasodilation and blood pressure reduction without compromising renal perfusion or filtration or affecting cardiac perfomance. Long-term treatment with <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> o. d. induced systemic, forearm and renal vasodilation and a blood pressure reduction. As in the acute study, <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> induced a reduction in renal vascular resistance. The glomerular filtration rate was maintained and the filtration fraction was reduced, indicating a decreased glomerular capillary pressure. The baroreceptor sensitivity was not influenced by <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> but the operational set point was shifted to the left. In the comparative study, <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> 16 mg o. d. reduced resting blood pressure significantly more than losartan 50 mg o. d. and valsartan 80 mg o. d. <b>Candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> almost completely inhibited the exogenous angiotensin II-induced renal vasoconstriction, effectively inhibited the increase in filtration fraction and significantly blunted aldosterone secretion compared with losartan and valsartan, indicating a more effective AT 1 receptor blockade with <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil.</b> In conclusion, <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> is a vasodilator providing long-term blood pressure control without initial reflex tachycardia. Long-term renal adaptation is characterised by a reduction in filtration fraction. The superior blood pressure control and more pronounced inhibition of exogenous angiotensin II-induced effects with <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> compared with losartan and valsartan might be explained by the binding properties of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil,</b> especially the slow dissociation from the receptor...|$|R

In this study we determined the contribution of AT 2 R to chronic antihypertensive and remodelling effects of AT 1 R blockade in aged hypertensive rats. Adult (20 weeks) and senescent (20 months) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were treated with either the AT 1 R antagonist, <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> (2 [*]mg/kg/day), the AT 2 R antagonist, PD 123319 (10 [*]mg/kg/day), {{or a combination of}} the 2 compounds. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and left ventricular volume were markedly decreased by <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil,</b> however, simultaneous treatment with PD 123319 had no additional effect on either parameter. Perivascular fibrosis was significantly reduced by <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> in aged animals only, and this effect was reversed by concomitant PD 123319 administration. Vascular hypertrophy was reduced by <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil,</b> and these effects were reversed by simultaneous PD 123319. These results suggest that AT 2 R stimulation does not significantly influence the antihypertensive effect of chronic AT 1 R blockade, but plays a role in the regulation of vascular structure.

BackgroundInhibition of the renin-{{angiotensin}} system by both angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (AT 1 As) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) shows renoprotective effects in rats with {{chronic renal failure}} when treatment is started in the early phase of renal injury. In this study, we examined the renal protective effects of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> (TCV- 116), an AT 1 A, and enalapril, an ACEI, in the progressive phase of renal injury in 5 / 6 nephrectomized rats. MethodsCandesartan cilexetil (1 mg/kg/day) and enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks (the short-term experiment) or 16 weeks (the long-term experiment) to 5 / 6 nephrectomized rats beginning 15 weeks after the nephrectomy, that is, after they had already showed marked proteinuria. ResultsIn vehicle-treated rats, proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis developed. Moreover, enhanced expression of transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) in the injured glomeruli was observed. These adverse changes progressed with time, and in the short-term experiment, both drugs inhibited them. In the long-term experiment, the progressive proteinuria and the {{elevation of blood pressure}} were similarly attenuated by both drugs. However, <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> significantly inhibited the progression of glomerulosclerosis, the expression of TGF-β 1, and interstitial fibrosis, whereas enalapril did not.

A large-scale, eight week, open-label, non-placebo-controlled, single-arm trial evaluated the efficacy, tolerability and dose-response of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil,</b> 16 — 32 mg once-daily, either as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy, in a diverse hypertensive population in actual practice settings. 6465 patients with high blood pressure, of whom 52 % were female and 16 % African American, {{with a mean age of}} 58 years, were included. 5446 patients had essential hypertension and 1014 patients had isolated systolic hypertension. In order to be included in this study, patients had either untreated or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 — 179 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 — 109 mmHg inclusive at baseline), despite a variety of other antihypertensive drugs. Of the 5156 patients with essential hypertension and at least one post baseline efficacy measurement, the mean pretreatment blood pressure (BP) was 156 / 97 mmHg. <b>Candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> monotherapy reduced mean SBP/DBP by 18. 0 / 12. 2 mmHg. Similarly, in the 964 patients with isolated systolic hypertension and at least one post baseline efficacy measurement, <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> monotherapy reduced SBP/DBP from 158 / 81 by 16. 5 / 4. 5 mmHg. <b>Candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> was similarly effective when employed as add-on therapy. When added to baseline antihypertensive medication in 51 % of the patients with essential hypertension not achieving BP control, additional reduction in BP was achieved regardless of the background therapy, including diuretics (17. 8 / 11. 7 mmHg) calcium antagonists (16. 6 / 11. 2 mmHg), beta-blockers (16. 5 / 10. 4 mmHg), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) (15. 3 / 10. 0 mmHg), and alpha blockers (16. 4 / 10. 4 mmHg). Likewise, when <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> was used as add-on therapy in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, there was a consistent further reduction of mean SBP/DBP, regardless of the background therapy. Moreover, these monotherapeutic or add-on efficacy benefits were seen regardless of age (65 years), gender, or race. Despite the open-label design of the study which enhances efficacy owing to the placebo effect, the Ang II receptor blocker, <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> either alone, or as an add-on therapy, is highly effective for assisting in the control of systolic and diastolic hypertension...|$|R

A total of 94 patients of either gender aged between 18 and 75 years with normal or mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction (Study I) and normal or mild to moderate/severe renal dysfunction (Studies 2 - 5) were included. Subjects recruited to all studies evaluating the effect of renal impairment also had some degree of hypertension. Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment showed no significant differences in the key plasma pharmacokinetic parameters or plasma protein binding profile of candesartan compared with healthy volunteers. In patients with mild to moderate or severe renal impairment there were significant increases in the maximum plasma concentration, area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve and elimination half-life of candesartan and its inactive metabolite (CV- 15959) when compared to volunteers with normal renal function following repeated administration of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> 8 or 12 mg. However, {{there was no evidence of}} accumulation following treatment with the 8 mg dose apart from those with severe disease requiring dialysis.

Abstract The Study on COgnition and Prognosis in the Elderly (SCOPE) is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study {{designed}} {{to compare the}} effects of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> and placebo in elderly patients with mild hypertension. The primary objective {{of the study is}} to assess the effect of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> on major cardiovascular events. The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the effect of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> on cognitive function and on total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal function, hospitalization, quality of life and health economics. Male and female patients aged between 70 and 89 years, with a sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 160 - 179 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 - 99 mmHg, and a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 24 or above, are eligible for the study. The overall target study population is 4000 patients, at least 1000 of whom are also to be assessed for quality of life and health economics data. After an open run-in period lasting 1 - 3 months, during which patients are assessed for eligibility and those who are already on antihypertensive therapy at enrolment are switched to hydrochlorothiazide 12. 5 mg o. d., patients are randomized to receive either <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> 8 mg once daily (o. d.) or matching placebo o. d. At subsequent study visits, if SBP remains > 160 mmHg, or has decreased by 85 mmHg, study treatment is doubled to <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> 16 mg o. d. or two placebo tablets o. d. Recruitment was completed in January 1999. At that time 4964 patients had been randomized. All randomized patients will be followed for an additional 2 years.

Moreover, beneficial effects from ARBs, such as tissue protection owing {{to a more}} complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), may be independent of blood pressure-lowering by ARBs. In this investigation, we evaluated whether increasing the dose of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil,</b> in subjects already on the maximally-recommended FDA doses of 32 mg, would induce a further reduction in 24 -hour urinary protein excretion in patients with heavy proteinuria (urinary protein excretion > 1. 5 g/day; mean 4. 4 ± 2 g/day). Ten patients were started on 16 or 32 mg of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> daily. After 1 — 2 months of therapy, the dose was titrated upwards to 96 mg.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESTo {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} an angiotensin (Ang II) type 1 receptor antagonist on immune markers in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). BACKGROUNDAng II stimulates production of immune factors via the Ang II type 1 receptor in vitro, and {{the long-term effects of}} Ang II type 1 receptor antagonists on plasma markers of immune activation are unknown in patients with CHF. METHODSTwenty-three patients with mild to moderate CHF with left ventricular dysfunction were randomly divided into two groups: treatment with Ang II type 1 receptor (<b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil)</b> (n = 14) or placebo (n = 9). We measured plasma levels of immune factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (sICAM- 1) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (sVCAM- 1). We also measured plasma levels of the neurohumoral factors such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a biological marker of ANP and BNP. RESULTSPlasma levels of TNFalpha, IL- 6, sICAM- 1 and sVCAM- 1 were increased in the 23 CHF patients compared with normal subjects and significantly decreased after 14 weeks of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> treatment, but did not change in the placebo group. Plasma levels of BNP, which is a marker of ventricular injury, significantly decreased, and the molar ratio of plasma cGMP to cardiac natriuretic peptides (ANP + BNP) was significantly increased after <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> treatment, but did not change in the placebo group.

Whether it is advantageous to combine <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or uptitrate it in cases of insufficient blood pressure control has not been fully investigated under routine clinical conditions. Methods: CHILI Triple T is a prospective, noninterventional, observational study. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension and added cardiovascular risk received a fixed-dose combination of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> 16 mg and HCTZ 12. 5 mg (combination therapy group) or high-dose monotherapy with <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> 32 mg (high-dose monotherapy group). Results: A total of 4600 patients {{with a mean age of}} 63. 1 &plusmn; 11. 0 years, of which 44. 7 % were female, was included. The combination therapy group had 3337 patients, and the high-dose monotherapy group 1263 patients. Patients in both treatment groups were comparable with respect to age and gender, but patients receiving high-dose monotherapy had a slightly higher mean systolic blood pressure, more prior revascularizations, renal insufficiency, diabetic nephropathy, peripheral artery disease, and a lower ankle brachial index. The use of combination therapy resulted in a blood pressure reduction of - 28. 5 &plusmn; 13. 8 /- 14. 2 &plusmn; 9. 4 mm Hg (P &lt; 0. 001 vs 160. 2 &plusmn; 13. 3 / 94. 5 &plusmn; 8. 2 mm Hg at baseline). The use of high-dose monotherapy reduced blood pressure by - 29. 73 &plusmn; 15. 3 /- 14. 1 &plusmn; 9. 6 mm Hg (P &lt; 0. 001 vs 162. 4 &plusmn; 14. 7 / 94. 7 &plusmn; 8. 7 mm Hg at baseline). Differences in subgroups of patients defined by age, gender, body mass index, dyslipidemia, waist circumference, smoking, prior cardiovascular event, glomerular filtration rate, and microalbuminuria were minor, although partially significant. Tolerability was excellent, with only 28 out of 3358 patients (0. 8 %) in the combination therapy group and 15 out of 1273 patients (1. 2 %) in the high-dose monotherapy group experiencing any adverse event, of which one in each group was considered to be serious (&lt; 0. 1 %). Conclusions: Both the fixed-dose combination of <b>candesartan</b> <b>cilexetil</b> 16 mg and HCTZ 12. 5 mg and high-dose monotherapy with candesartan 32 mg were highly effective in lowering blood pressure in patients at increased cardiovascular risk.

In an effort to identify novel compounds that can alleviate Cu-induced toxicity, we screened the Pharmakon 1600 repositioning library using a Cu-toxicity yeast screen. We identified 2 members of the drug class of Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) that could increase yeast tolerance to Cu, namely Candesartan and Losartan. Subsequently, we show that specific ARBs can increase yeast tolerance to Cu and/or the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin (Cp). The latter also induces mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in mammalian cells. We further demonstrate that specific ARBs can prevent the prevalence of Cu-induced apoptotic markers in yeast, with <b>Candesartan</b> <b>Cilexetil</b> being the ARB which demonstrated most pronounced reduction of apoptosis-related markers. Next, we tested the sensitivity of a selection of yeast knockout mutants affected in detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Cu for <b>Candesartan</b> <b>Cilexetil</b> rescue in presence of Cu.
