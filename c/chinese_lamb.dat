40|$|A group A {{rotavirus}} {{isolated from}} a lamb with diarrhea in Qinhai province, China, was serially passaged in fetal calf kidney cells. In passage 96, rearrangements of RNA segments 5 and 6 of the viral genome were found. Here we report the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of normal and rearranged RNA 6, coding {{for the major}} inner capsid protein VP 6. In comparison with the normal gene (N 6), the rearranged RNA 6 (R 6) contained the normal open reading frame followed by a 473 -nucleotide (nt) duplication of the gene beginning 23 nt after the termination codon. The duplicated region starts at nt 768 and runs through to the 3 ' end of the gene. In accordance with the nucleotide sequence of the rearranged RNA 6, a normal-length VP 6 product was found in cells infected with the mutant. However, a single-amino-acid change from proline to glutamine at position 309 slightly affected the electrophoretic mobility of the VP 6 monomer of the R 6 mutant and reduced the stability of VP 6 trimers on gels and at low pH values compared with the normal gene product. The degree of relatedness of VP 6 of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>lamb</b> rotavirus Lp 14 {{to those of other}} group A rotaviruses was determined...|$|E

40|$|Tan sheep (Ovis aries), a Chinese {{indigenous}} breed, {{has special}} curly fleece after birth, especially at one month old. However, this unique phenotype disappears gradually {{with age and}} the underlying reasons of trait evolvement are still unknown. In this study, skin transcriptome data was used to study this issue. In total 51, 215 transcripts including described transcripts and transfrags were identified. Pathway analysis of the top 100 most highly expressed transcripts, which included TCHH and keratin gene family members, such as KRT 25, KRT 5, KRT 71, KRT 14 and others, showed pathways known to be relevant to hair/fleece development and function. Six hundred differentially expressed (DE) transcripts were detected at two different physiological ages (one-month-old with curly fleece and 48 -month-old without curly fleece) and were categorized into three major functional groups: cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. The top six functional categories included cell, cell part, cellular process, binding, intracellular, metabolic process. The detected differentially expressed genes were particularly involved in signal, signal peptide, disulfide bond, glycoprotein and secreted terms, respectively. Further splicing isoform analysis showed that the metallothionein 3 isoform was up-regulated in Tan lamb skin, indicating {{that it may be}} related to the conformation of curly fleece in <b>Chinese</b> Tan <b>lamb.</b> The hair-related important differentially expressed genes (SPINK 4, FGF 21, ESRa, EphA 3, NTNG 1 and GPR 110) were confirmed by qPCR analysis. We deduced that the differences existed in expressed transcripts, splice isoforms and GO categories between the two differen...|$|R
50|$|In {{ten months}} of unrest at Burrangong, the most infamous riot on the gold fields {{occurred}} {{on the night of}} 30 June 1861 when a mob of 1,500 - 2,000 drove the <b>Chinese</b> off the <b>Lambing</b> Flat, and then moved on to the Back Creek diggings, where 150 - 200 Chinese were encamped, they went about destroying tents and looting possessions. Many of the Chinese were cruelly beaten, but no one was killed. About 1,000 Chinese abandoned the field and set up camp near Roberts' homestead at Currowang sheep station, 20 km away. There were two triggers for the violence: in Sydney the Legislative Council rejected the anti-Chinese bill, and a false rumour swept the goldfield that a new group of 1,500 Chinese were on the road to Burrangong. The police arrived in the days that followed, identified the leaders of the riot, and three were arrested two weeks later. The mob's reaction was an armed attack on the police camp by about a thousand miners on the night of 14 July, which the police broke up with gunfire and mounted sabre charges, leaving one rioter dead and many wounded.|$|R
