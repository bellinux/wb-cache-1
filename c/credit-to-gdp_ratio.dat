40|$|Macroeconomists {{have long}} {{recognized}} that activity-gap measures are unreliable {{in real time}} and that this can present serious difficulties for stabilization policy. This paper investigates whether the <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> gap, which has been proposed as a reference point for accumulating countercyclical capital buffers, is subject to similar problems. We find that ex post revisions to the U. S. <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> gap are sizable and {{as large as the}} gap itself, and that the main source of these revisions stems from the unreliability of end-of-sample estimates of the series ’ trend rather than from revised estimates of the underlying data. The paper considers the potential costs of gap mismeasurement. We find that the volume of lending that may incorrectly be curtailed is potentially large, although loan interest rates appear to increase only modestly...|$|E
40|$|This thesis proposes two {{top-down}} approch frameworks {{to assess}} the Basel III countercyclical capital buffer.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the Basel III capital regulation, macroprudential authorities may order the accumulation of countercyclical capital buffers in the period when systemic risks are building up. According to recommendations, it is worth setting the size of the capital buffer {{on the basis of the}} magnitude of the <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> gap. Therefore, the time series of Hungary's <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> is decomposed to trend and cyclical components (credit gap) using four trend filtering methods: univariate Hodrick-Prescott filter, univariate Christiano-Fitzgerald filter, univariate Beveridge-Nelson filter and multivariate Hodrick-Prescott filter. The decomposition was carried out separately for the household and corporate segments. Of the four methods, it is the results of the multivariate Hodrick-Prescott filter, which also uses the information content of other variables, that reflect experts' assessment relating to developments in lending in Hungary the most. In addition, endpoint uncertainty was also the smallest in this case, i. e. the receipt of new data caused the smallest changes in the values estimated for previous periods here...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of credit to the private sector in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Although the speed of credit growth in these countries has recently slowed down as the consequence of the global financial crisis, the overall increase in credit to the private sector over the past decades has been immense. As a result, the thesis examines whether this substantial increase in credit is linked to the convergence of the CEE countries towards the equilibrium or whether it represents an excessive credit growth that could threaten the macroeconomic and financial stability in these countries. We estimate the equilibrium credit levels for 11 transition countries by applying a dynamic panel data model. Since in-sample approach may bias the estimation results we perform the estimates out-of-sample using a panel of selected developed EU countries as a benchmark. The difference between the actual and estimated <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> serves as a measure of private credit excessiveness. The results indicate a slightly excessive or close to the equilibrium <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> in Bulgaria, Estonia, and Latvia prior to the financial crisis.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} a theoretical and cross-country empirical {{analysis of the}} determinants of financial deepening, and finds that higher <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> are associated with stronger creditor rights and lower inflation, and that the marginal effect of improvements in creditor rights protection is declining as {{the rate of inflation}} increases.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the equilibrium level of private credit to GDP in 11 Central and Eastern European {{countries on the}} basis of a number of dynamic panels containing quarterly data on Central and Eastern European economies, emerging markets and developed OECD countries. In doing so, we propose a unifying framework which includes factors driving both the demand for and the supply of private credit. We emphasize that relying on in-sample panel (i. e. including only transition countries) estimates for transition economies is problematic not only because of the upward bias of the estimated constant and slope coeffi cients due to the initial undershooting and the ensuing steady adjustment toward equilibrium, but also because of the instability of the equations estimated for transition economies. The use of out-of-sample (i. e. excluding transition economies) panels suggests that some of the transition economies might have already come close to equilibrium by 2004, whereas others have private <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> which are well below the level the fundamentals would justify. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of capital inflow surges {{on the evolution of}} domestic credit. Using a panel of developed and emerging economies from 1970 to 2007, it is shown that in the two years following the beginning of a capital inflow surge the <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> increases by about 2 percentage points. The effect is reversed in the medium-term with the <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> decreased by almost 4 percentage points seven years after the initial surge. The paper also finds that the effect is different {{depending on the type of}} flows characterising the episode (debt vs. portfolio equity vs. FDI), with large capital inflows that are debt-driven having the largest effect. The results of the paper also suggest that the short-term effect of capital inflow surges on domestic credit depends on countries’ macroeconomic policy stances. In particular, it is found that this effect is lower in countries with higher real exchange rate flexibility and fiscal policy counter-cyclicality...|$|E

40|$|Equilibrium {{credit is}} an {{important}} concept because it helps to identify excessive credit provision in an economy. This paper proposes a structural approach to determine equilibrium credit {{which is based on}} the long-run through-the-cycle transaction demand for credit. Using a panel data set consisting of 49 high and middle-income countries from 1980 to 2010, we show that there exists considerable variation in the cross-country estimates of the income and price elasticities of credit and that the unit elasticity restriction implicitly imposed by the <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> is strongly rejected by the data. This suggests that the <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> is not appropriate to measure equilibrium credit. We show further that the cross-sectional variation in the income and price elasticities of credit can be related to a set of relevant economic, financial and institutional development indicators of a country. The main determinants that explain the cross-sectional variation in the income and price elasticities are financial depth, access to financial services, use of capital markets, efficiency and funding of domestic banks, central bank independence, the degree of supervisory integration, and the experience of a financial crisis. As an empirical illustration, we compute equilibrium credit and credit gaps for eleven new EU member states using our structural framework and compare it to credit gaps based on the Basel III approach.

In this paper we introduce a continuous and forward-looking stability indicator for the banking system based on information on all financial institutions in Germany between 1995 and 2010. Explaining this measure by means of panel regression techniques, we identify significant macroprudential early warning indicators (such as asset price indicators, leading indicators for the business cycle and monetary indicators) and spillover effects.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to re-assess the bank credit {{development}} in 11 Central and Eastern European countries and to provide new estimates of the <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> equilibrium level.

After this period, while credit has continued to remain excessive in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, it has decelerated in the other countries. However, while the results suggest a possibility of “credit crunch” in the Baltic republics and, to a less extent, in Croatia, credit deceleration may lead to “soft landing” for the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovenia. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{critical}} {{assessment of the}} countercyclical capital buffer in the new regulatory framework known as Basel III, {{which is based on}} the deviation of the <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> with respect to its trend. We argue that a mechanical application of the buffer would tend to reduce capital requirements when GDP growth is high and increase them when GDP growth is low, so it may end up exacerbating the inherent pro-cyclicality of risk-sensitive bank capital regulation. We also note that Basel III does not address pro-cyclicality in any other way. We propose a fully rule-based smoothing of minimum capital requirements based on GDP growth.

40|$|This paper sheds {{some light}} on {{situations}} in which monetary and macroprudential policies may interact (and potentially get into conflict) and contributes to the discussion about the coordination of those policies. Using data for the Czech Republic and five euro area countries we show that monetary tightening has {{a negative impact on}} the <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> and the non-risk-weighted bank capital ratio (i. e. a positive impact on bank leverage), while these effects have strengthened considerably since mid- 2011. This supports the view that accommodative monetary policy contributes to a build-up of financial vulnerabilities, i. e. it boosts the credit cycle. On the other hand, the effect of the higher bank capital ratio is associated with some degree of uncertainty. For these and other reasons, coordination of the two policies is necessary to avoid an undesirable policy mix preventing effective achievement of the main objectives in the two policy areas...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of countercyclical capital buffer {{is to encourage}} banks to build up buffers in good times that can be drawn down in bad times. The aim of the report is to assess such decisions by banks derived from two approaches. The approaches are the aggregate <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> as well as credit growth. The approaches are implemented for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for the time period 2000 – 2012. The report compares two approaches and analyses their relevance to the Baltic states by testing the correlation between a growth in studied variables and a growth of corresponding gaps. Methods used in the empirical part of the report are econometric analysis {{as well as economic}} analysis, development indicators, relative and absolute indicators and other methods. The research outcome is a cross-Baltic comparison of two alternative approaches to establish or release a countercyclical capital buffer by banks and their implications for each Baltic country...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} some general lessons {{for the design}} of countercyclical capital buffers. Its main empirical contribution is to analyse conditioning variables which could guide the build-up and release of capital. A major distinction for countercyclical capital schemes is whether conditioning variables are bank-specific or system-wide. The evidence presented in the paper indicates that the idiosyncratic component can be sizeable when a bank-specific approach is used. This makes a system-wide approach preferable, for which the best variables as signal for the pace and size of the accumulation of the buffers are not necessarily the best for the timing and intensity of the release. The <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> seems best for the build-up phase. Some measure of aggregate losses, possibly combined with indicators of credit conditions, seem to perform well for signalling the beginning of the release phase. Nonetheless, the analysis indicates that designing a fully rule-based mechanism may not be possible at this stage as some degree of judgment seems inevitable. A parallel exercise indicates that reducing the sensitivity of the minimum capital requirement is an important element of a credible countercyclical buffer scheme. countercyclical capital buffers, financial stability, procyclicality...|$|E
40|$|The credit-to-GDP gap and countercyclical capital buffers: {{questions}} and answers 1 Basel III uses {{the gap between the}} <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> and its long-term trend as a guide for setting countercyclical capital buffers. Criticism of this choice centres on three areas: (i) the suitability of the guide given the objective of the buffer; (ii) the early warning indicator properties of the guide for banking crises (especially for emerging market economies); and (iii) practical measurement problems. While many criticisms have merit, some misinterpret the objective of the instrument {{and the role of the}} indicator. Historically, for a large cross section of countries and crisis episodes, the credit-to-GDP gap is a robust single indicator for the build-up of financial vulnerabilities. As such, its role is to inform, rather than dictate, supervisors’ judgmental decisions regarding the appropriate level of the countercyclical buffer. JEL classification: E 44, E 51, E 61, G 01, G 21.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{questions}} {{the role of}} cross-border lending {{in the definition of}} national macroprudential policies in the European Monetary Union. We build and estimate a two-country DSGE model with corporate and interbank cross-border loans, Core-Periphery diverging financial cycles and a national implementation of coordinated macroprudential measures based on Countercyclical Capital Buffers. We get three main results. First, targeting a national <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> should be favored to federal averages as this rule induces better stabilizing performances in front of important divergences in credit cycles between core and peripheral countries. Second, policies reacting to the evolution of national credit supply should be favored as the transmission channel of macroprudential policy directly impacts the marginal cost of loan production and, by so, financial intermediaries. Third, the interest of lifting up macroprudential policymaking to the supra-national level remains questionable for admissible value of international lending between Eurozone countries. Indeed, national capital buffers reacting to the union-wide loan-to-GDP ratio only lead to the same stabilization results than the one obtained under the national reaction if cross-border lending reaches 45 %. However, even if cross-border linkages are high enough to justify the implementation of a federal adjusted solution, the reaction to national lending conditions remains remarkably optimal...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} new {{regulatory}} proposals, primarily Basel III accords and analyzes {{its ability to}} create a buffer for recurrent credit bubbles. This paper follows a research made by Lis, Pagés and Saurina [2000]. Their paper has illustrated the cyclicality of loan growth and GDP growth for Spain. This cyclicality is supported by cyclical Basel II regulation. In this paper is examined the ability of new regulatory proposals such as Basel III, statistical provisions and change in the approach to the probability of default, to cope with recurrent credit bubbles. According to my critical assessment, Basel III {{may not be able}} to create sufficient capital buffer for exceptional credit bubbles such as the current one. This buffer suggested by Basel III has several drawbacks which may decrease its functionality. Statistical provision is not an appropriate measure either, because it could weaken the fair and true view of financial statements principle. Change in approach to probability of default seems to be rational and effective. The only issue may relate to its recovery mechanisms. It doesn't support economic growth in time of economic recession. The author's proposal of new countercyclical buffer, which would be based on <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> and GDP growth to loan growth gap is introduced at the end of this work. Although this measure may have negative impact on GDP growth, it may create an appropriate buffer to systematic credit risk...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} credit expansion in business cycles in two ways. First, it reviews literature to determine whether credit is {{found to have a}} role in economic fluctuations. Secondly, the study investigates empirically whether credit-based indicators could be used to predict upcoming economic downturns. The empirical study is based on the proposition presented by Borio (2006) that changes in the monetary and financial regimes over the last few decades have made economies more vulnerable to buildup of financial imbalances, which lead to financial and economic distress when unwound. For this purpose, the study constructs a signaling model in the spirit of Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) and Borio and Lowe (2002). DATA The data in the empirical section of the study consists of quarterly series covering 18 industrialized countries between Q 1 1970 and Q 4 2008. Four key components form the core of the indicators: they include a <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> that is based on the nominal private sector credit and GDP series from the IMF International Financial Statistics (IFS) database and OECD. Asset prices are gauged via MSCI equity price indices from Datastream and property price indices from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Additionally, real private sector fixed investment to GDP series is constructed for 15 of the 18 countries based on OECD data. RESULTS The mainstream academic literature has relatively little to offer in terms of explaining the causes of business cycles. Research of financial crises and asset price boom-bust dynamics provides one explanation. Rapid credit growth coexisting with asset price increases creates financial imbalances that lead to widespread economic distress when they unwind. An empirical examination via a signaling model verifies that credit-based indicators capturing the buildup of imbalances would often have provided advance warnings of costly downturns between 1980 and 2008...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Computer, Statistical and Mathematical Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. With the {{acceptance}} of the new Basel II banking regulation (implemented in South Africa in January 2008) the search for improved ways of modeling the most important banking activities has become very topical. Since the notion of Levy-process was introduced, it has emerged as an important tool for modeling economic variables in a Basel II framework. In this study, we investigate the stochastic dynamics of banking items that are driven by such processes. In particular, we discuss bank provisioning for loan losses and deposit withdrawals. The first type of provisioning is related to the earnings that the bank sets aside in order to cover loan defaults. In this case, we apply principles from robustness to a situation where the decision maker is a bank owner and the decision rule determines the optimal provisioning strategy for loan losses. In this regard, we formulate a dynamic banking loan loss model involving a provisioning portfolio consisting of provisions for expected losses and loan loss reserves for unexpected losses. Here, unexpected loan losses and provisioning for expected losses are modeled via a compound Poisson process and an exponential Levy process, respectively. We use historical evidence from OECD (Organization for Economic Corporation and Development) countries to support the fact that the provisions for loan losses-to-total assets ratio is negatively correlated with aggregate asset prices and the private <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio.</b> Secondly, we construct models for provisioning for deposit withdrawals. In particular, we build stochastic dynamic models which enable us to analyze the interplay between deposit withdrawals and the provisioning for these withdrawals via Treasuries and reserves. Further insight is gained by considering a numerical problem and a simulation of the trajectory of the stochastic dynamics of the sum of the Treasuries and reserves. Since managing the risk that depositors will exercise their withdrawal option is an important aspect of this thesis, we consider the idea of a hedging provisioning strategy for deposit withdrawals in an incomplete market setting. In this spirit, we discuss an optimal risk management problem for a commercial bank whose main activity is to obtain funds through deposits from the public and use the Treasuries and reserves to cater for the resulting withdrawals. Finally, we provide a brief analysis of some of the issues arising from the dynamic models of the banking items derived. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the medium term {{economic impact of the}} new capital regulatory standards (the Basel III reform) for Norway using a standard semi-structural dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with credit market imperfections. The following questions are answered: (i) what are the major expected effects of higher minimum capital requirement on the Norwegian banking sector and on medium-term economic performance? (ii) How is the inclusion of a proposed countercyclical capital buffer, when made dependent on either the credit-to-GDP or the real credit growth as common reference point, affecting the model economy and in particular GDP and credit growth? The main findings of this study are the following: (1) each percentage point increase in the capital adequacy ratio translates into a 0. 50 per cent loss in the level of steady state output. The long-run effect of a persistent shock to the capital adequacy ratio equation propagates through the banking sector block in the model to the real sector, affecting output by as much as - 0. 55 percentage points at its peak before shifting output to a new steady-state level between 0. 50 and 0. 55 percentage below its initial level. (2) The application of a countercyclical capital buffer based on a prudential rule that increases the capital requirement when the <b>credit-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> rises seems capable of moderating credit growth in the model, but it increases the output volatility. More up to date findings in the literature suggest that the use of credit-to-GDP gap as a common reference point could be flawed and at worst increase the inherent pro-cyclicality of bank capital regulation. Reproducing the same methods to investigate this issue for Norway seems to confirm this undesirable property. Findings from the estimated model suggest that the use of a buffer, with credit-to-GDP gap as a reference point alters the sign of the correlation between output growth and bank capital, producing a strong negative correlation of - 0. 61. In order to circumvent this issue, real credit growth is employed as an alternative indicator. The use of real credit growth, both as a leading indicator of systemic risk and as a common reference point, seems to moderate credit growth in a sizeable way and output growth to some extent. Finally, the model seems to generate a slightly higher correlation between output and bank capital, confirming that the use of real credit growth, next to having some desirable properties, also seems able to produce results in the model economy that are closely in line with the main objectives of Basel III and its mandate...|$|E
