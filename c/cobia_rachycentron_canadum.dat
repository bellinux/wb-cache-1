50|$|Like other {{stingray}}s, the Brazilian large-eyed stingray is aplacental viviparous. Females have {{a single}} functional uterus (on the left), and carry a single embryo at a time; the embryo is provisioned by yolk, and later histotroph ("uterine milk") secreted by the mother. The gestation period lasts 5 - 6 months, and females are able to bear two litters per year in June and in November-December. The young are birthed in coastal sandbanks 3 - 10 m deep, which serve as nursery areas. Newly born rays measure 13 - 14 cm across; females mature later and attain a larger ultimate size than males. The distinctive ventral blotches appear relatively suddenly as the ray ages; the paired blotches outside the gills develop first, followed by the blotches further back. A known predator of this species is the <b>cobia</b> (<b>Rachycentron</b> <b>canadum).</b>|$|E

50|$|The disc {{shape of}} the smalleye {{stingray}} suggests that it may swim in a fashion unlike other stingrays and more akin to other rays with very broad pectoral fin discs (such as butterfly or manta rays), i.e., flapping its pectoral fins up and down rather than undulating the pectoral fin margins; this species would thus represent a case of convergent evolution with those ray families. Off Tofo, most individuals are accompanied by multiple <b>cobia</b> (<b>Rachycentron</b> <b>canadum).</b> A known parasite of this species is the tapeworm Oncomegoides celatus, which infests the spiral valve intestine. As with other stingrays, the smalleye stingray is aplacental viviparous with the developing embryos being sustained by yolk and later histotroph ("uterine milk") secreted by the mother. There is a record of a female gestating a single late-term fetus, which exhibited the same spotted color pattern as the adult. Newborn rays likely measure 31 - 33 cm across.|$|E

5|$|The round ribbontail ray has nocturnal {{habits and}} rests {{motionless}} {{for much of}} the day, often near vertical structures, in caves, or under ledges. It may be solitary, or form small to large groups. This ray is frequently shadowed by one or more jacks or <b>cobia</b> (<b>Rachycentron</b> canadum); these smaller fishes may feed on food stirred up by the ray's activities, or use the ray's body as cover for approaching their own prey. The round ribbontail ray hunts for bivalves, crabs, shrimps, and small bony fishes on the bottom. When feeding, it adopts a characteristic posture in which it presses the margin of its disc against the bottom and takes in water through its spiracles, which it blows through its mouth to uncover prey buried in the sediment. This species may fall prey to larger fishes such as sharks, and marine mammals. When threatened, it raises its tail over its back so that the spine faces forward, and waves it back and forth. Known parasites of this species include the monogenean Dasybatotrema spinosum, Dendromonocotyle pipinna, Neoentobdella garneri and N. taiwanensis, and the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti.|$|R

We report an {{environmental}} monitoring study to assess the trace metals in fish species caught from Arabian Sea and commercially available in the coastal city Karachi, Pakistan. Heavy metals such as copper, iron, lead and cadmium were determined in the skin, fillet and heart of the fish species Pampus argenteus, Epinephelus chlorostigma, <b>Rachycentron</b> <b>canadum,</b> Scomberomorus commerson, Johnius belangerii, Labeo rohita, Lutjanus argentimaculatus, Trachinotus blochii, Pomadsys olivaceum and Acanthopagrus berda by the atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The concentration (mg kg− 1, dry weight) range was: Cd (0.00 – 0.041), Cu (0.006 – 0.189), Fe (0.413 – 4.952) and Pb (0.00 – 0.569). Cadmium, copper and iron levels were below the tolerable limits whereas concentration of lead in the skins of S. commerson, E. chlorostigma, J. belangerii, A. berda; L. argentimaculatus, fillets of J. belangerii, E. chlorostigma and {{in the heart of}} J. belangerii exceeded the recommended limits. Therefore fish skin should be discouraged as food for humans or animals. The results indicate that a number of fish species have higher concentration of heavy metals dangerous for human health. Since the fish P. olivaceum (Dhotar) has the lowest level of trace metals therefore we recommend it for breeding and human consumption.|$|R

40|$|Geographical {{distribution}} of nematoda larva was investigated {{for 4 years}} from 1967 to 1970 on 1825 marine fishes of 68 species caught in the sea around Nagasaki, in the East China Sea, and in the South China Sea. The last group was brought back on the Nagasaki-maru, a training ship owned by Nagasaki University School of Fishery, and all others were obtained at the Nagasaki Fish Market. Results {{of the study were}} as follows; 1. In regard to the distribution in sea areas, a far greater number and variety of nematoda larva were found in the East China Sea and the South China Sea as compared with the water around Nagasaki. There were found nematoda larvae in 38 fishes of 5 species among 393 of 20 species caught in the sea around Nagasaki, 1 to 10 larvae per fish, 19 of 20 species or 405 of 688 fishes, 1 to 137 larvae in the East China Sea, and 22 of 28 species or 449 of 744 fishes, 1 to 320 per fish in the South China Sea respectively. Parasitic rate was 100 per cent in the following species of fish; Saurida tumbil, Muraenesox cinereus, Argyrosomus argentatus, Decapterus maruadsi, Pseudosciaena crocea in the East China Sea, and Nemipterus virgatus, Lutjanus sebae, Saurida tumbil, <b>Rachycentron</b> <b>canadum</b> in the South China Sea. Amount of the larva per fish was extremely high in Saurida tumbil and Muraenesox cinereus, 85. 5 and 65. 9 larvae in the averege respectively. 2. The types of nematoda larva discovered were four genuses and 6 species in total; Anisakis sp. (Type I), Contracaecum sp. (Type A, Type B and Type F), Terranova sp. (Type B) and Raphidascaris sp. 3. Anisakis sp. (Type I) has the highest incidence in each sea area, and Contracaecum sp. (Type E) has the second highest incidence in the East china Sea and South China Sea. Although Contracaecum sp. (Type F) has never been described near the Japanese coast, it was found in the South China Sea. Relatively high incidence of Terranova sp. (Type B) was also found in the South China Sea. 4. Species of fish having significantly high incidence of Anisakis sp. (Type I) were; Muraenesox cinereus (100 per cent), Saurida tumbil (100 per cent), Argyrosomus argentatus (100 per cent), Pseudosciaena crocae (100 per cent), Decapterus maruadsi (100 per cent), Zeus japonicus (80. 0 pes cent) in the South China Sea, Saurida tumbil (100 per cent), <b>Rachycentron</b> <b>canadum</b> (100 per cent), Nemipterus virgatus (100 per cent), Priacanthus sp. (95. 0 per cent), Abalistes stellatus (88. 5 per cent), Lutjanus basmira (86. 7 per cent), Pristipomoides sieboldi (84. 0 per cent), Decapterus maruadsi (82. 0 per cent), Megalospis cordyla (80. 0 per cent), Epinephelus septemfasciatus (80. 0 per cent) caught in the South China Sea. High incidence of Contraceecum sp. (Type E) was found in Argyrosomus argentatus (100 per cent) of the East China Sea, and Nemipterus virgatus (100 per cent) and Priacanthus sp. (75. 0 per cent) of the South China Sea. Terranova sp. (Type B) is common in Lutjanus sebae (100 per cent) and Carcarrhinus menisorrah (90. 0 per cent). Contracaecum sp. (Type F) was discovered in Saurida tumbil, Pseudorhombus dupliciocellatus and Abalistes stellatus in the South China Sea. 5. There seem to be two courses of migration of the nematoda-susceptible fishes, such as Muraenosox cinereus, Argyrosomus argentatus, Saurida tumbil, Pseudosciaena crocea, Nemipterus virgatus and Lutjanus sebae in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. One runs toward North and South along the coast of China, and the other from shallow sea to deeper sea or toward East. They move, however, within the East China Sea and the South China Sea, where is the main sea area having high incidence of anisakis worm. 1967 年から 1970 年までの 4 ケ年間に長崎に陸揚げされた長崎近海及び東支那海のものと長大水産学部長崎丸の遠洋航海実習で捕獲された南支那海の魚類,合計 68 種 1, 825 尾についてAnisakidae幼線虫の感染調査とその形態を観察し次のような成績を得た. 1) 幼線虫の寄生率は近海のものに比べて東支那海及び南支那海の所謂遠洋もので格段に高く,その寄生数及び種類も多い. 2) 幼線虫はAnisakis sp.

40|$|AbstractIn a joint {{research}} of the Korean Biodiversity Information Facility (KBIF), the study analyzed species composition and fluctuations in abundance of fishes caught by the set net fishery installed in the offing of Impo, Dolsando in Yeosu-si, Jeollanamdo in June and September 2008. During the study period, there were 11, 180 individuals of 54 species of 39 families in 8 orders {{that appeared in the}} set net fishery in the offing of the Dadohae Marine National Park. The numbers of individuals that appeared in June and September were shown in Table 2. Among the fishes caught, the Perciformes was the dominant species with 29 species of 22 families followed by the Tetraodontiformes with 6 species of 2 families and the Pleuronectiforme with 5 species of 4 families. There appeared 3 species of 3 families of the Anguilliformes and the Beloniformes, respectively. There were 4 species of 2 families of the Clupeiformes and 3 species of 2 families of the Scorpaeniformes. There was 1 species of 1 family of the Aulopiformes. During the study period, Scomber japonicus was the dominant species with 9005 individuals followed by Trichiurus lepturus with 1500 individuals and Panpus argenteus with 184 individuals. In June, Trichiurus lepturus was dominant with 1200 individuals followed by Panpus argenteus with 150 individuals and Scomberomorus koreanus with 58 individuals. In October, Scomber japonicus was the dominant species with 9000 individuals followed by Trichiurus lepturus with 300 individuals and Scomberomorus koreanus with 45 individuals. It indicates that the dominance of a species has close relationship with water temperature because fishes migrate to feed in this season. Given the frequency of appearance, Scomber japonicus and Trichiurus lepturus most frequently appeared because they {{were in the middle of}} growing into adult fishes while the frequent appearance of Scomberomorus koreanus and Panpus argenteus, which were major species of the fishing industry, contributed to the income of fishermen. There appeared rarely seen species in the offing of Yeosu like Pelamis platurus, <b>Rachycentron</b> <b>canadum</b> (Linnaeus), Lobotes surinamensis, Kyphosus vaigiensis, Abudefduf vaigiensis and Siganus fuscescens (Houttuyn). They are subtropical fishes and seem to move here due to the warmer water affected by the global warming. Additional studies on species composition and fluctuations in abundance of fishes that appear in the set net fishery in the Dadohae Marine National Park will be continuously conducted. So, they will contribute to the increase of fishermen's income by transferring the new fish species to fishermen when newly developed rare fish species are fostered in the lab and evaluated for adaptability and growth potential. The research result will be used as basic data to secure national biological resources, and create/manage biodiversity data by building a biodiversity database network...|$|R
40|$|The Collective Article “New Mediterranean Biodiversity Records” of the Mediterranean Marine Science journal {{offers the}} means to publish {{biodiversity}} records in the Mediterranean Sea. The current article has adopted a country-based classification and the countries are listed according to their geographic position, from west to east. New biodiversity data are reported for 7 different countries, although one species reported from Malta is new for the entire Mediterranean basin, and is presumably also present in Israel and Lebanon (see below, under Malta). Italy: the rare native fish Gobius kolombatovici is first reported from the Ionian Sea, whilst the alien jellyfish Rhopilema nomadica and the alien fish Oplegnathus fasciatus are first reported from the entire country. The presence of O. fasciatus from Trieste is concomitantly the first for the entire Adriatic Sea. Finally, the alien bivalve Arcuatula senhousia is reported {{for the first time}} from Campania (Tyrrhenian Sea). Tunisia: a bloom of the alien crab ortunus segnis is first reported from the Gulf of Gabes, where it was considered as casual. Malta: the alien flatworm Maritigrella fuscopunctata is recorded in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time, on the basis of 25 specimens. At the same time, web searches include possible unpublished records from Israel and Lebanon. The alien crab P. segnis, already mentioned above, is first formally reported from Malta based on specimens collected in 1972. Concomitantly, the presence of Callinectes sapidus in Maltese waters is excluded since based on misidentifications. Greece: the Atlantic northern brown shrimp Penaeus atzecus, previously known from the Ionian Sea from sporadic records only, is now well established in Greek and international Ionian waters. The alien sea urchin Diadema setosum is reported for the second time from Greece, and its first record from the country is backdated to 2010 in Rhodes Island. The alien lionfish Pterois miles is first reported from Greece and concomitantly from the entire Aegean Sea. Turkey: the alien rhodophyte Antithamnion hubbsii is first reported from Turkey and the entire eastern Mediterranean. New distribution data are also provided for the native fishes Alectis alexandrina and Heptranchias perlo. In particular, the former record consists of a juvenile measuring 21. 38 mm total length, whilst the latter by a mature male. Cyprus: the rare native cephalopod Macrotritopus defilippi, and the alien crab Atergatis roseus, sea slug Plocamopherus ocellatus and fish Cheilodipterus novemstriatus are first recorded from the entire country. Lebanon: the alien crabs Actaea savignii and Matuta victor, as well as the alien fish Synanceia verrucosa, are first recorded from the entire country. In addition, the first Mediterranean record of A. savignii is backdated to 2006, whilst the high number of M. victor specimens observed in Lebanon suggest its establishment in the Basin. The Atlantic fishes Paranthias furcifer and Seriola fasciata, and the circumtropical <b>Rachycentron</b> <b>canadum,</b> are also first reported from the country. The P. furcifer record backdates its presence in the Mediterranean to 2007, whilst S. fasciata records backdate its presence in the eastern Mediterranean to 2005. Finally, two of these latter species have been recently ascribed to alien species, but all three species may fit the cryptogenic category, if not a new one, better. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In Taiwan, {{the history}} of {{aquaculture}} spans over three hundred years and the breakthroughs in the artificial propagation of finfish and shrimp effectively reduced the industries' reliance on wild fry, thereby stabilizing commercial operations and overcoming the barriers for expansion. Taiwan is located very close to Japan, {{one of the biggest}} seafood importers in the world, which has also benefited the development of aquaculture. However, the growing problems of water pollution and the increasingly high environmental costs generated by aquaculture ventures have made Taiwan experience a declining trend in recent years. To overcome those constraints, three main areas are described, which then form the basis of this study. (1). Adjustment of existing production practices - Milkfish culture, one of the most vulnerable sectors suffering from price fluctuation is used as an example to understand both the production cost, market attributes {{and the ways in which}} impacts of variations between production and price can be reduced. (2). Improving existing systems - One of the methods to reduce the use of underground water is to use super intensive culture in which high densities are stable and water use minimised, and has been tried in Taiwan for eels. However, the cost and benefits must be evaluated and as most eel products are exported to the Japanese market, it is very important to examine the comparative advantages against other countries. (3). Develop new systems- One of the solutions to the constraints of land-based aquaculture in Taiwan is to develop seawater-based cage culture. This has been developed in a limited degree in Ping-Tong and Pen-Hu counties but the feasibility and profitability have not been investigated. Based on 274 milkfish farms, 63 traditional eel farms, 5 intensive eel farms, 22 cage culture farms and 133 consumers from different zones, constituted the primary data, which combined with other secondary data constructed this investigation. The milkfish sector was not economically sound. Farm size in the categories of 4 -< 5 ha could appear to be more profitable. Cold weather and unstable in price made this industry more risky. The price was very unstable and strongly correlated to seasonal variation of production. The various forms of average financial appraisal have shown that intensive eel culture has a slight advantage over traditional eel culture. However, traditional eel culture has a higher distribution and the financial advantage of intensive culture is primarily due to the cheaper eel seed. The mass production of eel from China has caused Taiwan to lose the comparative advantage in roasted eel for the Japanese market. Cage culture is a new aquaculture venture in Taiwan. The structure of cages, feed and other facilities still need to be improved. Although Dumerils's Amberjack (Seriola dumerili) and red porgy (Pagrus major) can make higher profits than other species, fish farmers still have great expectation for <b>cobia</b> (<b>Rachycentron</b> canadus). As Taiwan's market is not big enough, there is great hope that the Japanese market can be developed and cobia can become a candidate for sashimi (raw fish). For sustainable development, aquaculture must be economically viable, ecologically sound and socially acceptable. To attain these goals, production and marketing groups, and production area were suggested. Proper administration and management could help the industry to be sustainable...|$|R
40|$|On April 20 th, 2010, a fire {{broke out}} on the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) {{offshore}} oil drilling rig on the Macondo prospect located {{off the coast of}} the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). This fire and resulting explosions resulted in the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig and the largest marine oil spill in history. An estimated 4. 9 million (+/- 10 %) barrels were released into the Gulf of Mexico over the ensuing 87 days. Many economically important fish species spawn in northern Gulf of Mexico waters; the spawning seasons and pelagic larval phase of many of these species occur within the temporal extent of the DWH oil spill (April through July). Fish eggs and larvae in waters exposed to Macondo oil likely experienced lethal and sublethal physiological effects, leading to potential losses in year class strength depending on the proportion of a population’s larval production encountering oil. Differing spatial distributions of larvae due to different spawning locations and seasons could predict that some species were disproportionately affected by the DWH oil spill. This study aims at quantifying the impact of the spill across numerous taxa, by estimating the proportion of species-, genus-, or family-specific fish larval abundances located within the spatial/temporal domain of the DWH spill until the Macondo well was capped. Estimates and related uncertainties were based on empirical ichthyoplankton data collected over 27 years and on observed and modeled distribution of surface oil slicks and concentrations. In addition, two hypothetical oil spills were simulated on the Western Florida Slope and on the Western interior of the Gulf of Mexico {{to assess the impact of}} oil spills to the ichthyoplankton from different offshore locations that would have occurred during the DWH spill period. Ichthyoplankton data collected during annual plankton surveys (and other resource surveys) as part of the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program – Gulf of Mexico (SEAMAP) during years 1982 - 2009 were used to describe the composition and distribution of ichthyoplankton in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The SEAMAP larval fish data along with oil surface distributions (both actual and simulated) were used to estimate the proportions of larvae of 115 selected fish taxa that were potentially exposed to DWH oil. Bootstrapping methods were applied to the SEAMAP data to quantify the variability. Proportions of larval fish potentially exposed to oil were calculated for four oil spill scenarios: (1) the DWH spill, (2) an September-December oil spill with the same spatial footprint as the DWH spill but occurring later in the year, (3) a west Florida Slope spill occurring during the months of April-July and centered at 27 ˚N, 85 ˚W, and (4) a western GOM spill occurring during the spring and centered at 27 ˚N, 93. 5 ˚W. Spill scenarios (3) and (4) were modeled using the Connectivity Modeling System (CMS). The CMS is a Lagrangian model which predicts oil droplet distribution and degradation based on oil properties and ocean currents. Significant differences in the proportion of larvae potentially exposed were found in the DWH spill and the three simulations. The proportion of fish larvae exposed to the DWH spill varied between 0 % (many species) and 26. 8 % (Cynoscion nebulosus). The proportion of fish larvae exposed to simulated spills varied between 0 % and 78. 9 % (Bonapartia pedaliota in Western GOM spill). Both the west Florida Slope oil spill and the western GOM spills had a disproportionally greater impact on a larger number of taxa than the DWH spill, even after correcting for their larger spatial extent. For the DWH spill (Scenario 1), the potentially most impacted taxa were Cynoscion nebulosus, Engraulidae, <b>Rachycentron</b> <b>canadum,</b> and Etropus spp. If the DWH spill had occurred in the fall (Scenario 2), the most potentially impacted taxa would have been Leiostomus xanthurus, Elopidae, and Pomatomus saltatrix. For a west Florida slope exposure (Scenario 3), the potentially most impacted taxa would be Holocentridae, Acanthocybium solandri, Coryphaena spp., and Pomacanthidae. For a western GOM spill (Scenario 4), the most potentially impacted taxa would be Bonapartia pedaliota, Thunnus thynnus, Caranx spp., and Holocentridae [...] The historical SEAMAP data set combined with the CMS modeling tool provides a powerful planning tool to understand the potential impacts of oil spills in the northern GOM and the relative sensitivity of locations in the Northern GOM to oil spill effects...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the feeding and nutrition of tropical farmed fish and shrimp, targeting its applicability to aquaculture farming. The study of the actual panorama of aquafeed quality for tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei farmed in Brazil showed that the proximate compositions between the analyzed feeds were mostly consistent with the declared values from the manufacturers, however, the feed water stability showed the opposite; the in vitro pH-stat species-specific method to determine the protein degree of hydrolysis (DH) showed to be a useful tool to evaluate feed quality; and NIRS technique {{can be used in}} many applications throughout the aquafeed industry, being an efficient tool for rapidly assessing feed quality in terms of DH. A second study evaluated the acid-insoluble ash (AIA) and chromic oxide (Cr 2 O 3) as inert markers and feed processing method (industrial extruded vs. laboratory cold pelleted) to determine apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of dry matter and crude protein of juvenile L. vannamei. The AIA showed to be an effective natural endogenous marker for digestibility trials with L. vanammei, however, for commercial feeds attention should be paid to feed AIA level; the extruded feed showed better animal performance than the cold pelleted feed, however, ADC of both feeds were not significantly different from each other. Further, two feeding trials were conducted with juvenile <b>cobia</b> <b>Rachycentron</b> canadum: (1) feeding trial conducted within floating net cages to test the nutritional efficacy of different dietary feeding regimes ranging from the use of trashfish, in-house formulated feeds, to dry commercial extruded marine fish feed; and (2) feeding trial conducted within indoor water-recirculated tanks to test the nutritional efficiency of different potential dietary fishmeal replacers within dry in-house prepared diets. Generally, fish performance was superior in the net-cage feeding trial compared with the indoor water-recirculated tank trial; overall, the fish growth and performance of the experimental diets were very similar, showing that the alternative ingredients could be included and replace part (50 %) of the fishmeal component; the results from both trials concluded that the cobia requires practices diets with high levels of crude protein and lipid, and the inclusion of alternative plant-based and terrestrial animal protein sources was possible; the quantitative essential amino acid (EAA) requirement values estimated by the protein accretion method was highly correlated to the average of each of the EAA requirement for the species of carnivorous fish reported in the literature, and could be recommended for formulation of commercial feed for cobia R. canadum. Finally, a tentative to quantify the total sulfur amino acid requirement of juvenile Florida Pompano Trachinotus carolinus, was performed using combinations of various soybean protein products in order to develop cost-effective and environmentally-friendly diets. Although there was an apparent tendency in the results, the range of methionine levels employed in this study may not have been broad enough to accurately measure the dietary concentration necessary to estimate the total sulfur amino acid requirement; in addition, high variation results among the three replicates per diet did not provide sufficiency robustness for its estimation; this study within 45 days should not have been enough to show significant differences among the treatments. Long term feeding trials would be recommended from fingerling/juvenile to market size with full nutritional and economic evaluation of results. O objetivo dessa tese foi avaliar a alimentação e nutrição de peixes e camarões tropicais cultivados, visando a sua aplicação à aquicultura. O estudo do atual panorama da qualidade das rações para tilapia e camarão cultivados no Brasil mostrou que a maioria das composições proximais das rações analisadas foram consistentes com os valores declarados pelos fabricantes, porém, a estabilidade das na água mostrou-se o oposto; o método in vitro pH-stat com enzimas espécie-específica, para determinação do grau de hidrólise da proteína (DH), mostrou ser uma ferramenta útil para avaliar a qualidade das rações; a técnica da espectrofotometria do infravermelho próximo (NIRS) pode ser usada em várias aplicações na indústria de alimentos aquáticos, sendo uma ferramenta eficiente para avaliar rapidamente a qualidade dos alimentos em termos de DH. Um segundo estudo avaliou a cinza insolúvel em ácido (AIA) e óxido de cromo (Cr 2 O 3) como marcadores inertes, além de métodos de processamento de alimentos (extrusado industrial vs. peletizada a frio no laboratório) para determinar o coeficiente de digestibilidade aparente (ADC) da matéria seca e proteína bruta de juvenis de L. vannamei. O AIA mostrou ser um marcador endógeno natural eficaz para ensaios de digestibilidade com L. vanammei, no entanto, atenção especial deve ser dada aos níveis de AIA nas rações comerciais; a ração extrusada teve a melhor performance dos animais, porém, os valores de ADC entre as rações não foram diferentes significantemente. Além disso, dois experimentos de alimentação foram conduzidos com juvenis de beijupirá Rachycentron canadum: (1) experimento realizado em tanques-rede flutuantes para testar a eficácia nutricional de diferentes regimes alimentares, variando entre rejeito de pesca, rações preparadas em laboratório, e ração comercial extrusada; e (2) um experimento realizados em tanques com recirculação de água para testar a eficiência nutricional de diferentes potenciais substitutos de farinha de peixe, com dietas completadas preparadas em laboratório. Em geral, o desempenho dos peixes foi superior no experimento nos tanques-rede, comparado com o experimento nos tanques de recirculação de água; no geral o crescimento e performance dos peixes das dietas experimentais foram bem similares, concluindo que ingredientes alternativos podem ser incluídos e substituírem parte (50 %) da farinha de peixe das rações; os resultados de ambos os estudos concluíram que o beijupirá requer dietas práticas com alto teores de proteína bruta e lipídeos, e a inclusão de fontes proteicas de origem vegetal e animal foi possível. Os valores quantitativos das exigências de amino acido essenciais (EAA) estimados pelo método de acreção de proteína na carcaça foram altamente correlacionados com as médias de exigência de cada EAA das as espécies de peixes carnívoros encontrados na literatura, e pode ser recomendado para a formulação de ração comercial para beijupirá R. canadum. Por ultimo, uma tentativa de quantificar as exigências de amino ácidos sulforosos totais para Florida Pompano Trachinotus carolinus, foi realizada utilizando combinações de vários ingredientes proteicos a base de soja, a fim de desenvolver dietas de baixo custo e ecologicamente sustentáveis. Embora houve uma tendência clara nos resultados, os intervalos dos níveis de metionina utilizados nesse estudo podem não ter sido amplos o suficiente para medir com precisão a concentração alimentar necessária para estimar a exigência dos de amino ácidos sulforosos totais; além disso, a alta variação entre as replicas não forneceu uma estimativa robusta; este estudo de 45 dias não deve ter sido suficiente para mostrar diferenças significativas entre os tratamentos...|$|R
