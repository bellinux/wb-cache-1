If one <b>chooses</b> <b>to</b> wait and the other <b>chooses</b> <b>to</b> walk, {{then there is a}} {{theoretical}} certainty that they will meet eventually; in practice, though, it may take too long for it to be guaranteed. The question posed, then, is: what strategies should they <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> maximize their probability of meeting? ...|$|R
50|$|Concerning {{third-party}} prisoner's dilemma (TP-PD), {{the game}} was modified so {{that in addition to}} two players who would <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> either cooperate or defect, a third party observer could <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> punish the players. The payoffs of the game were such that the players would be best off if they defected; however, if both players <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> defect, their payoff would be less than if they had cooperated. The observer could then <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> spend from his endowment to punish the defectors who <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> put self-interest ahead of cooperation. From previous theories, it can be concluded that subjects are willing to cooperate if the probability that others will also do so is sufficiently large. Once again, if self-interest was the decision maker for these players, neither would <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> cooperate, and the observer would also <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> keep his full endowment and not issue any punishments. However, about 45.8% of observers <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> punish the defector when he is paired with a cooperator, and 20.8% <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> punish both players if they had both defected. It's {{important to note that the}} magnitude of punishment was much larger when one defected.|$|R

5|$|The 1961–62 season {{proved to}} be highly disappointing, as Leicester {{finished}} 14th {{in the league and}} exited the FA Cup at the hands of Stoke City. The only highlight was the club's participation in the European Cup Winners' Cup, which actually put Banks in the difficult position of <b>choosing</b> <b>to</b> play for his club against Spanish club Atlético Madrid or <b>choosing</b> <b>to</b> attend the England versus Portugal match as a non-playing squad member. He elected to attend both games, leaving London at full-time to reach Leicester 30 minutes before the kick-off against Madrid. A last-minute goal earned the Spaniards a 1–1 draw at Filbert Street. In the return leg, Banks saved an Enrique Collar penalty, but Atlético were awarded a second penalty which Collar converted, and Leicester lost the game 2–0 (losing the tie 3–1 on aggregate).|$|E
