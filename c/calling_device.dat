50|$|The first {{commercial}} {{installation of a}} telephone dial accompanied the {{first commercial}} installation of a 99-line automatic telephone exchange in La Porte, Indiana, in 1892, {{which was based on}} the 1891 Strowger designs. The original dials required complex operational sequences. A workable, albeit error-prone, system was invented by the Automatic Electric Company using three push-buttons on the telephone. These buttons represented the hundreds, tens, and single units of a telephone number. When calling the subscriber number 163, for example, the user had to push the hundreds button once, followed by six presses of the tens button, and three presses of the units button. In 1896, this system was supplanted by an automatic contact-making machine, or <b>calling</b> <b>device.</b> Further development continued during the 1890s and the early 1900s in conjunction with improvements in switching technology.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Selcal (selective calling) controller, as {{intermediate}} equipment between selcal and radio station, {{is designed to}} achieve the software automation and remote control in aviation. The whole system adopts msp- 430 microcontroller as hardware core and C language as the method of software realization. This paper focuses on hardware connection and design to introduce the electrical design and software flow of selcal controller.. OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE Selcal, also know as ground-air selective <b>calling</b> <b>device,</b> {{has been used by}} land station for selective calling of aircraft. Each aircraft has a unique selective calling code, when the selective <b>calling</b> <b>device</b> calls an aircraft, the selective call code, which consists of two connected audio pulse, shall be entered firstly. Two single tones that transmitted simultaneously are contained in each pulse. Selcal code will be transmitted by the shortwave radio station when the CALL push-button is pressed. When this code is received by the appropriate aircraft, the communication between radio station and aircraft is established. Therefore voice transmission connection between the ground and the aircraft can be achieved by using a handle. Fig. 1 Conventional model of selective calling syste...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the mobile device {{has become a}} {{ubiquitous}} tool within everyday life. Unfortunately, whilst the popularity of mobile devices has increased, a corresponding increase can also be identified in the threats being targeted towards these devices. Security countermeasures such as AV and firewalls are being deployed, however, the increasing sophistication of the attacks requires additional measures to be taken. This paper proposes a novel behaviour-based profiling technique that is able to build upon the weaknesses of current systems by developing a comprehensive multilevel approach to profiling.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{describes}} an Electric Power Monitoring Device for low voltage (127 / 220 Volts) distribution network. A small sensor box makes an automatic phone call when an outage {{occurs at the}} costumer residence. An automated Call Center identifies the device and generates an acknowledge signal to the <b>calling</b> <b>device.</b> Many Power Utillities uses the Call Centers not only for customers complains [1] {{but also as a}} way to register outages [2][3]. Currently most of the outages in feeders or branches of electric power distribution in Brazil is detected and registered from costumers ’ phone calls to the Utility Call Centers (generally a reserved phone number 196 for this function) [3]. When a feeder outage happens (that causes generalized outage), thousands of phone calls are originated causing a bottleneck at the Call Center. Usually most of those calls are not completed. Increasing the number of attendants to handle 100 % of the claims is economically impracticable. On the other hand only through the phone call the Power Utility can receive the information about outages in feeder branches, after a key fuse for example. Using the device presented here, the Power Utility can receive a higher number of pone calls and have more information about outages in a shorter time and with better accuracy. Key words:- power quality, Call Center, distribution operatio...|$|E

Lighted at initial luminance intensity 1135 cd/m(2), Devices SSA decayed to its half luminance after 18 hours (hrs) in the vacuum which has pressure of 5 X 10 (- 3) Pa.
