5000|$|The Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), {{native to}} the Pacific Northwest of North America, and the Canada yew (Taxus canadensis) were the initial sources of {{paclitaxel}} or Taxol, a chemotherapeutic drug used in breast and lung cancer treatment and, more recently, {{in the production of}} the Taxus drug eluting stent by Boston Scientific. Over-harvesting of the Pacific yew for paclitaxel led to fears that it would become an endangered species, since the drug was extracted from the bark of the yew, the harvesting of which kills the tree in the process.. However, methods were developed to produce the drug semi-synthetically from cultivated yews, without the need to further endanger the wild populations, and the Pacific yew is no longer at risk. [...] The more <b>common</b> Canada <b>yew</b> is also being successfully harvested in northern Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, and has become another major source of paclitaxel.

Conclusion. In this particular case, the cardiac electrical instability was definitely maintained by several causes, including severe hypokalemia, which has not been previously reported as related to Taxus poisoning. The metabolic acidosis associated with severe hypokalemia definitely contributed to the complex arrhythmias. The occurrence of severe hypokalemia needs further attention in cases with Taxus poisoning as its immediate treatment might increase survival chances...|$|R

The number of additional species of plants found here was great, and all betokened a rapid approach to the alpine region of the Himalaya. In order of prevalence the trees were,--the scarlet Rhododendron arboreum and barbatum, as large bushy trees, both loaded with beautiful flowers and luxuriant foliage; R. Falconeri, in point of foliage the most superb of all the Himalayan species, with trunks thirty feet high, and branches bearing at their ends only leaves eighteen inches long: these are deep green above, and covered beneath with a rich brown down. Next in abundance to these were shrubs of Skimmia Laureola,* [This plant has been lately introduced into English gardens, from the north-west Himalaya, and is greatly admired for its aromatic, evergreen foliage, and clusters of scarlet berries. It is a curious fact, that this plant never bears scarlet berries in Sikkim, apparently owing to the want of sun; the fruit ripens, but is of a greenish-red or purplish colour.] Symplocos, and Hydrangea; and there were still a few purple magnolias, very large Pyri, like mountain ash, and the <b>common</b> English <b>yew,</b> eighteen feet in circumference, the red bark of which is used as a dye, and for staining the foreheads of Brahmins in Nepal.

2500|$|Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta. Although T. brevifolia is {{typically}} a tree as described above, T. brevifolia var. reptaneta is a shrub variety that generally {{occurs in the}} mid to upper elevation range of the typical variety, 3,500 to 4,000ft (1000–1219 m) at its southernmost occurrence in the Klamath Mountains region, and at lower elevations further north. [...] It is distinguished from young trees of the typical variety (var. brevifolia) by its stems initially creeping along the ground for a short distance before ascending (curving) upwards and by the branches growing off {{to one side of the}} stem, usually the upper side. The epithet reptaneta is from the Latin reptans which means “creeping, prostrate, and rooting,” which is exactly what this variety does; in rooting it forms yew thickets; hence, the epithet reptaneta (etum means collective place of growth) and hence the <b>common</b> name, thicket <b>yew.</b> Unlike the typical variety, thicket yew grows in abundance on open sunny avalanche shoots or ravines as well as in the forest understory. [...] It also occurs along forest margins. In northwestern Montana, a variant of the thicket yew does not ascend upwards; rather, it remains along the ground. [...] This is probably the ancestral form; the upright form with branches along the upper side would be the expected growth pattern that might evolve from one with stems that strictly creep along the ground since branches can only arise from the upper surface.|$|R
