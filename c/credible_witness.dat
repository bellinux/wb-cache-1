500|$|The 17th-century genealogical {{compilation}} {{known as}} Ane Accompt of the Genealogie of the Campbells by Robert Duncanson, minister of Campbeltown, claimed that [...] "Efferic" [...] (i.e. Affraic or Afraig), wife of Gilleasbaig of Menstrie (fl. 1263–6) {{and mother of}} Campbell progenitor Cailean Mór, {{was the daughter of}} one Cailean (anglicised Colin), [...] "Lord of Carrick". Partly because Ane Accompt is a <b>credible</b> <b>witness</b> to much earlier material, the claim is thought probable. Thus Donnchadh was likely the great-grandfather of Cailean Mór, a lineage that explains the popularity of the names Donnchadh (Duncan) and Cailean (Colin) among later Campbells, as well as their close alliance to King Robert I during the Scottish Wars of Independence.|$|E
500|$|Eid {{said the}} Blanchard and Geisel {{situations}} {{were different from}} those of Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson because credible witnesses heard specific threats being made in both cases. Eid said Gartrell never made any threatening statements about killing Obama, and Johnson could not be considered a <b>credible</b> <b>witness</b> because he was under the influence of drugs when he made accusations against Gartrell and Adolf. Blanchard's attorney, Lawrence Hewitt, said he planned to research the Colorado cases to see whether it would have any bearing on his client's case. In a letter responding to criticism about not pursuing federal charges against Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson, Eid wrote, “It would have been disgraceful for me or any other prosecutor to charge someone for a crime he didn’t commit. ... There was no probable cause to support such a charge. To the extent you challenge my motives or those of the many investigating agents and career prosecutors who all reached this conclusion in this matter, you’re mistaken.” ...|$|E

[...] Tom Cox in The Daily Telegraph disagreed: he praised the characterisation, calling Mountstuart [...] "a man whose fragile egotism and loose-fitting story has you frequently forgetting you're reading fiction, and even more frequently forgetting you're reading at all." [...] Giles Foden, in The Guardian, found the New York art-scene sections weakest, saying they [...] "puncture the realism Boyd has so carefully built up {{in the rest of}} the novel." [...] Michiko Kakutani agreed that Mountstuart's youth was well evoked, but that the description of his retirement and poverty was [...] "as carefully observed and emotionally resonant". While in the early part of the book [...] "the characters' marionette strings [...] carefully hidden", later Boyd tried to play God, resulting in [...] "an increasingly contrived narrative that begins to strain our credulity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sadoveanu {{began his}} career as a novelist with more {{in-depth}} explorations into subjects present in his stories and novellas. At the time, Crohmălniceanu stresses, he was being influenced by the naturalism of Caragiale (minus the comedic effect), and by his own experience growing up in characteristically underdeveloped Moldavian cities and târguri (somewhat similar to the aesthetic of boredom, adopted in poetry by George Bacovia, Demostene Botez or Benjamin Fondane). Among his first works of the kind is Floare ofilită ("Wizened Flower"), where a simple girl, Tincuța, marries a provincial civil servant, and finds herself deeply unhappy and unable to enrich her life on any level. Tincuța, seen by Călinescu as one of Sadoveanu's [...] "savage" [...] characters, only maintains urban refinement when persuading her husband to return for supper, but, according to Crohmălniceanu, is also a <b>credible</b> <b>witness</b> to the [...] "small-mindedness" [...] of [...] "bourgeois" [...] environments. A rather similar plot is built for Însemnările lui Neculai Manea ("The Recordings of Neculai Manea"), where the eponymous character, an educated peasant, experiences two unhappy romantic affairs before successfully courting a married woman who, although grossly uncultured, makes him happy. Apa morților ("The Dead Men's Water") is about a Bovaryist woman who discards lovers over imprecise feelings of dissatisfaction, finding refuge in the monotonous countryside. Călinescu noted that such novels were [...] "usually less valuable than direct accounts", and deemed Însemnările lui Neculai Manea [...] "without literary interest"; in Ovid Crohmălniceanu's view, the same story presents relevant detail on professional and intellectual failure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fighting}} {{between the military}} and the Tamil Tigers continued, causing the civilians to flee from the Safe Zone to a narrow strip of land between Nanthi Kadal lagoon and the Indian Ocean. On 12 February 2009 the military declared a new [...] Safe Zone in this area, north-west of Mullaitivu town. Over the next three months a brutal siege of the Safe Zone occurred as the military allegedly blitzed by land and air the last remnants of Tamil Tigers trapped in the Safe Zone. Satellite images of the Safe Zone publishes by the UN, foreign governments and scientific organisations showed heavy damage that could have only been caused by bombardment. Inevitably many thousands of civilians were killed or injured. The UN, based on <b>credible</b> <b>witness</b> evidence from aid agencies as well civilians evacuated from the Safe Zone by sea, estimated that 6,500 civilians were killed and another 14,000 injured between mid-January, when the Safe Zone was first declared, and mid-April. [...] There are no official casualty figures after this period but a report in The Times claims that civilian deaths increased to an average of 1,000 per day after mid-April 2009. The UN has refused to confirm the Times' allegations. Estimates of the death toll for the final four months of the civil war (mid-January to mid-May) range from 15,000 to 20,000. A US State Department report has suggested that the actual casualty figures were probably much higher than the UN's estimates and that significant numbers of casualties were not recorded. As the civil war edged towards a bitter end in late April/early May the number of civilians leaving the Safe Zone turned from a trickle to a torrent. On 19 May the Sri Lankan government declared victory.|$|E

2500|$|On 31 December 2011, the FA {{released}} {{the contents of}} their findings. In the 115-page report, the FA said that Suárez [...] "damaged the image of English football around the world". The FA, while finding Evra to be a <b>credible</b> <b>witness,</b> declared that Suárez's evidence was unreliable and inconsistent with the video footage. According to Evra's testimony, Suárez said in Spanish that he had earlier kicked Evra [...] "because you are black", said [...] "I don't speak to blacks" [...] and used the word [...] "negro" [...] five times in total as they argued. Suárez had claimed that {{he used the word}} 'negro' only once to address Evra and this was intended to be conciliatory and friendly, but the FA rejected this claim as being [...] "unsustainable and simply incredible given that the players were engaged in an acrimonious argument". As the conversation between Suárez and Evra took place in Spanish, linguistic experts were called in to help the panel with the meaning of the phrases. The panel concluded that [...] "Suárez's use of the term [...] was not intended as an attempt at conciliation or to establish rapport; neither was it meant in a conciliatory and friendly way". Suárez was also warned that two similar offences in the future could lead to [...] "a permanent suspension". In January 2012, Liverpool announced that they would not appeal the punishment handed to Suárez, releasing a statement voicing their support [...] "to stamp out racism in every form, inside and outside the sport", adding that it was [...] "for this reason that Liverpool will not appeal the eight-game suspension of Luis Suárez". However, Liverpool continued to maintain their belief in both Suárez's innocence and a [...] "strongly held conviction" [...] that the Football Association and the panel it selected [...] "constructed a highly subjective case...based on an accusation that was ultimately unsubstantiated". Suárez subsequently made an official statement in which he thanked everybody who had shown support for him, and declared that he was [...] "upset" [...] at the decision to ban him, and that he would [...] "carry out the suspension with the resignation of someone who hasn't done anything wrong and who feels extremely upset by the events", but refused to offer a direct apology to Evra.|$|E

6000|$|... § 7. If, in {{the second}} place, the property, in the {{instances}} {{in which it has}} been observed, is not an effect of causation, it is a property of Kind; and in that case the generalization can only be set aside by the discovery of a new Kind of crow. That, however, a peculiar Kind not hitherto discovered should exist in nature, is a supposition so often realized {{that it can not be}} considered at all improbable. We have nothing to authorize us in attempting to limit the Kinds of things which exist in nature. The only unlikelihood would be that a new Kind should be discovered in localities which there was previously reason to believe had been thoroughly explored; and even this improbability depends on the degree of conspicuousness of the difference between the newly-discovered Kind and all others, since new kinds of minerals, plants, and even animals, previously overlooked or confounded with known species, are still continually detected in the most frequented situations. On this second ground, therefore, as well as on the first, the observed uniformity of co-existence can only hold good as an empirical law, within the limits not only of actual observation, but of an observation as accurate as the nature of the case required. And hence it is that (as remarked in an early chapter of the present book) we so often give up generalizations of this class at the first summons. If any <b>credible</b> <b>witness</b> stated that he had seen a white crow, under circumstances which made it not incredible that it should have escaped notice previously, we should give full credence to the statement.|$|E
60|$|As he {{returned}} to Cambridge Caldigate was not altogether contented with himself. He tried to persuade himself, {{in reference to the}} money which he had refunded, that in what he had done he had not at all been actuated by the charge made against him. Had there been no such accusation he would have felt himself bound to share the loss with these people as soon as he had learned the real circumstances. The money had been a burden to him. For the satisfaction of his own honour, of his own feelings, it had become necessary that the money should be refunded. And the need of doing so was not lessened by the fact that a base conspiracy had been made by a gang of villains who had thought that the money might thus be most readily extracted from him. That was his argument with himself, and his defence for what he had done. But nevertheless he was aware that he had been driven to do it now,--to pay the money at this special moment,--by an undercurrent of hope that these enemies would think it best for themselves to go as soon as they had his money in their hands. He wished to be honest, he wished to be honourable, he wished that all that he did could be what the world calls 'above board'; but still it was so essential for him and for his wife that they should go! He had been very steady in assuring these wretched ones that they might go or stay, as they pleased. He had been careful {{that there should be a}} <b>credible</b> <b>witness</b> of his assurance.

60|$|Many {{events are}} {{altogether}} improbable to us, {{before they have}} happened, or before we are informed of their happening, which {{are not in the}} least incredible when we are informed of them, because not contrary to any, even approximate, induction. In the cast of a perfectly fair die, the chances are five to one against throwing ace, that is, ace will be thrown on an average only once in six throws. But this is no reason against believing that ace was thrown on a given occasion, if any <b>credible</b> <b>witness</b> asserts it; since though ace is only thrown once in six times, some number which is only thrown once in six times must have been thrown if the die was thrown at all. The improbability, then, or, in other words, the unusualness, of any fact, is no reason for disbelieving it, if the nature of the case renders it certain that either that or something equally improbable, that is, equally unusual, did happen. Nor is this all; for even if the other five sides of the die were all twos, or all threes, yet as ace would still, on the average, come up once in every six throws, its coming up in a given throw would be not in any way contradictory to experience. If we disbelieved all facts which had the chances against them beforehand, we should believe hardly any thing. We are told that A. B. died yesterday; the moment before we were so told, the chances against his having died on that day may have been ten thousand to one; but since he was certain to die at some time or other, and when he died must necessarily die on some particular day, while the preponderance of chances is very great against every day in particular, experience affords no ground for discrediting any testimony which may be produced to the event’s having taken place on a given day.|$|E
