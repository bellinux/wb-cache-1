40|$|Low quality <b>charge</b> {{controllers}} and <b>lamps</b> {{are common}} sources of failure in solar home systems in developing countries. It is often assumed that components manufactured {{at a small}} scale in developing countries are of lower quality than imported ones. On the other hand, a number of authors have suggested that small-scale, local manufacture {{has the potential to}} improve the installation, maintenance and use of PV technology. This paper aims to identify {{the extent to which these}} different claims are warranted by documented experiences and to provide a summary of barriers to and advantages of small scale manufacture of balance of system (BOS) electronics for small PV systems in developing countries. The PV literature has been reviewed for any accounts of small-scale manufacture of PV system components in developing countries. The review was further informed by case studies, site inspections and personal communications undertaken by the author, as described in (Bruce 2007). The implications of local manufacture for the successful commercialisation of the technology, and the implications of both project-based and cash-based implementation models for the success of local manufacture have been examined. The results of the literature review are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} the propagation of the first anode directed ionization wave that occurs in a straight discharge tube during breakdown are studied {{by means of a}} fluid model. The discharge tube contains argon at a pressure of a few Torr and is operated at a dc voltage with the cathode heated to thermal electron emission temperatures. The two-dimensional model incorporates continuity and momentum equations for the electrons, for several effective excited states and for the ions, a balance equation for the electron energy and the Poisson equation. The model is capable of describing the first ionization front {{in a way that is}} qualitatively consistent with observations made in experiments. The mechanisms behind the breakdown evolution are investigated by considering the temporal and spatial evolution of the quantities described by the model. Previously, researchers have described this breakdown evolution in terms of an RC-line circuit. The validity of this picture is surveyed by considering the distribution of <b>charges</b> within the <b>lamp.</b> The effect of control parameters on the breakdown process and the assumptions that affect the validity of the model for later stages in breakdown are considere...|$|R
40|$|Solar home systems (SHS) {{are seen}} as an {{attractive}} option for off-grid electrification in rural areas in developing countries. The combined effect of declining photovoltaic module costs and success in micro-finance has resulted in increased SHS installations in emerging economies in Asia such as Bangladesh. Majority of the SHS components are now manufactured locally {{with the exception of}} PV cells. Considering the role of component quality in SHS performance, technical quality of four key SHS components: solar panel, battery, <b>charge</b> controller and <b>lamp</b> circuit (inverter) from market-leading manufacturers were evaluated in this study in laboratory settings, against national and international standards. All of the tested components met some evaluation criteria in their respective categories but none met all. Key performance failures were found to be related to inverter efficiency, reverse polarity protection in charge controllers and battery capacity, which are critical for optimum performance of the system. Findings in this study point towards an ineffective regulatory mechanism for quality assurance and the protection of consumer rights, which needs to be rectified for maintaining public confidence and sustaining the growth of SHS based off-grid electrification...|$|R
60|$|The {{town has}} lately yawned a weary laugh over {{an enemy of}} yours, who has {{produced}} two heavy volumes, styled by him 'The Real Shelley.' The real Shelley, it appears, was Shelley as conceived of by a worthy gentleman so prejudiced and so skilled in taking up things by the wrong handle that I wonder he has not made a name in the exact science of Comparative Mythology. He criticises you {{in the spirit of}} that Christian Apologist, the Englishman who called you 'a damned Atheist' in the post-office at Pisa. He finds that you had 'a little turned-up nose,' a feature no less important in his system than was the nose of Cleopatra (according to Pascal) {{in the history of the}} world. To be in harmony with your nose, you were a 'phenomenal' liar, an ill-bred, ill-born, profligate, partly insane, an evil-tempered monster, a self-righteous person, full of self-approbation--in fact you were the Beast of this pious Apocalypse. Your friend Dr. Lind was an embittered and scurrilous apothecary, 'a bad old man.' But enough of this inopportune brawler. For Humanity, of which you hoped such great things, Science predicts extinction in a night of Frost. The sun will grow cold, slowly--as slowly as doom came on Jupiter in your 'Prometheus,' but as surely. If this nightmare be fulfilled, perhaps the Last Man, in some fetid hut on the ice-bound Equator, will read. by a fading <b>lamp</b> <b>charged</b> with the dregs of the oil in his cruse, the poetry of Shelley. So reading, he, the latest of his race, will not wholly be deprived of those sights which alone (says the nameless Greek) make life worth enduring. In your verse he will have sight of sky, and sea, and cloud, the gold of dawn and the gloom of earthquake and eclipse, he will be face to face, in fancy, with the great powers that are dead, sun, and ocean, and the illimitable azure of the heavens. In Shelley's poetry, while Man endures, all those will survive; for your 'voice is as the voice of winds and tides,' and perhaps more deathless than all of these, and only perishable with the perishing of the human spirit.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{ignition}} {{phase is}} a critical stage {{in the operation of}} gas discharge lamps where the neutral gas enclosed between the electrodes undergoes a transformation from the dielectric state to a conducting phase, eventually enabling the production of light. The phenomena occurring during this phase transition are not fully understood and the related experimental studies are often limited to local optical measurements in environments prone to influencing these transient phenomena. In this work unipolar ignition phenomena at sub-kilovolt levels are investigated in a 3 Torr argon discharge tube. The lamp is placed in a highly controlled environment so as to prevent any bias on the measurements. A fast intensified CCD camera and a specially-designed novel electrostatic probe are used simultaneously so as to provide with a broad array of measured and computed parameters which are displayed in space-time diagrams for cross comparisons. Experiments show that three distinct phases exist during successful ignitions: Upon the application of voltage a first ionization wave starts from the active electrode and propagates in the neutral gas toward the opposite electrode. A local front of high axial E field strength is associated with this process and causes a local ionisation to occur, leading to the electrostatic <b>charging</b> of the <b>lamp.</b> Next, a second wave propagates from the ground electrode back toward the active electrode with a higher velocity, and in this process leads to a partial discharging of the lamp. This return stroke draws a homogeneous plasma column which eventually bridges both electrodes {{at the end of the}} wave propagation. At this point both electrode sheaths are formed and the common features of a glow discharge are observed. The third phase is an increase of the light intensity of the plasma column until the lamp reaches a steady state operation. Failed ignitions present only the first phase where the first wave starts its propagation but extinguishes in the lamp, leading to a charge memory effect. It is found that the full propagation of this first wave is a requirement for a successful lamp ignition. Differences in the properties of the waves were observed depending on the voltage polarity, and it was estimated that a photoelectric effect at the wall is the most likely source of electron for the ionisation wave of positive polarity. Finally a simple model of the first ionization wave is developed and used to analyse the fundamental differences between processes occurring at negative and at positive polarity. From this study three conditions are developed for the successful unipolar ignition of lamps and the relations between them are derived. ...|$|R
