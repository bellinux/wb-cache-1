5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' <b>crops</b> <b>and</b> killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' <b>crops</b> <b>and</b> houses.|$|E
5|$|Bruchus rufimanus, {{commonly}} known as the broad bean weevil, broad bean beetle, or broad bean seed beetle is a weevil which inhabits <b>crops</b> <b>and</b> fields, as well as some homes.

The parasitoids and predators were collected using yellow pan traps and sweep nets. The {{variations in the}} diversity, species richness, and evenness between two cropping systems are discussed in this paper. Diversity indices were worked out. Predators belonging to the families viz., Coccinellidae, Carabidae, Chrysopidae, Syrphidae, and Pentatomidae were recorded. The adult parasitoids belonging to the families Trichogrammatidae, Braconidae, Encyrtidae, and Ichneumonidae were recorded. Shannon-Weiner index, Margalef’s richness index, and evenness index found to be higher in the inter/border/hedgerow cropped fields compared to the sole cropped ecosystems. The abundance of the adult stage of the predators and parasitoids of the inter/border/hedgerow crops {{was found to be}} higher. The results of the study confirmed the role of crop diversification as a tool to enhance the functional biodiversity of parasitoids and predators for an efficient biological control program.|$|R

40|$|Information on {{the crop}} types is {{necessary}} for the studies on global food security and other environmental problems. Fields of crop types are distinguished by images for special periods of planting, growing and harvesting from other LULC types. Series of Landsat satellites can provide high quality images during those special periods. With the local knowledge of crop calendar, we calculated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index during the special periods to identify <b>crop</b> <b>and</b> other LULC types. The resultant TM-derived <b>crop</b> <b>and</b> other LULC type map were evaluated using check points and land registration data from government. The accuracy assessment proved that our area estimates of <b>crop</b> <b>and</b> other LULC types were at high level.
