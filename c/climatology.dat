40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to address the {{variability}} of the direct and indirect aerosol effect for the time period of space-based monitoring.

In the first step, a database of hourly surface monitoring will be developed for clear, partly cloudy and overcast sky conditions and stratified by solar zenith angle categories. Surface solar radiation <b>climatologies</b> will be calculated for these cloud cover conditions and for various “event strategies”. The design of the database will be flexible for future needs. Changes over time of the direct aerosol radiative forcing will be addressed with clear sky <b>climatologies.</b> Changes over time of the indirect aerosol effect will be analyzed with overcast sky <b>climatologies.</b> In the second step, comparisons with satellite derived determinations and modeling results will be carried out.

40|$|A {{comparison}} is made between a new operational NOAA AVHRR global cloud amount product to those from established satellite-derived cloud <b>climatologies.</b> The new operational NOAA AVHRR cloud amount is derived using the cloud detection scheme in the extended Clouds from AVHRR (CLAVR-x) system. The cloud mask within CLAVR-x is {{a replacement for}} the CLAVR- 1 cloud mask. Previous analysis of the CLAVR- 1 cloud <b>climatologies</b> reveals that its utility for climate studies is reduced by poor high latitude performance and inability to include data from the morning orbiting satellites. This study demonstrates, through comparison with established satellite-derived cloud <b>climatologies,</b> the ability of CLAVR-x to overcome the two main shortcomings of the CLAVR- 1 derived cloud <b>climatologies.</b> While systematic differences remain in the cloud amounts from CLAVR-x and other <b>climatologies,</b> no evidence is seen that these differences represent {{a failure of the}} CLAVR-x cloud detection scheme. Comparisons for July 1995 and January 1996 indicate that for most latitude zones, CLAVR-x produces less cloud than ISCCP and UW/HIRS.

5|$|On September 9 a {{tropical}} wave moved off the African coast and moved west into the Atlantic. It started {{to become more}} organized on September 13 and the National Hurricane Center began to watch it closely for further development. Tropical Depression Seventeen formed from the wave on September 17 when it was 350miles (560km) east of Barbados.

Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a dry northern climate zone where they had never been known to grow, climates naturally shifted geographically over time.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclone {{forecasting}} also {{relies on}} {{data provided by}} numerical weather models. Three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist: Statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using <b>climatology,</b> and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that {{is not based on}} the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. Models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models.|$|E
40|$|A new {{tropopause}} definition, {{based on}} a flow-dependent blending of the traditional thermal tropopause with one based on potential vorticity, has been developed. The benefits of such a blending algorithm are most apparent in regions with synoptic scale fluctuations between tropical and extratropical airmasses. The properties of the local airmass determine the relative contributions {{to the location of}} the blended tropopause, rather than this being determined by a specified function of latitude. Global <b>climatologies</b> of tropopause height, temperature, potential temperature and zonal wind, based on European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA) ERA-Interim data, are presented for the period 1989 - 2007. Features of the seasonal-mean tropopause are discussed on a global scale, alongside a focus on selected monthly <b>climatologies</b> for the two high latitude regions and the tropical belt. The height differences between <b>climatologies</b> based on ERA-Interim and ERA- 40 data are also presented. Key spatial and temporal features seen in earlier <b>climatologies,</b> based mainly on the World Meteorological Organization thermal tropopause definition, are reproduced with the new definition.

5|$|In the UK {{there were}} 124 {{separate}} occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell {{to less than}} 2% of installed capacity. A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002. Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind {{can be dealt with}} by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power. According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and <b>Climatology,</b> interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced (i.e. about 8% of total nameplate capacity) to be used as reliable, baseload electric power which can be relied on to handle peak loads, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.|$|E
5|$|Dry air {{prevented}} the convection from initially reorganising after Gillian was downgraded. With a ridge to the south, the low turned westward around the Top End of northwestern Australia. On 17March, the system moved north of 10°S, {{into the area}} of warning responsibility of the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, <b>Climatology</b> and Geophysics. By that time, the low-level circulation was disconnected from its mid-level circulation, and land interaction with Indonesia was expected to prevent redevelopment. Late on 18March, the storm moved over the island of Timor, and over the subsequent two days passed over several other Indonesian islands. On 21March, the convection reorganised due to a drop in wind shear, and at 12:00UTC that day, the BoM again upgraded Gillian to tropical cyclone status while the storm was about 380km (235mi) south-southeast of Jakarta. On the same day, the JTWC also re-initiated advisories on the storm, noting that the circulation had improved as it moved away from Indonesia. With low wind shear and favourable outflow, Gillian gradually intensified while moving southwestward around the ridge. On 22March, the storm passed just north of Christmas Island while Gillian was developing an eye; by that time, the 10minute sustained winds had increased to 95km/h (60mph) within an environment favourable for continued strengthening.|$|E
