40|$|The article {{discusses}} the problem <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> age (one’s own {{and that of}} other people), which {{is regarded as a}} special case <b>of</b> social <b>perception.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study was to analyze the components of another person’s appearance in the structure <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> visual representations of age. For these purposes the authors created a special technique, “Identifying Age through Photo Visualization” (Shkurko T. A., Nikolaeva E. G.). The study enrolled 20 individuals (10 men, 10 women aged 18 to 58 years) as “models” (i. e. objects <b>of</b> <b>perception)</b> and 60 individuals (47 women and 13 men aged 18 to 77 years) as subjects <b>of</b> <b>perception.</b> The paper shows that in the structure <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> visual representations of age the most important are stable, moderately stable and dynamic components of appearance, among which the stable parameters prevail.

40|$|Objective: Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} the variability <b>of</b> the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea in healthy subjects. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the variability <b>of</b> the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea in healthy subjects during breathing against increasing inspiratory resistive loads, as well as to assess the association between the level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea and the level of physical activity. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving healthy individuals 16 years of age or older. Subjects underwent inspiratory resistive loading testing, in which the level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was quantified with the modified Borg scale. We also determined body mass indices (BMIs), assessed maximal respiratory pressures, performed pulmonary function tests, applied the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) -long form, and conducted six-minute walk tests (6 MWTs). The level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was classified as low (Borg score 5). Results: We included 48 healthy subjects in the study. Forty-two subjects completed the test up to a load of 46. 7 cmH 2 O/L/s. The level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was classified as low, intermediate, and high in 13, 19, and 10 subjects, respectively. The level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was not significantly associated with age, gender, BMI, IPAQ-long form score, maximal respiratory pressures, or pulmonary function test results. Conclusions: The scores for perceived dyspnea induced by inspiratory resistive loading in healthy subjects presented wide variability. The <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was classified as low in 31 % of the subjects, intermediate in 45 %, and high in 24 %. There was no association between the level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea and the level of physical activity (IPAQ or six-minute walk distance) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Not all {{empirical}} work in {{the psychology}} <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> has operated explicitly within a theoretical framework. But when it has, that framework has usually been provided by the inferential theory <b>of</b> <b>perception.</b> I argue {{that in spite of}} its explanatory strengths, the inferential theory <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> conceals a well-established empirical phenomenon. That phenomenon is known in ordinary parlance as ‘familiarity’.

40|$|Theories <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> can broadly {{be divided}} into two groups: {{orthodox}} and heterodox theories (Noë & Thompson, 2002). Orthodox theories <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> consider perception as a neurological process, i. e. as a phenomenon which can be explained solely in terms of intracranial facts. Heterodox views expand this scope, maintaining that an understanding <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> must include extracranial facts, or facts about the environment in which a perceiver is situated (ibid.). This thesis will attempt to defend a particular exemplar of this heterodox approach, namely the enactive theory <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> proposed by Alva Noë. The thesis has two primary goals. First, I will attempt to offer an exegesis of Noë's theory, attempting to clarify the scope and strength of Noë's view.

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{functional}} specifics <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> and emotion verbs in the Old Russian language; the studies of lexicographical sources have proved that they are genetically related. The author focuses on etymology of the some verbs <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> and emotions. It is stated that the meaning of physical activity or state {{is associated with the}} process <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> (objective and independent by nature), which explains the reason for the emotive words to make a bank of subjectively oriented units. The functional analysis <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> and emotion verbs was performed on the material of "Andrew the-Fool-for-Christ Life", a Slavonic translated version of the text from the ancient list, dated {{as the end of the}} 14 th cen., and the original hagiographic texts: "Life of Theodosius of the Caves", "The Tale of Boris and Gleb" from "The Uspensky Manuscript" of the 12 th cen. It has been stated that the order and variations <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> and emotion verbs represent cause-and-reason relations. In the majority of the contexts emotion verbs follow the verbs <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> thus reflecting the consequence of the activities nominated by them. The verbs <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> may be used in the logical and metaphorical meanings, which is the result of semantic modulation; emotion verbs demonstrate connections with semantic derivation.

40|$|Book synopsis: The {{collection}} of papers {{of this book}} discuss Whitehead's bold theory <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> from different angles. According to the major perspectives the book {{is divided into two}} major parts: the philosophical and the psychological perspective. The four philosophical papers focus on: the relation between Whitehead's theory <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> and his account of the phases of concrescence, the nature of causal explanations in Whitehead's theory <b>of</b> <b>perception,</b> a comparative study on Kitaro Nishida's philosophy of pure experience and Whitehead's philosophy <b>of</b> <b>perception,</b> and a contrasting account of Whitehead's theory <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> with that <b>of</b> Deleuze. In the five papers of part II of the book («the psychological perspective»), some basic guidelines for conducting process-oriented psychological experiments on perceptgenesis are given. Then Whitehead's tri-modal theory <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> in the light of microgenetic research results is discussed. A comparison of Whitehead's position of the construction of solid objects with Piaget's account of the constructive development of the 'object permanent' in the young child follows. In the fourth paper James Gibson's early position on perception is compared with Whitehead's account. Finally it is shown that Whitehead's theory <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> may provide a mode of access to nonordinary experiences and an explanation for the emergence of nonordinary states of consciousness...|$|R
