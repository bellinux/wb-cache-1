And Jerry, as softly as Nalasu, informed him again that it was men, many men, more men than five.|$|R
5000|$|Compasses-and-straightedge constructions {{are used}} to {{illustrate}} principles of plane geometry. Although a real pair <b>of</b> <b>compasses</b> is used to draft visible illustrations, the ideal compass used in proofs is an abstract creator <b>of</b> perfect <b>circles.</b> The most rigorous definition of this abstract tool is the [...] "collapsing compass"; having drawn a circle from a given point with a given radius, it disappears; it cannot simply be moved to another point and used to draw another <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> equal radius (unlike a real pair <b>of</b> <b>compasses).</b> Euclid showed in his second proposition (Book I of the Elements) that such a collapsing compass {{could be used to}} transfer a distance, proving that a collapsing compass could do anything a real compass can do.|$|R

There is evident use <b>of</b> <b>compass</b> and straight-edge without taped lines, yet vigorous brushwork {{within the boundaries of}} drawn elements. By the mid-70's the supporting grid was undetectable beneath an interplay of squares, rectangles, triangles, <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> varying dimensions embraced within tonal fields.|$|R

Differential positioning performance <b>of</b> <b>COMPASS</b> and GPS are essentially similar, with GPS marginally better.
