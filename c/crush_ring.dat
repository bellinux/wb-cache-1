5000|$|The rocket uses {{a form of}} magneto-inertial fusion {{to produce}} a direct thrust fusion rocket. Powerful {{magnetic}} fields cause large metal rings (likely made of lithium, where a set for one pulse has a total mass of 365 grams) to collapse around the deuterium-tritium plasma, compressing it to a fusion state. Energy from these fusion reactions heats and ionizes the shell of metal formed by the <b>crushed</b> <b>rings.</b> The hot, ionized metal is shot out of a magnetic rocket nozzle at a high speed (up to 30 km/s). Repeating this process roughly every minute would propel the spacecraft. The fusion reaction is not self-sustaining and requires electrical energy to induce fusion. With electrical requirements estimated to be between 100 kW to 1,000 kW (300 kW average), spacecraft designs incorporate solar panels to produce the electrical energy needed for the fusion engine. [...] This approach uses Foil Liner Compression to create a fusion reaction of the proper energy scale {{to be used for}} space propulsion. The proof of concept experiment in Redmond, Washington, will use aluminum liners for compression. However, the actual rocket design will run with lithium liners.|$|R

The dimensions, loads and foundation of the new tanks are identical to the old tanks which were erected 40 years ago and demolished a few years ago. Despite {{the fact that the}} new tanks are identical to the old tanks, the stability calculation for the foundation of the new storage tanks did not fulfill the requirements of the present Eurocode 7 - 1. To ensure sufficient stability, additional measures like soil improvement are necessary. This {{is due to the fact}} that safety levels have much increased in the last 40 years. In order to optimize the design, it was decided to recalculate the stability using the code for existing structures “NEN 8707 ”, which is currently being developed. According to NEN 8707 it is allowed to use a lower value for the reliability index β for existing structures compared to new structures, because of proven strength. Thus, lower partial load and material factors can be applied. These calculations with the adjusted partial factors resulted in a sufficient overall safety factor for the ultimate limit state for the hydro-test phase and the operational phase. Thus, using NEN 8707, the tanks can be built on a <b>crushed</b> rock <b>ring</b> foundation without an expensive soil improvement...|$|R

The reaction was mediated {{in the presence}} of laccase by one of the following polyphenols {{in the presence of}} air: gallic acid (GA), vanillic acid (VA) and catechol (1, 2 –DHB). Enzyme was added at constant loading (24 kg ton− 1), 1 % pulp consistency, 0. 005 % CMC, pH = 6. 3 ± 0. 5 and 2 mM of mediator. CPX content was assessed at two levels (0 % and 0. 005 %). Treated pulps were analyzed by different mechanical tests (<b>ring</b> <b>crush,</b> mullen, corrugating medium test (CMT) flat crush of corrugating medium test and tension). An improvement in these parameters was obtained by biopolymer coupling and selected mediator. When using GA, three parameters increased more than 40 %, while <b>ring</b> <b>crush</b> increased 120 %. For the case of VA, properties were enhanced from 74 % to 88 % when CPX was added. For 1, 2 –DHB, there was not found a statistically significant difference between the results in the presence of CPX. Scanning electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, FTIR and 13 C NMR were used in all papers in order to evaluate grafting.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the property recovery capability of handsheets formed from secondary fibers by combining different techniques. To attain that, pulps derived from post-consumer cardboard scrap {{were subjected to}} various refining intensities respectively in a PFI mill (0, 400, 800 and 1200 revolutions) and ultrasound (0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes), followed by enzymatic treatments with enzymes Cellulase, Hemicellulase, Mixture 1 and Mixture 2 (both mixtures composed of cellulase and hemicellulase). The papermaking potential of the pulps was evaluated by means of physical and mechanical tests on the resulting paper after the relevant treatments. It was found that both the combination of PFI mill refining with enzymatic treatments and the combination of ultrasound with enzymatic treatments were effective in improving paper properties. It was also found that interfiber bonding properties such as tensile index and <b>ring</b> <b>crush</b> strength had greater increases, {{in relation to the}} initial pulp, in pulps derived from the combined PFI mill refining with enzymatic treatments.

The cyclic condition was more detrimental. Recycled boxes experienced greater losses in compression strength than virgin boxes. Significant differences in final compression strength also existed between virgin and recycled boxes for three different humidities. The final compression strength was not only related to moisture content, but also related to the moisture content history of the boxes. It was found that there were significant differences in creep rate and survival time between virgin and recycled boxes.

The rheological measurement indicated that PSBM emulsions exhibited shear-thinning behavior, and the phenomena became more pronounced with increasing silica sol concentration. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) demonstrated that the stronger interfacial interaction between silica sol and polymer matrix, but microphase separation took place with excess silica sol. Thereby the tensile strength and thermal stability of emulsion films were increased with desirable silica sol concentration, and when silica sol concentration was greater than 6 wt%, the tensile strength leveled off and the decomposition temperature decreased from 351. 19 ℃ to 331. 63 ℃. The degree of crystallinity increased from 5. 12 % to 10. 98 % with 4 % silica sol addition, resulting in enhanced rigidity of films. Furthermore, the interaction between polymer and fiber was improved with certain amount of silica sol, resulting in improved sizing degree, <b>ring</b> <b>crush</b> strength, surface strength and folding strength.

A preliminary economic analysis was performed in which an impulse dryer would increase press dryness by 4 points and would allow the basis weight to be reduced by 10 %. The economic model showed that the 4 points in dryness would translate to a 17 % tonnage increase. Applying the 10 % basis weight reduction resulted in an increase in productivity, on an area basis, of 30 %. The pulp cost savings was found to outweigh any additional electric power costs...|$|R

Fiber length, diameter, lumen and cell wall thickness of rapeseed residue fibers were examined as 0. 96 ± 0. 18 mm, 24. 21 ± 6. 07 µ, 15. 47 ± 5. 23 µ and 4. 37 ± 1. 97 µ. Three pulping durations of 20, 30 and 40 min and 3 chemical charges of 10 %, 15 % and 20 % chemical charge was used for NSSC paper industry. Cooking temperature at 170 °C, Na 2 SO 3 to Na 2 CO 3 ratio of 2. 91 : 1 and liquor to residue ratio of 10 : 1 were kept constant. The highest yield (82 %) was obtained applying the treatment combination of 40 min pulping time and 10 % chemical charge and the lowest yield (63. 67 %) was observed with 30 min pulping time and 15 %- 2 chemical. After the Pulping, The pulp prepared to be refined up to 400 ± 50 ml CSF and 127 gm hand sheets were prepared.

The ring of 3 H-thymidine-labeled cells separated retina that was present at the time of nerve <b>crush</b> (inside the <b>ring)</b> from new retina added afterward (outside). After a period of 14 – 16 months postcrush, both tectal lobes received two punctate applications of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), one in the central and the other in peripheral tectum, to retrogradely label contralateral retinal ganglion cell bodies and their axons. The pattern of HRP labeling from the control tectum confirmed earlier work: axons on the central tectum had somata in the central retina, and axons on the peripheral tectum had somata in the peripheral retina. The labeled cells and axons were both in predictable patterns. The somata that were backfilled from applications {{to the center of the}} experimental tectum lay inside the radioactive ring and had therefore regenerated their axons. The patterns of their labeled axons in the optic pathway and of their somata in the retina were typical of the regenerated condition as described in earlier studies. The somata backfilled from the periphery of the experimental tectum were outside the radioactive ring and had been added after the optic nerve crush. The patterns of their labeled axons and somata were comparable to the normal pattern. These observations indicate that new axons do not depend on an ordered array of predecessors to reestablish normal order along the age-axis of the pathway...|$|R

This study has found that Nopcobond 1213 significantly increases strength for handsheets made from both type of pulp and 5 mg/g is the optimum addition rate. In addition, light basis weight, about 0. 2 - 0. 35 kg/m 3 paper products are able to made from the TMP reject stream with desirable tensile strength (dry tensile index about 10 - 25 Nm/g, wet tensile index about 1 - 7 Nm/g). Handsheet were made and tested for physical properties and opacity properties including bulk, tensile strength, bending stiffness, fibre strength and formation, <b>ring</b> <b>crush</b> compressive strength, light scattering coefficient and opacity. Due to the long fibre and small amount of fines loss in the shive-free pulp, test samples showed relatively lower tensile strength compared to the whole pulp. Moreover, the shive-free handsheets did not completely dry in the drying process (due to wrinkles formation of high temperature), freely dried shive-free handsheets had worse formation than handsheets made from the whole pulp (as they are totally dried in drying section), therefore polymer in the shive-free handsheets reduced its performance in imparting paper strength. The whole pulp handsheets with better formation and more long fibres in the pulp showed good strength but relatively lower light scattering coefficient and opacity. The coarse and large fibres made handsheets from the whole pulp less sensitive to the different levels of pressing...|$|R
