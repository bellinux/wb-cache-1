50|$|A brake is a {{metalworking}} {{machine that}} allows the bending of sheet metal. A <b>cornice</b> <b>brake</b> only allows for simple bends and creases, while a box-and-pan brake also allows one to form box and pan shapes. It {{is also known as}} a bending machine or bending brake or in Britain as a sheet metal folder or just a folder.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{simplified}} brake, usually {{much smaller than}} <b>cornice</b> or box-and-pan <b>brakes.</b> Typically, a single handle both clamps the workpiece and makes the bend, in a single motion, but the depth is usually much less than what a <b>cornice</b> or box-and-pan <b>brake</b> can handle.|$|R
