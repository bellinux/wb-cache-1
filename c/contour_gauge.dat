Dirac brackets of both Maxwell and Yang-Mills theories are given for arbitrary admissible space-like paths. It is shown how to define a non-abelian flux and local charges which obey a local charge algebra. Fields associated with the charges differ from the electric fields of the theory by singular topological terms; to avoid this obstruction to the Gauss law it is necessary to exclude a single, gauge fixing curve from the region considered.

40|$|The renormalization-group {{properties}} of gauge-invariant transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDF) in QCD are addressed. We {{perform an analysis}} of their leading-order anomalous dimensions, which are local quantities, making use of the renormalization {{properties of}} contour-dependent composite operators in QCD. We argue that attaching individual gauge links with transverse segments to quark fields in the light-cone gauge, the associated <b>gauge</b> <b>contours</b> are joined at light-cone infinity through a cusp-like junction point. We find that the renormalization effect on the junction point creates an anomalous dimension which has to be compensated in order to recover the results in a covariant gauge.

We show that in the light-cone gauge, TMD PDFs contain UV divergences that {{may be attributed to}} the renormalization effect on a cusp-like junction point of the <b>gauge</b> <b>contours</b> at infinity. In order to eliminate the anomalous dimension ensuing from this cusp, we propose to use in the definition of the TMD PDFs, a soft counter term in terms of a path-ordered phase factor along a particular cusped contour extending to transverse light-cone infinity and comprising light-like and transverse segments. We argue that this additional factor is analogous to the "intrinsic" Coulomb phase factor found before in QED.

40|$|A (coordinate) {{gauge of}} general type is {{introduced}} where 1 -form (vector potential) is {{expressed as a}} contour integral of the 2 -form (field strength) along an arbitrary contour C. For a special class of <b>contours</b> the <b>gauge</b> condition reduces to kµ(x) Aµ(x) = 0 where kµ(x) is a tangent vector to the contour C. A simple proof of the nonabelian Stokes theorem is given demonstrating {{the advantage of the}} gauge. 1 The procedure of the gauge fixing {{is an essential part of}} QCD [1] and however final results do not depend on the gauge, different forms of gauge conditions are useful in different settings of physical problems. For example, in high energy scattering in QCD the axial gauge has proved to be useful [2], while in the OPE analysis [3] the Fock-Schwinger [4] (sometimes called the coordinate or radial) gauge was applied (for discussions and derivation see [5] and also [6]). In another physical situation, where the time axis is singled out, as e. g. in the heavy quarkonium theory, the modified coordinate gauge [7] can be convenient. This gauge was used recently in the context of equations for the quark [8] and gluon [9] Green’s functions, displaying the property of chiral symmetry breaking and confinement. There is another set of studies where an emphasis is made on formulation of gauge theory without gauge-dependent degrees of freedom from the very beginning, and the role of dynamical variables is played by 2 -forms [10] or loop variables [11]. These completely gauge-invariant approaches encountered their own difficulties and as a matter of fact many gauge-invariant observables are easier to calculate using gauge-dependent diagrammatic rules.

40|$|We {{summarize}} the renormalization-group properties of transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDF) s arguing {{that in the}} light-cone gauge the overlapping ultraviolet and rapidity divergences cannot be solely controlled by (dimensional) regularization, but necessitate their renormalization. In doing so, we show that at the one-loop order this additional divergence entails an anomalous dimension which {{can be attributed to}} a cusp in the <b>gauge</b> <b>contour</b> at light-cone infinity. Then, we present a recent analysis of TMD PDFs which incorporates in the gauge links the Pauli term ∼ F^μν[γ_μ,γ_ν]. This generalized treatment of gauge invariance is shown to be justified, {{in the sense that it}} does not modify the behavior of the leading-twist contribution, though it contributes to the anomalous dimension of that of twist-three. An important consequence of the inclusion of the spin-dependent Pauli term is the appearance of a constant phase [...] -the same for the leading twist-two and subleading distribution functions [...] -that ensues from the interaction of the Pauli term in the transverse gauge link with the gauge field accompanying the fermion. Remarkably, this phase has opposite sign for the Drell-Yan process as compared to the semi-inclusive DIS. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures embedded as eps files.

40|$|Groundwater-fed {{lakes in}} northeastern Germany are {{characterized}} by significant lake level changes, but {{for only a few}} lakes are in situ water level measurements available. In this study, we test the potential of RapidEye satellite images for indirectly reconstructing lake level changes. The lake levels are derived by intersecting water-land borders with a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Based on Lake Fürstenseer (LF), we define requirements and limitations of the method. Water-land borders were extracted automatically from the 37 RapidEye images available for the period between 2009 and 2014. Otsu’s threshold was used for the NIR band and for the normalized difference water index (NDWI). The results were validated with in situ <b>gauging,</b> <b>contour</b> lines from the DEM, and in situ Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) measurements of the shoreline. Using an ideal shoreline subset, the lake levels could be reconstructed with decimeter accuracy using the NIR water-land border, but the levels were systematically underestimated by 0 – 20 cm. The accuracy of the reconstructed lake level retrieval strongly depends on the precision of the water-land border retrieval, on the accuracy of the DEM, and on the lake level itself. A clear shift of the water-land border with increasing lake level is also essential for the unambiguous reconstruction of different levels. This shift needs to be several times larger than the pixel size. The biggest challenges for lake level reconstruction are the presence of vegetation at the shorelines, the quality of the topographic data in the underwater area, the slope of the shoreline, and shadows in combination with low solar angles...|$|R

40|$|Most {{studies of}} the {{movement}} patterns of intertidal herbivores assess overall displacement in an assumed homogeneous environment. In the present study, the impact of substrate complexity on spatial patterns of foraging in the limpet, Cellana grata, was investigated on a rocky shore in Hong Kong. Movement patterns were measured by photographing individual C. grata every 10 minutes over an entire foraging cycle. From the photographs, limpet positions were mapped onto the shore at low water and individual trails re-constructed in situ. Individual movement tortuosity (using a sinuosity index from a correlated random walk model and the fractal dimension of movement paths), mean speed, overall net displacement and trail length were measured. Surface profiles were recorded using a <b>contour</b> <b>gauge</b> and surface complexity described using fractal dimensions. The paths of C. grata became more tortuous as {{the complexity of the}} rock surface increased, suggesting that the limpet avoids moving and foraging directly over surface irregularities.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} role of gluon poles and the gauge {{invariance}} for the hadron tensors of Drell-Yan and direct photon production processes with the transversely polarized hadron. These hadron tensors are needed to construct the corresponding single spin asymmetries. For the Drell-Yan process, we perform our analysis within both the Feynman and axial-type (contour) gauges for gluons. In both the Feynman and contour gauges, we demonstrate that the gauge invariance leads to the need of the new (non-standard) diagrams. Moreover, in the Feynman gauge, we argue the absence of gluon poles in the correlators 〈ψ̅γ_ A^+ψ〉 related traditionally to dT(x,x) /dx. As a result, these terms disappear from the final QED gauge invariant Drell-Yan hadron tensor.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates policies {{implemented by}} governments in emigration states to incorporate their diasporas into the homeland political community. While some governments enact expansive policies that enable their diasporas to easily acquire citizenship, vote overseas, and access the policymaking process, others try to insulate homeland politics from diaspora influence. I refer to these three interlocking policies as diaspora political incorporation policies because they define the diaspora's {{relationship to the}} homeland political community. To explain variation in diaspora political incorporation policies, I pair data on global trends in citizenship, external voting rights, and diaspora representation with analysis of policy variation in Armenia, Croatia, and Serbia. These three countries have among the world's largest emigrant populations relative to domestic population. Moreover, they grappled with devastating wars and steep economic decline in the 1990 s. Nevertheless, diaspora political incorporation policies sharply varied across these three cases as well as within each case over time. While most scholars emphasize the homeland government's need for economic aid or foreign policy support from the diaspora, I argue that diaspora political incorporation policies are firmly anchored in electoral competition. Homeland politicians support expansive diaspora incorporation policies when said policies increase their parties' electoral resources, and reject them when their opponents benefit. The challenge for policymakers, who have limited knowledge of the diaspora's political <b>contours,</b> is to <b>gauge</b> the political impact of an expanded electorate and citizenry prior to enacting reforms. Lacking reliable data on diaspora political orientations, Armenian, Croatian, and Serbian politicians' perceptions of the diaspora as a political force were instead shaped by the manner of diaspora involvement in homeland affairs during communism's collapse. Two factors were particularly important: 1) whether the diaspora supported the anticommunist opposition in the homeland or competed independently, and 2) whether the diaspora's support was concentrated in one homeland party or was diffuse...|$|R
40|$|A {{sediment}} {{and sediment}} trap study of natural oil seeps in the Timor Sea off {{the north coast}} of Australia has been conducted. Sediment traps were set at 40 m below sea level {{on top of a}} benthic carbonate dome, formed near the Cornea oil and gas field, which was visibly leaking oil and gas around its edges in 90 m of water. Other traps were set at the continental shelf edge at 100 m and 400 m below sea level on the 500 m bathymetric <b>contour</b> to <b>gauge</b> the long range dispersion of the Cornea seep. Sediment cores from the trap sites and other relevant sites were also collected. Sea surface microlayer samples of the oil slicks emerging with gas bubbles were also sampled. These were used to characterize the oil as it moved from surface slicks, through settling particles, to surface sediment. Downward fluxes of total hydrocarbons (THC) ranged from 500 µg m− 2 d− 1 at the shallow Cornea seep site to 100 µg m− 2 d− 1 in 100 m depth traps at the offshore stations. Fluxes of oil polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) ranged from 6000 ng m− 2 d− 1 at Cornea to 1000 ng m− 2 d− 1 at off shore stations. Principal Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Principal Component Analysis (HCA–PCA) of the petroleum biomarkers confirmed that the surface slick samples and sediment traps from Cornea and some of the offshore traps had similar hydrocarbon compositions. However, some of the offshore traps also contained hydrocarbons from an apparently different source. This second source appeared to be “background oil”, probably due to a mixture of natural seeps, oil industry activities, or release from shipping traffic, and was similar in composition to that seen in previous sediment trap studies on the Northwest shelf. The Cornea seep area was deemed a significant point source of oil and gas to the coastal environment that was dispersed by tidal movements across the continental shelf and contributed to settling particles up to 300 km away on the continental slope of the Timor Sea. An extension of a diagenesis model showed that 44 to 77 % of the (THC) and 27 to 83 % of the (PAH) were degraded in the water column. Of the remaining oil reaching the sediment surface 99 to 100 % of THC and 98 to 100 % of PAH were degraded in the near surface sediments. Microbial biomarkers indicated the presence of sulphate reducing bacteria in both sediment traps and sediments and only trace amounts of the markers associated with Archaea which together accomplish the anoxic oxidation of methane (AOM). Rather than this well known deep sea microbial consortia, aerobic hydrocarbon oxidizing bacteria constituted a small proportion of the bacterial community in the surface sediment layer associated with the largest seep plume observed at the Cornea seep area. These hydrocarbon degraders were not visible in the offshore sediments against the background of other microbes. The rapid water column and surface sediment degradation rates indicated that the Timor Sea is well adapted to degrade natural oil seeps. This rapid degradation rate makes detection difficult for specific oil biomarkers due to low hydrocarbon concentrations in sediments. Such studies are more successfully accomplished with sediment trap deployments...|$|R
40|$|The Laurentian Great Lakes (LGL) are {{the largest}} system of surface {{freshwater}} on Earth. Three factors, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), outlet conveyance, and climate processes contribute to natural rises and falls in LGL lake level over geologic time. Studying {{the natural history of}} prehistoric lake levels preserved in coastal landforms helps determine the context of current lake levels and predict potential future lake level changes. Detailed records of lake level change during the late Holocene are preserved in strandplains of beach ridges. Each beach ridge forms {{as a result of a}} lake level rise and fall over many decades and preserves a record of relative lake level elevation at the time of deposition. Multiple beach ridges within a single strandplain contain an account of relative lake level changes over the past 4, 500 years. This study examined beach ridges in the Ipperwash strandplain, southern Lake Huron, that uniquely preserves natural lake level fluctuations at the only unregulated outlet in the LGL, the Port Huron/Sarnia outlet of Lake Michigan-Huron, which is particularly susceptible to natural lake level flucuations. The Ipperwash strandplain is the closest strandplain with the most number of beach ridges to the Port Huron/Sarnia outlet and therefore best records natural lake level fluctuation experienced at the Port Huron/Sarnia outlet of Lake Michigan-Huron. The study of the Ipperwash strandplain beach ridges used many methods to derive measured elevations and modelled ages of ancient lake levels. Elevation data is combined with age data to create the Ipperwash paleohydrograph. Thirty-six basal foreshore elevations were used to reconstruct the elevation of ancient lake levels. Elevation data shows an oscillatory lake level fall from a maximum elevation of 181. 0 m to a minimum elevation of 177. 8 m. Ten optically stimulated luminescence ages were used to create a linear age model of the Ipperwash strandplain. The resultant age model shows a maximum age of 3520 years ago and a minimum age of 710 years age. The multi-millennium trend shows a net linear fall at an average rate of 7 cm/century for the entire Ipperwash paleohydrograph. This trend is interpreted as a record of the rate of GIA at Ipperwash relative to Lake Michigan-Huron’s outlet. The multi-millennium trend suggests the rate of GIA at Ipperwash is 7 cm/century; however, estimates of GIA based on water gauge data suggest the rate of GIA at Ipperwash is 0 cm/century. This discrepancy could result from an underestimation estimated from <b>contoured</b> water level <b>gauge</b> data for the rate of GIA at Ipperwash, erosion at the Port Huron/Sarnia outlet during the deposition of the Ipperwash strandplain and/or the Chicago outlet being dominant during the deposition of the Ipperwash strandplain. The multi-millennium trend may also be expressed as two millennium trends shown as two vertically offset phases of lake-level lowering from 3520 to 2180 years ago and 2020 to 710 years ago. These age ranges correspond with the Algoma and 1700 -high lake level phases in Lake Michigan. Millennium patterns at Ipperwash corresponds to regional climate records and may represent a climate signal. However, the rate of linear lake level lowering for the older lake level phase at Ipperwash corresponds with the difference in rates of GIA, based on water gauge data, between the Chicago outlet and the Ipperwash strandplain. Therefore, the millennium trends may represent either natural climate change or the abandonment of the Chicago outlet of Lake Michigan-Huron. Detailed sedimentologic and lake level records at the Port Huron/Sarnia and Chicago outlets are needed to resolve this controversy. Centennial lake level fluctuations represent rises and falls in lake levels lasting an average of 208 years ± 114 years with an average amplitude of 0. 8 ± 0. 4 m about the linear millennium trends. The average timing of the centennial lake level fluctuation at Ipperwash are similar to centennial lake level fluctuations found in Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron that are interpreted to represent climate driven lake level fluctuations. Multi-decadal lake level fluctuations cause a single Ipperwash strandplain beach ridge to form average every 73 ± 35 years. The subsurface stratigraphy of Ipperwash beach ridges shows a similarity of other LGL beach ridges which are interpreted to form as a result of a climate driven lake level fluctuations over many decades. The Ipperwash paleohydrograph provides the context needed to adjust all strandplain data in Lake Michigan-Huron to resolve basin-wide relative lake level changes related to GIA, outlet conveyance, and climate. In addition, the Ipperwash paleohydrograph suggest lake-level may rise and fall on a multi-decadal time scale contributing to erosion and setting the stage to create a new beach ridge, assuming the rate of sediment supply is maintained...|$|R
