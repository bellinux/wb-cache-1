Johnson's 1964 Presidential campaign. He and Peggy are often at odds with each other due to his abrasive attitude, although the two later develop a strong working relationship after Peggy challenges Stan over working in the nude for a campaign, which Stan gruffly concedes to her. Stan {{is one of the}} few members of the SCDP <b>creative</b> <b>department</b> who survives the staff cuts. He makes the transition to McCann Erickson in Season 7 and tells Peggy of his love for her at the conclusion of the series, which Peggy reciprocates.|$|E
40|$|Gender {{segregation}} begins {{early and}} is reinforced within the workplace. Advertising <b>creative</b> <b>departments</b> {{appear to have}} extreme gender segregation with women representing just 20 % of all those working within <b>creative</b> <b>departments</b> worldwide. Yet, creativity {{does not depend on}} gender. Thus, the underrepresentation of women is particularly troubling. In Peru women comprise 3 % to 10. 4 % of all people working in advertising creative, which suggests the situation for creative women in Peru is dire. In order to understand this phenomenon, and with the hope of finding solutions, this study uses indepth interviews to explore the experiences of Peruvian women working in advertising <b>creative</b> <b>departments.</b> The study investigates three primary aspects of Peruvian creative women’s experiences. First, it looks at relationships with colleagues and clients. Second, work/life balance is explored. Third, the study examines how the environment within <b>creative</b> <b>departments</b> constrains <b>creative</b> women’s employment and advancement opportunities. Findings suggest that Peruvian <b>creative</b> <b>departments</b> are strongly machismo environments where discrimination and gender segregation are staunchly entrenched. This machismo environment creates challenging relationships between creative women and their colleagues and clients, it negatively impacts creative women’s work/life balance and it leads to severely constrained hiring, promotion and retention of creative women in Peruvian advertising agencies. The discussion closes with suggestions to help creative women succeed in Peruvian <b>creative</b> <b>departments...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{cross-cultural study}} examines {{the experiences of}} women in advertising <b>creative</b> <b>departments</b> in Spain and the United States. The study, {{an exploration of the}} creative environment and its impact on female creatives, is framed by Hofstede's dimensional model of national culture (Hofstede 2001; de Mooij & Hofstede 2010) and signalling theory (Spence 1974). Interviews with 35 top female creatives suggest that the challenges women face are rooted in the 'fraternity culture' or 'territorio de chicos' of <b>creative</b> <b>departments</b> in both countries. The data further suggest that the gender-bound cultural environment of advertising <b>creative</b> <b>departments</b> may be a global phenomenon, one that may adversely affect the creative process and impact women's upward mobilit...|$|R
500|$|One {{creative}} {{solution was}} uncovering Peter Parks, {{a specialist in}} macro photography, who had retrieved deep-sea microorganisms and photographed them in 3-D under partial funding from the Bahamas government. Parks brewed chemicals and bacteria together to create reactions that Schrecker and Dawson shot, recording 20,000 feet worth of film over eight weeks. To create the effects, Peter Parks took advantage of fluid dynamics, which affected {{the behavior of the}} substances that he photographed. [...] "When these images are projected on a big screen, you feel like you're looking at infinity. That's because the same forces at work in the water—gravitational effects, settlement, refractive indices—are happening in outer space," [...] Parks said. The specialist's talent convinced the film's <b>creative</b> <b>department</b> to go beyond computer-generated imagery and follow Parks' lead. Instead of millions of dollars for a single special effects sequence, Parks generated all the footage for the film for just $140,000.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his search}} for radio work {{following}} his graduation, Stern declined an offer to work evenings at WRNW, a progressive rock station in Briarcliff Manor, New York. He stopped and was unsure of his talent and questioned his future as a professional in the industry, writing [...] "I freaked out. I got real nervous that I wasn't good enough". Stern accepted a marketing role at Benton & Bowles, a New York advertising agency, which he soon [...] "quit without giving notice" [...] {{in favor of a}} position in the <b>creative</b> <b>department.</b> He lasted three hours before he was fired [...] "because their personnel department realized that I was the guy who just quit." [...] Stern then worked in Queens as a radio salesman selling advertising time without considerable success. He wrote, [...] "All of a sudden ... I realized I had turned down a job in radio". With encouragement from his mother and girlfriend, Stern contacted WRNW for work and agreed to take cover shifts surrounding the Christmas holidays in 1976. Impressed with his reliability and professional approach, the station's director hired Stern full-time for a four-hour midday shift for six days a week, for $96 a week. After several months, Stern became the station's production director which lasted until November 1977 when he became its program director for an increased salary of $250 a week. To save money, Stern rented a room in a monastery in Armonk, New York.|$|E
