Also the cationbinding capacity of casein was studied and found to depend on several factors. By simultaneous titration at constant pH of calcium hydroxide and phosphoric acid, a complex phosphate was precipitated (relation Ca/P about 1. 4), which is neither an orthophosphate, nor a hydroxy-apatite. If this titration was in caseinate solutions, a 'complex' could be synthetized. Its properties were in most respects according to those of the complex of milk. Although no definite answer could be given to the problem of the kind of bond between caseinate and phosphate, some existing hypotheses could be ruled out.

Our current studies concern gamma irradiation influence on the physical properties of calcium caseinate-whey protein isolate-glycerol (1 : 1 : 1) solutions and gels, used for films preparation. Irradiation of solutions was carried out with Co- 60 gamma rays applying 0 and 32 kGy dose. The increase in viscosity of solutions was found after irradiation connected to induced crosslinking. Lower viscosity values were detected, however, after heating of the solutions irradiated with a 32 kGy dose than after heating of the non-irradiated ones regarding differences in the structure of gels and resulting in different temperature-viscosity curves that were recorded for the irradiated and the non-irradiated samples during heating and cooling. Creation of less stiff but better ordered gels after irradiation arises probably from reorganisation of aperiodic helical phase and β-sheets, in particular from increase of β-strands, detected by FTIR. Films obtained from these gels are characterised by improved barrier properties and mechanical resistance and are more rigid than those prepared from the non-irradiated gels.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to gain a better understanding of the formation, stability and microstructure of oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by commercial sodium (ALANATE 180) and calcium caseinates (ALANATE 380). The study also determined the effects of heat treatment and NaCI addition on the formation and stability of these emulsions. Emulsions were prepared using various concentrations of sodium or <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> solutions (0. 5 to 5. 0 %) and 30 % soya oil. Surface protein coverage (mg/m 2) in freshly prepared emulsions was determined from analysis of the aqueous phase after centrifugation of emulsions at 45, 000 g for 40 minutes, using the Kjeldahl method. SDS-PAGE was used to identify the adsorbed protein components in the cream phase. Creaming stability was determined after storage of emulsions for 24 hours at 20 °C by a low speed centrifugation method. The microstructure of these emulsions was determined using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The aggregation state of caseins in sodium and <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> solutions was determined by successive centrifugation, gel permeation chromatography and multi-angle laser light scattering techniques. For emulsions stabilized with sodium caseinate, the surface protein concentration increased gradually with protein concentration up to 3 %, but the increase was much smaller at higher concentrations. By comparison, the surface protein coverage in emulsions stabilized with <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> showed an almost linear increase with protein concentration (0. 5 to 5. 0 %). At all protein concentrations, the surface protein coverage of emulsions stabilized with <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> was higher than that of sodium caseinate emulsions. β-Casein was adsorbed in preference to other caseins in emulsions made using ≤ 2. 0 % sodium caseinate, but αs-casein (αs 1 - + αs 2 -) appeared to adsorb in preference to other caseins when emulsions were made using > 2. 0 % sodium caseinate. In calcium caseinate-stabilized emulsions, αs-casein was found to adsorb in preference to other caseins at all protein concentrations used. Heat treatment (121 °C for 15 min) of sodium caseinate emulsions or heat treatment of sodium caseinate solutions prior to emulsion formation, at all caseinate concentrations, resulted in an increase in surface protein coverage and altered the proportions of individual caseins at the droplet surface. The surface protein coverage of emulsions formed with <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> solutions increased markedly when the emulsions were heated (121 °C for 15 min) or when <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> solutions were heated prior to emulsion formation. The preferential adsorption of αs-casein, observed in the unheated <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> emulsions, diminished after heating, which was due to polymerization of αs-casein during heating and/or degradation of this casein. In sodium caseinate emulsions, the surface protein coverage and the composition of emulsion droplets were influenced by the presence of NaCl prior to emulsion formation. The surface protein coverage in emulsions made with 1 and 3 % sodium caseinate increased with an increase in NaCl concentration up to 40 mM, with a large increase in the adsorption of αs-casein at the droplet surface. Addition of NaCl beyond 40 mM had no further effects on surface coverage and composition. Similar trends were observed when NaCl was added to the emulsions after they were formed. By contrast, in <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> emulsions, the surface protein coverage decreased with increase in NaCl concentration up to 40 mM, but with further increase in NaCl concentration the surface protein coverage increased slightly. In these emulsions, the composition of the interface remained largely unafffected by NaCl addition; αs-casein was adsorbed in preference to other caseins. Creaming stability of <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> emulsions, after storage at 20 °C for 24 hours, increased with an increase in protein concentration. However, the creaming stability of sodium caseinate emulsions decreased markedly as the protein concentration was increased above 2 %. This decrease in stability was attributed to the reversible flocculation arising from a 'depletion flocculation' mechanism. This flocculation in turn resulted in enhanced creaming at high caseinate concentrations. In sodium caseinate emulsions, the appearance of the droplets in the confocal micrographs was dependent on the concentration of protein used for making emulsions. Emulsions formed with low concentrations of sodium caseinate (0. 5 and 1. 0 %) appeared to be homogenous with no sign of flocculation. However the emulsions made with > 2 % sodium caseinate showed some irregular flocs, which appeared to be forming a network structure at higher concentrations of protein. In contrast, confocal micrographs of emulsions formed with <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> at all protein concentrations showed individual droplets. The creaming stability of these emulsions improved, when the emulsions were heated or when emulsions were made using heated sodium or <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> solutions.

40|$|The {{effect of}} calcium and sodium {{caseinate}} supplements (2 g/ 100 g) {{on the behavior}} of rice-buckwheat dough and bread quality was compared to the effect of xanthan gum and carboxymethyl cellulose. The addition of caseinates significantly (P < 0. 01) increased dough weakening, which became similar to dough with xanthan gum. During heating, the gelatinization rate became similar to dough with carboxymethyl cellulose. Moreover, peak complex viscosity was decreased by 0. 4. 10 (5) Pa s. Additionally, hydrocolloid supplements impacted bread crumb characteristics. An open structure was found in crumb with added <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> carboxymethyl cellulose as well as xanthan gum. The hardness of rice buckwheat crumb without hydrocolloids (12. 2 N) was decreased by <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> (4. 3 N), xanthan gum (9. 1 N) and carboxymethyl cellulose (9. 3 N), however, no significant effect of sodium caseinate was recorded (11. 5 N). The overall sensory acceptability of rice-buckwheat bread (7. 1) was increased by sodium caseinate (7. 5), <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> (7. 7) and carboxymethyl cellulose (7. 8). The acceptability of bread with xanthan gum (5. 9) was negatively impacted by dry, coarse crust and extremely sticky crumb. It can be concluded caseinates may be alternative substances with satisfactory impact on the rheological characteristics of rice -buckwheat dough, as well as bread quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper focuses on some important characteristics of films produced with sodium and calcium caseinates. The effects of caseinate type and concentration, plasticizer concentration and pH were studied.

40|$|The {{changes in}} {{quaternary}} structure of casein supramolecules with various {{physical and chemical}} treatments were studied using transmission electron microscopy, and a model {{to account for the}} changes is put forth. The effects of casein structure on coagulation properties were also studied. The sample preparation for transmission electron microscopy involved physical methods of fixation and flash freeing to preserve the structure of caseins in the sample. The structure of caseins in sodium and <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> varied with sodium caseinate not exhibiting any spherical structure as opposed to the spherical structure seen in <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> non-fat dried milk and native milk. This difference in structure was carried over to rennet coagulum made from those sources of casein. Addition of calcium and phosphate to sodium and <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> respectively, improved their coagulation properties. Hydration parameters such as time and shear of hydration affected the extent of hydration. High shear (733 s- 1) or approximately 10 hr of hydration was required to disperse and hydrate the dried milk protein powders. Acidification and treatment with excess EDT A resulted in dissociation of casein supramolecules into various sizes and shapes. Heat treatment of milk in the presence of ethanol also resulted in its dissociation. High heat treatment of milk at various pH levels induced different types of whey protein casein interactions. All these changes can be explained using an irregular supramolecular structure of caseins based on a node and strand network of proteins and calcium phosphate nanoclusters. Such a filigreed sponge-like appearance is seen in native bovine milk and in milk of other species...|$|E

Also, the pure unmodified milk fat, {{and the soft}} (SBF 23), medium (SBF 27) and hard (SBF 42) fractions of the same were transformed into powder by spray chilling the molten samples. The effect of chilling with air and nitrogen was investigated. The powders were satisfactorily stable at 5 °C, but were relatively unstable at ambient temperatures. The powders' particle size distributions ranged from 4. 44 to 215. 56 μm. The powder characteristics were influenced {{by the size of}} the nozzle, the atomising gas pressure, the chilling temperature, the feed flow rate, and to a lesser extent, the feed temperature. The shelf life of the unmodified milk fat powders stored at 20 °C, 5 °C and - 10 °C was assessed. The powders chilled with air had excessively oxidised after one month of storage at all the temperatures, whereas powders processed with nitrogen were still usable after the same period of storage. Lower peroxide values were recorded for the powders stored at - 10 °C and 5 °C, while significantly higher values were obtained for the samples stored at 20 °C. The powdered fats dry-blended successfully with skim milk and <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> powders at the ambient temperature. In comparison, the hard fraction mixed better than the other softer fractions.

40|$|Both {{health and}} {{sustainability}} are drivers {{for the increased}} interest {{in the creation of}} novel foods comprising a high protein content. The key challenge is the formation of an attractive, stable and palatable food texture, which is mainly determined by the food structure. In this research, new processing routes based on flow are explored to create innovative protein-rich structures (exceeding 10 %), and in parallel, insight is gained in the relevant mechanisms of structure formation. Dense dispersions of sodium caseinate and <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> which are derived from milk, were mixed in a conventional mixer and sheared in an in house developed shear cell device. After mixing dense (sodium or <b>calcium)</b> <b>caseinate</b> dispersions, homogenous structures were obtained of which the properties were determined by the dispersed phase added, in this case palm fat. Shearing of dense <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> dispersions in combination with solidification using the enzyme transglutaminase resulted in completely different structures; highly fibrous structures were produced, which may serve as a basis for the creation of meat analogs. In contrast, after treating dense sodium caseinate dispersions using this novel structuring process, homogenous structures were obtained. It appeared that the intrinsic properties of protein dispersions are important for the formation of fibrous structures using well-defined flow. Based on the differences in performance between the two types of caseinates, tools and parameters can be derived to optimize and control the formation of fibrous products. In conclusion, the development of equipment that is dedicated to structure food ingredients is promising for the creation of novel foods on the one hand, and for gaining scientific understanding of structure formation on the other hand...|$|E

Performances of the two encapsulants were compared in respect of the rate of release of core material from the microcapsules and stability of microcapsules against harsh conditions. Microencapsulation was carried out by preparation of an emulsion containing <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> as the emulsion stabilizer and a water-soluble carbohydrate (either sodium alginate or trehalose) as the encapsu-lant.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study {{competitive}} adsorption of milk proteins during spray-drying. For this purpose, a new surface sensitive method was developed which measures the quantitative amount of specific proteins at the powder surface. The new method is based on steady-state fluorescence measurement of pyrene labelled proteins with oxygen gas phase quenching at the powder surface. The milk proteins studied were bovine serum albumin (BSA), beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg), beta-casein and micellar beta-casein. Beta-casein aggregated into micelle-like structures of size 20 - 30 nm, were assumed to resemble native casein submicelles. The proteins differ in their surface affinity, size and structure, and were therefore expected to show different adsorption properties to the droplet air-water interface during the spray-drying process. Protein adsorption was studied using dextran or lactose as the carbohydrate matrix. The influence of pH on the solutions prior to spray-drying was also studied for whey proteins, sodium caseinate and <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> using the ESCA-technique. Furthermore, the surface coverage of proteins was correlated with the surface tension of the dried emulsions to elucidate {{the relationship between the}} surface tension at the air-water interface and the surface composition of the dried emulsions. Results showed that competitive protein adsorption occurs between the proteins during spray-drying. It was seen that the surface affinity and the adsorption dynamics (protein aggregate complexity and protein flexibility) is important for protein adsorption during spray-drying, particularly at high concentrations. Beta-casein was found to be the most competitive protein, and dominated at the powder surface when spray-dried together with beta-Lg. In an aggregated form the competitiveness of micellar beta-casein was weaker compared to monomeric beta-casein. When micellar beta-casein was spray-dried together with beta-Lg, beta-Lg dominated at a low bulk concentration whereas at higher concentrations the presence of micellar beta-casein at the surface was comparable to beta-Lg. The whey proteins beta-Lg and BSA were found the be equal in their competitiveness during spray-drying. The change of pH in the solutions was shown to not affect the whey proteins with respect to surface coverage. However, both <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> and sodium caseinate showed an increased surface coverage with an increasing pH. The expected correlation between surface coverage and surface tension, (i. e. the most surface active protein will give the largest surface coverage) was found for whey proteins and sodium caseinate, whereas for <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> this correlation was weaker...|$|E

The sample which exhibited good functional properties in imitation cheese, had slightly higher calcium (16. 4 mg/g protein), non-casein protein (2. 87 %) and y-casein contents, a higher formal titre (8. 95 mg free amino N/g protein), lower water absorption (138 mg/ 100 g protein), and lower stability to added calcium (8. 0 min) than did the other sample (14. 6 mg/g, 1. 66 %, 8. 02 mg/g, 129 mg/ 100 g, and 15 min, respectively), which was described as having poor functionality according to the criteria of the imitation cheese producer...|$|E
40|$|The malate-aspartate shuttle {{allows the}} {{hydrogen}} ions of the cofactor NADH {{produced in the}} cytosol to reach the electron transport chain in the mitochondria and generate energy. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of oral L-glutamine and the stable dipeptide, l-alanyl-glutamine, on the expression of the mitochondrial key enzymes of the malate-aspartate shuttle in rat distal small intestine on 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. In order to demonstrate the possible changes in (malate desidrogenase) MDH 1, 2 and (aspartate desidrogenase) GOT 1, 2 in the rat intestine tissues, the mRNA levels for those enzymes were analyzed by real-time PCR. Results showed that although there were fluctuations in tissue MDH and GOT values of the samples assessed with glutamine versus L-alany-glutamine supplementation versus a <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> supplementation, no significant differences were observe...|$|E
40|$|M. TechIn South Africa, {{the gross}} margins {{currently}} achieved on normal pan breads are minimal. For {{a number of}} years manufacturers have been trying to improve this situation with added ingredients. Probably one of the simplest of ways {{to do this is to}} increase the water absorption, without adversely affecting the quality of the bread such as loaf volume and shelf life. Another means to possibly increase profits is to extend the shelf life on bread. The ultimate would be to supplement the standard formulation with one extra ingredient in order to enhance all aspects. White pan bread was supplemented with three different concentration levels of each lipase, pentosanase, guar gum, к-carrageenan, <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> and whey. The effects of the different additives were measured against a control. In terms of the water absorption the gums prove to be the best additives, which is mainly due to their ability to function as water binders. К-carrageenan was most excellent at both the medium and high concentration levels, whereas guar gum only performed best at the high concentration level. Both lipase and pentosanase gave good loaf volumes compared to the rest of the additives and the control. The positive effect due to pentosanase could probably be explained by way of two main pathways – oxidative gelation or spiralling effect of the hydrolysis of water in the dough. Lipase is believed to strengthen the gluten and therefore ultimately increases loaf volume. <b>Calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> was a good anti-staling agent. The mode of action is probably through its water holding ability, though more work is needed since the water absorption results did not correlate. Although к-carrageenan showed increased water absorptions, it also slowed down mould growth tremendously, possibly since the water is in a “bound” form and not available for microbial activity. In the search for one additive to obtain best results for water absorption, loaf volume and shelf life, it seems that к-carrageenan would be the additive of choice...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to isolate and briefly {{characterize}} proteolytic bacteria from a poorly known habitat - raw wool. Fleece samples were accordingly collected from Merino raw wool - a Portuguese ewe breed, at three distinct areas of their body, from animals exhibiting no symptoms or signs of abnormalities: they were then subjected to enumeration and isolation of a total of 158 bacterial strains. Said isolates were screened for protease activity, using the spot technique, on <b>Calcium</b> <b>Caseinate</b> Agar containing 1 % (w/v) skim milk. The 36 isolates displaying the highest protease activity underwent a more refined assessment of enzymatic performance - by examining their cell-free supernatant extracts, using casein as substrate. Two Bacillus isolates were eventually chosen owing to their highest proteolytic activities (24. 6 and 15. 9 U/mL), and identified using molecular biology tools. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Application of shear and {{cross-linking}} enzyme transglutaminase (Tgase) induced fibrous hierarchical {{structures in}} dense (30 % w/w) <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> (Ca-caseinate) dispersions. Using Tgase was {{essential for the}} anisotropic structure formation. The fibrous materials showed anisotropy on both micro- and macroscale as determined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical analyses, respectively. SEM revealed protein fibers with a diameter of approximately 100 - 200 nm; visually, we observed fibers of about 1 mm. Both shear and Tgase affected the reinforcement of the fibers to a large extent, whereas the mechanical properties in the direction perpendicular to the shear flow remained constant. Shearing Ca-caseinate without Tgase yielded a slightly anisotropic layered structure. Both cross-linking {{in the absence of}} shear and cross-linking during mixing resulted in gels without alignment. The formation of shear- and enzyme-induced anisotropic structures was explained by aligning of protein aggregates due to shear and concurrent solidification of the aligned protein aggregates...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of added CaCl 2 on (i) the adsorption behaviour of caseinate and whey protein concentrate (WPC) at the oil-water interfaces and (ii) the stability of emulsions formed with caseinate or WPC. The relationship between aggregation state of protein, due to Ca 2 + binding, and emulsifying properties is discussed. The effects of addition of NaCl to the emulsions containing various concentrations of CaCl 2 were also explored. Protein solutions and 30 % soya oil, at pH 7. 0, were mixed and homogenized at 207 / 34 bar and 55 °C to form emulsions. CaCl 2 was added to protein solutions prior to emulsion formation or to the emulsions after they were made. The average particle size (d 32 or d 43), the surface protein concentration, the composition of protein adsorbed layer at the interface and the creaming stability of emulsions were determined. The microstructure of emulsions was observed using the confocal laser microscopy. The droplet sizes of emulsions made with sodium caseinate or WPC were similar and were independent of the protein concentration at concentration above 0. 5 %. The surface protein concentration of emulsions made with sodium caseinate, WPC or <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> generally increased with increase in the protein concentration, although the trends were different. The emulsions made with <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> had higher (d 32 and surface protein concentration than that of sodium caseinate or WPC. In emulsions made with sodium caseinate at low protein concentrations, the adsorption of β-casein occurred in preference to αs -casein, whereas αs- (αs 1 - + αs 2 -) casein was found to adsorb in preference to β-casein at high protein concentrations. In <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> emulsions, the αs -casein was adsorbed in preference to β-casein at all concentrations. In emulsions made with WPC, β-lactoglobulin adsorbed slightly in preference to α-lactalbumin. In emulsions made with mixtures of sodium caseinate and WPC (1 : 1), the adsorption of whey proteins occurred in preference to caseins at low concentrations (< 3 %), whereas caseins were adsorbed in preference to whey protein at high concentrations. In emulsions made with <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> or WPC, the creaming stability of emulsions followed mainly the changes in particle size of emulsions. However, the creaming stability of emulsions made with sodium caseinate decreased markedly as the caseinate concentrations were increased above 2. 0 %. This was attributed to depletion flocculation occurring in these emulsions. Whey proteins did not retard this instability, due to depletion flocculation, in emulsions made with mixtures of caseinate and WPC When CaCl 2 was added prior to or after emulsion formation, the (d 43 and surface protein concentration increased with increasing CaCl 2 concentration in emulsions made with 0. 5 and 3. 0 % sodium caseinate. The adsorption of αs -casein increased with increase in the concentration of CaCl 2, with a corresponding decrease in the adsorption of β-casein. The creaming stability of emulsions made with 0. 5 % caseinate decreased with increasing CaCl 2 concentration. However, the creaming stability increased with CaCl 2 concentration in 3. 0 % caseinate emulsion. The destabilising effects of CaCl 2 in emulsions made with sodium caseinate were reduced by the addition of 200 mM NaCl. Addition of CaCl 2 to protein solutions prior to emulsion formation increased the d 43 and surface protein concentration in emulsions made with 0. 5 or 3. 0 % WPC. In this case, the adsorption of β-lactoglobulin occurred slightly in preference to α-lactalbumin. The creaming stability of emulsions decreased with increase in the concentration of CaCl 2. The addition of CaCl 2 to emulsions after emulsion formation also resulted in increases in and surface protein concentration of emulsions made with 0. 5 % WPC and formation of gel-like network structure at high CaCl 2 concentrations. However, the stability of emulsion made with 3. 0 % WPC was not affected by the addition of CaCl 2. Different aggregation mechanisms are involved depending upon whether Ca 2 + is added to protein solution before emulsification or to the emulsion after its formation. Addition of Ca 2 + to protein solution may lead to decrease in emulsifying capacity and subsequently result in protein bridging flocculation between emulsion droplets. Ca 2 + bridging flocculation between emulsion droplets may be formed in emulsions that have Ca 2 + added. The change in aggregation state of caseinate due to Ca 2 + binding could retard the instability of emulsion due to depletion flocculation. The protein unfolding at the surface of emulsions made with low whey protein concentrations may promote the protein-Ca-protein bridges forming between protein-coated emulsion droplets, consequently forming gel-like network structure in emulsions...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{discussion was}} given {{of the extensive}} literature {{on the nature of}} the complex of <b>calcium</b> <b>caseinate</b> phosphate. A series of different experiments were performed to elucidate this complicated problem. It was inferred that calcium bound to casein must be considered separate from the calcium bound to inorganic phosphate. Casein-bound calcium was thought to be linked to the ester phosphate groups of the casein molecule. This contradicted the often assumed structure of double salts, and the author supposed the inorganic phosphate and the remaining calcium to be separately and individually linked to various reactive sites on the casein molecule, mostly amino and carboxyl groups. The relation Ca/P of the adsorbed ions was found to be about 1. 5. On heating milk, according to the author tricalcium phosphate was precipitated from the serum, and subsequently calcium and phosphate were replenished from the caseinate complex. This could go on until all was present in the form of tricalcium phosphate. This could be re-adsorbed as such onto the caseinate complex. <p/...|$|E

Furthermore, on addition of methylcellulose to the irradiated protein matrix it was found that it has potential in enhancing the puncture strength and has no detrimental effect on water vapor permeability of protein based films. Finally, these film formulations were used as bioactive edible coatings containing natural antimicrobial agents (limonene and peppermint) to preserve the shelf life of fresh strawberries during storage. The bioactive coatings containing peppermint was found to be more efficient as preserving coatings than the formulations containing limonene.
