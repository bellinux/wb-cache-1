5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, a guarded {{carriage}} carrying Prince Charming (Joshua Dallas) and his fiancee, Abigail (Anastasia Griffith), is halted by a roadblock. Charming {{notices a}} fallen tree is blocking the road, {{and that it}} was cut on purpose. The carriage is ambushed by a hooded vagabond, who takes Charming's bag of valuables, including a wedding ring. Charming pursues and knocks the mysterious thief off their horse. He discovers it is a woman, Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin). Before he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> answer as to why she stole his bag, Snow hits him with a rock, surprising and cutting him to make her escape. Charming vows that he will find her.|$|E
5|$|NextWorth {{purchases}} used {{electronics and}} resells about 80-85 percent of them, while the remainder {{are sent to}} a network of partners for recycling. Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth. The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3-15 days depending on the payment method. If NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than the seller expected, they <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.|$|E

In confirmation, children receive another given name, but it is not used. Both baptismal and confirmation names have religious significance only, and they are not on any official records.|$|E

25|$|Iron overload: People with {{thalassemia}} <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> overload of iron {{in their}} bodies, {{either from the}} disease itself or from frequent blood transfusions. Too much iron can result in damage to the heart, liver, and endocrine system, which includes glands that produce hormones that regulate processes throughout the body. The damage is characterized by excessive deposits of iron. Without adequate iron chelation therapy, almost all patients with beta-thalassemia accumulate potentially fatal iron levels.|$|E
25|$|By reading Bradstreet's {{works and}} {{recognizing}} her intended audience, one <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> {{idea of how}} life was for Puritan women. According to U.S. History.org Puritan women were required to attend worship services, yet they could not to speak or offer prayer. Women were also not allowed to attend town meetings or {{be involved in the}} decisions that were discussed. If Puritan women were to be seen and not heard in public, then one can say that most of their works are not meant for public consumption.|$|E
25|$|During {{the past}} week people were taken {{from their homes and}} arrested by police, and people have been shot at. We need {{to ensure the safety of}} these people, and need to help stop police action against the people of Marikana. The work is enormous. Some people still need medical attention, and we also need to look at the living {{conditions}} of workers and the community at large. Then there is the problem of the unemployment of women and the high rate of illiteracy here. We need to help realise programmes to ensure people <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> income, that they can enjoy a reasonable standard of living.|$|E

25|$|Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said:To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly {{stood for}} “theft and extortion,” {{and he was}} right, {{distinctly}} right, indisputably right. He manifestly thinks that when it got scaled away down to a mere “one-third” a little thing like that was some other than “theft and extortion.” Why, only the board knows! I will try to explain this difficult problem so that the board <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> idea of it. If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the same.|$|E
25|$|The {{motorcycles}} {{are divided}} in three categories. Anyone born before 1985 may drive a moped. Persons born in 1985 or after may obtain a moped driver's licence {{at the age}} of 15. This requires training in a driving school or by your relative. After that there's a theoretical test and short handling test. The A1 licence, allowing the use of light motorbikes, may be obtained {{at the age of}} 16. The practical training is done independently in traffic after a training permit has been obtained from the police. Theoretical training includes 12 theory lessons. A person who has A1 licence <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> A2 after holding the A1 for two years by completing an additional training course in a driving school. After two years of A2 licence, it can be turned into full A licence with extra training in a driving school. After the age of 24, a person can obtain the A licence directly, without holding an A1 licence first.|$|E

There is one civilian woman on the island, nicknamed [...] "Bloody Mary", a sassy middle-aged Tonkinese vendor of grass skirts, who engages the sailors in sarcastic, flirtatious banter {{as she tries to}} sell them her wares ("Bloody Mary"). Billis yearns to visit the nearby island of Bali Ha'i – which is off-limits to all but officers – supposedly to witness a Boar's Tooth Ceremony (at which he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> unusual native artifact); the other sailors josh him, saying that his real motivation is to see the young French women there. Billis and the sailors further lament their lack of feminine companionship ("There Is Nothing Like a Dame").|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the results}} are graded [...] "on the curve" [...] {{but at the same}} time a cutoff score for each grade is also used. Obtaining an A is very difficult, {{especially}} for languages in the past system, where only about 1.5–3% of students received A's. On average, only the top 3–4% in each subject <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> A. The cutoff scores vary greatly from subject to subject and from year to year. To give a clearer picture, for Chinese, A-grades are sometimes given for candidates having scored 70 or above, while for Mathematics, an A invariably translates to a score in excess of 90. The cutoff scores are not released by the HKEAA publicly; the information is only available to teachers.|$|E

30|$|From {{the above}} {{we can see}} that if we add a Randić weight to every edge in a simple graph G, then we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> Randić matrix R(G).

Let M be a mixed graph and H(M) be its Hermitian-adjacency matrix. If we add a Randić weight to every edge and arc in M, then we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> new weighted Hermitian-adjacency matrix. What are the properties of this new matrix? Motivated by this, we define the Hermitian-Randić matrix of a mixed graph M.|$|R
