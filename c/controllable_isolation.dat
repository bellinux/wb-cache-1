The influence of the different factors on {{the properties of the}} forming complexes has been studied systematically. The obtained data have been compared with the theoretical prognoses and publication data for the system linear polymetacrylic acid - polyethylenglycol. For the first time, experimentally detected for the present system {{has been the}} second conformation transition - decollapse, the explanation of this phenomenon has been given. First, the system gel of the polymetacrylic acid - unionogenous surface-active substance on the base of the polyethylenglycol has been studied; the role of the hydrophobic interactions with the complex-formation has been cleared. The peculiarities of the complex-formation shall allow to effectively modify the hydrogeles properties, to receive the materials with the preset properties, the membranes with the selective permeability, the materials for the <b>controllable</b> <b>isolation</b> of the medicinal substancesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{dual-mode}} dual-band {{bandpass filter}} with <b>controllable</b> in-between <b>isolation</b> is presented using a single microstrip ring resonator. By installing two dispersion-controlled coupled-line sections {{on the ring}} resonator at the two ports with 90 q-separation, two transmission poles can be easily emerged and distributed in each passband. Meanwhile, two transmission zeros are generated between the two passbands, {{which can be used}} to control the rejection level of the in-between isolation. Instead of perturbing the gap distance between one of the open ends of the coupled-line section and the ring, a pair of open-circuited stubs is further installed along the symmetrical plane of the ring resonator, which can effectively enlarge the tuning range of the two transmission zeros. A prototype dual-band filter is finally designed, fabricated, and verified through the experiment. Index Terms — Bandpass filters, dual-band, dual-mode, isolation, ring resonators...|$|R

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to reduce harmonics generated by a three-phase diode rectifier. The proposed approach uses the input filters, six <b>controllable</b> switches, high-frequency <b>isolation</b> transformer, and the three-phase diode rectifier. The switching of the controllable switches is modulated by a novel pulse-width modulation (PWM) implemented in an XC 4006 field programmable gate array (FPGA). This approach realizes sinusoidal input current waveforms with low electromagnetic interference and arbitrary output voltage. The output voltage can be controlled by variation of the modulation index in the range (0 â�¤ M â�¤ 0. 98). The experimental results to compare performance between with and without the proposed approach are carried out to confirm its feasibility...|$|R
40|$|Com a publicação e vigência da norma brasileira de desempenho NBR 15575 : 2013 amplia-se a necessidade de pesquisas que avaliem os fatores {{influentes}} sobre o desempenho dos materiais em função do local em que são empregados, principalmente no caso de materiais cimentícios, uma vez que, além de serem altamente utilizados no país, são severamente danificados por condições de umidade, radiações solares e variações de temperatura. Sendo assim, frente à exposição e função da argamassa de rejuntamento em sistemas de revestimento aderido, o material de preenchimento requer maior atenção principalmente porque o seu desempenho de forma isolada afeta no desempenho do sistema como um todo, seja do ponto de vista estético, de estanqueidade à água ou de segurança ao uso. Dessa forma, objetivando avaliar a influência do intemperismo sobre o desempenho de argamassas de rejuntamento à base de cimento Portland, essa pesquisa desenvolveu um plano experimental com 4 variáveis de influência, quais sejam: fabricante da argamassa (três níveis), cor da argamassa (branco, cinza e preto), tratamento superficial (sem tratamento, dois produtos hidrofugantes de bases diferentes) e tipo de exposição (referência, natural e artificial). A exposição ao intemperismo natural ocorreu na cidade de Porto Alegre durante 252 dias e a exposição artificial foi realizada em simulador ambiental do tipo radiação UVA e umidade por condensação durante 140 dias. Os resultados apontam para degradação física das argamassas do ponto de vista de alteração de cor e aumento da absorção de água das argamassas após intemperismo. A aplicação de produtos de proteção altera a cor das argamassas, sendo que o tratamento à base de metil siliconato de potássio causa manchas desuniformes em argamassas escuras e não apresentou melhorias quanto à absorção de água das argamassas de rejuntamento. O ensaio em câmara de intemperismo não foi capaz de reproduzir as degradações alcançadas no ambiente de Porto Alegre para as argamassas pretas. Por fim, todos fatores controláveis de forma isolada têm efeito significativo sobre as características cor, absorção de água e abrasão. Dessa forma, não é possível eleger uma argamassa que atenda de forma satisfatória a todas as propriedades avaliadas, demonstrando a ausência de requisitos em norma. Since the Brazilian {{performance standard}} NBR 15575 : 2013 was published and entered into effect, {{the need for}} research that assesses {{the factors that influence}} the performance of materials {{as a function of the}} location where they are employed, has grown, especially in the case of cimenticious materials, given that these are not only frequently employed in the country, but also severely damaged by moisture, solar radiation and temperature variations. Because of the exposure and function of tile grout in coating systems, the filling material requires greater attention, mainly because its isolated performance affects the performance of the system as a whole from an aesthetic, water proofing or safety perspective. This research was therefore developed to evaluate the influence of weathering on the performance of grouts based on Portland cement using an experimental plan with 4 variables of influence, namely: the manufacturer of the grout (three levels), the color of the grout (white, gray and black), the surface treatment (without treatment, two water-repellent products with different bases) and type of exposure (reference, artificial and natural). The natural exposure to weather occurred in the city of Porto Alegre for 252 days and the artificial exposure was performed in an UVA radiation and moisture condensation environmental simulator for 140 days. The results point to the physical degradation of the grout regarding the change of color and an increase in water absorption of the grout after weathering. The application of protection products changes the color of the grouts, with the treatment based on Potassium Methyl Siliconate causing uneven staining in dark grouts without presenting improvements regarding the water absorption of the tile grout. The test in the weathering chamber wasn't able to reproduce the degradation reached in the environment of Porto Alegre for the black grouts. Finally, all <b>controllable</b> factors in <b>isolation</b> had a significant effect on the Color, Water Absorption and Abrasion characteristics. It's therefore not possible to point to a mortar that meets all assessed properties in a satisfactory manner, demonstrating the non-compliance with the requirements in the standard...|$|R
