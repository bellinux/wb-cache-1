The material attributes, the process parameters (CPP), and the critical quality attributes of the FSMs were identified. Box–Behnken experimental design was applied to develop space design and determine the control space of FSMs that have maximum solubility, maximum dissolution, and ability to inhibit felodipine crystallization from supersaturated solution. Material attributes and CPP studied were the amount of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC; X 1), amount of polymeric surfactants Inutec®SP 1 (X 2), amount of Pluronic®F- 127 (X 3) and preparation techniques, physical mixture (PM) or solvent evaporation (SE; X 4). There is no proposed design space formed if the Pluronic® content was below 45. 1  mg and if PM is used as the preparation technique. The operating ranges, for robust development of FSM of desired quality, of Pluronic®, Inutec®SP 1, HPMC, and preparation technique, are 49 – 50, 16 – 23, 83 – 100  mg, and SE, respectively. The calculated value of f 2 was 56. 85, indicating that the release profile of the <b>controlled-release</b> (CR) <b>tablet</b> (CR- 6) containing the optimized in situ-formed FSM was similar to that of the target release profile.

40|$|The {{wide variety}} of excipients {{available}} calls for evaluation of their functionality, in this case of the pharmaceutical performance of microcrystalline celluloses and sodium cross-linked carboxymethylcelluloses from different sources. This evaluation includes parameters such as powder flow, compactibility, ejection pressure and dissolution from fast-release tablets {{as well as from}} floating granules and <b>controlled-release</b> <b>tablets.</b> In a previous study, the excipient Carmacel® presented better disintegration properties compared to Croscarmellose®. However, the evaluation showed better compactibility performance for Croscarmellose®. These characteristics were observed using pure excipients. Nevertheless, these advantages have not been confirmed in tests employing immediate-release or modified-release formulations containing metronidazole. Regarding microcrystalline celluloses, the present comparative evaluation between pure Alfacel ® types 101 and 102 and pure Avicel® types 101 and 102 showed better compactibility performance for the latter. However, for metronidazole formulations, this advantage was not evident in the innovative excipient. Notwithstanding, this study revealed better compactibility performance of microcrystalline cellulose type 101. In terms of powder flow properties, Avicel® and Alfacel® showed similar performance. However, the results revealed better powder flow employing microcrystalline cellulose type 102 for both excipients. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that the employment of innovative and generic excipients have both advantages and disadvantages. The observed differences however, tend to disappear as the excipients are diluted in a formulation, thereby equalizing their influence on product performance...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the systemic bioavailability {{of a new}} controlled release cyclobenzaprine tablet, {{and the influence of}} a high fat meal on its bioavailabillty. Subjects, materials and methods: 24 and 12 healthy male subjects were recruited for the bioavailability and influence of diet studies, respectively. Experimental design for both studies was an open randomized, 2 -period, single dose, crossover study. In the bioavailability study, each subject received in different occasions, a single oral dose of cyclobenzaprine of immediate (10 mg) or controlled release (20 mg) tablet, followed by a 2 -week washout period. In the influence of diet study, the volunteers received the <b>controlled-release</b> <b>tablet</b> concomitantly with a high fat meal or in a state of fasting. Results: In the bioavailability study, plasma cyclobenzaprine profiles were in agreement with a controlled release system. This formulation presented a 92. 8 % of relative bioavailability (IC 85. 5 - 105 %) and a significant reduction in C-max (IC 58 - 65. 5 %), when compared with equal dose of the immediate release tablet. The presence of food increased AUC (11. 6 %) and C-max (48 %). For both parameters the calculated 90 % confidence interval was not in the bioequivalence interval, 97. 4 - 125. 8 % for AUC and 111. 7 - 184. 2 % for C-max. Conclusions: The controlled release tablet showed a relative bioavailability comparable with equal dose of the immediate release product and produced a significantly lower C-max, as expected in a controlled release formulation.

Material and Methods. Three sets of matrix tablets differing in the drug-to-filler ratio (1 : 1, 2 : 1, and 4 : 1) and polymer amount with diltiazem hydrochloride (freely soluble) or caffeine (sparingly soluble) were prepared. Samples were evaluated by the dissolution test at pH 6. 8 corresponding to {{the upper part of}} the small intestine; the selected samples were tested at a changing pH level to better simulate in vivo conditions. Results. The prepared matrix tablets fulfilled all the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia. Tablets with Eudragit® NM showed excellent mechanical characteristics. In vitro studies showed that the set 1 : 1 was the most suitable for the sustained release of a freely soluble drug concerning the burst effect and the total drug amount released within 12 hours. The significant effect of the drug-to-filler ratio and polymer amount on the dissolution profile was confirmed by similarity factor analysis. A faster drug release was observed during the dissolution test within changing pH levels because of the pH-dependent solubility of diltiazem. A prolonged release of the sparingly soluble drug was not achieved, and a trend for fast disintegration was observed. Conclusions. The combination of Eudragit®NM with microcrystalline cellulose as an insoluble filler seems to be suitable only for freely soluble drugs, when the amount of the drug and the filler is similar...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{has examined the}} use of zein proteins from maize as the major component in oral <b>controlled-release</b> <b>tablets,</b> such formulations often being required to improve patient compliance. Tablets containing ground zein proteins, calcium hydrogen orthophosphate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, theophylline and magnesium stearate were produced by wet granulation and compression on a single station tablet press and were compared to directly compressed tablets based on zein proteins, calcium hydrogen orthophosphate and theophylline. Non invasive techniques such as Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Raman spectroscopy were employed to investigate any changes in the secondary structure of zein proteins during tablet production. Random coils, a helices and ß sheets predominated and their relative content remained unaffected during grinding, wet granulation and compression, indicating that formulations based on zeins will be robust, i. e. insensitive to minor changes in the production conditions. Drug release from the tablets was studied using a standard pharmacopoeial dissolution test. Dissolution profiles in water, 0. 1 M HCl (pH = 1) and phosphate buffer (pH = 6. 8) show that only {{a limited amount of}} theophylline was released after 4. 5 h, suggesting that zein proteins could act as a potential vehicle for oral controlled drug release. Analysis of the theophylline release profiles using the Peppas and Sahlin model reveals that diffusion and polymer relaxation occurred in acidic (pH = 1) and buffered (pH = 6. 8) conditions for wet granulated tablets, whereas diffusion was predominant in directly compressed tablets. In conclusion, the present study has shown that zeins can be successfully used as a pharmaceutical excipient, and in particular as a matrix in monolithic controlled release tablets...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cefadroxil is a first-generation {{cephalosporin}} and is {{very effective}} against Gram positive and Gram negative infections. Cefadroxil is an antibiotic agent which has high absorption in {{the upper part of}} the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Conventional Cefadroxil tablets produce rapid and relatively high peak blood level and require frequent administration to keep the plasma drug level at an effective range. The present study was carried out with an objective of preparation and in vivo evaluation of floating tablets of using Cefadroxil as a model drug using Eudragit polymers to improve oral bioavailability of Cefadroxil floating tablets by increasing gastric residence time. Methodology: Floating <b>controlled-release</b> cefadroxil <b>tablets</b> were prepared by direct compression method. Tablets were formulated using Eudragit polymers (Eudragit-RLPO & Eudragit-RSPO), with Sodium alginate (SA) and Carbomer (CP) as release-retarding polymers, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) as the effervescent agent. Floating behavior, in vitro drug release, and swelling index studies were conducted. Initial and total drug release duration was compared with a commercial tablet in 0. 1 N HCl (pH 1. 2) at 37 ± 0. 5 °C for 24 hours. Tablets were then evaluated for various physical parameters, including weight variation, thickness, hardness, friability, and drug content etc. Consequently, 6 months of physical stability studies and in vitro-in vivo gastro-retentive studies were conducted. Results and Discussion: The result of in vitro dissolution study showed that the drug release profile could be controlled by increasing the concentration of Eudragit-RLPO. The optimized formulation (F 20) containing Eudragit-RLPO showed 99. 17 % drug release at the end of 24 h. Changing the viscosity grade of Eudragit-RLPO had no significant effect on drug release profile. The optimized formulations (F 20) containing sodium bicarbonate 40 mg per tablet showed desired buoyancy (floating lag time of about 20 min and total floating time of > 24 h). Optimized formulation (F 20) followed diffusion controlled zero order kinetics and fickian transport of the drug. FTIR and DSC studies revealed the absence of any chemical interaction between drug and polymers used. The best formulation (F 20) was selected based on in vitro characteristics and was used in vivo radiographic studies by incorporating BaSO 4. These studies revealed that the tablets remained in the stomach for 24 h in fasting human volunteers and indicated that gastric retention time was increased by the floating principle, which was considered desirable for the absorption window drugs. Studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics in vivo showed better bioavailability, area under the concentration time curve, elimination rate constant and half-life than marketed product. Conclusion: In conclusion, in order to suggest a better drug delivery system with constant favorable release, resulting in optimized absorption and less side effects, formulated Eudragit based cefadroxil floating <b>controlled-release</b> <b>tablets</b> can be a promising improves candidate therapy.

In addition, this study analyzes and discusses the negative factors that currently affect the clinical application of morphine. Patients and methods: A questionnaire survey {{was given to}} {{a random sample of}} 150 oncologists from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. The statistical results were analyzed and processed using SPSS version 21. 0 and Matlab version 2012 a statistical software. Single-factor analysis of variance, Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test, and independent samples t-test were adopted to analyze the difference in knowledge scores of morphine usage. The study also identified major impediment factors on clinical use of morphine. Results: Among the 127 respondents, morphine <b>controlled-release</b> <b>tablets</b> were the most popular drug chosen to treat severe cancer pain (76 respondents, 35. 8 %). Participants who reported having received training in cancer pain management and drug use demonstrated a significantly higher mean score of basic knowledge compared with their untrained peers (11. 51 ± 2. 60 versus 9. 28 ± 3. 68, t= 2. 48, P= 0. 022). The top four barriers to widespread clinical use of morphine for cancer pain were 1) insufficient analgesia administration training for medical personnel, 2) poor patient compliance, 3) drug side effects, and 4) concerns surrounding drug addiction. Conclusion: The oncologists in the People&# 39;s Republic of China simultaneously lack comprehensive knowledge and harbor misconceptions with regard to cancer pain treatment and morphine&# 39;s clinical application. Creating professional training initiatives for oncologists is necessary to enhance their awareness and expertise in morphine use for cancer pain treatment.

Drug release kinetics of CR tablet formulations F 1, F 2, and F 3, each one suitably compressed for 9 -, 12 -, and 15 -kg hardness, were determined in a dissolution media of 0. 1  N HCl (pH  1. 5) and phosphate buffer (pH  6. 8) using type II dissolution apparatus with paddles run at 50  rpm. Ethocel® {{was found to}} be distinctly controlling drug release, whereas the hardness of tablets and pH of the dissolution media did not significantly affect release kinetics. The CR test tablets containing 30 % Methocel® and 60 % Ethocel® (F 3) with 12 -kg hardness exhibited pH-independent zero-order release kinetics for 24  h. In vivo performance of the CR test tablet and conventional reference tablet were determined in rabbit serum using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detector. Bioavailability parameters including Cmax, Tmax, and AUC 0 – 48  h of both tablets were compared. The CR test tablets produced optimized Cmax and extended Tmax (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). A good correlation of drug absorption in vivo and drug release in vitro (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 9082) was observed. Relative bioavailability of the test tablet was calculated as 94 %.

This study was designed to develop a <b>controlled-release</b> floating matrix <b>tablet</b> and floating raft system of Mebeverine HCl (MbH) and evaluate different excipients for their floating behavior and in vitro controlled-release profiles. Oral pharmacokinetics of the optimum matrix tablet, raft system formula, and marketed Duspatalin® 200 mg retard as reference were studied in beagle dogs. The optimized tablet formula (FT- 10) and raft system formula (FRS- 11) were found to float within 34 ± 5 sec and 15 ± 7 sec, respectively, and both remain buoyant over a period of 12 h in simulated gastric fluid. FT- 10 (Compritol/HPMC K, 100 M 1 : 1) showed the slowest drug release among all prepared tablet formulations, releasing about 80. 2 % of MbH over 8 h. In contrast, FRS- 11 (Sodium alginate 3 %/HPMC K, 100 M 1 %/Precirol 2 %) had the greatest retardation, providing sustained release of 82. 1 % within 8 h. Compared with the marketed MbH product, the Cmax of FT- 10 was almost the same, while FRS- 11 maximum concentration was higher. The tmax was 3. 33, 2. 167, and 3. 0 h for marketed MbH product, FT- 10, and FRS- 11, respectively. In addition, the oral bioavailability experiment showed that the relative bioavailability of the MbH was 104. 76 and 116. 01 % after oral administration of FT- 10 and FRS- 11, respectively, compared to marketed product. These results demonstrated that both <b>controlled-released</b> floating matrix <b>tablet</b> and raft system would be promising gastroretentive delivery systems for prolonging drug action.

Release profiles to achieve desired plasma concentration versus time curves were established by using simulation software and reported pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) 100, 000 mPa·s was used as a release modifier because the polymer was found to be resistant to changes in conditions of the release study, including rotation speed of paddle and ion strength. The burst release of the drug from the CR tablets could be suppressed by applying an additional HPMC layer as a physical barrier. Finally, the oxycodone once-a-day tablet was comprised of two layers, an inert HPMC layer and a CR layer containing drug and HPMC. Commercial products, either 10 mg bis in die (bid [twice a day]) or once-a-day CR tablets (20 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers, and calculated pharmacokinetic parameters indicated bioequivalence of the two different treatments. The findings of the present study emphasize the potential of oxycodone once-a-day CR tablets for improved patient compliance, safety, and efficacy, which could help researchers to develop new CR dosage forms of oxycodone.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} of the study: Verapamil {{hydrochloride}} is a calcium channel blocker which {{is used in the}} control of supraventricular arrhythmia, hypertension and myocardial infraction. There are considerable inter-individual variations in serum concencentration of verpamil due to variation in the extent of hepatic metabolism. In this study <b>controlled-release</b> buccoadhesive <b>tablets</b> of verapamil hydrochloride (VPH) were prepared in order to achieve constant plasma concentrations, to improve the bioavailability by the avoidance of hepatic first-pass metabolism, and to prevent frequent administration. Materials and methods: Tablets containing fixed amount of VPH were prepared by direct compression method using polymers like carbomer (CP), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) in various combination and ratios and evaluated for thickness, weight variation, hardness, drug content uniformity, swelling, mucoadhesive strength, drug release and possible interaction between ingredients. Results: All tablets were acceptable with regard to thickness, weight variation, hardness, and drug content. The maximum bioadhesive strength was observed in tablets formulated with a combination of CP-NaCMC followed by CP-HPMC and NaCMC-HPMC. &nbsp; Decreasing the content of CP in CP-HPMC tablets or NaCMC in CP-NaCMC or NaCMC-HPMC systems resulted in decrease in detachment forces. Lower release rates were observed by lowering the content of CP in CP-HPMC containing formulations or NaCMC in tablets which contained CP-NaCMC or NaCMC-HPMC. The release behavior was non-Fickian controlled by a combination of diffusion and chain relaxation mechanisms and best fitted zero-order kinetics. Conclusion: The buccoadhesive VPH tablets containing 53 % CP and 13. 3 % HPMC showed suitable release kinetics (n = 0. 78, K 0 zero order release = 4. 11 mg/h, MDT = 5. 66 h) and adhesive properties and did not show any interaction between polymers and drug based on DCS scanning.

40|$|Objective: Schizophrenia is {{a chronic}} disease, which may induce a {{progressive}} functional, cognitive and social impairment {{if it is}} not adequately treated: therefore it requires long-term treatment with efficacious, tolerable and safe drugs. Lack of adherence to treatment is the cause of at least half of relapses, and this should be taken into account in their prevention. Paliperidone ER is the main active metabolite of risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug. Paliperidone is similar to risperidone in binding to specific receptors and antagonism to serotonin and dopamine. Paliperidone ER is available as <b>controlled-release</b> <b>tablets</b> based on an osmotic system, allowing controlled release of the drug within 24 hours and it does not require an initial dose titration. After oral administration, drug bioavailability is 28 %; maximal plasma concentrations are attained after about 24 hours and steady state after 4 - 5 days. Renal excretion is the major route of elimination, with 59 % of the dose excreted unchanged in urine. CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 3 A 4 isoenzymes have a limited role in paliperidone metabolism. Its terminal half-life is about 23 hours. Methods: The aim of this work was to carry out a review of international literature on paliperidone, in order to evaluate its clinical efficacy and effects on psychosocial parameters, as well as tolerability and safety. Results: The efficacy of paliperidone in acute patients has been evaluated in 3 double-blind randomized studies, lasting 6 weeks (Table I). All studies demonstrated a significant improvement of mean PANSS scores and of PANSS Marder factor scores versus placebo. All doses (3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 mg) used in these studies were effective, even though 3 mg dose was the least effective; the results suggest that the best starting dose of paliperidone ER in the treatment of schizophrenia is 6 mg/day. The efficacy of paliperidone ER in the prevention of relapses has been evaluated in 3 long-term studies (Table II), lasting 52 weeks: in all studies paliperidone ER was superior to placebo in preventing relapse after stabilization of the disease. In patients with recent exacerbation of schizophrenia requiring hospital admission, paliperidone ER caused a more rapid and greater improvement of symptoms with respect to quetiapine IR. The effects of paliperidone ER on psychosocial parameters, such as quality of life and social functioning, were also studied extensively: the analysis of the data of three randomized controlled studies lasting 6 weeks, carried out on 1306 patients with acute schizophrenia (Table V), demonstrated that all subjects treated with paliperidone, at any dosage (ranging from 3 to 15 mg/day), obtained a significant improvement of PSP (Personal and Social Performance Scale) score with respect to placebo (p < 0. 001). Paliperidone decreased consistently the risk of worsening of social functioning with respect to placebo also in studies evaluating its long-term effects (until 52 weeks). Several works showed the positive effect of paliperidone ER on social functioning in populations with specific features, such as patients with prevalent mood disorders, with recent onset of the disease, or previously treated with other antipsychotics, such as risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine and aripiprazole: the switch to paliperidone ER induced a significant increase in PSP score. Extrapiramidal symptoms (EPS) induced by paliperidone are similar to those caused by risperidone, with a low frequency of EPS at doses lower that 3 - 6 mg/day and a progressive increase of the EPS risk at greater dosage. However, data deriving from switch studies suggest that paliperidone causes an improvement of EPS induced by previous treatments with second-generation antipsychotics. The more frequent metabolic effect of paliperidone is weight gain, which seems to be dose-correlated and quite mild in the therapeutic range of dosage (3 - 12 mg/day), consistently lower than that induced by quetiapine and olanzapine. There are no significant changes in glucose and lipid profile during treatment with paliperidone. Among endocrine effects, paliperidone is similar to risperidone in inducing hyperprolactinemia. However, the rate of adverse effects on sexual function is relatively low and, most of all, these events do not seem to induce the patients to stop treatment. Conclusions: In conclusion, clinical studies demonstrated that paliperidone ER is effective in inducing clinical remission and preventing relapses in patients with schizophrenia, as well as in improving social functioning both at short- and long-term. Moreover, the favorable safety/tolerability profile of the drug may improve the adherence to therapy, which currently represents one of the main issues in long-term treatment of schizophrenia...|$|R

K., Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan Objective: Selective {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitors {{are commonly}} used in the pharmacotherapy of depression. However, adverse events can lead to their early discontinuation. This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of paroxetine <b>controlled-release</b> (CR) <b>tablets</b> in Japanese patients with depression/depressive state (hereafter referred to as depression) in routine clinical practice in Japan. Patients and methods: This was an open-label, noninterventional, prospective, postmarketing surveillance study. A total of 3, 213 patients aged 12 – 92 years with depression were prescribed paroxetine CR for 8 weeks at the physician’s discretion. Safety was evaluated {{on the basis of}} the reporting of adverse drug reactions. Effectiveness was evaluated {{on the basis of the}} physician’s assessment using the Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-GI) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-SI) scales, as well as on the basis of the patients’ self-reported satisfaction. The primary effectiveness outcome was the improvement rate based on the physician’s assessment using the CGI-GI. Results: The incidence of adverse drug reactions was 11. 2 % (359 / 3, 213; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 10. 1 %– 12. 3 %). The common adverse drug reactions that accounted for 1. 0 % or more of the incidence were nausea (3. 5 %) and somnolence (2. 7 %). The proportion of patients who continued paroxetine CR at week 8 was 80. 2 % (2, 577 / 3, 213; 95 % CI: 78. 8 %– 81. 6 %). The improvement rate at week 8 (last observation carried forward) was 72. 8 % (2, 132 / 2, 927; 95 % CI: 71. 2 %– 74. 4 %). The proportion of patients with CGI-SI scores of moderately or severely ill decreased from 63. 6 % at baseline to 17. 9 % at week 8. The proportion of patients who were satisfied with paroxetine CR treatment was 69. 8 % (2, 040 / 2, 921; 95 % CI: 68. 1 %– 71. 5 %).

This project aimed to formulate niacin CR pellets made of hydrophobic inert matrix. After niacin was melted with excipients and cooled, the mass was extruded and spheronized into pellets.
