40|$|Biosurfactants have {{potential}} for enhancement of in situ biorestoration. A study {{was performed to}} characterize biosurfactant production by microbes from several subsurface environments contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. Emulsification of hydrocarbons was used to identify microorganisms with the greatest potential to produce biosurfactants. Biostimulated zone microbes contained the greatest proportion of emulsifiers as compared to contaminated and pristine zone microbes. Biostimulation was the dominant factor which selected for and encouraged growth of microbial emulsifiers; exposure to hydrocarbon was also important. The degree of emulsification by biostimulated microbes was greater for the <b>contaminant</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> than for heavier fuels. Emulsification of hydrocarbons {{may be an important}} mechanism in biorestoration by increasing the bioavailability of the contaminant; however, no attempt was made to assess this possibility or relationship. Since biosurfactants are emulsion stabilizers, they merit further attention for enhancement of in situ aquifer restoration...|$|E

Gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) {{is one of the most}} powerful analytical techniques available for characterizing individual molecular compositions of different hydrocarbon fractions (e.g., Moldowan et al. 1985; Brassell et al. 1986; Budzinski et al. 1995; Vékey 2001; Ratnayake et al. 2005; Cortes et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2012; Jiang et al. 2015).

NTs 15  nm sample shows the least hydrophilic surface among the three types of NT diameters, indicating a minor amount of free hydroxyl groups and less surface acidity, contributing to inferior ζ-values in magnitude.|$|R

Results of plasma cleaning experiments on <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminant</b> films showed that the optical properties of mirrors and gratings could be satisfactorily restored. Results on fused silica optical flats were inconclusive because of the insensitivity of measurement techniques to the contaminant films.

Animals are rarely considered for bioremediation initiatives owing to ethical or human health concerns. Nonetheless, specific examples in the literature reveal that some animal species are effective remediators of heavy metals, microbial <b>contaminants,</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> nutrients and persistent organic pollutants, particularly in an aquatic environment.

40|$|There {{has been}} a concerted effort {{over the last few}} years in Alberta to {{increase}} our level of understanding of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) technology as an oxidation remediation technique for hydrocarbon-contaminated sites. H 2 O 2 (and Fenton’s reagent- a mixture of H 2 O 2 and iron salts) oxidizes <b>contaminant</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> and it degrades and releases oxygen and bio-stimulates the subsoils leading to a faster aerobic degradation. This paper gives an overview of the H 2 O 2 technology and describes a successful field application that has subsequently led to a number of research projects at the University of Calgary. The field application proved economical and was successful in a restricted access situation (Mahmoud et al, 2000, 2003). Two research projects have been conducted since the completion of the field application. The first focused on examining the potential of H 2 O 2 in causing volume change in hydrocarbon-contaminated silty sands (Mahmoud et al, 2003; Mohamed at al, 2002).

From 30 hydrocarbon contaminated soil samples, six strains of Pseudomonas spp. were isolated and its ability to produce stable oil water emulsion with different vegetable and petroleum oil was determined. The isolated strains of Pseudomonas sp. were identified by 16 S rRNA sequencing and these were screened for ability to produce high molecular weight bioemulsifier by conventional methods by measuring reduction in surface tension, oil spreading ability and emulsification index.

40|$|Despite {{the overall}} high {{efficacy}} of cyclodextrins {{to accelerate the}} treatment of soil aquifer remediation by in-situ soil flushing, the use in practice remains limited {{because of the high}} costs of cyclodextrin and high concentrations needed to significantly reduce the treatment time. The current study tested the potential of activated carbon to treat washing water originating from soil flushing in order to selectively separate <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminants</b> from washing water containing cyclodextrin and subsequently reuse the cyclodextrin solution for reinfiltration. A high recovery of the cyclodextrin from the washing water would reduce the costs and would make the technique economically feasible for soil remediation. This study aimed to investigate whether cyclodextrin can pass through the activated carbon filter without reducing the cyclodextrin concentration when the contaminated washing water is treated and whether the presence of cyclodextrin negatively affects the purification potential of activated carbon to remove the organic pollutants from the pumped soil water. Lab-scale column experiments showed that with the appropriate activated carbon 100 % of cyclodextrin (randomly-methylated-β-cyclodextrin) can be recovered from the washing water and that the effect on the efficiency of activated carbon to remove the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminants</b> remains limited.
