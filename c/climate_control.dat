5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E

5|$|Toyota Australia {{planned to}} sell 50 to 70 TRD Aurion units per month with the {{majority}} of the sales coming from Australia. However, the project was unsuccessful, and as of 31 March 2009, TRD Australia halted production of the Aurion TRD (and TRD Hilux), and the division was shut down. When available, the range comprised two variants, the 3500S and 3500SL. The former features performance mufflers, 19-inch alloy wheels, red alcantara leather seats with black alcantara fabric bolsters and other high-performance upgrades. The range-topping 3500SL adds clearance and reverse parking sensors, dual-zone <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> air conditioning, a colour-coded transmission selection lever, and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat. Furthermore, the SL gains an aluminium rear bumper reinforcement addition, and is the first production car in the world to use the Eaton twin-vortices supercharger. This substantially reduces engine noise while bringing gains to power and torque.|$|E

25|$|The dashboard's design {{originated}} {{from a large}} number of complaints from customers that the previous Taurus' radio and <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> modules were cluttered with many small and similar feeling buttons, as well as small graphics, which caused the driver to have to look away from the road to be able to operate them properly. As a result, {{a large portion of the}} third generation's dash was devoted to the radio and <b>climate</b> <b>control,</b> with each button on these modules containing a unique design, making it easier for the driver to operate the radio and <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> without taking their eyes off the road. This would eventually lead to the creation of the Integrated Control Panel.|$|E
