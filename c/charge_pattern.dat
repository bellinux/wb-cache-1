Heavy intermittent charging load of EVs will create bottlenecks in supplying capacity and expose power system to severe security risks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent method to control EV charging loads in response to time-of-use (TOU) price in a regulated market. First, an optimized charging model is formulated to minimize the charging cost. Then, a heuristic method is implemented to minimize the charging cost considering {{the relation between the}} acceptable charging power of EV battery and the state of charge (SOC). Finally, the charging cost and energy demand in different time intervals are compared for both typical <b>charging</b> <b>pattern</b> and optimized <b>charging</b> <b>pattern.</b> Results show that the optimized <b>charging</b> <b>pattern</b> has great benefit in reducing cost and flatting the load curve if the peak and valley time periods are partitioned appropriately.

50|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts to capture an energy field around the human body, going {{as far back as}} photographs by a French army officer in the 1890s. Supernatural interpretations of these images have often been the result of a lack of understanding of the simple natural phenomena behind them, such as heat emanating from a human body producing aura-like images under infrared photography.In 1939, Semyon Davidovich Kirlian discovered that by placing an object or body part directly on photographic paper, and then passing a high voltage across the object, he would obtain the image of a glowing contour surrounding the object. This process became known as Kirlian photography. Some parapsychologists, such as Dr. Thelma Moss of UCLA, have proposed that these images show levels of psychic powers and bioenergies. However, studies have found that the Kirlian effect is caused by the presence of moisture on the object being photographed. Electricity produces an area of gas ionization around the object if it is moist, which is the case for living things. This causes an alternation of the electric <b>charge</b> <b>pattern</b> on the film.
