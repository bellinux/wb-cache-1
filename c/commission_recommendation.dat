2500|$|When the Maastricht Treaty {{established}} the European Union under its current name in 1993, the organization started identifying problems of misinterpretations of its name and resolved {{to change it}} to EUCC – The Coastal Union in 2001. During these years the main field of work was the promotion of integrated coastal zone management in Europe, contributing to the EC Demonstration Programme on ICZM [...] (1996-1999). EUCC participated in the UNEP ICZM Conference of 1998 in St Petersburg [...] which recommended a demonstration programme to be launched on ICZM for Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. EUCC took the lead to organise in conjunction with UNEP’s PAP/RAC, the first intergovernmental ICZM meeting (ICMCEENIS), in Croatia in June 2000, bringing together representatives from 18 non EU coastal States and from the Regional Seas Programmes for the Eastern Mediterranean, Baltic, Caspian and Black Seas who expressed support common ICZM initiatives for their regions.
