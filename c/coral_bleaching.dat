5|$|Water {{temperature}} {{changes of}} more than 1–2°C (1.8–3.6°F) or salinity changes can kill some species of coral. Under such environmental stresses, corals expel their Symbiodinium; without them coral tissues reveal the white of their skeletons, an event known as <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching.</b>|$|E
5|$|Increasing sea {{temperatures}} in tropical regions (~1 degree C) {{the last century}} have caused major <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching,</b> death, and therefore shrinking coral populations since although {{they are able to}} adapt and acclimate, it is uncertain if this evolutionary process will happen quickly enough to prevent major reduction of their numbers.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{landslides}} {{and floods}} {{are projected to}} become increasingly common in such states as Assam. Ecological disasters, such as a 1998 <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching</b> event that killed off more than 70% of corals in the reef ecosystems off Lakshadweep and the Andamans and was brought on by elevated ocean temperatures tied to global warming, are also projected to become increasingly common. Meghalaya and other northeastern states are also concerned that rising sea levels will submerge much of Bangladesh and spawn a refugee crisis. If severe climate changes occurs, Bangladesh and parts of India that border it may lose vast tracts of coastal land.|$|E

40|$|When a <b>coral</b> <b>bleaches,</b> the obligate {{symbiosis}} {{between the}} coral polyp and the micro-algal zooxanthellae is disrupted and the zooxanthellae are {{expelled from the}} polyp. Although a <b>bleached</b> <b>coral</b> does not necessarily die, it is more vulnerable to disease, algal overgrowth, bioerosion and eventually mortality. Mass bleaching and mortality events {{in the last decade}} have prompted increased research into zooxanthellae, and it is possible that zooxanthellae population strategies affect a <b>coral’s</b> tolerance to <b>bleaching</b> stress.

5|$|The algae {{benefit from}} {{a safe place to}} live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp, stress on the coral often drives them to eject the algae. Mass ejections are known as <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching,</b> because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the use of}} spearguns and {{dynamite}} {{for fishing}} was banned through efforts of local conservationists in the 1960s, the wildlife is unafraid of snorkelers and divers. <b>Coral</b> <b>bleaching</b> in 1998 has damaged most reefs, but some reefs show healthy recovery (e.g., Silhouette Island).|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} display of marine {{symbiotic}} relationship would be coral. Coral reefs {{are home to}} a variety of dinoflagellate symbiont, these symbionts give coral its bright coloring and are vital for the survival of the reef. The symbionts provide the coral with food in exchange for protection. If the waters warm or become too acidic, the symbionts are expelled, the <b>coral</b> <b>bleaches</b> and if conditions persist the coral will die. This in turn leads to the collapse of the entire reef ecosystem.|$|R

25|$|Increasing acidity has {{possibly}} harmful consequences, such as depressing metabolic {{rates in}} jumbo squid, depressing the immune responses of blue mussels, and <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching.</b> However it may benefit some species, for example increasing {{the growth rate}} of the sea star, Pisaster ochraceus, while shelled plankton species may flourish in altered oceans.|$|E
25|$|Despite these {{protective}} measures, {{the reef}} remains under threat from oceanic pollution {{as well as}} uncontrolled tourism, shipping, and fishing. Other threats include hurricanes, along with global warming and the resulting increase in ocean temperatures, which causes <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching.</b> It is claimed by scientists that over 40% of Belize's coral reef has been damaged since 1998.|$|E
25|$|Gradual {{sea-level rise}} {{also allows for}} coral polyp {{activity}} to raise the atolls with the sea level. However, if the increase in sea level occurs at a rate faster than coral growth, or if polyp activity is damaged by ocean acidification, then the resilience of the atolls and reef islands is less certain. Also, <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching</b> {{has led to the}} death of up to 80% of the coral.|$|E
40|$|Coral {{health and}} {{framework}} development {{was investigated in}} Eleuthera, Cat Island (Bahamas) and Khor Fakkan (Arabian Sea, United Arab Emirates) in 1999. In the Bahamas, coral cover and reef framework development {{was found to be}} better in Eleuthera than in Cat Island. However, <b>coral</b> mortality, <b>bleaching</b> and disease frequency was much higher in Eleuthera than in Cat Island. Repeated small-scale upwelling of water about 2 degrees colder than surface waters was observed on Cat Island and the shelf-edge reefs were covered by this water. It is assumed that in bleaching years, when sea-surface temperatures are elevated and <b>corals</b> <b>bleach,</b> such moderate upwelling can protect the Cat Island <b>corals</b> from <b>bleaching.</b> The <b>coral’s</b> price for this protection is the disadvantage of having to live in a colder environment with ensuing lower calcification and frame building rates. In the Arabian Sea, Shark Island experiences frequent small-scale upwelling events which lead to a temperature stratified water column. Pocillopora frameworks were found to be dead above 5 m but completely alive underneath. The geometry of the reef and the mortality signs allow speculation that this mortality in shallow water was also caused by surface waters heated above <b>bleaching</b> threshold, while <b>corals</b> growing in water deeper than 5 m were protected by cool, upwelled water...|$|R
50|$|Sites on both {{faces of}} these islands were {{surveyed}} using fixed transects {{at the height}} of the bleaching in April 1998. Over 60% of the hard <b>corals</b> <b>bleached.</b> All <b>coral</b> groups except poritids were extensively bleached. Poritids were only slightly affected, with less than 10% of colonies <b>bleaching.</b> <b>Coral</b> death after <b>bleaching</b> led to significant reductions in the cover of all coral groups. Pocilloporids were most severely affected with almost 100% mortality, but even the cover of poritids declined slightly. Bleaching in 1998 reduced average hard coral cover on Frankland Is. fringing reefs from 67% to 37%. Reductions were similar on both the eastern and western reefs. Over 70% of soft corals (primarily Sinularia spp.) also bleached, but these apparently recovered and soft coral cover increased slightly between the 1998 and 1999 surveys. Eastern reefs were also affected by the crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci (COTS) in 1998. Following the losses from bleaching and COTS, a few small pocilloporids recruits were recorded on both sides of the islands in December 2000.|$|R

25|$|The Philippines host one of {{the most}} highly biodiverse regions, with 464 reef-building coral species. Due to overfishing, {{destructive}} fishing techniques, and rapid coastal development, these are in rapid decline. The country has established some 600 MPAs. However, the majority are poorly enforced and are highly ineffective. However, some have positively impacted reef health, increased fish biomass, decreased <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching</b> and increased yields in adjacent fisheries.

25|$|The reefs at Funafuti have {{suffered}} damage, with 80 per {{cent of the}} coral having been bleached {{as a consequence of}} the increase of the ocean temperatures and acidification from increased levels of carbon dioxide. The <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching,</b> which includes staghorn corals, is attributed to the increase in water temperature that occurred during the El Niños that occurred from 1998–2000 and from 2000–2001. Researchers from Japan have investigated rebuilding the coral reefs through introduction of foraminifera.|$|E
25|$|Clades B and C {{are found}} more {{frequently}} in the deeper water regions, which may explain the higher susceptibility to increased temperatures. Terrestrial plants that receive less sunlight because they {{are found in the}} undergrowth can be analogized to clades B, C, and D. Since clades B through D are found at deeper depths, they require an elevated light absorption rate to be able to synthesize as much energy. With elevated absorption rates at UV wavelengths, the deeper occurring phylotypes are more prone to <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching</b> versus the more shallow clades. Clade D has been observed to be high temperature-tolerant, and as a result it has a higher rate of survival than clades B and C.|$|E

25|$|The reefs at Funafuti have {{suffered}} damage, with 80 per {{cent of the}} coral becoming bleached {{as a consequence of}} the increase in ocean temperatures and ocean acidification. The <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching,</b> which includes staghorn corals, is attributed to the increase in water temperature that occurred during the El Niños that occurred from 1998–2000 and from 2000–2001. A reef restoration project has investigated reef restoration techniques; and researchers from Japan have investigated rebuilding the coral reefs through the introduction of foraminifera.

This will impact negatively on the rare back coral trees (Antipathes grandis) found within the Cape Byron Marine Park. Changes in water temperature {{that are associated with}} climate change are also expected to impacted on the life cycle of many species as evidenced by the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) change in nesting patterns and times, this again could lead to an unbalanced ecosystem which could have detrimental effects on other species which rely on the loggerhead turtle for survival.|$|E
25|$|During {{the past}} ten years, unusually warm Caribbean waters have been {{increasingly}} threatening Caribbean coral reefs. Coral reefs support {{some of the most}} diverse marine habitats in the world, but they are fragile ecosystems. When tropical waters become unusually warm for extended periods of time, microscopic plants called zooxanthellae, which are symbiotic partners living within the coral polyp tissues, die off. These plants provide food for the corals, and give them their color. The result of the death and dispersal of these tiny plants is called <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching,</b> and can lead to the devastation of large areas of reef. Over 42% of corals are completely bleached and 95% are experiencing some type of whitening. Historically the Caribbean is thought to contain 14% of the world's coral reefs.|$|E

25|$|Most of the Arabian Peninsula is unsuited to agriculture, making {{irrigation}} and land reclamation projects essential. The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting {{to less than}} 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, coffee and tropical fruits. Goat, sheep, and camel husbandry is widespread elsewhere {{throughout the rest of}} the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid tropical monsoon climate, in particular the Dhofar and Al Mahrah areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical monsoon rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid desert climate or arid steppe climate. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally tropical sea with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in symbiosis with the Red Sea coral, the protozoa and zooxanthellae, have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by <b>coral</b> <b>bleaching</b> caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the indopacific coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the Persian Gulf, mostly caused by phosphate water pollution and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.|$|E

On Great Keppel Island, about 85%of shallow-water reefs died. Reef damage also occurred in the Whitsunday Islands. The discharge from the Fitzroy River affected various islands and coral groups, depending on the offshore wind direction and ocean current. The water flow washed a group of freshwater turtles from the mainland to North West Island, though they were later returned to their native habitat. The influx of freshwater reduced commercial fishing productivity by 30%.|$|E

40|$|Singapore reefs {{show the}} impact of over four decades of land {{reclamation}} and coastal development. High sedimentation rates persist, causing declining live coral cover at almost all sites monitored since 1987. Live coral cover of reefs close to or {{in the path of}} sediment plumes dropped drastically. The widespread bleaching event of 1998 affected Singapore reefs at an unprecedented level. Exceptionally elevated water temperature up to 350 C coinciding with low tides resulted in 90 % of hard <b>corals</b> <b>bleached</b> of which 25 % failed to recover. Overall reduction in the total percent live <b>coral</b> cover through <b>bleaching</b> was most evident at the reef crest. Recovery rates varied among genera and growth forms. The submassive coral, Goniopora, showed the most complete recovery, while massive corals recovered slower. The lack of a national policy on coral reefs and the absence of an identified national agency to manage coral reefs are factors against reef protection. However, strong measures in controlling marine pollution (other than sedimentation) and a diversity of reef protection activities by non-governmental organisations are helping to mitigate the deficiency within obvious limitations...|$|R
