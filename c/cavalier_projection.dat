5000|$|<b>Cavalier</b> <b>projection</b> is {{the name}} of such a projection, where the length along the [...] axis remains unscaled.|$|E
50|$|Oblique {{projection}} {{is commonly}} used in technical drawing. The <b>cavalier</b> <b>projection</b> was used by French military artists in the 18th century to depict fortifications. Oblique projection was used almost universally by Chinese artists from {{the first or second}} centuries to the 18th century, especially when depicting rectilinear objects such as houses.|$|E
50|$|To play Champions of Krynn, one simply {{needs to}} create {{characters}} {{and form a}} party. The gameplay basics are identical to all games in the series, with combat employing a <b>cavalier</b> <b>projection</b> view of the battlefield. There is no character-transferring system in this game, {{as it is the}} first. Characters from Champions of Krynn may be transferred to the sequel, Death Knights of Krynn.|$|E
50|$|In {{an oblique}} projections, the {{parallel}} projection rays are not {{perpendicular to the}} viewing plane, but strike the projection plane at an angle other than ninety degrees. In both orthographic and oblique projection, parallel lines in space appear parallel on the projected image. Because of its simplicity, oblique projection is used exclusively for pictorial purposes rather than for formal, working drawings. In an oblique pictorial drawing, the displayed angles among the axes {{as well as the}} foreshortening factors (scale) are arbitrary. The distortion created thereby is usually attenuated by aligning one plane of the imaged object to be parallel with the plane of projection thereby creating a true shape, full-size image of the chosen plane. Special types of oblique <b>projections</b> include military, <b>cavalier</b> and cabinet <b>projection.</b>|$|R
40|$|This work acquaints {{with the}} program Sam for {{interactive}} computer training of students on the theme "Mutual intersecting of pyramids and prisms in axonometry”. The program containing three modules – teacher, student and autopilot – allows for briefest time to teach and study the whole variety of the tasks on this theme. A classification of the pierce points of the surrounding edges of the one polyhedron with the other one, based on the mutual position of their auxiliary planes, is made. The solutions of the tasks can be traced {{in each of the}} popular axonometric <b>projection</b> (cabinet <b>projection,</b> <b>cavalier</b> perspective, military perspective, increased orthogonal dimetry, increased orthogonal isometry) in their significant stages as well as in each step. Each stage of the solution is accompanied by commentary. The student can manipulate any object of the drawing or can apply on the whole drawing rotation, translation, expansion, shrink, zoom, etc. The student can watch on all sides the rotating 3 D image of the composition of the two intersecting polyhedrons and separate the rotating 3 D image of their common part. The combination of traditional methods of training in descriptive geometry using the program Sam and the classification of the pierce points enable for a thorough, creative and self study of the students. They are instruments through which the students can not only learn in depth material for a short time, but they can prepare creative course projects such as: improvisations on a task or a selection of tasks from known sources and creating original tasks on a given topic. The program also allows to create dynamic geometric drawings...|$|R
50|$|The term cabinet {{projection}} (sometimes cabinet perspective) {{stems from}} {{its use in}} illustrations by the furniture industry. Like cavalier perspective, one face of the projected object {{is parallel to the}} viewing plane, and the third axis is projected as going off at an angle (typically 63.4°). Unlike <b>cavalier</b> <b>projection,</b> where the third axis keeps its length, with cabinet projection the length of the receding lines is cut in half.|$|E
50|$|The term cabinet {{projection}} (sometimes cabinet perspective) {{stems from}} {{its use in}} illustrations by the furniture industry. Like cavalier perspective, one face of the projected object {{is parallel to the}} viewing plane, and the third axis is projected as going off in an angle (typically 30° or 45° or arctan(2) = 63.4°). Unlike <b>cavalier</b> <b>projection,</b> where the third axis keeps its length, with cabinet projection the length of the receding lines is cut in half.|$|E
50|$|A {{perspective}} projection {{of an object}} is often considered more realistic than a parallel projection, since it more closely resembles human vision and photography. However, parallel projections are popular in technical applications, since the parallelism of an object's lines and faces is preserved, and direct measurements can be taken from the image. Among parallel projections, orthographic projections are the most realistic, and are commonly used by engineers. On the other hand, certain types of oblique projections (for example <b>cavalier</b> <b>projection,</b> military projection) are very simple to implement, and are used to create quick and informal pictorials of objects.|$|E
50|$|In <b>{{cavalier}}</b> <b>projection</b> (sometimes {{cavalier perspective}} or high view point) {{a point of}} the object is represented by three coordinates, x, y and z. On the drawing, it is represented by only two coordinates, x″ and y″. On the flat drawing, two axes, x and z on the figure, are perpendicular and the length on these axes are drawn with a 1:1 scale; it is thus similar to the dimetric projections, {{although it is not}} an axonometric projection, as the third axis, here y, is drawn in diagonal, making an arbitrary angle with the x″ axis, usually 30 or 45°. The length of the third axis is not scaled.|$|E
