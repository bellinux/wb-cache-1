40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the behavior of}} different junction models in scale space. In this perspective, we study the behavior of linear models (L,Y and X models) and linear multi-models (two adjacent corners with infinite extent and a closed triangular model) with constant illumination, linear models with nonconstant illumination and a non-linear model (<b>curved</b> <b>junctions).</b> The study shows under which conditions the Laplacian is zero or not at the junction point. Consequently, approaches based on the Laplacian of Gaussian to detect corners are not precise. Futhermore, all these models provide one or several extrema inside the junction sector. These extrema have nice scaling properties...|$|R
5000|$|By {{performing}} an obstetric ultrasound at a {{gestational age}} of 10-14 weeks, monochorionic-diamniotic twins are discerned from dichorionic twins. The {{presence of a}} [...] "T-sign" [...] at the inter-twin membrane-placental junction is indicative of monochorionic-diamniotic twins (that is, the junction between the inter-twin membrane and the external rim forms a right angle), whereas dichorionic twins present with a [...] "lambda (λ) sign" [...] (that is, the chorion forms a wedge-shaped protrusion into the inter-twin space, creating a rather <b>curved</b> <b>junction).</b> The [...] "lambda sign" [...] is also called the [...] "twin peak sign". At ultrasound at a gestational age of 16-20 weeks, the [...] "lambda sign" [...] is indicative of dichorionicity but its absence does not exclude it.|$|E

On the north wall of north transept two shaped heads with embattled tops, the two heads bearing together the date 1634. On north wall of nave, head with arabesque ornament and painted decoration; on south wall, with rounded and moulded head.

40|$|Asymmetric binary nanocrystals (BNCs), {{comprising}} one c-axis elongated anatase TiO 2 {{section and}} one gamma-Fe 2 O 3 spherical domain attached together, are synthesized by heterogeneous nucleation of iron oxide onto the longitudinal facets of TiO 2 nanorods in a ternary surfactant mixture. The topologically controlled {{composition of the}} BNCs is ascertained {{by a combination of}} powder X-ray diffraction, Raman and Mossbauer spectroscopy, high-angle annular dark-field imaging, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy lattice fringe mapping, while their size-dependent magnetic behavior is demonstrated by ac susceptibility measurements. The heteroepitaxial growth proceeds through a mechanism never observed before for colloidal nanoheterostructures: the two domains share a restricted and locally <b>curved</b> <b>junction</b> region, which accommodates efficiently the interfacial strain and retards the formation of misfit dislocations. It is believed that these BNCs, which combine the properties of two technologically relevant oxide materials, can pave the way to reinforced applications in several fields of nanoscience, such as in photocatalysis, in malignant cell treatments, and in nanocrystal assembly...|$|E

40|$|House Patterson (1966) in Somerset West {{was built}} for a potter. It is hidden from the street by a solid {{boundary}} wall, punctured only by a shuttered opening. The “house draws one, as into a spiral shell, towards the central hearth” (Fagan, c. 1991 : 4). An upward spiral route leads the visitor from the street down a long driveway to a ceramic mural, with the front door placed at ninety degrees. On entry the visitor is {{turned to face the}} opposite direction where a staircase leads to a mezzanine study. At this point, views of False Bay are revealed. Fagan believes all elements should relate and enhance each other as far as possible, so the yard wall is made part of the house. The garden wall and three building blocks are used to define a courtyard hidden from the road and to foster the reading of a single form. Connections to the courtyard are limited, in a vernacular sense, to punctured openings, save for the original extensive open connection at the pottery studio end. House Patterson displays restraint in plastic articulation, but hints of plasticity {{can be seen in the}} <b>curved</b> <b>junction</b> of the living room roof. 10 digital colour photos of House Patterson, taken by Arthur Barker with a Canon EOS 400 D digital camera, December 2008.

40|$|Abstract. An {{improved}} {{interpolation method}} is presented based on B-spline curve back calculation which regards data points as control points. First, a B-spline surface reconstruction is done, and a favorable condition for real-time interpolation {{can be provided}} for NC machining. Then, by prejudging the trajectory feedrate, the tangent vectors of spline <b>curve</b> <b>junction</b> can be calculated, {{which can be used}} to establish the spline curve equations based on time. At last, with the equations mentioned above, the trajectory and feedrate profile can be generated simultaneously by the improved interpolation algorithm. An error analysis is also discussed and the feasibility of the improved algorithm is verified by the simulation results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We are {{interested}} in descriptions of 3 D data sets, as obtained from stereo or a 3 D digitizer. We therefore consider as input a sparse set of points, possibly associated with certain orientation information. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} inferring integrated high-level descriptions such as surfaces, 3 D <b>curves,</b> and <b>junctions</b> from a sparse point set. While the method proposed by Guy and Medioni provides excellent results for smooth structures, it only detects surface orientation discontinuities but does not localize them. For precise localization, we propose a noniterative cooperative algorithm in which surfaces, <b>curves,</b> and <b>junctions</b> work together: Initial estimates are computed based on the work by Guy and Medioni, where each point in the given sparse and possibly noisy point set is convolved with a predefined vector mask to produce dense saliency maps. These maps serve as input to our novel extremal surface and curve algorithms for initial surface and curve extraction. These initial features are refined and integrated by using excitatory and inhibitory fields. Consequently, intersecting surfaces (resp. curves) are fused precisely at their intersection <b>curves</b> (resp. <b>junctions).</b> Results on several synthetic as well as real data sets are presented. Index Terms—Segmentation and feature extraction, integrated shape description, surface orientation discontinuity, surface and curve extremality. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} vision-based {{approach}} for navigation of humanoid robots in networks of corridors connected through <b>curves</b> and <b>junctions.</b> The {{objective of the}} humanoid is to follow the corridors, walking {{as close as possible}} to their center to maximize motion safety, and to turn at <b>curves</b> and <b>junctions.</b> Our control algorithm is inspired by a technique originally designed for unicycle robots that we have adapted to humanoid navigation and extended to cope with the presence of turns and junctions. The corridor following control law is here proven to provide asymptotic convergence of robot heading and position to the corridor bisector even when the corridor walls are not parallel. A State Transition System is designed to allow navigation in mazes of corridors, curves and T-junctions. Extensive experimental validation prove the validity and robustness of the approach, and in particular the successful extension of the controller to turns and junctions...|$|R
