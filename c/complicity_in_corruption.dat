5000|$|Silvio Berlusconi (owner of Fininvest) {{was accused}} of <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> <b>corruption.</b> The crime was perpetrated by Fininvest's payment of 380 million lira in bribes to three {{officers}} of the Guardia di Finanza engaged in tax audits, in the attempt of convincing them to [...] "turn a blind eye" [...] against tax frauds committed by the four Fininvest owned companies (all with headquarters in Milan): Videotime (1989), Arnoldo Mondadori Editore (1991), Mediolanum (1992) and TELE+ (1994). The mix of interrogation by Paolo Berlusconi and Salvatore Sciascia (the {{former head of the}} tax office of Fininvest) made it clear, that the most important decisions were made by Silvio Berlusconi, who was aware of everything, and that sometimes the responsibility of managers were only a facade, because everything was decided by a very small group of people. Silvio Berlusconi was interrogated about his role in the case by the Milan prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro on 22 November 1994. An official indictment was launched against Silvio Berlusconi on 14 October 1995.|$|E
5000|$|Kılıçdaroğlu's {{efforts to}} uncover {{malpractice}} among high-ranking Justice and Development Party (AKP) politicians carried him to {{headlines in the}} Turkish media.

Furthermore, he publicly accused the AKP-affiliated Mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek, of <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> a <b>corruption</b> scandal relating to the [...] "Deniz Feneri" [...] charity based in Germany.|$|R
5000|$|Though Steffens' {{subject was}} {{municipal}} corruption, {{he did not}} present his work as an exposé of corruption; rather, he wanted {{to draw attention to}} the public's <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> allowing <b>corruption</b> to continue. Steffens tried to advance a theory of city corruption: corruption, he claimed, was the result of [...] "big business men" [...] who corrupted city government for their own ends, and [...] "the typical business man"—average Americans—who ignored politics and allowed such corruption to continue. He framed his work as an attempt [...] "to sound for the civic pride of an apparently shameless citizenship," [...] by making the public face their responsibility in the persistence of municipal corruption.|$|R
50|$|After {{his arrest}} and release in Italy in 1989, Van Anraat fled to Iraq, {{where he lived}} for the next 14 years.

On December 23, 2005, {{he was sentenced to}} fifteen years <b>in</b> prison for <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> war crimes, but the court decided the charges of <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> genocide could not be substantiated.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the public}} {{prosecutor}} {{as well as}} Van Anraat appealed the verdict. In May 2007, the appeal court sentenced Van Anraat to seventeen years in prison, this time for <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> multiple war crimes which explains the two extra years, but not for <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> genocide.|$|R
