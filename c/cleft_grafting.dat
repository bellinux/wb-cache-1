50|$|Stub {{grafting}} is {{a technique}} that requires less stock than <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting,</b> and retains {{the shape of a}} tree. Also scions are generally of 6-8 buds in this process.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cleft</b> <b>Grafting</b> {{is carried}} out when the plants are {{slightly}} larger, and a V-shaped cut {{is made in the}} stem of the scion. The scion is then inserted into the rootstock, which has a vertical slice cut {{down the center of the}} stem. The rootstock and scion are then held together by a spring clip while the graft union forms11.|$|E
50|$|In <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> a small cut {{is made in}} {{the stalk}} and then the pointed end of the scion is {{inserted}} in the stalk.The most common form of grafting is <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting.</b> This is best done in the spring and is useful for joining a thin scion about 1 cm diameter to a thicker branch or stock. It is best if the latter is 2 - 7 cm in diameter and has 3-5 buds. The branch or stock should be split carefully down the middle to form a cleft about 3 cm deep. If it is a branch that is not vertical then the cleft should be cut horizontally. The end of the scion should be cut cleanly to a long shallow wedge, preferably with a single cut for each wedge surface, and not whittled. A third cut may be made across the end of the wedge to make it straight across.|$|E
500|$|Grafting is {{used for}} species {{difficult}} to grow well in cultivation or that cannot grow independently, such as some chlorophyll-free forms with white, yellow or red bodies, or some forms that show abnormal growth (e.g., cristate or monstrose forms).

50|$|Nutmeg {{trees are}} {{dioecious}} plants which are propagated sexually (seeds) and asexually (cuttings or grafting). Sexual propagation yields 50% male seedlings, which are unproductive. As {{there is no}} reliable method of determining plant sex before flowering in the sixth to eighth year, and sexual reproduction bears inconsistent yields, grafting is the preferred method of propagation. Epicotyl grafting (a variation of <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> using seedlings), approach grafting, and patch budding have proved successful, with epicotyl grafting being the most widely adopted standard. Air layering is an alternative though not preferred method because of its low (35-40%) success rate.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of methods for {{grafting}} vegetable crops. <b>Cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> occurs when a V-shape is cut into the rootstock and a complementing wedge-shaped scion is inserted. The graft is then held with a small clip until healing occurs. [...] Approach grafting involves notching opposing sides of the stems of the rootstock and scion, and then using a clip to hold the stems together while they fuse. Once the graft has healed, the original scion is then cut off of the desired rootstock and the unused rootstock is detached from the scion. [...] Micrografting is a new technique that has been recently integrated into micropropagation production for hybrid tomato. This method uses micropropagated scion shoots that grafted onto 3 week-old rootstock seedlings. The most common commercial technique for grafting tomato is tube grafting. Tube grafting takes place when the scion and rootstock are severed as seedlings and reattached with a small, silicone tube or clip. [...] This technique has been highly effective as it can be carried out when plants are very small, thereby eliminating the need for large healing chambers while increasing the output. Tube grafting has been adopted as the primary method for vegetable grafting on the farm as it can be easily carried out with small healing chambers with typical success rates ranging from 85 to 90 percent 14.|$|E

To {{struggle against the}} diminishing resources of gathered fruits {{as well as the}} genetic erosion, a domestication program is being carried out in Senegal. It aims at selecting and cloning trees of a superior phenotype before introducing them into local populations. Some tests have been tried out so as to develop and optimise techniques of grafting adapted to theses species. The tested factors have been the age of the source plants, the time for grafting, as well as the type of graft. The best dates to graft have been defined as follows: end of dry season for D. senegalense, during rainy season for B. aegyptiaca, beginning of dry season for T. indica. For these three species the apical <b>grafts</b> (<b>cleft</b> <b>graft</b> and splice graft) gave better results than other types.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To date, a {{great number}} of tissue {{engineering}} strategies have been suggested for alveolar cleft reconstruction; however, autologous bone grafting seems to remain the golden standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to evaluate the clinical evidence pertaining to enhancement or replacement of the autologous bone graft in the alveolar cleft by means of tissue-engineered substitutes; 16 articles were selected for analysis. RESULTS: Tissue engineering strategies for alveolar <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> included enhancing the autologous bone graft by means of platelet-rich plasma addition, the use of barrier membranes and fibrin glue, extension of the autologous graft with calcium phosphate scaffolds, and replacement of the graft using bone morphogenetic protein- 2, mesenchymal stem cells, or calcium phosphate scaffolds.

30|$|Many {{sources of}} bone both {{autologous}} and alloplastic {{have been studied}} and compared. The question of the preferred donor site for <b>cleft</b> <b>grafts</b> has been debated for many years [13]. Autologous bone graft {{has always been the}} gold standard of bone replacement because it provides osteogenic cells as well as essential factors needed for bone healing and regeneration. It can be taken from the patient’s iliac crest, mandible, or tibia. The choice between these sites is influenced by several factors including the surgeon’s experience, the volume of bone required, and the morbidity of the harvest area [14]. To avoid or reduce such morbidity, surgeons are searching for a bone graft substitute. In 2007, the recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) started to be used after the Food and Drug Administration approval as an alternative to autologous bone graft for localized alveolar ridge augmentation [15]. The identification and development of rhBMP- 2 associated with a collagen sponge carrier has allowed the use of alloplastic bone graft. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play a role in osteogenesis and chondrogenesis and are also involved in embryonic development and fracture healing [16]. It is important to better understand if rhBMP- 2 graft could represent an autologous bone graft substitute, thus eliminating donor site morbidity [17]. The last systematic review assessing autologous vs. alloplastic bone for SABG in patients with cleft lip and palate was published by Guo et al. in 2011 [18] that included only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing traditional iliac bone graft to rhBMP- 2. Therefore, the objectives of this systematic review are to evaluate volume and bone height and length of hospital stay in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate treated with autologous or rhBMP- 2 secondary bone graft, thus synthesizing the available evidence on the effectiveness of the two types of treatment.|$|R

O araticum ou marolo é uma espécie nativa do Cerrado, apreciada localmente no Centro-Oeste e coletada extrativamente para comercialização em feiras e ruas das cidades desta região. O trabalho foi dividido em dois capítulos, o primeiro, enxertia de atemoia Thompson sobre dois porta-enxertos do gênero Rollinia e o segundo, enxertia de araticum sobre 4 porta-enxertos de anonáceas. O Capítulo I avalia a eficiência de dois porta-enxertos (Rollinia sp. e Rollinia mucosa) e dois métodos de enxertia (inglês simples e fenda lateral). Os parâmetros avaliados foram: índice de sobrevivência dos enxertos, comprimento de ramo {{principal}} e número de folhas aos 60, 75, 90 e 105 dias após a enxertia. O porta-enxerto araticum-de-terra-fria apresentou melhores resultados que o biribá, com índice de sobrevivência de 82, 5 % e 35 % respectivamente. O melhor método de enxertia para araticum-de-terra-fria foi o inglês simples com índice de sobrevivência de 90 %. O Capítulo II foi organizado em 5 experimentos para avaliação de diferentes métodos de enxertia e porta-enxertos para a propagação do araticum. O Experimento I consistiu em avaliar a habilidade e eficiência de dois enxertadores para a condução dos experimentos seguintes, quanto ao índice de sobrevivência dos enxertos, onde não foi encontrada significância estatística em nenhuma época de avaliação para o parâmetro avaliado.

The two species chosen for this research have morphological affinities, but they also present many different features. Atemoya is a hybrid which has excellent flavor characteristics appreciated {{all around the world}} and it is grown mostly in Australia, Israel, United States and Brazil. The araticum is a native species of the Brazilian savannah, the Cerrado, and it is consumed locally in the central west region, and commercialized in local markets. A common element between these two species is the lack of propagation studies, to which the results of this research are a contribution. It is well known that grafting is a method of vegetative propagation which, besides cloning and rescuing interesting genotypes exhibits, has some advantages such as root disease resistance, trunk borer resistance, as well as inducing desirable characteristics to the canopy. This work was divided in two chapters. The first one was about atemoya Thompson grafting with two methods (side <b>cleft</b> <b>graft</b> and whip graft) onto two rootstocks (Rollinia mucosa e Rollinia sp.). The analyzed parameters were: graft survival rate, main branch length and leaf number at 60, 75, 90 and 105 days after grafting. The atemoya grafting experiment proved the efficiency of the araticum-de-terra-fria rootstock and the unviability of atemoya grafting onto the biribá rootstock (wild sweetsop). Chapter II was organized into 5 experiments for the evaluation of different grafting methods and rootstocks for araticum propagation. Experiment I assessed and compared the ability and efficiency of two grafters. For this experiment it was necessary to conduct the following procedures: The grafts survival rate was compared through an F test but no statistical significance was found in any procedure. In Experiment II, three <b>grafting</b> methods (side <b>cleft,</b> whip <b>graft,</b> whip and tongue graft) were used for araticum grafting onto soursop rootstocks, age 12 and 24 months. In Experiment III, three <b>grafting</b> methods (<b>cleft,</b> whip and whip and tongue) were evaluated for araticum grafting onto araticum-de-terra-fria rootstocks, age 9 and 21 months. The survival rate of the grafts was assessed at 60 days after grafting. In Experiment IV, four grafting methods were tested (<b>cleft,</b> whip <b>graft,</b> sub-shell and side cleft), with randomized blocks design, with 5 blocks, 5 replicates, 8 plants per parcel, totaling 200 plants. In Experiment V, two <b>grafting</b> methods (<b>cleft</b> and whip <b>graft)</b> were evaluated in 2 rootstocks (soursop and custard apple). The survival rate was assessed at 30 days after grafting. All the grafting experiments on 4 rootstocks, including 5 types of grafting and 500 grafted plants, have shown that araticum has grafting incompatibility, because only 3 grafts survived. Possible causes for this problem were investigated through histochemical and anatomical studies and through grafting tissue analysis from experiments of soursop, biriba (wild sweepsop) and araticum-de-terra-fria. Boards and tables record the results. It was identified anatomical differences and phenolic compounds at the graft union. Alternatives are suggested for overcoming the incompatibility in the araticum grafting, which until now has not produced viable plants of this species with the method here employed...|$|R

Ten patients with bilateral clefts were selected and during a 2 -week period, all received autogeneic cancellous iliac bone bilaterally. The membrane was placed nasally and orally on the larger cleft side and removed after 3 - 6 months. All patients have been followed for 14 months. Bone graft incorporation was successful except for one patient (membrane side), who was regrafted 1 year later. However, soft-tissue problems with membrane exposure occurred {{in the majority of}} patients, while on the nonmembrane side, healing was uneventful in all cases.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of BP on the success of bone grafts placed in palatal defects in rats. Bone was harvested and packed into palatal defects in recipient animals which were divided into four groups (n= 8) : (1) Saline, (2) BP at the time of surgery (T 0), (3) BP one-week post-surgery (T 1) and (4) BP three-weeks post-surgery (T 2). All animals were euthanized at six weeks. Bone volume in the T 1 BP (36. 3 ± 8. 8 %) and T 2 BP groups (36. 9 ± 12. 4 %) was significantly greater than controls (24. 8 ± 7. 9 %) and T 0 BP group (22. 1 ± 5. 9 %) (p < 0. 05). H&E images confirmed increased bone in delayed BP groups. There was no difference in number of TRAP+ cells but BP groups showed abnormal morphology of 3. 75 % of TRAP+ cells.

Os porta-enxertos utilizados foram obtidos de sementes da gravioleira Morada, as quais foram enxertadas com a gravioleira Gigante das Alagoas. O método de enxertia empregado foi por garfagem de topo em fenda cheia, e o delineamento {{experimental}} usado foi o de blocos ao acaso, com cinco repetições e dezesseis plantas por unidade experimental. Foram avaliados a percentagem média de pegamento do enxerto aos 60 dias após a enxertia, diâmetro do caule e altura dos porta-enxertos em quatro idades distintas (40; 55; 70 e 85 dias após a emergência). Verificou-se que o percentual de pegamento do enxerto aumentou com a idade dos porta-enxertos, no qual a idade de 85 dias após a emergência foi superior às demais, apresentando 82 % de pegamento. Aos 40 dias após a emergência, não houve pegamento, e somente a partir de 55 dias após a emergência, constatou-se o pegamento do enxerto, ou seja, com diâmetro médio do caule acima de 2, 21 mm. In {{order to}} determinate the age effect on soursop tree grafting, an experiment {{was carried out}} at the Universidade Federal de Alagoas, Brazil {{during the period of}} July to December 2001. The performance of four ages of the rootstocks for soursop tree was evaluated in 40, 55, 70 and 85 days after emergence. The rootstocks utilized were obtained from seeds of the soursop tree "Morada", which were grafted with the soursop tree "Gigante das Alagoas". The grafting utilized was by top <b>cleft</b> <b>graft</b> methods and the experimental design utilized was randomized blocks with five replicates and sixteen plants per experimental unit. The evaluations consisted of percentage of grafting technique success at 60 days after grafting, stem diameter and height of the soursop seedlings for each ages. It was verified that the percent of success of the graft increased with the rootstocks ages. The age of 85 days after emergence showed a better performance than the others, presenting 82 % of grafting success.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Aiming the {{selection}} of rootstocks to produce seedlings, {{the objective of this}} study was to quantify the seminiferous propagation in chestnut seeds, with or without incisions. Nine cultivars were used (‘Ibuki’, ‘Isumo’, ‘Kinshu’, ‘Moriwase’, ‘Okuni’, ‘Senri’, ‘Taishowase’, ‘Tamatsukuri’ and ‘Tiodowase’) and two selections (‘KM- 1 ’ and ‘KM- 2 ’) of hybrid chestnut trees (Castanea crenata x Castanea sp.). An incision was held in half of chestnuts and the other half remained intact. Percentage of germination, emergence and root length were quantified. The germinated nuts were transplanted and were quantified the diameter and height of seedlings. Then, the chestnut selections ‘KM- 2 ’ and ‘Jacutinga’ were grafted by the <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> method, and were quantified the percentage of sprouting, besides the diameter and height of grafts. Incisions increase the germination and seedling emergence in most cultivars and selections. ‘Taishowase’ and ‘Tamatsukuri’ stood out over the others to germination, growth of the rootstocks...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to evaluate the agronomical responses of two seed propagated artichoke hybrids (‘Concerto’ and ‘Madrigal’) grafted onto two varieties of cultivated cardoon (‘Belgio’ and ‘Madrid’) in noninfested soil (Experiment 1), to evaluate the agronomical responses of the seed propagated artichoke ‘T 3 ’ ungrafted and grafted onto cultivated cardoon ‘Bianco gigante inerme a foglia intera’ in soil infested with Verticillium (Experiment 2), to assess the compatibility of globe artichoke cultivars ‘Istar’ and ‘Romolo’ grafted onto the cultivated (‘Bianco avorio’) and wild cardoon rootstocks, and to identify the best grafting method (splice or <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> method) for artichoke (Experiment 3). In Experiment 1, when ‘Madrigal’ cultivar was used as scion no difference in yield was observed between grafted and ungrafted plants. Contrarily, for the same cardoon rootstocks (‘Belgio’ and ‘Madrid’) in combination with ‘Concerto’ significant differences were recorded among the grafting combinations, with the highest yield and yield components recorded with the combination ‘Concerto’/‘Belgio’. The cardoon rootstock ‘Madrid’ delayed {{the beginning of the}} harvest season, when ‘Concerto’ was used as scion, the harvest of grafted plants started 2 months later than ungrafted plants, whereas when ‘Madrigal’ was used as scion, the delay was about 1 month. In Experiment 2, the total yield was higher by 45 %, 53 %, and 44 % in 2008 / 2009, 2009 / 2010, and 2010 / 2011, respectively when ‘T 3 ’ was grafted onto ‘Bianco gigante inerme a foglia intera’ cardoon rootstock than in ungrafted ‘T 3 ’. The Verticillium wilt incidence in grafted plants was significantly lower (10 %) in comparison to ungrafted plants (43 %). In Experiment 3, the higher graft survival rate (82 – 92 %) was observed when the two globe artichoke cultivars were self grafted, cross grafted or grafted onto the cultivated cardoon, whereas a lower affinity rate (39 – 49 %) was recorded when both globe artichoke cultivars were grafted onto wild cardoon. The grafting technique influenced the graft survival rate with the higher values recorded with splice grafting (78 %) compared to <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> method (73 %) ...|$|E
40|$|There {{is great}} genetic {{diversity}} of rambutan plants, thus, to establish commercial orchards cul-ture, {{it is recommended}} the use of plants vegetatively propagated. Therefore, this research aimed {{to determine the best}} method of grafting, graft protection and type of rootstock for its propagation. The experiment was re-peated in two seasons (autumn/winter and spring/summer). The experimental design was completely random-ized in both experiments, with four replicates, each experimental unit consisted of 10 plants analyzed in a 4 x 2 x 2 factorial with four types of grafting (whip graft-WG; cleft graft –CG; wedge graft-WG; and inverted wedge graft-IWG;), 2 types of graft protection (Biodegradable and plastic) and 2 types of rootstock (without or with leaves). The variables analyzed in this study were: percentage of grafting success, number and length of buds (cm). For grafting performed in autumn / winter, both by <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> as whip graft with biodegradable strip and rootstock leafless provided the best results in propagation of rambutan tree.

40|$|Allanblackia stuhlmannii, a {{multi-purpose}} fruit tree, produces {{edible oil}} from seeds, {{is a new}} commercial species in global food and cosmetic industry. Cultivation of this fruit tree is limited because of lack quality and quantity planting materials due to poor seed germination. Our study therefore aimed at evaluating healing and survival of scions grafted on two types of rootstocks under two nursery conditions to promote cultivation of A. stuhlmannii by rural farmers. Scions taken from 2 coppiced (L 26 and L 62) and 3 un-coppiced (L 19, L 28 and L 63) mother sources were grafted on a 2 year-old rootstocks using top <b>cleft,</b> side-veneer <b>grafting</b> and budding methods. Each treatment per site contained 10 seedlings of two rootstocks type (with/without leaves) arranged in a randomized complete block design with nursery sites as blocks (replicates). The grafts take (survival) was assessed 4 months after grafting. The survival rate of the grafts was generally poor in both nurseries. Top-cleft grafting method with scions from coppiced sources produced the best success rate. There was a significant differences on various grafting methods and using scion from coppiced sources, and the interaction of grafting methods and scion sources, p < 0. 0001. It is presupposed that the low percentile of success (19 %) {{is linked to the}} physiologic condition of the scions sources, besides less favourable environmental conditions at the time of grafting. The top-cleft grafting method using coppiced scions source proved most effective method in the survival rate of grafts.

40|$|Cleft lip and palate (CL/P) is a {{frequent}} congenital malformation that manifests in several varieties including unilateral or bilateral and complete or incomplete. Alveolar cleft reconstruction remains controversial with regard to timing, graft materials, surgical techniques, and methods of evaluation. Many {{studies have been conducted}} addressing these points to develop an acceptable universal protocol for managing CL/P. The primary goal of alveolar cleft reconstruction in CL/P patients is to provide a bony bridge at the cleft site that allows maxillary arch continuity, oronasal fistula repair, eruption of the permanent dentition into the newly formed bone, enhances nasal symmetry through providing alar base support, orthodontic movement and placement of osseointegrated implants when indicated. Other goals include improving speech, improvement of periodontal conditions, establishing better oral hygiene, and limiting growth disturbances. In order to rehabilitate oral function in CL/P patients alveolar bone grafting is necessary. Secondary bone grafting is the most widely accepted method for treating alveolar <b>clefts.</b> Autogenous bone <b>graft</b> is the primary source for reconstructing alveolar cleft defects and is currently the preferred grafting material...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{aimed to}} assess whether {{patients}} with hemifacial microsomia can be quantitatively identified using bone mineral density information. Mandibular bone mineral density was studied using computer assisted analysis between the nonaffected (r) and the affected (1) sides with an orthopantomograph in a patient with hemifacial microsomia with median mandibular cleft, four patients who suffered from hemifacial microsomia in the left side. Fifty controls without bone diseases were randomly selected. Bone mineral density r/l ratios in the controls ranged from 0. 479 to 2. 064, those in two patients that were associated with and without median mandibular cleft were higher {{than those in the}} controls, with a maximum of 8. 622 in a particular male with median mandibular <b>cleft</b> after bone <b>graft,</b> whereas the r/l ratios in the other three cases were similar to the controls. Our findings indicate that the quantitative character in the case with median mandibular cleft reveals a large discrepancy of bone mineral density between the nonaffected and the affected sides. This may suggest a compensatory mechanism for bone hypertrophy from regulated bone mineral density with underdevelopment in hemifacial microsomia...|$|R
