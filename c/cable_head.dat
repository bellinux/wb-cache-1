When Deadpool and the Agency X gang hear of this, they travel to Providence to help Cable. However, Rogue has already defeated Hecatomb by absorbing the 8 billion people's minds it absorbed. Sabretooth attacks the building where Irene Merryweather and the Black Box are. Domino heads for the building to rescue them as <b>Cable</b> <b>heads</b> for the Power Core. Domino gets to the building to discover that Sabretooth has killed Black Box and is holding Irene hostoge by using her as a human shield. Deadpool, who has parachuted from the Angency X jet, shoots Sabretooth and Irene manages to roll away. Domino takes Irene to the evacuation boats. Deadpool then proceeds to shoot Sabretooth repeatedly, stating that he knows he's running out of bullets, but he wonders if there will be anything left of Sabretooth for his healing factor to heal, just as he runs out bullets. Domino gets Irene to the evacuation boats as Cable joins them after he added just enough energy to the island to [...] "finish the job." [...] Domino makes Cable promise not to commit suicide, as Providence has a fail-safe system should Cable die. As Domino leaves, Cable wonders how many promises he's broken.

50|$|The Telconia {{is often}} {{incorrectly}} credited with {{playing a role}} in cutting German cables in August 1914. In her book The Zimmermann Telegram, American historian Barbara Tuchman incorrectly asserted this based on an interview with a retired Royal Navy officer decades later. Scholars have since determined that in fact it was the British General Post Office ship CS Alert that carried out these attacks. The job of the Alert was to locate and cut the five German <b>cables</b> <b>heading</b> into the Atlantic. A similar operation cut the German cables that connected Great Britain to the German coast. Successive missions by the Telconia and other ships later in the war eliminated the remainder of Germanys cable network and, in some instances, pulled the cables up with their grapples and relaid them into British and French ports for use by the Allied powers instead.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{approach}} for indoor localization based on already installed communication transceiver infrastructure is presented. Only marginal additional hardware {{is required to}} implement the localization functionality. The idea {{is to use a}} power level detection evaluation of the received signals in communication receivers to localize participants. In the planned configuration the power transmitted from mobile terminals is received by a leaky wave cable. Its length and coupling properties are dimensioned according to the dynamic range of two access points connected to the two <b>cable</b> <b>heads.</b> In order to adapt the problem to circuit-based analysis techniques the leaky wave cable is represented by a distributed antenna system. Thereby the considered design consists of a cascade of coupling structures with broadband Vivaldi antennas connected to the coupling ports. An experimental system has been built and also tested using an automated frequency domain measurement setup. Measurement results relating the system bandwidth to positioning accuracy show good agreement with theoretical investigations...|$|R
