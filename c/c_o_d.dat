He was so real accommodating, and so modest-like and simple in his last moments. Friends wanted metallic burial case--nothing else would do. I couldn't get it. There warn't going to be time--anybody could see that. Corpse said never mind, shake him up {{some kind of a}} box he could stretch out in comfortable, he warn't particular 'bout the general style of it. Said he went more on room than style, any way, in the last final container. Friends wanted a silver door-plate on the coffin, signifying who he was and wher' he was from. Now you know a fellow couldn't roust out such a gaily thing as that in a little country town like this. What did corpse say? Corpse said, whitewash his old canoe and dob his address and general destination onto it with a blacking brush and a stencil plate, long with a verse from some likely hymn or other, and p'int him for the tomb, and mark him <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.,</b> and just let him skip along. He warn't distressed any more than you be--on the contrary just as carm and collected as a hearse-horse; said he judged that wher' he was going to, a body would find it considerable better to attract attention by a picturesque moral character than a natty burial case with a swell doorplate on it. Splendid man, he was. I'd druther do for a corpse like that 'n any I've tackled in seven year. There's some satisfaction in buryin' a man like that. You feel that what you're doing is appreciated. Lord bless you, so's he got planted before he sp'iled, he was perfectly satisfied; said his relations meant well, perfectly well, but all them preparations was bound to delay the thing more or less, and he didn't wish to be kept layin' round. You never see such a clear head as what he had--and so carm and so cool. Just a hunk of brains that is what he was. Perfectly awful. It was a ripping distance from one end of that man's head to t'other. Often and over again he's had brain fever a-raging in one place, {{and the rest of the}} pile didn't know anything about it--didn't affect it any more than an Injun insurrection in Arizona affects the Atlantic States. Well, the relations they wanted a big funeral, but corpse said he was down on flummery--didn't want any procession--fill the hearse full of mourners, and get out a stern line and tow him behind. He was the most down on style of any remains I ever struck. A beautiful, simple-minded creature--it was what he was, you can depend on that. He was just set on having things the way he wanted them, and he took a solid comfort in laying his little plans. He had me measure him and take a whole raft of directions; then he had a minister stand up behind a long box with a tablecloth over it and read his funeral sermon, saying 'Angcore, angcore!' at the good places, and making him scratch out every bit of brag about him, and all the hifalutin; and then he made them trot out the choir so's he could help them pick out the tunes for the occasion, and he got them to sing 'Pop Goes the Weasel,' because he'd always liked that tune when he was downhearted, and solemn music made him sad; and when they sung that with tears in their eyes (because they all loved him), and his relations grieving around, he just laid there as happy as a bug, and trying to beat time and showing all over how much he enjoyed it; and presently he got worked up and excited; and tried to join in, for mind you he was pretty proud of his abilities in the singing line; but the first time he opened his mouth and was just going to spread himself, his breath took a walk. I never see a man snuffed out so sudden. Ah, it was a great loss--it was a powerful loss to this poor little one-horse town. Well, well, well, I hain't got time to be palavering along here--got to nail on the lid and mosey along with' him; and if you'll just give me a lift we'll skeet him into the hearse and meander along. Relations bound to have it so--don't pay no attention to dying injunctions, minute a corpse's gone; but if I had my way, if I didn't respect his last wishes and tow him behind the hearse, I'll be cuss'd. I consider that whatever a corpse wants done for his comfort is a little enough matter, and a man hain't got no right to deceive him or take advantage of him--and whatever a corpse trusts me to do I'm a-going to do, you know, even if it's to stuff him and paint him yaller and keep him for a keepsake--you hear me!" ...|$|E

When n and d are both large, exactly solving the LSR problem is very expensive. When n ≫ d, one feasible approach to speeding up LSR is to randomly embed y and all columns of X into a smaller subspace R^c; the induced LSR problem has {{the same number of}} columns but much fewer number of rows, and it can be solved in O(c d^ 2) time and O(c d) space.

40|$|In {{the study}} of organic {{substances}} found in sewage or other geographical environments where pollution by bacteria and the waste matter often happens, one inrariably encounters a problem of {{the choice of the}} methods of test: Which is better, a method based on the measurement of biochemical oxygen demand (B. O. D.) or a method based on the estimation of chemical oxygen demand (<b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.)</b> ? In an attempt to compare and correlate the results of experiments with B. O. D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.,</b> the author carried out tests on both B. O. D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.</b> of the organic matter contained in the samples of sea water, river water, sewage and night soil. The results are summarized as follows : (1) Both B. O. D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.</b> of the samples of river water obtained at low tide were higher than those of the samples obtained at high tide. At both low and high tides, the samples of the surface water of a river showed higher B. O. D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.</b> values than those of the water obtained from its bottom. It appeared that a slight shower caused B. O. D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.</b> of river water to fall, a medium rainfall caused them to rise and prolonged rain lasting several days caused them to fall. (2) Like samples of river water, those of sea water showed higher B. O. D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.</b> values at low tide than at high tide. (3) Tests for comparison of B. O. D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.</b> of the samples of sewage and those of the 1 : 2 dilution of identical samples, both kept to stand at a room temperature, showed that the decrease of B. O. D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.</b> and the decrease of the ratio B. O. D. / <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.</b> were more marked in the latter than in the former. (4) It was shown that the degree of dilution of any samples of raw night soil and its supernatant paralleled the fall in the values of their B. O. D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.</b> the rate of fall being a little smaller than the degree of dilution. (5) Tests in which samples of supernatant of night soil and their dilutions were kept standing at 30 ℃ and 37 ℃ in incubators showed that B. O. D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.</b> of the samples kept at 37 ℃ fell earlier than those of the samples kept at 30 ℃. (6) It was shown that, from the standpoint of stochastics, there were significant differences between B. O. D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>D.</b> in all the samples from river water, sea water, sewage and night soil. This indicates that there will be an agreement between the result of tests by chemical method of oxygen demand based on the use of KMnO_ 4 and the result of tests by biochemical method of determination of oxygen demand, if organic matters to be tested are of similar character...|$|E

Cyclic voltammetry in mixed media of water and organic solvents was used for this purpose. First of all, the effect of organic solvent on potential window of boron doped diamond electrode was studied. Solvents used were methanole, isopropanole, N-dimethylformamide and acetonitrile; the water components was phosphate buffer (0, 075 mol. l- 1, pH 3, 0). It was deduced from the results, that suitable solvent for detection of stigmasterol on was the acetonitrile, which provided sufficiently large potential window in anodic area.

The patterns of phosphorylated proteins were modified when larvae were incubated with bile. KEY WORDS: phosphorylated protein, Trichinella, tyrosine. MATERIALS AND METHODS T he short intestinal phase o f the parasitic nema-tode Trichinella is character ised by a rapid transformation in less than 36 hours of L 1 larvae into adults. T h e b iochemica l c h a n g e s in the intestinal environment of the larvae l iberated from the nurse cell by pepsin digestion, are fo l lowed by a shift from a coi led to a serpent ine morphology o f the larvae (Stewart et al., 1987) and the by the shed-ding of the a c c e s s o r y and external layer of the cuticle, as seen w h e n L 1 larvae undertake their first moult (Wright et al., 1988).

As calcium seemed {{to play a role}} in these morpholo-gical changes, we hypothetized that tyrosine phos-phorylated proteins and/or receptors could b e impli-cated in this process. In this study, we searched for tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in crude extracts of T. spiralis larvae. * "Signalisation cellulaire et Parasites", EA 2499 /INSERM U 529...|$|R
