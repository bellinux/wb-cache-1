5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviour,</b> producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E

25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviour</b> and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviour</b> as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E

25|$|<b>Consumer</b> <b>behaviour</b> is {{the study}} of the motivations {{surrounding}} a purchase of a product or service. It has been linked to the field of psychology, sociology and economics in attempts to analyse when, why, where and how people purchase {{in the way that they}} do. However, little literature has considered the link between our consumption behaviour and the basics of our being, our biology. Segmentation by biological driven demographics such as sex and age are already popular and pervasive in marketing. As more knowledge and research is known, targeting based on a consumers biology is of growing interest and use to marketers.|$|E
25|$|Giffen {{goods are}} {{difficult}} to study because the definition requires a number of observable conditions. One reason for the difficulty in studying market demand for Giffen goods that is Giffen originally envisioned a specific situation faced by individuals in poverty. Modern <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviour</b> research methods often deal in aggregates that average out income levels, and are too blunt an instrument to capture these specific situations. Complicating the matter are the requirements for limited availability of substitutes, {{as well as that}} the consumers are not so poor that they can only afford the inferior good. For this reason, many text books use the term Giffen paradox rather than Giffen good.|$|E
25|$|For the consumer, channel {{switching}} offers {{a more diverse}} shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to {{channel switching}} because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviour</b> is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E

40|$|Evolving <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{with regards}} to store and channel choice, {{shopping}} frequency, shopping mission and spending heighten the need for robust spatial modelling tools for use within retail analytics. The UK groceries retail sector has traditionally {{been at the forefront}} of applied retail modelling through sustained research and innovation, in-part via collaboration with academia. In this paper we report on collaboration with a major UK grocery retailer in order to assess the feasibility of modelling <b>consumer</b> store choice <b>behaviours</b> at the level of the individual consumer. We benefit from very rare access to our collaborating retailers’ customer data which we use to develop a proof-of-concept agent-based model (ABM). Utilising our collaborating retailers’ loyalty card database, we extract key <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviours</b> in relation to shopping frequency, mission, store choice and spending. We build these observed behaviours into our ABM, based on a simplified urban environment, calibrated and validated against observed consumer data. Our ABM is able to capture key spatiotemporal drivers of <b>consumer</b> store-choice <b>behaviour</b> at the individual level. This could offer considerable enhancement to traditionally-applied spatial interaction models (SIMs) which, even after considerable disaggregation, cannot fully capture the complex and individualised spatiotemporal drivers of shopping mission and store choice. Our findings could afford new opportunities for spatial modelling within the retail sector, enabling the complexity of <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviours</b> to be captured and simulated within a novel modelling framework. We reflect on further model development required for use in a commercial context for location-based decision making for store revenue estimation and impact assessment. We strongly assert that changing <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviours,</b> coupled with the growing availability of individual-level consumer data, creates a unique opportunity for a ‘step change’ in retail modelling...|$|R

Skinner, theorist of operant conditioning, {{shows how}} a pigeon has {{been taught to}} {{distinguish}} between two words and behaves appropriately depending on which one is being presented. It learned each response with a reward of food therefore its behaviour is being shaped by controlling its environment. An example of this conditioning in a <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviour</b> context is a cinema using a consumer incentive scheme.

25|$|Whether an {{individual}} develops certain diseases or disorders is also established, {{to a certain}} degree, {{on the basis of}} nature and nurture. Genes often predispose individuals to certain disorders or diseases, while environmental factors can trigger the onset. Susceptibility of diabetes is determined by inherited differences in DNA, but environmental factors such as diet, weight, age, and physical activity seem to be triggering the onset of the disease. Genetic make-up, in addition to the environment with which the genes are exposed to, is influencing the behaviour of consumers with regard to the food choices they make. Addiction to substance abuse is partially determined by genes, which predispose individuals to have addictive personalities; however the stimuli with which an addiction develops is dependent on the environment. Addiction is persistent and compulsive, and has a significant impact upon <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Individuals who experience substance abuse, for example, are prone to basing their consumption primarily around the purchasing of alcohol, even {{at the expense of other}} important aspects of well-being.|$|E

In their paper on the consumer and CSR, Janssen and Vanhamme [...] looked into a phenomenon that they termed the [...] "CSR-Consumer Paradox".

For instance, a survey by Cohn & Wolfe found that globally over 60% of consumers want to buy from responsible companies. However, Janssen and Vanhamme reported that less than 4% of average household expenditure in the UK in 2010 was ethical.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that [...] "selling arrangements" [...] would be presumed to {{not fall into}} TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected {{them in the same}} manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as [...] "in law and in fact" [...] it was an equally applicable [...] "selling arrangement" [...] (not something that alters a product's content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so {{did not need to be}} justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect [...] "in fact" [...] particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were [...] "the only effective form of promotion enabling [...] to penetrate" [...] the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' [...] "traditional social practices and to local habits and customs" [...] to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average <b>consumer</b> <b>behaviour,</b> is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice.

40|$|The {{importance}} of social networks on the Internet is constantly increasing, thus {{more and more}} consumers and companies make use of them. In order to reach their goals and communicate with consumers, companies employ social media, which includes platforms such as blogs, social networks like Facebook and many more. The use of these means depends on the company’s financial resources. Social media is unique: consumers {{can use it to}} communicate to one another, which supplements traditional communication, which is conducted by word of mouth. There is no doubt that communication among consumers highly determines consumers’ ability to receive and react to the information provided by the company – this is how consumers’ decisions are conditioned. When assessing the influence that social media has on changes in communication, the profound {{importance of}} social media cannot be ignored, since this type of media is based on consumers, who share their information on goods and services; therefore, it becomes an inherent part of marketing. Research object of the thesis: the impact that communication among consumers has on the individual <b>consumer’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the virtual environment. Aim of the thesis: to theoretically and empirically substantiate the impact of communication among consumers on individual <b>consumer’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the virtual environment. Tasks of the thesis: 1. To review the issues related to the impact of communication among consumers on individual <b>consumer’s</b> <b>behaviour.</b> 2. To analyse consumers’ behaviour in virtual environment. 3. To analyse theoretical aspects of the role of consumers in communication of companies. 4. To carry out theoretical studies of factors that determine the involvement of consumers in communication among themselves. 5. To prepare a conceptual model of the impact of communication among consumers on individual <b>consumer’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> in virtual environment. 5 6. To carry out an empirical assessment of the conceptual model of the impact of communication among consumers on individual <b>consumer’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> in virtual environment. The five hypotheses formulated in the research were confirmed after carrying out a consumers’ survey. It was proven that the factor of the social agent mostly effects consumer’s inclination to communicate with other consumers, while consumer’s intent of buying is strongly affected by the attitude that is influenced by consumers’ communication among themselves. Information communication among consumers has a greater impact on consumer’s approach towards the item and also strongly effects consumer’s intent of buying it. It was determined that informative communication among consumers has a greater impact on consumer’s intent of buying an item compared to normative communication...|$|R
