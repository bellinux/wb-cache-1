We show that domestic firms respond {{to an increase in}} the presence of foreign firms <b>by</b> increasing <b>their</b> <b>exports,</b> despite the increase in foreign presence can drive up the production cost and make domestic market more profitable. This hypothesis is then tested in China, where we find a 1 per cent increase in foreign presence causes domestic firms to increase <b>their</b> <b>exports</b> <b>by</b> 0. 74 per cent. This finding sheds light on understanding China’s massive exports and fast inflow of foreign investment observed in the past three decades. ...|$|R

Then, we show that countries enter more unrelated products when they are at an intermediate level of economic development, and when they have higher levels of human capital. Finally, we ask whether countries entering more unrelated products grow faster than those entering only related products. The data shows that countries that enter more unrelated activities experience an increase in short-term economic growth of 0. 5 % per annum compared to those with similar levels of income, human capital, capital stock per worker, and economic complexity.

40|$|The new, {{draconian}} sanctions {{introduced by}} the United States and the European Union to prevent Iran from earning money from its crude oil exports could pose a serious economic threat to oil-importing countries that also trade heavily with the US and EU economies. Nations such as China, South Korea, and Japan, which obtain significant amount of oil from Iran while enjoying large trade surpluses with the United States, are justifiably anxious. These countries and others worry that by pushing Iran from the global crude market, the new US and EU sanctions will disrupt oil markets, increase crude prices, and further slow global economic growth, which, at a minimum, would <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> <b>export</b> revenues. Saudi Arabia {{and other members of}} the Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have indicated they would replace oil previously purchased from Iran, but these offers have done little to allay the apprehensions. Verleger suggests a way to put real pressure on Iran while moderating or eliminating economic fallout for the US and EU economies and those of their trading partners: selling oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which now holds far more oil than required by treaty obligations—more than 280 million surplus barrels. This strategic use of the SPR will increase the effectiveness of sanctions on Iran and ease the adjustment difficulties that confront US allies. The sales might also reduce any price pressure caused by removal of light Iranian crude from the market. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the export}} market entry decisions of Dutch firms and their subsequent growth or market exit. Exporters, particularly when entering new markets, {{have to learn}} about market conditions and to search for new trade relations under uncertainty. In that sense the paper also investigates the role of economic diplomacy and knowledge spillovers from colleague-exporters. We combine detailed international trade data by firm and destination between 2002 and 2008 with firm data and export market characteristics in order to disentangle the firm and country determinants of successful and less successful export behaviour. First, we find that about 5 % of all Dutch exporters have just started in their first market and a similar share of exporters ceases all exports. Still, the starting exporters increase <b>their</b> <b>exports</b> very fast. In each market <b>their</b> <b>export</b> growth in <b>their</b> third year as exporter is about {{twice as high as}} for established exporters. Many starters also increase <b>their</b> <b>exports</b> <b>by</b> expanding <b>their</b> number of destinations, but they will retreat swiftly if they are not successful. For all exporters we find that more productive and larger firms are more inclined to enter (additional) export markets, and that larger firms are less likely to leave a market. Market characteristics are important as well. Distance and import tariffs reduce the probability to enter the market and increase the probability to exit. Not only distance to the home country matters, but also the distance to export markets already accessed. Firms seem to follow a stepping stone approach for reaching markets further away (physically and culturally). They first enter more nearby markets before moving to more distant markets. Finally, we find that the presence of support offices abroad and trade missions in destination countries, particularly middle income countries, stimulate the entry of new exporters and the growth of export volume. Knowledge spillovers from exporters with the same destinations have also positive effects on market entry...|$|R

In contrast, when thioredoxin is fused to a posttranslational signal sequence, very little of it appears in the periplasm. We propose that this absence of posttranslational export is due to the rapid folding of thioredoxin in the cytoplasm. We sought mutants of thioredoxin that retarded its folding in the cytoplasm, which we accomplished by fusing thioredoxin to a posttranslational signal sequence and selecting for mutants in which thioredoxin was exported to the periplasm, where it could replace DsbA.

In an attempt to identify the initial NPC docking site(s) for RNA, we have explored various conditions that either yield docking of import ligands to the NPC or inhibit the export of nuclear RNAs. Surprisingly, we failed to observe docking of RNA destined for export at the nuclear periphery of the NPC under any of these conditions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the sources of}} Belarus’s export growth and decomposes export growth into extensive and intensive margins. This study also aims to determine export margins for intermediate and final goods and to determine the price and quantity components of the intensive export margin. In order to achieve the desired objectives, we use two methods for decomposing export growth, the count method and the export shares method. We analyse Belarus's export growth using export data at the HS- 6 digit level for the 2004 - 2014 period. Our results show that Belarus's exports grew mainly due to growth in the price margin during the studied period 2004 - 2014. However, the extensive margin was important in export growth to some extent. Comparing the growth rate across final and intermediate goods reveals that although the share of final products in Belarus’s exports is not very big (18. 9 % in 2014), the average annual growth in exports of final products is {{higher than that of}} intermediate goods.

The provision of services thus participates to the perceived vertical differentiation of the goods. Under monopolistic competition, adding a service boosts firms' sales only through quantities.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the strategic pricing behaviour (Pricing to Market; PTM) policies of textile exports in the 1990 s for a hyperinflation country, Turkey, whose currency has been depreciating continually {{for the last}} two decades. The findings show that Turkish textile export categories exhibit evidence of strategic pricing behaviour when the Turkish textiles export data is analysed for different frequencies. The results show that evidence of strategic pricing behaviour is observed in response to changes in real exchange rates for textile exports for closer lagging periods and strategic pricing behaviour diminishes with further lagging periods. Also, evidence of strategic pricing behaviour is observed in a more recurrent fashion with higher frequency data, three-month periods, than with relatively lower frequency data, six-month and 12 -month periods. Another interesting finding is that Turkish textile exporters prefer to increase their prices as a reaction if they had adjusted their prices in an overshooting fashion in response to real exchange changes in the previous period. The most important finding of the paper is that while Turkish textile exporters prefer to adjust <b>their</b> <b>export</b> pricing without fully absorbing the real exchange depreciation and by increasing their relative markups for some textile categories, they prefer to adjust <b>their</b> <b>export</b> prices <b>by</b> lowering <b>their</b> markups in addition to fully absorbing the real exchange depreciation for some other textile categories in order to increase their market share overseas. ...|$|R
