Operating in the Magaliesburg area in North West Province, South Africa, Camp Sizanani offers multiple camp sessions throughout the year for children aged twelve through nineteen whose lives have been affected by HIV/AIDS. The term HIV-affected can imply that an individual is infected with the virus, but it can also mean that the infection of family members or guardians have impacted the individual's life. While some children at Camp Sizanani are HIV +, many more have been orphaned by a parent's AIDS-related death or have family members <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Nearly all of Sizanani's campers come from Soweto, Johannesburg's enormous township, to which many black Africans were relegated during South Africa's apartheid era.
