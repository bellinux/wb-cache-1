2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> <b>land,</b> negotiable instruments, uncalled shares, book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not extinguish the debt itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an unsecured creditor. In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of contractual freedom. Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be reconveyed. An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|E

50|$|Crown debt, in English law, a {{debt due}} to the crown. By various statutes, the first dating from the reign of Henry VIII of England (in 1541), the crown has {{priority}} for its debts before all other creditors. At common law the crown always had a lien on the lands and goods of debtors by record, which could be enforced even when they had passed {{into the hands of}} other persons. The difficulty of ascertaining whether lands were subject to a crown lien or not was often very great, and a remedy was provided by the Judgments Act 1839, and the Crown Suits Act Coronets of Viscounts and Barons 1865. Now by the Land Charges Act 1900, no debt {{due to the}} crown operates as a <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> until a writ of execution for the purpose of enforcing it has been registered under the Land Charges Registration and Searches Act 1888. By the Act of 1541 specialty debts were put practically on the same footing as debts by record. Simple contract debts due to the crown also become specialty debts, and the rights of the crown are enforced by a summary process called an extent.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the people lived in villages and agriculture was their main occupation. The economy of the kingdom was based on agriculture. Grains, pulses, vegetables and flowers were cultivated. Commercial crops included sugarcane and cotton. The agrarian population consisted of landlords (gavunda, zamindar, heggadde) who tilled the land by employing a number of landless labourers, usually paying them in grain. Minor cultivators were also willing to hire themselves out as labourers if the need arose. It was due to the availability of these landless labourers that kings and landlords were able to execute major projects such as palaces, temples, mosques, anicuts (dams) and tanks. Because land was abundant and the population relatively sparse, no rent was <b>charged</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> ownership.

50|$|Coign and livery or coyne and livery (coinmheadh is buannacht) in Gaelic Ireland was {{the free}} {{entertainment}} which a chief exacted from his subjects for his servants and followers. Originally in Brehon law {{it took the}} form of a feast held when the chief passed through a subject's lands. By the late medieval period it was often an oppressive charge to billet and supply the chief's professional soldiers (kern and gallowglasses), enforced by those same soldiers. It was the most important of the exactions which lesser chiefs resented of their superiors. The surrender and regrant and composition imposed by the English during the Tudor conquest of Ireland sought to abolish Gaelic customs of chiefship and replace all exactions with a single rent <b>charged</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> holdings. This was accordingly supported by the lesser chiefs, but opposed by the over chiefs such as Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare.|$|R

G/ 206 /PN-Mdn on September 8, 2006. This case has caused legal problem, for the ruling for sequestration by the District Court cannot be executed {{in the interest of the}} plaintiff. This is because the object placed on the sequestration by the District Court has been charged the first degree hypothecation by defendant, PT Pancing Business Center as a debt guarantee to PT Bank Mestika. According to Article 1, paragraph (1) of Hypothecation Law (UUHT) No. 4 / 1996,” A hypothecation is a security right which is <b>charged</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> rights as it is stipulated in Law No. 5 / 1960 on the Principal Provision of Agrarian Law, with or without other objects related to the land to the paying off, the position is prioritized to a certain creditor other than to the other creditors. ” Although the ruling about sequestration is placed on the object case (the land) by the District Court, the ruling is void (illusoir) sinct e he position of the creditor as the receiver of hypothecation is prioritized to carry out his rights according to civil law. The condition will, of course, harm the plaintiff and ignore the principle of claiming sequestration (conservatoir beslag) in order to obtain a number of properties from the defendant as collateral for the loss suffered by the plaintiff. Therefore, the judge in the civil case should be careful in using sequestration institution because, if he does not look into the object (the land) as an immovable object and makes a verdict on sequestration haphazardly, the verdict will not have any executorial power...|$|R
40|$|SONNE cruise SO 144 - 1 and 2 {{started on}} 7 September 1999 in San Diego, California, and ended on 8 November 1999 in Caldera, Costa Rica. Two visits were {{paid to the}} port of Caldera for {{exchange}} of personnel and equipment. The cruises, together with the follow-up cruise SO 144 - 3, constitute the PAGANINI (PAnama basin and GAla pagos plume - New INvestigations of Intraplate magmatism) project. After transit to the working area, the first two legs (SO 144 1 a and b) were mainly dedicated to seismic data acquisition. During the entire cruise, hydroacoustic data were collected and magnetic measurements were made whenever possible. The data sets will extend the existing database, mainly collected on previous SONNE cruises (SO 76, SO 81, SO 107), but also by other ships. They provide an essential element for the morphotectonic development of the survey area and late tectonic reconstruction. Where possible, transit profiles were placed so that unsurveyed areas were covered. First results of the newly acquired hydroacoustics indicate profound differences in the morphology of the continental slope between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which can partly be related to differences of the incoming plate, but partly also document the variability of the upper plate structure and composition. Having reached the survey area and after some investigations off Nicaragua had been performed, 14 ocean bottom stations from SCRIPPS Institute of Oceanology were installed northwest of Osa peninsula. They cover {{the region of the}} 20 August 1999 (Mw: 6. 7) earthquake and will be used for detailed studies of the processes in the seismogenic zone.
