25|$|To {{make up for}} {{the fishing}} areas lost to the 2009 {{expansion}} of the Moreton Bay Marine Park, the Queensland Government agreed to create a total of six artificial reefs for anglers. The reefs are constructed from specially designed balls of concrete which will provide habitat for fish species.

25|$|The {{recreational}} catch {{often is}} greater than the <b>commercial</b> <b>catch</b> in some areas, with a survey carried out in Blackwood River indicating 120 700 fish were taken in a year by anglers. A similar survey conducted in the South Australian Gulfs found recreational fishermen accounted for 28% of the entire yellowfin whiting taken during the 2000/2001 period, representing over 50 tonnes of fish. Recreational bag limits have been put in place to prevent over-exploitation by anglers in both states, with South Australia imposing a minimum size limit of 24cm and a bag limit of 20 fish on anglers. In Western Australia, there is no minimum size limit, but a bag limit of 40 fish in combination with school whitings (Sillago bassensis and Sillago vittata).|$|E

Design A prospective study of <b>commercial</b> <b>catches</b> of mullet in the Clarence River of NSW and individual cases from other areas.

Up to 6 % of fish were affected in <b>commercial</b> <b>catches.</b> Conclusion The infection is widespread in Australian mullet, but rarely causes significant economic loss...|$|R

Over the past decade <b>commercial</b> <b>catches</b> have fluctuated between one and two million fish annually with an additional 0. 6 – 0. 9 million fish caught in recreational, subsistence, and aboriginal fisheries.

25|$|Commercial fishing {{has always}} been an {{important}} component of the island economy. Historically, this trade included whaling and the hunting of dolphins. Until ice became available in the 1920s, the primary <b>commercial</b> <b>catch</b> was mullet, which was caught near the beaches of Shackleford Bank and Core Bank and salted on shore. In the late 19th century, the Core Sound area produced 80% of the salted mullet sold on the United States east coast. An ice plant was built in nearby Beaufort in 1920, and fish houses were established on the island to process fish and shellfish. Some bay areas on the north side of the island have been developed for harvesting cultured shellfish. In addition to mullet, the commercial fishing industry of Harkers Island brings in oysters, clams, shrimp, scallops, crabs, spot, croaker, trout, flounder, bluefish, and mackerel.|$|E

40|$|The {{results from}} {{robustness}} {{tests of the}} OMP adopted {{last year for the}} hake resource are used to assign priorities for research, with the outcome compared to that from the Environmental Risk Analysis (ERA) exercise.

2500|$|In Central America, {{the primary}} species of squat lobster {{targeted}} by fisheries is {{a species of}} Pleuroncodes. There {{is a great deal}} of confusion over both scientific names and common names, and the exact species is often unknown. In El Salvador, the <b>commercial</b> <b>catch</b> is generally referred to as [...] "P.planipes", but is in fact P.monodon, for instance. Commercial fishing for squat lobsters in El Salvador began in the early 1980s; production increased markedly in the 2001 season, and has continued to grow, now making up 98% of the demersal resources landed in El Salvador, with annual catches peaking at 13,708t in 2005. In Costa Rica, aggregations of squat lobsters are avoided, as the fishermen fear the squat lobsters will clog their nets. In Nicaragua, squat lobsters are heavily exploited, especially following a large increase in fishing effort in the 2007 season. In Panama, production reached 492t in 2008. Chilean squat lobster fisheries initially targeted Cervimunida johni, beginning in 1953. By the mid-1960s, effort had largely switched to P.monodon. In an effort to conserve stocks, the Chilean government instituted quotas for squat lobsters, and the fishery is closely monitored. In New Zealand, Munida gregaria has been considered as a potential fisheries resource, particularly to feed farmed Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).|$|E
2500|$|Up {{until the}} end of the 1950s, the most {{commonly}} caught commercial fish (more than 50% of the <b>commercial</b> <b>catch)</b> was a subspecies of the walleye known as the blue walleye (Sander vitreus glaucus) sometimes erroneously called [...] "blue pike". In the 1970s and 1980s, as pollution in the lake declined, counts of walleyes which were caught grew from 112,000 in 1975 to 4.1 million in 1985, with estimates of the numbers of walleyes in the lake at around 33 million in the basin, with many of 8 pounds or more. Not all walleyes thrived. The combination of overfishing and the eutrophication of the lake by pollution caused the population to collapse, and in the mid-1980s, one species of walleye called the blue walleye was declared extinct. But the Lake Erie walleye was reportedly having record numbers, even in 1989, according to one report. There have been concerns about rising levels of mercury in walleye fish; a study by the Canadian Ministry of the Environment noted an [...] "increasing concentration trend" [...] but that limits were within acceptable established by authorities in Pennsylvania. It was recommended, because of PCBs, that persons eat no more than one walleye meal per month. Because of these and other concerns, in 1990, the National Wildlife Federation was on the verge of having a [...] "negative fish consumption advisory" [...] for walleyes and smallmouth bass, which had been the bread-and-butter catch of an $800 million commercial fishing industry.|$|E
