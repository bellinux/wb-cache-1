25|$|The {{grant of}} {{probation}} {{may be made}} on the court's own motion. Because the power of pardoning offenders is vested in the President of the United States only, probation is not considered a pardon of any kind, but rather an authorized form of punishment of mild nature, and unlike a pardon, it cannot be refused by the <b>convicted</b> <b>person.</b> Federal courts have an inherent power to reduce a sentence, but without Congressional authorization, a federal court has no power to suspend the execution of a sentence which it has imposed or to place the defendant on probation. When this was first announced by the Supreme Court in 1916 in the case of Ex Parte United States, an abrupt halt was brought to a practice which, by then, had become widespread in the federal system, and which had existed for more than 70 years. A sentence for a period of one year with an order that, after the defendant had served three months of his sentence, probation was to be granted on the condition that the defendant abide by laws, was void for want of jurisdiction, since it was in effect an exercise of pardoning power.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{analysis}} of the types of prisons and labour camps, their structure and organization as well as the position of <b>convicted</b> <b>persons</b> while serving the punishment of imprisonment in Albania during the communist dictatorship period.

The large number of prisoners during this time-period as well as of prisons and labour camps was most of all a consequence of cruel punitive policy lead by the Albanian communist state, which as such was directed solely against the opposers of the communist regime.

2500|$|The first {{method of}} hanging was [...] "hoisting" [...] {{in which a}} rope would be thrown over a beam and the <b>convicted</b> <b>person</b> would then be hoisted into the air by others pulling on the rope.

A {{variation}} of this included the person with a rope around the neck to stand on a cart {{and then it would}} be pushed from under him. This {{led to the development of}} suspension in which [...] "the drop" [...] caused by jerking something from underneath the offender became the main component of the execution. Executioners experimented with the length of the rope for the drop. They discovered new ways of causing instant unconsciousness and quick death upon hanging. In 1872, the length of a drop extended to nearly five feet which dislocated the neck perfectly. Almost one year later, the length of the drop was extended to seven feet.|$|E

40|$|In this article, my {{contention}} is that Norway's criminal justice policy is increasingly based on principles taken from positive criminology. This {{means that the}} correctional service places strong emphasis on establishing collaboration with the local authorities (the municipalities) in order to offer <b>convicted</b> <b>persons</b> integrated services, both during and after serving their sentences. I {{also point out that}} positive criminology's principle of viewing <b>convicted</b> <b>persons</b> as unique individuals with individual problems and resources – problems to which there are rarely clear-cut solutions – means that these problems are perceived as 'wicked problems'. A recommended approach to 'wicked problems' is to establish collaboration between the different service providers involved. The article describes the experiences gained from a pilot project that entailed offering a training programme to <b>convicted</b> <b>persons</b> with substance abuse problems. One of the goals of the project was to link the programme to an offer of integrated services after the sentence had been served. The experiences described in semi-structured interviews with 16 <b>convicted</b> <b>persons,</b> seven correctional service employees and three local authority employees was that it was difficult to put in place such an integrated service package. On this basis, I discuss the reasons why it was so difficult to achieve the desired collaboration, and I outline some proposals for how these challenges can be resolved in future. </p...|$|R
