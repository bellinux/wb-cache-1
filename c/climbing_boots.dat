500|$|Shackleton {{refused to}} pack {{supplies}} {{for more than}} four weeks, knowing that if they did not reach South Georgia within that time, the boat and its crew would be lost. The James Caird was launched on 24 April 1916; during the next fifteen days, it sailed through the waters of the southern ocean, {{at the mercy of the}} stormy seas, in constant peril of capsizing. On 8 May, thanks to Worsley's navigational skills, the cliffs of South Georgia came into sight, but hurricane-force winds prevented the possibility of landing. The party was forced to ride out the storm offshore, in constant danger of being dashed against the rocks. They later learned that the same hurricane had sunk a 500-ton steamer bound for South Georgia from Buenos Aires. On the following day, they were able, finally, to land on the unoccupied southern shore. After a period of rest and recuperation, rather than risk putting to sea again to reach the whaling stations on the northern coast, Shackleton decided to attempt a land crossing of the island. Although it is likely that Norwegian whalers had previously crossed at other points on ski, no one had attempted this particular route before. For their journey, the survivors were only equipped with boots they had pushed screws into to act as <b>climbing</b> <b>boots,</b> a carpenter's adze, and 50 feet of rope. Leaving McNish, Vincent and McCarthy at the landing point on South Georgia, Shackleton travelled [...] with Worsley and Crean over extremely dangerous mountainous terrain for 36 hours to reach the whaling station at Stromness on 20 May.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not quite}} {{know how it}} happened, my {{recollection}} of the whole matter ebbing in a somewhat clouded condition. I fancy I had gone somewhere on a botanizing expedition, but whether at home or abroad I don't know. At all events, I remember that I had taken up the study of plants with {{a good deal of}} enthusiasm, and that while hunting for some variety in the mountains I sat down to rest {{on the edge of a}} ravine. Perhaps it was on the ledge of an overhanging rock; anyhow, if I remember rightly, the ground gave way all about me, precipitating me below. The fall was a very considerable one--probably thirty or forty feet, or more, and I was rendered unconscious. How long I lay there under the heap of earth and stones carried down in my fall it is impossible to say: perhaps a long time; but at last I came to myself and struggled up from the debris, like a mole coming to the surface of the earth to feel the genial sunshine on his dim eyeballs. I found myself standing (oddly enough, on all fours) in an immense pit created by the overthrow of a gigantic dead tree with a girth of about thirty or forty feet. The tree itself had rolled down to the bottom of the ravine; but the pit in which it had left the huge stumps of severed roots was, I found, situated in a gentle slope at the top of the bank! How, then, I could have fallen seemingly so far from no height at all, puzzled me greatly: it looked as if the solid earth had been indulging in some curious transformation pranks during those moments or minutes of insensibility. Another singular circumstance was that I had a great mass of small fibrous rootlets tightly woven about my whole person, so that I was like a colossal basket-worm in its case, or a big man-shaped bottle covered with wicker-work. It appeared as if the roots had grown round me! Luckily they were quite sapless and brittle, and without bothering my brains too much about the matter, I set to work to rid myself of them. After stripping the woody covering off, I found that my tourist suit of rough Scotch homespun had not suffered much harm, although the cloth exuded a damp, moldy smell; also that my thick-soled <b>climbing</b> <b>boots</b> had assumed a cracked rusty appearance as if I had been engaged in some brick-field operations; while my felt hat was in such a discolored and battered condition that I felt almost ashamed to put it on my head. My watch was gone; perhaps I had not been wearing it, but my pocket-book in which I had my money was safe in my breast pocket.|$|E
50|$|Danieli, {{helped by}} his wife, managed to {{successfully}} launch his first product, mountain <b>climbing</b> <b>boots.</b> During the 1950s, {{a reputation for}} excellence and quality helped the company grow and become a familiar name throughout the Italian market.|$|E
60|$|Again {{they took}} no notice, but, {{guided by the}} elder girl, set {{themselves}} to <b>climb,</b> <b>boots</b> and all, on to the green plush sofa {{in front of the}} radiator. The little boys had to be pushed, as they could not compass the stretch unaided. They settled themselves in a row, with small gasps of relief, and pawed the plush approvingly.|$|R
50|$|The next day, two Spanish climbers, Pepe Garces and Lorenzo Ortas (not Lorenzo Ortíz, who {{was killed}} in the storm), who had survived the storm at Camp 4, were {{descending}} the mountain suffering from frostbite and exhaustion. Before reaching Camp 3 they found a bloodstained anorak, a <b>climbing</b> <b>boot,</b> and a harness. They recognized the equipment as belonging to Hargreaves. From Camp 3 they could also see a body in the distance. They did not approach the body, so it was not positively identified, but they had little doubt it was Hargreaves' and concluded she had been blown off the mountain during the storm.|$|R

After the incident, Captain Fawad Khan, the Pakistani army officer who was the team's intermediary with the rescue services, stated that he had urged her not to climb beyond base camp because it would be [...] "suicidal" [...] in the deteriorating weather conditions.|$|R
50|$|Eckenstein {{was also}} a pioneer in {{developing}} new equipment and climbing methods. He started using shorter ice axes {{which could be used}} single-handed, designed the modern crampons and improved on the nail patterns used for the <b>climbing</b> <b>boots.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1939, {{after years}} of {{experience}} as traders in hides, the brothers Adriano and Oddone Vaccari founded “Nordica” in Montebelluna, making casual footwear. In the after-war years Nordica specialised in ski boots, although continuing to supply the market with cross-country ski shoes and <b>climbing</b> <b>boots.</b> Work was still seasonal and the equipment manual.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolution}} in equipment {{has been driven}} by the competition scene, resulting in leashless ice axes and lightweight ice <b>climbing</b> <b>boots</b> with integral crampons. Heel spurs were popular in the 1990's but their use has since been frowned upon by many activists and they have since been banned from competitions. Many of these evolutions have been embraced by the wider winter climbing community.|$|E
50|$|The initial trail {{leads to}} a series of rifugios, which is Italian for refuges, like the first Rifugio Coca {{mountain}} hut. This is a hike to this stage or refuge. Past Rifugio Coca, becomes a YDS 3 or a climbing route with scrambling uphill amongst boulders, creeks, cliffs and zig-zag markers. Based upon exposure to falling and increased YDS 3+ in some hard rock climb areas, climbing equipment like rope, <b>climbing</b> harness, <b>boots,</b> crampons, ice axes, snowshoes and skis is recommended.|$|R
5000|$|... 1889 {{saw another}} round of deaths {{attributed}} to alternating current including a lineman in Buffalo, New York, four linemen in New York City, and a New York fruit merchant who was killed when the display he was using {{came in contact with}} an overhead line. NYC Mayor Hugh J. Grant, in a meeting with the Board of Electrical Control and the AC electric companies, rejected the claims that the AC lines were perfectly safe saying [...] "we get news of all who touch them through the coroners office". On October 11, 1889 John Feeks, a Western Union lineman, was high up in the tangle of overhead electrical wires working on what were supposed to be low-voltage telegraph lines in a busy Manhattan district. As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high-voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded <b>climbing</b> <b>boot.</b> Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering {{for the better part of}} an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below. Where the power came from that killed Feeks was not determined although United States Illuminating Company lines ran near by.|$|R
50|$|Ariel has {{a strange}} {{compulsion}} to acquire shoes of all type, color, style and brands. Frequently, he starts {{a search for}} extremely comfortable footwear {{and for the most}} diverse use: from some simple sandals, the most fine and exclusive moccasins, all terrain mountain <b>climbing</b> certified <b>boots,</b> until his favorite ones, sport shoes ("tennis shoes") that usually involve the highest vanguard and technology in comfort, flexibility, durability, style, etc. Finding out the origin of this footwear’s obsession, Ariel explains that is a kind of acting exercise because he considers that a character expresses his essence, nature and personality through the footwear. It is a common practice in Ariel when a new role is assigned to match the most appropriate pair of shoes so he can “get into the part” faster.|$|R
5000|$|Mount Genecand (...) is a {{mountain}} {{at the head}} of Barilari Bay between Lawrie Glacier and Weir Glacier, on the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica. It was photographed by Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd in 1955-57, and mapped from these photos by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1959 for Félix-Valentin Genecand (1878-1957), a Swiss mountaineer who invented the Tricouni nail for <b>climbing</b> <b>boots</b> shortly before World War I.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the typical ice axe shaft {{measured}} 120-130 cm in length. Eckenstein started {{the trend toward}} shorter ice axes with a lighter model measuring 85-86 cm, {{which could be used}} single handed. Initially, this innovation was criticised by well-known climbers of the era, including his nemesis Martin Conway, a prominent member of the Alpine Club. Eckenstein is also credited with designing the modern crampon as well as analysing both knots and nail patterns for <b>climbing</b> <b>boots.</b>|$|E
50|$|Built in 1947, the Gloucester Tree was one {{of eight}} karri trees that between 1937 and 1952 were made {{relatively}} easy to climb {{so that they could}} be used as fire lookout spots. The suitability of the tree as a fire lookout was tested by forester Jack Watson, who climbed the tree using <b>climbing</b> <b>boots</b> and a belt. It took Watson six hours to climb 58 metres, a difficult climb due to the 7.3 metre girth of the tree and the need to negotiate through limbs from 39.6 metres up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right {{before the}} boot was the postilion's seat. It {{was a little}} lower than my seat, and was large enough for two. The conductor's seat {{was at the end}} of my seat, under the bellows-top. There was one thing curious about his seat, and that is, that there was a joint in the iron bar of the boot, so that he could open his end of it, and get out and in without {{disturbing}} the boot before the rest of the passengers. When I wanted to get out I had to <b>climb</b> over the <b>boot</b> to the postilion's seat, and so get down by the little iron steps.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Lawrie {{was born}} in Burnley. He trained as a shoe and boot maker at his father's firm which he later ran. By the late 1920s he had become an {{accomplished}} climber and alpinist, {{and he started to}} design, manufacture and supply mountaineering boots to his own design. His boots proved popular and he was commissioned to supply boots for the 1933 Everest expedition led by Hugh Ruttledge. [...] In 1935 he moved the business, now known as Robert Lawrie Ltd, to London, eventually working out of premises in his home in Seymour Street. He provided <b>boots,</b> <b>climbing</b> and mountaineering equipment to many expeditions including John Hunt's successful 1953 Everest campaign, for which he trained Wilfred Noyce in the art of boot repair.|$|R
5000|$|Robots {{based on}} the {{physiology}} and methods of locomotion of animals include BionicKangaroo which moves like a kangaroo, saving energy from one jump and transferring it to its next jump, and <b>climbing</b> robots, <b>boots</b> and tape mimicking geckos feet and their ability for adhesive reversal. Kamigami Robots, a children's toy, mimic cockroach locomotion to run quickly and efficiently over indoor and outdoor surfaces. Nanotechnology surfaces that recreate properties of shark skin are intended to enable more efficient movement through water. [...] Tire treads {{have been inspired by}} the toe pads of tree frogs. The self-sharpening teeth of many animals have been copied to make better cutting tools. Protein folding is used to control material formation for self-assembled functional nanostructures. The Structural coloration of butterfly wings is adapted to provide improved interferometric modulator displays and everlasting colours. New ceramics copy the properties of seashells. Polar bear fur has inspired the design of thermal collectors and clothing. The arrangement of leaves on a plant has been adapted for better solar power collection. The light refractive properties of the moth's eye has been studied to reduce the reflectivity of solar panels. Self-healing materials, polymers and composite materials capable of mending cracks have been produced based on biological materials.|$|R
5000|$|The First Step {{consists}} of large boulders that pose a serious obstacle, even for experienced climbers, {{because of their}} height above sea level. Many mountaineers have died on the First Step, among them [...] "Green Boots", a corpse wearing neon green <b>climbing</b> <b>boots</b> and a red coat, {{which serves as a}} somber landmark for climbers to gauge their distance to the top, which has now been possibly identified as Tsewang Paljor. His fellow climbers, who also perished on the same day as he in 1996, are Tsewang Smanla and Dorje Morup. Other climbers have died under that rock, as well, namely David Sharp and Francys Arsentiev.|$|E
5000|$|In July 1984, a small Australian team {{headed to}} {{the north side of}} Mt Everest where they {{prepared}} and ascended an unclimbed route on the north face, climbing without bottled oxygen in a lightweight alpine style and without the help of high altitude porters. On 3 October 1984, climbing in cross-country ski boots as substitutes for his high altitude <b>climbing</b> <b>boots</b> that had been lost in an earlier avalanche, Macartney-Snape and Greg Mortimer became the first Australians to climb Mt Everest, an achievement for which he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for services to mountaineering. Mt Everest historian, Walt Unsworth, described it as [...] "one of the greatest climbs ever done on the mountain" [...] and American climber, John Roskelley, said, [...] "the Aussies pulled off the coup of the century". The expedition was sponsored by Channel 9 who produced a television documentary about the expedition.|$|E
50|$|Each guide {{includes}} {{a list of}} the principal peaks and details of towns and villages useful for supplies, and closest points of access to the routes. Important national footpaths such as the Pennine Way are mentioned. He {{includes a}}dvice on essential equipment such as clothing including anorak or cagoule, compass, aneroid barometer, map, rucksack and <b>climbing</b> <b>boots</b> (the most important item), and when necessary, ice axe. Tweed is preferable to corduroy or cotton, and he personally prefers plus fours. Woollen clothing, especially pullovers or sweaters are also useful, and external clothing should be coloured red for visibility. He mentions hobnailed boots in one volume (The Lakes), but they are no longer available, having been displaced by the lighter vibrams with serrated rubber soles. To conserve heat, he recommends either a Bob-cap or balaclava, while a string vest is advisable to prevent heat loss in the cold. Essential foods included sweets for energy and water to prevent dehydration.|$|E
5000|$|The carcass {{was brought}} to the stern of the factory ship, where several other {{carcasses}} could be waiting to be processed. A line was looped around the small of its tail and it {{was brought to}} the bottom of the slipway, where the small of its flukes was secured by a whale claw (a giant pair of tongs invented by the Norwegian Anton Gjelstad in 1931) and pulled up unto the deck of the ship by powerful steam winches. On each side of the whale there were large chocks built into the deck so the carcass wouldn't roll in a rough sea. Two flensers, one on each side, cut longitudinal slits along the length of the body, while another man with spiked <b>boots</b> <b>climbed</b> atop the whale to make further cuts. With the use of a winch on an arch at the center of the ship two strips of blubber were pulled off (like the peeling of a banana), which was attended by [...] "a crackling like a bonfire of peasticks." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1885, she {{discovered}} her enthusiasm for mountaineering, and ascended the three hundred foot summit of Cape Misenum in Italy and small mountain passes in Switzerland, including Theodul Pass, at ten thousand feet. While in Greece, she climbed Mount Hymettus and Mount Pentecus, both {{between three and}} four thousand feet. From 1881 to 1892 she was a pioneering professor {{in the field of}} archeology and Latin at Purdue University and Smith College. She began to make money on the lecture circuit, and by 1892 she gave up teaching and made her living by lecturing and writing about archeology, mountaineering and her travels. She scaled a number of moderate-sized mountains in Europe and in the United States, including Mount Shasta. In 1895 Peck followed in Englishwoman Lucy Walker's footsteps and ascended the Matterhorn, but the accomplishment was overshadowed by what she wore during the climb: a long tunic, <b>climbing</b> <b>boots,</b> and a pair of pants. At the time, women were being arrested for wearing trousers in public, and so Peck's climbing costume not only brought about serious hullabaloo in the press, but also prompted public discussion and debate (for example, in the New York Times) on the question of what women should do and what they can be.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} have showed that cold injuries of feet occur {{more often than}} cold injuries of hands. Recently, an unexpectedly large number of cold injuries were observed during military training in Norway and a relationship between cold injuries {{and the use of}} the Alico ski boot was suspected. The Marine Corps and the Defence Clothing agency asked TNO to investigate whether the Alico ski boot, in combination with the Berghaus gaiter, and the arctic sock would lead to an increased risk for cold injuries. Tests with several ski boot combinations were performed to measure the water vapour transport and the water tightness. Both worn and unworn ski boots were tested with and without a gaiter. The results were compared with the results of the Meindl climbing boot. The water vapour transport was measured using a thermal sweating foot model which was placed in a boot combination during three days for a couple of hours (indicate a more precise duration) a day. The water tightness was measured using a walking simulator where boots walked in a water tank. Both worn ski and <b>climbing</b> <b>boots</b> were tested by 8 marines in a climatic chamber of - 18 ¦C. The subjects rested on a chair in the climatic chamber for the first half hour, walked on a treadmill for the second half hour and stood still for the last half hour. Several skin temperatures (indicate the number of sites) of the feet were measured. The subjects also provided regular information about their thermal sensations and comfort. A worn ski boot has higher water vapour absorption and lower water vapour transmission than an unworn ski boot. During water evaporation periods about half of the water absorption evaporated from both worn and unworn boots. Wearing a gaiter with the ski boot gives a lower water vapour transmission and a higher resistance to heat. The ski boots have higher water vapour absorption, a slightly lower water vapour desorption and a slightly lower water vapour transmission than the climbing boot. None of the tested boots are waterproof. More water leaks in a worn ski boot than in an unworn ski boot. The climbing boot gives the best results on water tightness. No significant differences were found between the different kind of boot combinations concerning temperature and comfort and thermal sensations. Worn ski boots absorb more sweat and evaporate less sweat than unworn ski boots. By wearing a gaiter even less sweat can evaporate. The ski boots are not waterproof and water leaks in faster when shoes are worn. The <b>climbing</b> <b>boots</b> are not waterproof either, but water leaks in slower and the feet stay dry for longer periods. The boot combinations give equal temperatures and temperature decreases or increases. Also the comfort and thermal sensations are equal. The greatest problem is the ski boot not being waterproof which gives more leaking in of water and a faster cooling down of the feet. This could lead to earlier development of cold injuries...|$|E
