5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; turbocharger for reduced engine lag and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|E

The mathematic model for describing the dead-band {{characteristics of the}} electro-hydraulic servo-driven <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is built. The effect of driving system leakage of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on the performances of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is analyzed. The results show that the dead band of the electro-hydraulic servo-driven <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> increases with the rise of the system leakage, the leakage affects the response rapidity and the control accuracy of the <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> and the <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> effect on the pressure pulsation of the mixed gas decreases with the increase of the system leakage...|$|R

25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> such as motor-operated <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|E

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R

25|$|Due to the {{breakage}} of one {{of three}} flow <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> on the previous flight, STS-126, the flow valves of all orbiters were subjected to tests to determine if Discovery was safe to fly. These valves are used to synchronize the flow of gaseous hydrogen between the external fuel tank and the Space Shuttle Main Engines, creating an even flow. Following the testing of the valves, mission managers decided to postpone the launch, and engineers were asked to replace the suspect flow valves with valves that had less flight time.|$|E

The normal coolant flow is 8000m³/h per pump; this is throttled down by <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> to 6000–7000m³/h when the reactor power is below 500MWt. Each pump has a flow control valve and a backflow preventing check valve on the outlet, and shutoff valves on both inlet and outlet.

According to a lawyer for the families, speaking in a press conference along with the secretary for the Adam Air KI-574 Passengers' Families Association (formed in the aftermath of the disaster), 30 of the victims' families intend to sue Boeing instead of Adam Air over the accident. However, this does not necessarily mean that all of the others will sue Adam Air, as they may not necessarily exercise their right to sue at all. Representatives of the families have explained that they believe the plane was brought down by a faulty rudder control valve although there is no evidence that proves this, similarly to the accidents involving United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427, which went down in the early 1990s. They have explained that, as a result, they are suing Boeing and Parker Hannifin, the valve's manufacturer, although airlines using the 737 have been warned about problems with the rudder <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|E
25|$|Air {{brakes on}} the train are {{supplied}} with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air.

When the air brake <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car.

Also, the TSB found that the “reset safety control” on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train’s brakes in the event of an engine failure.|$|E
