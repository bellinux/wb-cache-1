Despite the package of institutional, regulatory and structural reforms that made Poland a leader of economic transition among post-communist countries, the disinflation process in the country was not fast and presented a lot of signs of inflationary inertia. This paper attempts to answer why the pace of disinflation in Poland, considered as evident reform leader in the all region has been much slower than in some other countries, who were considered sometimes less advanced in transition process. To answer this question, the study presents a comparative <b>cross-countries</b> <b>analysis</b> of disinflationary process in post-communist countries. The study covers the period of 1990 - 1997 with more focus on 1993 - 1997.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{investigate}} whether, and, if so, to what extent, the valuation that nations place on individual personality traits change with economic growth and development. Design/methodology/approach – The paper compares the averages of the cross-country valuations of eight different personality characteristics for various levels of development, and, in addition, employs <b>cross-country</b> regression <b>analysis</b> {{to assess the impact}} of economic growth on the value placed on these characteristics. Findings – In general, the findings of both the comparative <b>analysis</b> and the <b>cross-country</b> regression <b>analysis</b> indicate that the valuation counties place on individual personality characteristics change with economic growth and development, and for certain characteristics, rather dramatically. Research limitations/implications – A major implication of the findings of the paper is that economic growth may not just act in a neutral fashion by merely providing additional material goods, but may have profound effect on future national identity, on the definition of the type of individual that a nation values. Practical implications – Since economic growth changes the way personality characteristics are valued by a nation, it is possible that the growth process itself can alter the future growth prospects of a nation, because some personality characterizes are apt to be growth fostering, while others are likely to be growth inhibiting. Originality/value – The paper should be of interest to anyone interested in the changes brought about by growth and development.
