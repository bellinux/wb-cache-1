Accurate <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> forecasting is essential to all contractors in the construction Industry for successful operation and existence in the long run. At initial stages of a project the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> aspect of the contractor is negative. The main role of project financing is to cover up this negative flow in a beneficial, cost effective manner. Mobilization Advance Payment enhances the quality and productivity in the construction industry. It improves the performance and cost efficiency of the contractors as well as the clients. Cash data in relation to thirty projects were collected. Three criteria, no Mobilization Advance, 20 % of the initial contract sum as the Mobilization Advance paid at the inception of the project and 20 % of the initial contract sum as Mobilization Advance given in stages, were identified to determine the differences in the effects of <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b> The effect of these different criteria on the cumulative <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> was examined. Further Scheduled Performance Index was calculated for further analysis. Results show and confirm that Mobilization Advance Payment has a big bearing on the contractors' existence and their motivation towards attaining objectives of the project. Research confirms that Mobilization Advance Payment is a necessity in the Sri Lankan construction industry. Further it can be confirmed that the provision of Mobilization Advance Payment is very essential for the Sri Lankan contractors.

40|$|Traditional {{monitoring}} {{methods for}} construction project control {{based on the}} earned-value method provide measures of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and <b>schedule</b> compliance. However, they do not tell managers anything about the quality (stability, continuity) of the workflow, {{and the results are}} not timely enough for effective control. In order to improve workflows where lean production control is applied, direct measures of workflow are needed. Kalsaas and others have proposed measures of daily or weekly workflow for specific tasks, but their measures cannot be used for real-time project control and they were not tested or calibrated over complete project life-spans. The Lean Workflow Index (LWI) that we propose directly reflects the smoothness and continuity of workflow lines in flowline charts. In the first stage we define a set of possible tracking parameters and propose the lean workflow index formula as a combination of them. A survey of lean experts was conducted in which they graded workflow quality for as-built flowline records for 12 projects. The results of the survey were then used to calibrate parameter coefficient values in the LWI formula by using a goal seeking algorithm. The resulting formula was used to compute the LWI for three high-rise residential projects. The major advantage of the proposed lean workflow index is that it monitors project workflows in real-time so that construction teams can be continuously aware of and improve their performance in the areas that are measured.

Analysis tools used in this study is a multiple linear regression analysis where the analysis used to determine the effect of variable X consists of Variable Operating <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> Changes (X 1), change in Investment <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> (X 2), and Financing <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> Changes (X 3), the Stock Return (Y) in the BEI Manufacturing Company. Hypothesis testing using the F test to simultaneously test the dependent variable against independent variables, t tests to demonstrate the influence of partially dependent variables against independent variables Results of analysis showed that simultaneous changes in operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> investment <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and financing <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> has a significant impact on stock returns. While In partial, changes in operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> have an effect on stock returns, while changes in investment <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and financing <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> does not have an effect on stock retur...|$|R

40|$|The thesis investigates {{construction}} project <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> It {{is divided into}} two main components. The first investigates the cumulative gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> profiles (S curves), and the second examines the cumulative net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> profiles. The gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model can be used by either construction industry clients or contractors, whereas the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model concerns the contractor. Interest in {{construction project}} <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> resulted from changed economic pressures in the 1970 s. A rise in inflation was associated with increased client attention to his gross <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> to the contractor, and similarly higher interest rates had the effect that contractors became concerned with their net <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> An examination of the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> literature found that most models were aimed at discovering generally applicable ideal curves. A similar situation existed within the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> literature. It was argued that the averaging approach is unsuitable for construction project <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> research, and consequently an approach which concentrates on the individual project was pursued. A gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was developed using logistic transformation regression procedures. This yielded excellent results for post-hoc analysis of individual project data. Furthermore the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was found to be suitable for the generation of a construction project net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model, which was similarly oriented towards the post-hoc analysis of single projects. A measure of deviation was used which enabled the identification of projects for which the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was a poor fit. This same procedure was used to exclude projects from the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> analysis. The results from the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model analysis indicate that projects do vary considerably from one to another, and this supports the contention made that an individual approach to this research is necessary. The net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model yields an excellent trend line for net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> on a project, and thus provides an excellent means for senior management to judge the quality of management employed on a projectRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
