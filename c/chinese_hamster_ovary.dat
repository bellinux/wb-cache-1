The goal of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of starch-coated, aminated, and PEGylated SPIONs on a cell line derived from <b>Chinese</b> <b>Hamster</b> <b>ovaries</b> (CHO-K 1 cells). We evaluated the effect of particle diameter (50 and 100 nm) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain length (2 k, 5 k and 20 k Da) on the cytotoxicity of SPIONs by investigating cell viability using the tetrazolium dye 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays. The kinetics and extent of SPION uptake by CHO-K 1 cells was also studied, as well as the resulting generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cell toxicity profiles of SPIONs correlated strongly with their cellular uptake kinetics, which was strongly dependent on surface properties of the particles. PEGylation caused a decrease in both uptake and cytotoxicity compared to aminated SPIONs. Interestingly, 2 k Da PEG-modifed SPIONs displayed the lowest cellular uptake and cytotoxicity among all studied particles.

[...] In particular, in a study using somatic cell hybrids of XR-1 cells and human fibroblasts, Giaccia et al. (1989) showed that the XR-1 mutation was a recessive mutation; [...] and in follow-up to this work, Giaccia et al. (1990) carried out further studies examining the XR-1 mutation (again using somatic cell hybrids formed between XR-1 and human fibroblasts) and were able to map the human complementing gene to chromosome 5 using chromosome-segregation analysis. [...] Giaccia et al, tentatively assigned this human gene the name “XRCC4” (an abbreviation of “X-ray-complementing Chinese hamster gene 4”) and determined that (a) the newly named XRCC4 gene biochemically restored the hamster defect to normal levels of resistance to gamma-ray radiation and bleomycin and (b) the XRCC4 gene restored the proficiency to repair DNA DSBs. [...] Based on these findings, Giaccia et al. proposed that XRCC4 ― as a single gene― was responsible for the XR-1 phenotype.|$|E

Using a baculovirus insect cell expression system can reduce the production time of influenza vaccines from 6 months to 4 months. The other cell line considered, <b>Chinese</b> <b>Hamster</b> <b>Ovaries,</b> was determined to be unfavorable due to safety concerns. It was determined that disposable technology would be ideal for the process, as it allows production scale up with minimal capital investment. The disposable technology employed in the facility was found to be more economically viable than conventional multi-use technology. The facility still requires the use of some multi-use components, such as chromatography and diafiltration, but single use technology is employed where possible. Examining the project, a lifespan of 23 years was determined to be appropriate for demonstrating the economic feasibility of the project. It was found that the minimum IRR at current prices was 33. 36 %. With a 12 % discrete interest rate, the net present value of the facility is $ 278 million, for a total capital investment of $ 149 million.
