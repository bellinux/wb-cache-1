40|$|This paper {{examines}} the factors influencing the globalisation of R&D, {{with a particular}} focus {{on the role of}} tax policy, using panel data for 25 OECD countries over the period 1980 - 2005. Two measures of globalisation are considered - R&D directly financed from abroad and R&D expenditure by affiliates of US multinational enterprises (MNEs). The econometric analysis, which controls for other determinants of inter-country differences in R&D investment, finds no evidence that host country tax policy is an important determinant of MNE location decisions or in attracting <b>cross-border</b> <b>contract</b> R&D. There is evidence that affiliate fixed capital stock and total sales are strong determinants of R&D performed by affiliates of US MNEs. Controlling for these variables, host country attributes seemed to be less important. In the case of <b>cross-border</b> <b>contract</b> R&D, host country expenditure on R&D via institutions of higher education is also found to be important.

In this paper, I indicate to what extent the transparency requirement may play a role in determining the language in which the standard contract terms are to be drafted. Finally, on the basis of experiments I conducted with colleagues, I conclude that traders should be required to provide the standard contract terms in the contracting language, but that there is no need to require them to provide the standard contract terms in the consumer’s mother tongue...|$|E
40|$|Globalization and {{digitalization}} {{of international}} sales creates needs to harmonize rules of international commercial contracts. The {{question is whether}} the harmonization should be done by binding rules or using soft law tools or through digitalization. In this article I argue on favor of harmonization through international contracts law rules ’ international interpretation. The international interpretation principles used in this article are found from on Art. 7 (1) of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) which sets three interpretation rules: international character; promoting uniformity; and observance of good faith in international trade. These principles are not only principles of the CISG, but also principles commonly recognized in international commercial practice and also in domestic contract rules. I argue that by adopting an international interpretation umbrella – the meta-principle of international interpretation, cross-border contracts could be interpreted under the same principle no matter applicable substantial law. The meta-principle functions as an interpretation umbrella covering general principles and Articles of the CISG, general principles of international commercial contracts, Lex Mercatoria, and <b>cross-border</b> <b>contract</b> provision under national law. The outcomes points out that arbitral tribunals have interpreted general principles of the CISG and Lex Mercatoria in various ways. General principles and their application in case law is analyzed in connection with the Civil Code of the Russian Federation. Tribunals found that general principles of the CISG are applicable even if the CISG is not. It follows Art. ’s 7 (2) logic to promote international standard to cross-border contracts where the closes connection is international commercial practice rather than any national jurisdiction. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objectives Contracting health {{services}} outside the public, statutory health system entails purchasing capacity from domestic non-public providers or from providers abroad. Over the last decade, these practices {{have made their}} way into European health systems, brought about by performance-oriented reforms and EU principles of free movement. The aim of the article is to explain the development, functioning, purposes and possible implications of <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracting.</b> Methods Primary and secondary sources on purchasing from providers abroad have been collected in a systematic way and analysed in a structured frame. Results We found practices in six European countries. The findings suggest that purchasers from benefit-in-kind systems contract capacity abroad when this responds to unmet demand; pressures domestic providers; and/or offers financial advantages, especially where statutory purchasers compete. Providers which receive patients tend to be located in countries where treatment costs are lower and/or where providers compete. The modalities of purchasing and delivering care abroad vary considerably depending on contracts being centralised or direct, the involvement of middlemen, funding and pricing mechanisms, cross-border pathways and volumes of patient flows. Conclusions The arrangements and concepts which <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracting</b> relies on suggest that statutory health purchasers, under pressure to deliver value for money and striving for cost-efficiency, experiment with new ways of organising {{health services}} for their populations. <b>Cross-border</b> <b>contracting</b> Health services Patient mobility Competition Performance Waiting lists EU...|$|R
40|$|The Roadmap for {{completing}} the Digital Single Market Strategy, published on 6 May 2015 underlines {{the need of}} legislative proposals for simple and effective <b>cross-border</b> <b>contract</b> rules {{in order to create}} better access for both consumers and businesses to digital goods and services across Europe. The absence of consistent EU wide objectives and criteria creates entrance barriers, hinders competition and reduces predictability for investors throughout Europe. Already in 2011 digital content products were the subject of specific provisions in the Directive 2011 / 83 /EU on consumer rights (CRD) and in the Proposal for a Common European Sales Law (CESL). The aim of the EU legislator was for these measures to stimulate the circulation of digital content products within the EU, to contribute to enhancing consumer protection and therefore also consumer confidence in cross-border transactions, as well as to encourage the standardization of the involved contracts. By focusing on the specific provisions of CRD concerning distance contracts to be concluded by electronic means this contribution aims to offer some thoughts about the methodological approach of the EU legislator to digital content products. With the CRD as its focal point, the contribution also engages in a wider analysis of some crucial issues of EU contract law. The analysis of positive aspects as well of problems and fragmentation which have arisen from the implementation of the CRD is thought to provide useful guidance for the question which path the EU legislator should take for the next stage of drafting the new ‘Digital Single Market Strategy’ for Europe. I begin with some general observations on the degree of harmonization that the EU legislator seeks to pursue in its legislation before moving to the more specific issue of ‘internet cost traps’ and the method of sanctioning these suggested by the CRD...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we criticize the {{so-called}} more economic approach to European competition law for disregarding {{the importance of a}} functional system of private law. Based on the availability of market governance as an alternative mode for organizing transactions, it is presumed that vertical integration, which is the central organizational structure of transnational corporations, is economically efficient. Since the enforcement of <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracts</b> by state-organized systems of private law, however, is insufficient, 2 ̆ 2 make-or-buy 2 ̆ 2 decisions in international commerce are prejudiced against arms 2 ̆ 7 length transactions in markets. Consequently, international transactions are integrated vertically into firms 2 ̆ 7 structures to a higher degree than comparable domestic transactions organized in the shadow of domestic private law. The resulting overintegration of world markets leads to reduced competitive incentives and high bureaucratic costs. Contrary to the fundamental assumptions of the more economic approach, vertical integration does not, therefore, foster consumer welfare in the global economy per se. However, as this overintegration is a reasonable reaction to the deficits in state protection of <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracts,</b> a strict world antitrust law cannot counter it without suppressing cross-border exchange. Thus, international private law policy establishing legal certainty in the enforcement of <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracts</b> currently seems to be the instrument of choice in promoting competition in the global economy.

40|$|Commercial parties {{commonly}} {{resolve their}} disputes in arbitration rather than courts. In fact, some estimate {{that as many}} as 90 percent of international commercial contracts opt for arbitration of future disputes, and others claim that some industries never resort to courts. However, a study of arbitration clauses {{in a wide variety of}} contracts, including franchise agreements, CEO employment contracts, technology contracts, joint venture agreements and consumer cell phone contracts, reveals that parties very often carve out a right to resort to courts for the resolution of claims designed to protect information, innovation, and reputation. Studies of international and <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracts</b> indicate that the preference for courts requires that parties are comfortable with available court systems, but when courts are thought to adequately protect information and innovation, they appear to be superior to arbitration.

If it would be enacted as it is currently drafted, the proposal would mean a significant shift in favour of sellers in most EU Member States, as further-reaching national consumer protection rules would have to be abrogated because of the full harmonization nature of the directive, whereas the level of protection offered by the directive is in some respects even lower than the existing minimum.

40|$|International audienceThe {{forthcoming}} instrument on European contract law, be it in {{the shape}} of an optional code for <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracts</b> or as an official toolbox for the European legislator, is likely to have a spill-over effect on adjudication. Judges will have no great difficulty in finding model rules and definitions that might come in handy when dealing with gaps and ambiguities in European private law. However, the question is whether such a role as a toolbox for judges would be legitimate. I discuss three types of possible legitimation strategies: the new European methods, traditional methods of legal interpretation, and merely political legitimation. It will often depend on the circumstances of the case at hand and the characteristics of the particular model rule or definition that is being borrowed what mode of legitimation will prove to be more convincing. However, generally speaking legitimation in terms of the general principles of civil law that the CJEU has recently been developing seems a particularly promising strategy. On the other hand, it seems unlikely that European courts could even come under a duty, following from the principle of sincere cooperation, to use the instrument as a toolbox...|$|R

Objective of the CESL is harmonise European contract law and provide rules applicable to <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracts</b> for consumers and small and medium size enterprises (SME).

The CESL presents unique opt-into mechanism. Parties cannot apply rules of the CESL before taking required steps to opt-into the CESL. Major problem with the mechanism is that its validity will be governed by national law. Therefore before parties can choose the CESL for governing law of sales contract, they are obliged to conclude separate agreement governed by national law to opt-into the CESL. Therefore the opt-into mechanism fails to create one set of rules applicable through the internal market...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} some of {{the private}} international law perspectives on electronic commerce, namely the matters of jurisdiction and choice of law. Electronic commerce {{is based on the}} formation of contracts, and when there are contracts, questions regarding legal issues arise. A distinctive trait of electronic business is that its activities are not bound by geographic borders in a traditional sense; cross border-contracts can be entered into as easy as can “domestic” <b>contracts.</b> This <b>cross-border</b> transaction adds another element to the legal questioning involved – which court will be competent to entertain a claim that sources from an electronic contract and which country’s law will be applicable?

40|$|The last 15 {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{the development of a}} particular set of EU norms for determining jurisdiction and applicable law for <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracts</b> in disputes brought before the courts of a Member State. These norms have and continue to be devised in response to the increasing cross-border nature of commercial activities and the need for parties, especially weaker parties, to be able to 'access [social] justice', and for the EU to demonstrate and reflect 'global ethical values through new human rights'. In particular, the post-Lisbon era has witnessed the further advancement of a third wave of EU private international laws.

40|$|Demands {{for a more}} {{comprehensive}} harmonization of law between legal areas {{are based on the}} assumption that legal diversity causes transaction costs and lowers economic trade and welfare, in particular by creating legal uncertainty. It is argued that legal diversity increases the transaction costs of <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracting</b> and discourages consumers and small entrepreneurs from engaging in such transactions. Consumers as well as producers tend to refrain from contracts in foreign legal systems if the costs of information (about the law, about administrative procedures, about competent legal advice) and/or the costs of enforcement (by way of litigation or alternative forms of dispute resolution) seem too high or unpredictable. This unpredictability or uncertainty about the costs of cross-border transactions may stem from the diversity in the formal legal system or diversity in judicial administration across the individual member countries. The purpose of this contribution is to make some basic considerations on the macroeconomic costs of legal uncertainty, particularly on the effects of cross-border legal uncertainty 2 on economic performance, and to ask whether legal harmonization could be an appropriate solution to this problem, or why not. As will be argued, full harmonization may (at first sight) seem to be an adequate instrument for reducing the costs of cross-border legal uncertainty; however, full harmonization itself tends to imply high economic costs, so that it is not generally recommendable. Nevertheless, a gradual (partial) harmonization process could, in some circumstances, be beneficial...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: {{the article}} {{examines}} the main {{problems associated with the}} extension of arbitration of domestic and international Islamic financial disputes in Malaysia. These include the specific features of the legal regulation of Malaysia, excluding the resolution of certain categories of cases by way of arbitration, and the lack of legal certainty in the submission of <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracts</b> in the field of Islamic banking to Sharia law. To achieve this goal in the article you must accomplish the following tasks: to determine whether there are institutions in Malaysia providing arbitration services for disputes in the field of Islamic banking; investigate the reasons for the unwillingness of the parties to a financial dispute to transfer it to arbitration; to identify the main problems of transferring a cross-border financial dispute to international arbitration; to study the practice of international arbitration on this issue. Methods: {{this article is based on}} an interdisciplinary concept of research, which allowed to distinguish the distinctive features of the legal regulation of the settlement of financial disputes in Malaysia. Results: currently the popularization of arbitration permits for domestic and international financial disputes in Malaysia faces difficulties due to both internal reasons and the traditional approach of Islamic banks to include in contracts the reservation of subordination of the provisions of the contract to the law of England or the United States in conjunction with the reservation clause financial disputes in the courts and arbitration of these states. Nevertheless, one can assume with great confidence that, following the development of Islamic banking, so-called Islamic arbitration will spread in Malaysia. Conclusions and Relevance: the materials outlined in the article show the special role of arbitration in resolving domestic and international disputes in the field of Islamic banking. Practical application of its results will improve the Russian legislation in the sphere of resolving financial disputes. </p...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of mobile}} {{communication}} devices like mobile phones, smartphones, tablet computers or notebooks {{with access to}} the internet has become an everyday phenomenon in today’s business world. However, whenever mobile communications are used for purposes of contract formation, i. e. the mobile dispatch of offers or acceptances, the mobility of the communicating parties raises important difficulties for the application of traditional legal rules: The fact that messages transmitted via phone, e-mail or SMS can be dispatched and received at virtually any place on earth challenges the categories of private international law and international contract law, which are based on the (unspoken) assumption that parties communicate from their home country. The existing legal framework for <b>cross-border</b> <b>contracts</b> therefore hardly takes into account the possibility that parties may move across borders, and that the place of their communications may accordingly vary. The present article addresses the legal difficulties and uncertainties that cross-border mobile communication raises under international rules of law, covering both conflict of laws rules and substantive law rules. It elaborates on the traditional role of the place of communication in this context before scrutinizing how ‘mobility-friendly’ the provisions of the relevant conventions developed by the United Nations, the Hague Conference for Private International Law and other organisations are. In doing so, it critically discusses in particular Article 10 (3) of the UN Electronic Communications Convention of 2005, the most recent attempt at regulating mobile communications. Finally, it identifies a number of problems that have hitherto been overlooked (as notably the interaction of Article 10 (3) of the UN Electronic Communications Convention with traditional private international law rules on the formal validity of contracts or with Article 3 (2) of the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to International Sales of Goods of 1955), and proposes appropriate solutions...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies how capital {{requirements}} influence a bank’s mode {{of entry into}} foreign financial markets. We develop a model of an internationally operating bank that creates and allocates liquidity across countries and argue that the advantage of multinational banking over offering cross-border financial services depends on the benefit {{and the cost of}} intimacy with local markets. The benefit is that it allows to create more liquidity. The cost is that it causes inefficiencies in internal capital markets, on which a multinational bank relies to allocate liquidity across countries. Capital requirements affect this trade-off by influencing the degree of inefficiency in internal capital markets. incomplete financial <b>contracting,</b> <b>cross-border</b> financial services, multinational banking, liquidity allocation, capital regulation...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} the abundance and interaction of rules aimed at determining the law applicable to <b>cross-border</b> consumer <b>contracts.</b> Firstly, it examines {{whether there is}} a continuing need for conflict-of-laws rules that stem from consumer-related directives. It then addresses {{the question of whether the}} Estonian Law of Obligations Act’s conflict-of-laws rules comply with the consumer-related directives. Lastly, the relations between the conflict‑of‑laws rules stemming from consumer-related directives and the Rome I Regulation are analysed. The authors conclude that the level of consumer protection afforded by Rome I seems to allow for a waiver of the various simultaneously existing directive-based conflict rules. Such renunciation would not only resolve the issue of inaccurate transposition to national laws – an apparent problem for the Estonian legislator as well – but also contribute to legal certainty. While the conflict-of-laws rules of Rome I and the national directive-based rules coexist, the latter are to be considered subordinately to Rome I. The conflict rules of the Estonian Law of Obligations Act are deemed to be only domestically mandatory and therefore not to be viewed as overriding mandatory rules in the sense of Article 9 of Rome I...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{arbitration}} (E-arbitration) {{is usually}} {{defined as a}} method to settle disputes through online platforms providing arbitration services. It constitutes a recent process dispute resolution mechanism between economic agents {{through the use of}} information and communication technology. E-arbitration is inseparable from the growth of e-commerce and <b>cross-border</b> trade transactions. <b>Contracting</b> parties in such transactions expect a swift, cost-effective and efficient dispute resolution mechanism. It is no coincidence therefore that an increasing number of domestic legislations and international regulations adhere to the rules governing E-arbitration. The fact remains that, surprisingly, the Lebanese regulatory framework puts several obstacles to the successful implementation of E-arbitration in Lebanon. In this respect, this contribution endeavors to identify the scope of such obstacles, and discusses the solutions adopted in other legal frameworks...|$|R
40|$|If the Common European Sales Law (CESL) is adopted, {{commercial}} {{parties will}} have the opportunity to choose between this instrument and the Vienna Sales Convention (CISG) to regulate their <b>cross-border</b> commercial sales <b>contracts.</b> In this paper, a comparison is made between the two international legal instruments in order to answer the question: why and when commercial parties should want to opt-in to the CESL (and opt-out of CISG) ? In this paper it is argued that as CESL remedies major flaws in CISG, in fact CESL is the better choice for commercial parties, in particular because it introduces coherent rules on defects of consent, clearer and more balanced rules regarding the incorporation of standard terms, and a scheme for the testing of the unfairness of standard terms...|$|R
40|$|V, 164 p. ill. Het Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de Gezondheidszorg (KCE) onderzocht samen met de K. U. Leuven de instroom van buitenlandse patiënten die zich laten opnemen in een Belgisch ziekenhuis voor een geplande ingreep. De grote meerderheid komt uit andere EU landen, vooral dan uit Nederland en Frankrijk. In vergelijking met het totaal aantal hospitalisaties is hun aandeel nog beperkt (ongeveer 1, 5 % van alle hospitalisaties), maar op 5 jaar tijd nam hun aantal wel met 60 % toe. Een verdere toename kan financiële problemen of wachtlijsten veroorzaken. Het KCE stelt daarom voor om de ziekenhuisfinanciering aan te passen. Daarnaast zou het pas operationele Observatorium voor Patiëntenmobiliteit aan de alarmbel moeten trekken wanneer er wachtlijsten ontstaan. 1. INTRODUCTION 8 [...] 1. 1.
