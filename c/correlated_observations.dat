Tracking {{manoeuvring}} military airborne targets with radar {{is problematic}} {{due to the}} low scan rates and {{the high levels of}} measurement noise. Surveillance systems using multiple radars have the benefit of an increased rate of observation and noise reduction but also have the problem of <b>correlating</b> <b>observations</b> from multiple sensors.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{quantity}} and impact of observations used in data assimilation {{it is necessary to}} take into account the full, potentially <b>correlated,</b> <b>observation</b> error statistics. A number of methods for estimating <b>correlated</b> <b>observation</b> errors exist, but a popular method is a diagnostic that makes use of statistical averages of observation-minus-background and observation-minus-analysis residuals. The accuracy of the results it yields is unknown as the diagnostic is sensitive to the difference between the exact background and exact observation error covariances and those that are chosen for use within the assimilation. It has often been stated in the literature that the results using this diagnostic are only valid when the background and observation error correlation length scales are well separated. Here we develop new theory relating to the diagnostic. For observations on a 1 D periodic domain we are able to the show the effect of changes in the assumed error statistics used in the assimilation on the estimated observation error covariance matrix. We also provide bounds for the estimated observation error variance and eigenvalues of the estimated observation error correlation matrix. We demonstrate that it is still possible to obtain useful results from the diagnostic when the background and observation error length scales are similar. In general, our results suggest that when <b>correlated</b> <b>observation</b> errors are treated as uncorrelated in the assimilation, the diagnostic will underestimate the correlation length scale. We support our theoretical results with simple illustrative examples. These results have potential use for interpreting the derived covariances estimated using an operational system...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that the use of <b>correlated</b> <b>observation</b> errors in data assimilation can lead to improvements in analysis accuracy and forecast skill. As a result there is increased interest in characterizing, understanding and making better use of <b>correlated</b> <b>observation</b> errors. A simple diagnostic for estimating observation error statistics makes use of statistical averages of observation-minus-background and observation-minus-analysis residuals. This diagnostic is derived assuming that the analysis is calculated using a best linear unbiased estimator. In this work, we consider if the diagnostic is still applicable when the analysis is calculated using ensemble assimilation schemes with domain localization. We show that the diagnostic equations no longer hold: the statistical averages of observation-minus-background and observation-minus-analysis residuals no longer result in an estimate of the observation error covariance matrix. Nevertheless, we are able to show that, under certain circumstances, some elements of the observation error covariance matrix can be recovered. Furthermore, we provide a method to determine which elements of the observation error covariance matrix can be correctly estimated. In particular, the correct estimation of correlations is dependent both on the localization radius and the observation operator. We provide numerical examples that illustrate these mathematical results...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{description}} of <b>correlated</b> <b>observation</b> error statistics {{is a challenge}} in data assimilation. Currently, the observation errors are assumed uncorrelated (the covariance matrix is diagonal) which is a severe approximation that leads to suboptimal results. It is possible to use multi-scale transformations to retain the diagonal matrix approximation while accounting for some correlation. However this approach can lead to some convergence problems due to scale interactions. In this paper we propose an online scale selection algorithm that improves the convergence properties in such case...|$|R
