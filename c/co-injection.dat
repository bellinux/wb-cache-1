OBJECTIVES: The current study tested the hypothesis that EtOH would stimulate mesopallidal and mesocortical dopamine neurons in the posterior but not anterior VTA and that the stimulating effects of EtOH in the VTA would involve activation of local 5 -HT(3) receptors. METHODS: Wistar female rats were surgically implanted with two cannulae, one in one sub-region of the VTA for microinjection and the other in the ventral pallidum (VP) or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) for microdialysis. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid or EtOH (200 mg%; 44 mM) was microinjected in the anterior or posterior VTA, and extracellular dopamine was measured in the VP or mPFC with microdialysis-HPLC.

40|$|The present {{studies were}} aimed at {{investigating}} the possible roles of dopamine (DA) and iron in production of hydroxyl radicals ((OH) -O-.) in rat striatum after Mn 2 + intoxication. For this purpose, DA depletions were assessed concomitant with in vivo 2, 3 - and 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) formation from the reaction of salicylate with (OH) -O-., of which 2, 3 -DHBA is a nonenzymatic adduct. Following intrastriatal Mn 2 + injection, marked 2, 3 -DHBA increases were observed in a time- and dose-dependent fashion reaching maximum levels at 6 - 18 h and a plateau beyond 0. 4 mu mol (fourfold increase). The delayed increase of 2, 3 -DHBA levels suggests that Mn 2 + induces (OH) -O-. formation in the living brain by an indirect process. The early DA depletion (2 h) and relatively late (OH) -O-. formation (6 h) indicate independent processes by Mn 2 +. In addition, depletion of DA (about 90 %) by reserpine pretreatment did not significantly alter Mn 2 +-induced 2, 3 -DHBA formation or the extent of DA depletion, suggesting that DA or DA autoxidation are not participating in Mn 2 + induced (OH) -O-. formation in vivo.

40|$|Genes of {{the basic}} helix-loop-helix {{transcription}} factor family have been implicated in many different developmental processes from neurogenesis to myogenesis. The recently cloned bHLH transcription factor, paraxis, {{has been found to}} be expressed in the paraxial mesoderm of the mouse suggesting a role for paraxis in the development of this mesodermal subtype which gives rise to the axial muscle, skeleton, and dermis of the embryo. In order to perform in vivo gain of function assays and obtain a better understanding of the possible roles of paraxis in mesodermal and somitic development, we have successfully identified homologues of paraxis in the frog, Xenopus laevis, where the process of mesodermal induction and development is best understood. The two homologues, Xparaxis-a and Xparaxis-b, are conserved with respect to their murine homologue in structure and expression within the embryo. Xparaxis genes are expressed immediately after gastrulation in the paraxial mesoderm of Xenopus embryos and are down regulated in the myotome of the mature somite with continued expression in the undifferentiated dermatome. Overexpression of Xparaxis-b in Xenopus embryos caused defects in the organization and morphology of the somites. This effect was not dependent on DNA binding of Xparaxis but is likely due to its dimerization with other bHLH factors. <b>Co-injections</b> with XE 12 did not diminish the effects indicating that the defects were not the result of limiting amounts of XE 12. We also demonstrated that Xparaxis does not cause obvious defects in the cell adhesions and movements required for proper mesoderm patterning during gastrulation. The paraxis proteins also lacked the ability to activate transcription as GAL 4 fusion proteins in a GAL 4 reporter assay, indicating that the genes may function more as modulators of the activity of dimerization partners than as positively acting cell determination factors. In agreement with this, Xparaxis is regulated in response to other pathways of bHLH gene action, in that XE 12 can activate Xparaxis-b, in vivo. In addition we show regulation of Xparaxis in response to mMyoD induced myogenesis pathways, again suggesting Xparaxis plays an important role in the patterning and organization of the paraxial mesoderm. ...|$|R

Cells which lie post-synaptic {{to these}} terminals are rich in dopamine receptors. These receptors have been characterized by their stimulation (D 1) or inhibition (D 2) of adenylate cyclase. In Vitro studies of adenylate cyclase in homogenates have described this enzymes laminar distribution, neuronal localization and sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs. ^ A method is described for stimulation of adenylate cyclase in vivo by direct injection of dopamine and other neuroactive substances (Life Sciences, Vol 35., pp 2145, 1984), the amplification of the cAMP response by D 2 selective antagonism and the laminar location of both the DA-stimulated cAMP response and the amplified cAMP response by D 2 selective neuroleptics. ^ Increases in cAMP levels in response to direct injection of DA were both time- and dose-dependent. Increases in cAMP levels from DA were up to five-fold basal levels. When co-injected with D 2 selective doses of trifluoperazine, nearly two-fold stimulation of the DA only response (12 -fold basal) was observed. ^ Tangential sectioning of the olfactory tubercle yielded a laminar distribution of the cAMP response due to DA injections and <b>co-injections</b> of DA and D 2 selective doses of TFP. When D 2 receptors were blocked with TFP, and DA was acting only at D 1 receptors, the cAMP response in the cortical laminae of the olfactory tubercle revealed a distribution of cAMP closely paralleling that of in vitro dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase (DSAC) laminar distribution. ^ Other drugs such as promethazine, propranolol and thioridazine produced different localizations of cAMP response when co-injected with DA. ^ This research demonstrates that DA and other neuroactive substances can stimulate cAMP production in vivo when injected directly into brain tissue. The agonist response of DA can be amplified by blocking inhibitory DA receptors. Further, the response can be localized anatomically to identified neuronal populations and neuronal fields. This will allow characterization of anatomical pathways which are important targets for the action of drugs useful {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia and provide an in vivo model for testing new drugs. ...|$|R
40|$|Men with {{localized}} {{prostate cancer}} (PCa) have a 100 % five-year survival rate, but this rate drops to 33 % for men with metastatic disease. A {{better understanding of}} the metastatic process is needed to develop better therapies for PCa. Aberrant activation of protein tyrosine kinases, including Src Family Kinases (SFKs) contribute to metastasis through numerous functions, one of which leads to increased expression of cytokines, such as IL- 8. However, the relationship between Src activity and IL- 8 regulation is not completely understood. In cell line models, I determined that IL- 8 activates Src and in turn Src activates IL- 8 demonstrating a feed forward loop contributing to the migration and invasion of PCa cells. However, IL- 8 is also produced by tumor-associated stromal cells. In bone marrow derived stromal cells (HS 5), I demonstrated a feed forward loop occurs as was observed in tumor cells. HS 5 conditioned media increased Src activity in PCa cells. By silencing IL- 8 in HS 5 cells, Src activity was decreased to control levels in PCa cells as was migration and invasion. Thus, stromal cells producing IL- 8 contribute to metastatic properties of PCa by a paracrine mechanism. To examine the effect of stromal cells on tumor growth and metastatic potential of PCa in vivo, I mixed HS 5 and PCa cells and co-injected them intraprostatically. I determined that tumor growth and metastases were increased. By silencing IL- 8 in HS 5 cells and co-injecting them with PCa cells intraprostatically, tumor growth and metastases were still increased relative to injection of PCa cells alone, but decreased relative to <b>co-injections</b> with PCa cells and HS 5 cells. These studies demonstrated: (1) a feed forward loop in both tumor and stromal cells, whereby IL- 8 activates Src, derepressing IL- 8 expression in PCa cells in vitro; (2) stromal produced IL- 8 activates Src and contributes to the migration and invasion of PCa cells in vitro; and (3) stromal produced IL- 8 is responsible, in part, for increases in PCa tumor growth and metastatic potential. Together, these studies demonstrated that IL- 8 -mediated Src activity increases the metastatic potential of PCa and therapeutic agents interfering with the IL- 8 /SFK signaling axis may be useful for prevention and treatment of metastases...|$|R

B 6 CBAF 1 mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were injected subcutaneously into homologous or heterologous (B 6 D 2 F 1) recipients, and heterologous injections were performed with or without <b>co-injection</b> of B 6 D 2 F 1 fetal fibroblasts. All homologous injections resulted in teratoma formation, whereas a sharp decrease in formation was detected after heterologous injection (100 vs. 14 %; p, 0. 05). The <b>co-injection</b> of somatic cells in heterologous injections enhanced teratoma formation significantly (14 vs. 75 %; p, 0. 05). Next, ESC-like cell colonies with the same genotype as parental ESCs were formed by culturing teratoma-dissociated cells. Compared with parental ESCs, teratoma-derived ESC-like cells exhibited significantly increased aneuploidy, regardless of homologous or heterologous injections. Repopulation of the parental ESCs was the main factor that induced chromosomal instability, whereas the <b>co-injection</b> of somatic cells did not restore chromosomal normality. Different genes were expressed in the parental ESCs and teratoma-derived ESC-like cells; the difference was larger with parental vs. heterologous than parental vs. homologous co-injections. The <b>co-injection</b> of somatic cells decreased this difference further. In conclusion, the host-to-cell interactions triggered by ESC transplantation could be modulated by <b>co-injection</b> with somatic cells.

40|$|Selective {{isolation}} protocols of selenium (Se) species integrated to Se specific {{atomic absorption}} spectroscopy (AAS) detection were developed and optimized for Se speciation in food supplements, including selenized yeasts. By ultrafiltration, 69. 18 % of Se in the extract was found as a low molecular weight soluble form, the remaining 30. 82 % was bound to high molecular weight components. After a cation-exchange chromatography of the ultrafiltrate, 3. 77 % of the Se in the extract {{was found in the}} aqueous washings of the column indicating the presence of free inorganic anions of Se; the 65. 41 % of Se retained on the column corresponded to the free organic Se cations. The limit of detection for the HPLC-THG-AAS system was 1. 85 ng of Se. Se was shown to be widely distributed over all the proteins with one sharp peak corresponding to the free forms of Se. Four major peaks were found at MW $>$ 250 000 Da (15. 97 % of Se recovered), between 102 330 and 117 490 Da (7. 06 %), between 48 977 and 53 703 Da (12. 71 %) and close to the dye migration band (17. 25 %). Selective isolation and HPLC-AAS protocols were also developed and optimized for the determination of free organic forms e. g. selenomethionine (SeMet), selenocystine (SeCystine) and inorganic forms of selenium in aqueous solutions, and in complex matrices such as nutritional supplements and mixtures of free amino acids. The selenoamino acid in alkaline solution was first derivatized with 1 -fluoro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene. After removal of excess of reagent by partitioning with diethyl ether, the N-dinitrophenyl (DNP) -derivatized selenoamino acid was acidified and extracted with diethyl ether. Inorganic Se(IV) was extracted from the acidic aqueous phases by complexation with 1, 2 -phenylenediamine, forming a piazselenol. Se derivatives were determined selectively by HPLC-THG-AAS. A selective chromatographic mechanism based on $ pi$-electron interactions was optimized using a silica stationary phase derivatized with p-nitrophenyl moieties. <b>Co-injections</b> of DNP-SeMet, DNP-SeCystine and piazselenol save retention times of 3. 7, 4. 0 and 4. 9 min, respectively, using a methanolic mobile phase containing 1. 5 % triethylamine and 0. 013 M acetic acid. Primary analytical validation parameters including stability, linearity and limits of detection were obtained using purified DNP-SeMet, DNP-SeCystine and piazselenol standards which were characterized by $ sp 1 $H-, $ sp{ 13 }$C- and $ sp{ 77 }$Se-NMR analysis and/or fast atom bombardment MS techniques. The calibration graphs for sequential dilutions of these Se standards were linear and the limits of detection from the resultant calibration graphs were 17 ng, 0. 21 ng and 18. 53 ng of Se, respectively. The purified DNP-SeMet and DNP-SeCystine were found to be photosensitive. The recovery of SeMet, SeCystine and inorganic Se from the stock solutions and/or nutritional supplements was virtually quantitative. In the presence of a 500 -fold excess of other amino acids, the recovery of SeMet and SeCystine (96. 1 $ pm$ 3. 9 % and 98. 08 $ pm$ 4. 2 %, respe...|$|R

40|$|Gas-injection {{enhanced}} oil recovery can recover nearly all residual oil where the gas sweeps. Sweep efficiency in these processes is often poor, {{in large part}} because of gravity override of gas. Stone and Jenkins presented a model for gravity override in homogeneous reservoirs, showing that the distance gas and water travel before segregation depends directly on injection rate. In cases where injection pressure is limiting, injectivity is key to overcoming gravity override. Stone assumed continuous injection of gas and water as a model for WAG (Water Alternating Gas), contending that this is valid as long as slugs mix near the well. This model for <b>co-injection</b> can be extended to relate segregation distance for <b>co-injection</b> processes directly to injection pressure. Injectivity depends on saturations very near the well, however. Therefore, where injection pressure is limiting, this model is pessimistic because injectivity in WAG is greater than in <b>co-injection.</b> We investigate the increase in injectivity possible with WAG compared to <b>co-injection</b> in 1 D and 2 D, and the implications for gravity override in 2 D, using a range of models for gas and water relative permeabilities. We confirm that the greater injectivity of WAG improves vertical sweep compared to Stone's model when injection pressure is limiting. The greatest improvements occur when slugs violate Stone's assumption: that is, when they are too large to mix fully near the well. The increase in injectivity over <b>co-injection</b> is greater for foam than for WAG without foam, because foam has much lower mobility when gas and water flow together.
