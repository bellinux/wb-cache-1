5|$|Ensuring a plasmid accepts {{an insert}} {{is a common}} problem of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin systems {{can be used to}} {{positively}} select for only those cells that have taken up a plasmid <b>containing</b> <b>the</b> inserted gene of interest, screening out those that lack the inserted gene. An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors. The gene of interest is then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus, inactivating the transcription of the toxic protein. Thus, cells <b>containing</b> <b>the</b> plasmid but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and only those that incorporate the insert survive.|$|E
