25|$|Commissioners have various privileges, such {{as being}} exempt from member state taxes (but not EU taxes), and having {{immunity}} from prosecution for doing official acts. Commissioners have sometimes {{been found to have}} abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Experts</b> found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had 'even the slightest sense of responsibility'. This {{led to the creation of}} the European Anti-fraud Office.

25|$|In response, on {{the basis}} it was {{tantamount}} to a vote of no confidence, the President of PES, Pauline Green, announced she would put forward a motion of censure. However PES would vote against its own motion, {{as there is no}} method for a motion of confidence. During this period, the Parliament took on an increased government-opposition dynamic, with PES as a party supporting the Commission and the EPP renouncing its support and acting as a de facto opposition party to the executive. This is in part because the allegations centred on Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both from the Socialist party (PES). It was seen by some that it was an attempt by the People's party (EPP) to discredit PES ahead of the 1999 elections. This led to hesitation from the PES leadership, who were the largest group in Parliament, to support the allegations. Motions tabled by the two groups outlined the differing stances the EPP favouring individual responsibility (just those whom the main allegations are against) and PES favouring an emphasis on collective responsibility (so EPP members such as the President, as well as PES members, would be forced to resign). The PES resolution also proposed establishing a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> <b>experts</b> to investigate the allegations.|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the National Treasury's projections of GDP and key fiscal aggregates is {{comparable to that of}} the projections of private sector economists, other reputable organisations and the fiscal authorities of other countries. The errors in the projections of the National Treasury have nonetheless been substantial in some years, and have increased from 2000 / 01 to 2010 / 11. This paper argues that the credibility of fiscal policy would have been severely tested if the largest annual errors in respect of the various aggregates had coincided. Against this backdrop, the paper makes the case for structured bi-annual discussions of government’s forecasts during public parliamentary hearings as a mechanism for improving the accuracy and credibility of official projections.

25|$|On 13 April 2011, the UNHCR {{recommended}} that the General Assembly reconsider the report at its sixty-sixth session (to be held in September 2011), and urges the Assembly to submit that report to the Security Council for its consideration and appropriate action, including consideration of referral {{of the situation in}} the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute. The resolution was drafted by the Palestinian Authority and adopted by the Human Rights Council with 27 states voting in favour, three against, and 16 abstentions. It followed the second report of a <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Experts,</b> established to monitor the domestic investigations into violations committed during the conflict, which was submitted to the Human Rights Council on 18 March 2011. The report concurred with Amnesty International's assessment that – more than 18 months since the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict documented crimes under international law committed by both sides – the Israeli authorities and the Hamas de facto administration have failed to conduct investigations meeting the required international standards of independence, impartiality, thoroughness, effectiveness and promptness. The General Assembly has already twice called on the domestic authorities to conduct credible, independent investigations into the serious violations of international humanitarian and international human rights law documented by the UN Fact-Finding Mission, in resolutions adopted in November 2009 and February 2010. Those calls appear to have been ignored meaning that the General Assembly would be entitled to submit the issue to the Security Council.|$|E

40|$|All the ten core UN {{human rights}} {{treaties}} have a treaty body. The treaty bodies are <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>independents</b> <b>experts</b> {{and set up}} by the governing treaty (with one exception). They perform different functions of which the main one is the examination of the state parties’ reports on implementation of the treaty. These reports are examined in a constructive dialogue with the state representatives. In addition to that they can issue general comments on the treaty obligations, initiate inquiries and examine state complaints. Eights of the treaty bodies can also receive petitions from individuals. This thesis analyses the legal status of the treaty bodies. The purpose is to find out their real status under international law. The treaty bodies have differing functions and their nature varies from court-like examination of cases to administrative and even legislative activities. This has raised questions about the real status of the treaty bodies. The scope of the action of the treaty bodies has widened slowly and sometimes deliberately as the treaty bodies have claimed the power to perform also action not expressed in the founding documents. The states have not always agreed on the treaty bodies’ views on the extent of their powers. This highlights the tension between the traditional state-centered thinking of international law and human rights that have challenged sovereignty. International law has changed from the times when the treaties were adopted. What are the treaty bodies then, today? The sources of international law, as listed in the article 38 of the statute of the International Court of Justice cannot point to a single clear answer. Comparison to existing status categories (court, lawmaker, organization etc.) does not help either, because the treaty bodies have characteristics of many of these but do not fall under any completely. Therefore the answers they give are contradictory and norm hierarchy cannot solve the conflict, as international law is not hierarchical in the same sense as national law. The inability to find a single definition and a clear answer is {{due to the nature of}} international law. It is indeterminate and inherently political. In order for it to work, it must be able to accommodate differing and even opposing views. This uncertainty does not mean that the treaty bodies are left empty-handed. Compliance does not require certain status, it requires legitimacy. The recent development including individual complaints mechanisms’ the entry into force and the finally reached agreement on how to enhance the treaty body system reflect the states’ commitment to human rights protection, and it is certain that we would not see it if the treaty bodies’ action was not perceived legitimate. After all, compliance is all that matters, especially in the context of the human rights treaty bodies because they were created to ensure and help implementation of the treaty rights. Bearing this in mind could lead to the realisation that, in fact, there is a clear definition for the human rights treaty bodies. It is enough to define that their status under international law is treaty body...|$|R
