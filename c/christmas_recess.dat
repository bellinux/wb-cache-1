25|$|From 1909 to 1912, Laue was a Privatdozent at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, under Arnold Sommerfeld, at LMU. During the 1911 <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess</b> and in January 1912, Paul Peter Ewald was {{finishing}} {{the writing of}} his doctoral thesis under Sommerfeld. It was on a walk through the Englischer Garten in Munich in January, that Ewald told Laue about his thesis topic. The wavelengths of concern to Ewald were in the visible region of the spectrum and hence {{much larger than the}} spacing between the resonators in Ewald’s crystal model. Laue seemed distracted and wanted to know what would be the effect if much smaller wavelengths were considered. In June, Sommerfeld reported to the Physikalische Gesellschaft of Göttingen on the successful diffraction of x-rays by Laue, Paul Knipping and Walter Friedrich at LMU, for which Laue would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1914. While at Munich, he wrote the first volume of his book on relativity during the period 1910 to 1911.|$|E

2500|$|The first Parliament of Australia quickly {{moved to}} {{restrict}} immigration to maintain Australia's British character, and the Pacific Island Labourers Bill and the Immigration Restriction Bill were passed shortly before parliament rose {{for its first}} <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess.</b> The Colonial Secretary in Britain had however {{made it clear that}} a race-based immigration policy would run [...] "contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have ever been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire". The Barton Government therefore conceived of the [...] "language dictation test", which would allow the government, at the discretion of the minister, to block unwanted migrants by forcing them to sit a test in [...] "any European language". Race had already been established as a premise for exclusion among the colonial parliaments, so the main question for debate was who exactly the new Commonwealth ought to exclude, with the Labor Party rejecting Britain's calls to placate the populations of its non-white colonies and allow [...] "aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands thereof". There was opposition from Queensland and its sugar industry to the proposals of the Pacific Islanders Bill to exclude [...] "Kanaka" [...] laborers, however Barton argued that the practice was [...] "veiled slavery" [...] {{that could lead to a}} [...] "negro problem" [...] similar to that in the United States, and the Bill was passed.|$|E
25|$|On 20 July 2007, Ramush Haradinaj's {{application}} for provisional release {{during the summer}} court recess was denied. He was granted a second exceptional provisional release over the <b>Christmas</b> court <b>recess.</b> The trial chamber rendered its decision on 3 April 2008; not guilty. Defenders of Haradinaj, Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj have not taken a single witness of the defence to the stand considering that unnecessary. The prosecution was unable {{to bring to the}} courtroom three planned witnesses. One of them was committed to a mental health institution {{at the time he was}} called to testify. Another, Shefqet Kabashi, refused to testify citing the OTP's failure to live up to the conditions set for his testimony. Haradinaj's full acquittal, however, was palled by whispers that witnesses had been intimidated. In fact, during the first trial two witnesses failed to attend and it was feared their evidence could have been determinative to the outcome.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pleydell {{had left}} the party for some time; but he returned, {{according}} to promise, during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess</b> of the courts. He drove up to Ellangowan when all the family were abroad but the Colonel, who was busy with plans of buildings and pleasure-grounds, {{in which he was}} well skilled, and took great delight.|$|E
60|$|The case lasted {{well over}} the <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess.</b> During the holidays, Deane spent {{a good part of}} his time seeking for some trace of Winifred Rowan. He went himself to her old employers, but they were able to tell him nothing. They could only show him the {{testimonial}} which they had written at her request, and which she had taken away with her a few days after her departure from the hotel. There was no one who seemed able to help him in the least. Very regretfully, he called in the services of a private detective, who, however, was equally unsuccessful. The holidays passed, the case was reopened, and Deane was once more immersed in the struggle....|$|E
60|$|When the <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess</b> {{was over}} {{he went back}} to his lectures {{resigned}} to the thought that the athletic side of college life was not for him. He studied harder than ever, and even planned to take a course of lectures in another department. Also his adeptness in dodging was called upon more and more. The Sophs were bound to get him sooner or later. But he did not grow resigned to that; every dodge and flight increased his resentment. Presently he knew he would stop and take what they had to give, and retaliate as best he could. Only, what would they do to him when they did catch him? He remembered his watch, his money, and clothes, never recovered after that memorable tug-of-war. He minded the loss of his watch most; that gift could never be replaced. It seemed to him that he had been the greater sufferer.|$|E
60|$|Miss Twinkleton’s {{establishment}} {{was about}} to undergo a serene hush. The <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess</b> was at hand. What had once, and at no remote period, been called, even by the erudite Miss Twinkleton herself, ‘the half;’ but what was now called, as being more elegant, and more strictly collegiate, ‘the term,’ would expire to-morrow. A noticeable relaxation of discipline had for some few days pervaded the Nuns’ House. Club suppers had occurred in the bedrooms, and a dressed tongue had been carved {{with a pair of}} scissors, and handed round with the curling tongs. Portions of marmalade had likewise been distributed on a service of plates constructed of curlpaper; and cowslip wine had been quaffed from the small squat measuring glass in which little Rickitts (a junior of weakly constitution) took her steel drops daily. The housemaids had been bribed with various fragments of riband, and sundry pairs of shoes more or less down at heel, to make no mention of crumbs in the beds; the airiest costumes had been worn on these festive occasions; and the daring Miss Ferdinand had even surprised the company with a sprightly solo on the comb-and-curlpaper, until suffocated in her own pillow by two flowing-haired executioners.|$|E

Everett died aged 78, during the 1967 Dáil <b>Christmas</b> <b>Recess,</b> when with 44 years service as a TD, he was joint Father of the Dáil with Frank Aiken and Paddy Smith.|$|E
5000|$|In Britain, {{a number}} of London merchants {{expressed}} interest in joining the Americans when the petition was presented, although Benjamin Franklin advised against the proposition. On December 21, Benjamin Franklin, Lee, and Bollan were notified by Lord Dartmouth that the petition was [...] "decent and respectful" [...] {{and that it would}} be presented as soon as possible to the Houses of Parliament. However, Franklin wrote two days later that the petition could not be presented to Parliament until after the <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, Pettigrew {{was named}} the first {{director}} of NIBIB, after contentious and prolonged effort by the national medical imaging and bioengineering communities to establish an NIH institute that is dedicated to advancing health through these catalytic fields, known to be engines of scientific progress. Of historical note is that Congress passed the bill to establish NIBIB (the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Establishment Act) just before <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess</b> in 2000, and President Bill Clinton signed it into law as the last legislative act of his presidency.|$|E
50|$|The {{campaign}} {{consisted of}} trying {{to win over the}} almost twenty-four hundred delegates who would go to the April convention. These consisted of prominent Liberals from across the country and also ordinary party members elected by each riding association. The campaign lasted from after the <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess</b> up to the convention. Parliament was in session during this period and since all the major candidates were important cabinet ministers finding time to campaign was difficult. Thus it mostly consisted of the candidates taking short trips to various parts of the country to try to win over delegates.|$|E
5000|$|There {{had been}} weekly protests {{in front of}} the Althing since the {{collapse}} of Iceland's three commercial banks in October 2008. These protests intensified with the return of the Althing from <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess</b> on 20 January 2009. [...] Three days later, Prime Minister Geir Haarde of the Independence Party announced that he was withdrawing from politics for health reasons (he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer), and promised early elections for 9 May. However, the Independence Party wished to retain the Prime Minister's post, which proved unacceptable to their coalition partners the Social Democratic Alliance: the government collapsed on 26 January 2009.|$|E
50|$|By 1960, {{she was a}} Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Health. One of {{the issues}} she spoke to the House of Commons about was the effect of poorly shaped shoes on children. She {{launched}} an independent report into the problem in February 1960. She was made Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1962. At the 1964 general election, Pitt retained her seat. She chaired the Air Corporations Act 1966 through the committee stage until <b>Christmas</b> <b>Recess</b> 1965. She died before Parliament returned and Robert Carr began the tributes to her {{on behalf of the}} bill team on 3 February 1966. Following her death, at the 1966 general election, Jill Knight was elected as her successor, who retained the seat for the following eight general elections. Knight and Pitt knew each other well.|$|E

50|$|When {{her husband}} emigrated to Canada {{in the late}} 1920s, Arnold joined him. In 1935, seven years after her arrival {{and the mother of}} three small children, she began her studies in Psychology at the University of Toronto. Against {{considerable}} odds, she completed her bachelor's degree in 1939, and the next autumn began graduate work. Her Master’s thesis was a study of the measurement of tension in the working muscles compared with simultaneous tension in resting muscles. She was ordered by the head of her department to use only one subject for this work, but as she later recalled in an unpublished autobiographical essay, “This would have made my project, which depended on individual differences, completely impossible.” So she ran her project during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess</b> when the labs were empty. As she later noted, “Since the data turned out well and indeed were plausible, my advisor persuaded the chairman to accept the thesis. I was awarded the M.A. in the spring of 1940.” By 1942, after a summer as an intern at the Psychiatric Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, Arnold received her doctorate and was invited to join the war-impoverished faculty at the University of Toronto. Here, she decided on her particular specialization - emotion and the brain. She took graduate courses in neurology while a Lecturer in Psychology and began correlating brain function with emotion.|$|E

5000|$|The Barton Government, {{which won}} the first {{elections}} following Federation in 1901, was formed by the Protectionist Party {{with the support of}} the Australian Labor Party (ALP). The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the Australian Workers' Union and other labor organizations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded. The first Parliament of Australia quickly moved to restrict immigration to maintain Australia's [...] "British character", passing the Pacific Island Labourers Act and the Immigration Restriction Act before parliament rose for its first <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess.</b> The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 limited immigration to Australia and required a person seeking entry to Australia to write out a passage of 50 words dictated to them in any European language, not necessarily English, at the discretion of an immigration officer. Barton argued in favour of the bill: [...] "The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman." [...] The passage chosen for the test could often be very difficult, so that even if the test was given in English, a person was likely to fail. The test enabled immigration officials to exclude individuals on the basis of race without explicitly saying so. Although the test could theoretically be given to any person arriving in Australia, in practice it was given selectively on the basis of race. This test was later abolished in 1958.|$|E
5000|$|News of the {{surrender}} of General Cornwallis at Yorktown reached Britain late in November 1781, shortly before Parliament was due to debate the military spending estimates for the following year. The hastily revised plan was that forces in America were to be retained at their existing level, but the policy of [...] "offensive" [...] war and long campaigns away from well-supplied strongholds (which had also led to the Saratoga defeat four years earlier) was to be abandoned, in favour of a new approach, details of which had to remain secret. The budget was passed by a large majority, {{but a few days}} later news was received that the British fleet in the Bay of Biscay had been able to capture only a fraction of a very large French fleet, carrying troops for invasions of British colonies around the world. Parliament immediately ordered an inquiry into the administration of the Royal Navy, to be held after the <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess.</b> At the beginning of January it was learned that French forces had begun capturing small British-held islands in the West Indies even without the help of the new fleet (which had been driven back to France by storms), so a large British fleet was sent westwards as soon as possible. Also in that month, the government appointed a new commander for the American forces, General Carleton who had defeated the American invasion of Canada in the early phase of the war, and the Colonial Secretary, Lord George Germain, was replaced by the hawkish Welbore Ellis.|$|E

Congress is expected to complete work on the bill before the <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess.</b> Although many are overjoyed by a tax cut, there are potential pitfalls to the tax cut that might adversely affect physicians. Under a rule in the Senate known as Pay as You Go (PAYGO), legislation that increases the deficit results in automatic spending cuts.

40|$|We {{compared}} cognitive (CT) and interpersonal-process (IP) group therapies in {{the treatment}} of moderate, unipolar depression i college counseling-center clients. Subjects who sought services early in the semester were randomly assigned to CT or IP groups and compared with a waiting-list group composed of subjects who requested services just prior to the <b>Christmas</b> <b>recess.</b> Multivariate analyses revealed no significant differences between treatment nd waiting-list conditions. Because th control was confounded by the Christmas holiday, we compared the CT and IP groups directly. Both treatments led to significant reductions in depression and depressed thinking and to increments in self-esteem atmidtreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up assess-ments but did not differ from each other at any point in time. There was no evidence of differential effectiveness or mechanisms oftherapeutic change as a function of typeof treatment. Depression is the common cold of mental health because of its high incidence in all segments of the population (Bellack, Hersen, & Himmelhock, 1981). Depression is particularly prevalent among college students with 17 % to 24 % of student...|$|E
