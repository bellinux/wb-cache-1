40|$|Within this work, {{we focus}} on the {{optimization}} of storage location assignments arising in warehouses with storage locations applying a last-in, first-out throughput policy. The sequence of goods to be stored is, however, not entirely known such that for each item the currently best storage location has to be identified almost immediately. Caused by this imperfect data and <b>by</b> <b>stock</b> <b>removals</b> concurrently performed it is necessary to apply relocation operations from time to time, which might range from a few operations to relocations lasting a working day depending on the workload of the warehousemen. For this purpose we propose an ad hoc stocking strategy as well as a storage relocation strategy based on variable neighborhood descent. Supported by experimental tests we compare variants of our approaches {{with each other and with}} formerly used stocking strategies showing that the number of conflicts could be significantly reduced by the proposed approach. Furthermore, an application of the relocation strategy can significantly improve warehouse states obtained due to imperfect stocking strategies, concurrently performed <b>stock</b> <b>removals</b> and insufficient information on production sequences...|$|R

25|$|Steel blades are {{commonly}} shaped <b>by</b> forging or <b>stock</b> <b>removal.</b> Forged blades {{are made by}} heating {{a single piece of}} steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. <b>Stock</b> <b>removal</b> blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> processes. Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> product lines <b>by</b> the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.|$|R

Effects of lower stock plant temperatures on rooting were not the result of reduced Ca concentration, but consistent relationships were found between adventitious root formation and B concentration. Average rooting percentages were low (1 – 15 % for C. citriodora and 2 – 22 % for E. dunnii) but rooted cutting production per stock plant (e. g. 25 for C. citriodora and 52 for E. dunnii over 14 weeks at 33 / 28 °C) was sufficient to establish clonal field tests for plantation forestry...|$|R
500|$|Emerson's early folding knives {{were of the}} linerlock variety, ground <b>by</b> the <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> method, and {{utilized}} rare {{materials from}} the aerospace industry, including titanium, carbon fiber, micarta, and meteorite. [...] He incorporated exotic materials common to knifemakers of the time, including mother-of-pearl, abalone shell, paua shell, staghorn, and rare hardwoods. Writer Paul Basch reported in 1990 that Emerson refused to use the parts of any animal or plant which was an endangered species, noting Emerson as being an environmentally conscious knifemaker. The steel used in these blades was typically graded ATS-34, AEB-L, or 440C, and the blades were either highly polished or hand-rubbed. Emerson made knives with Damascus steel blades. Among custom knife collectors and purveyors today, these knives are known as the [...] "Pre-Tac" [...] (Pre-Tactical) models. They can be identified by their bright anodized titanium bolsters and liners and the predominant use of clip point blades. The knives were noted for their close tolerances and precise locking mechanisms. Emerson credits the following knifemakers for helping him along during his early years as a knifemaker: Michael Walker, Clint Breshears, Bob Engnath, and Jim Ferguson.|$|R

40|$|Fuzzy {{control is}} applied to the {{superfinishing}} in order to optimize the cutting ability of the stone. The finishing performance of vitrified bonded WA stone is regarded as the fuzzy goal. At the beginning of cutting, the stone is in the stage of cutting to get high <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rate. But the cutting ability is decreasing as the finishing proceeds and is lost at the end of finishing, resulting in getting the smooth surface. A cutting resistance is used to monitor the cutting condition of stone. The cutting ability of stone is controlled by both the stone pressure and the amount of electricity for electrolytic in-process dressing. A water-solution type coolant and metal bonded diamond stone are used. The main results obtained are as follows. Fuzzy control makes it possible to give the optimized cutting ability to the diamond stone. In the first case, it is possible to get the large <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> following the smooth surface in a limited time.

40|$|Repeated pruning {{of stock}} plants {{is a common}} {{approach}} to delaying maturation and maintaining the propagation ability of cuttings, but {{little is known about}} the hormonal or anatomical basis for this phenomenon. We tested the effect of two different stock-plant pruning heights (15 cm and 30 cm) on shoot production, rooting capacity and rooted cutting vigour of six clones of the eucalypt Corymbia torelliana × C. citriodora. We determined whether differences in rooting potential were related to indole- 3 -acetic (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) concentrations, or the degree of lignification or sclerification, of the cuttings. Maintaining stock plants at 15 cm height sometimes reduced the production of stem cuttings. However, it often increased the ensuing percentage of cuttings that formed roots, with mean rooting across all clones increasing from 30 %– 53 %. Therefore, the number of rooted <b>cuttings</b> produced <b>by</b> short <b>stock</b> plants was similar to, or higher than, the number produced <b>by</b> tall <b>stock</b> plants. <b>Cuttings</b> from shorter stock plants had faster root elongation and occasionally greater root dry mass, shoot dry mass or shoot height than cuttings from tall stock plants. These differences in rooting potential were generally not related to differences in IAA or ABA concentrations of the cuttings or to differences in their stem anatomy. Pruning at the lower height was more effective in maintaining clonal juvenility, supporting previous findings that stock plant maturation is a limiting factor in clonal propagation of Corymbia torelliana × C. citriodora...|$|R

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{centreless grinding}} machine was modified extensively to operate satisfactorily at high grinding wheel speeds and in the high rate centreless grinding regime. The principal modifications included the provision of a 75 k. W. d. c., variable speed, main drive motor which enables grinding wheel speeds up to 120 m/s to be employed and a coolant supply manifold was designed and manufactured-which was capable of delivering a high velocity coolant stream to the grinding zone. In addition, a measurement system was developed-which-allowed the grinding forces to be monitored and recorded in process. Two solutions for the accepted kinematic model of plunge feed cylindrical grinding are proposed. The general and more accurate solution takes account of the variable grit height and separation of the grinding wheel, whilst the particular and approximate analytical solution makes provision for variable grit separation only. The particular solution enabled parametric studies to be undertaken and allowed comparisons with the solutions proposed by other workers. The trends of theoretical grinding forces were predicted from analysis of the undeformed chip dimensions. The trends indicated two methods of achieving high <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rates, firstly, for a constant force value, higher <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rates are possible by increasing the grinding wheel speed and infeed-rate. Secondly, at a constant grinding wheel speed, and force level, reducing the workpiece speed and increasing the infeed-rate will yield higher <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rates. Experimental results were in agreement with these predictions. An extensive experimental programme investigating plunge feed centreless grinding of ferrous components was undertaken. Results from approximately 300 grinding experiments were used to establish a data bank of grinding parameters {{for a range of}} grinding conditions. High-rate centreless grinding {{has been shown to be}} a feasible first machining process. It has also been shown that the choice of kinematic conditions is important in achieving high <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rate grinding. Incorrect choice of kinematic conditions can cause problems of, workpiece burn, grinding vibrations and excessive power demands. Limit charts have been constructed which outline the boundaries to the process in terms of burn, grinding vibration and power limit. Operation between the boundaries is best achieved if the ratio of grinding wheel to workpiece speeds is in the range 90 - 200.
