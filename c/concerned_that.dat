5|$|After Washington issued his 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality {{he became}} <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> Spain, which {{later that year}} joined Britain in war against France, might work in consort to incite insurrection in the Yazoo against the U.S., using the opening of trade on the Mississippi as an enticement. At that same time though, mid-1794, Spain was {{attempting}} to extract itself from its alliance with the British, and to restore peace with France. As Spain's prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, was attempting to do so, he learned of John Jay's mission to London, and became <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> those negotiations would result in an Anglo-American alliance and an invasion of Spanish possessions in North America. Sensing the need for rapprochement, Godoy sent a request to the U.S. government for a representative empowered to negotiate a new treaty; Washington sent Thomas Pinckney to Spain in June 1795.|$|E

The US was also <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> it had been infiltrated by communists although historian Richard H. Immerman argued that during {{the early part of the}} Cold War, the US and the CIA were predisposed to see the revolutionary government as communist, despite Arévalo's ban of the communist party during his 1945–1951 presidency. Additionally, the US government was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> the success of Árbenz's reforms would inspire similar movements elsewhere.
