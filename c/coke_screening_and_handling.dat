30|$|At present, {{there are}} many methods being used to {{determine}} breakthrough channels {{in the process of}} water flooding, such as injecting tracer material, analyzing well test data, applying fuzzy recognition of expert system based on interpretation results of logging information (Serres-Piole et al. 2012; Liu and Liang 2004; Meng et al. 2007). Some similar technologies have also been used to judge steam breakthrough performance (Closmann 1984; Masse et al. 1991). Generally, the cost of injecting tracer material is expensive and the workload is always heavy. Well test needs to measure pressure changes under the condition of well shut-in, which will influence regular production. For the fuzzy recognition of expert system, its application is always restricted due to non-screening and processing parameters in advance. Recently, Yu et al. (2009) introduced an integrated discrimination exponent method, which is based on <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> geological static parameters, production performance and analytical test data to quantitatively describe breakthrough channels in the water flooding process.|$|R

40|$|Context <b>and</b> Aim: <b>Screening</b> {{programs}} using conventional cytology conventional Pap smear (CPS) {{have successfully}} reduced cervical cancer, but newer tests like liquid-based cytology (LBC) and human papillomavirus testing might enhance screening. The main {{aim of the}} present study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of LBC versus CPS using "split samples. " Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study comprising of 1000 consecutive cervical "split samples" over a period of 1 year. Split sample was obtained using cervex-brush. CPS was prepared from the brush and the brush head was suspended in the LBC vial and processed by SurePath™ LBC. Results: There were 4. 3 % unsatisfactory (U/S) cases in CPS and 1. 7 % in LBC; the main cause is insufficient cells, and excess of blood in CPS. About 25 / 100 (2. 5 %) split samples had epithelial abnormalities both in CPS and LBC (1. 2 %-atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; 0. 4 %-low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; 0. 2 %-high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; 0. 5 %-squamous cell carcinoma; 0. 1 %-atypical glandular cells favouring neoplasia; 0. 2 %-adenocarcinoma). Inflammatory organisms were almost equally identified in both techniques but were better seen in LBC samples. Conclusions: LBC technique leads to significant reduction of U/S rate.

50|$|Transportable semi-mobile {{installations}} {{have gained}} increasing {{popularity in the}} last two decades. They are enabled by the fact that complete sensor-based sorting systems are relatively compact in relation to the capacity in tonnes per hour. This is mainly because little infrastructure is needed. The picture shows a containerised sensor-based sorter which is applied in Chromitite sorting. The system is operated in conjunction with a Diesel-powered mobile crusher <b>and</b> <b>screen.</b> Material <b>handling</b> of the feed, undersize fraction, product and waste fraction is conducted using a wheel loader. The system is powered by a Diesel generator and a compressor station delivers the instrument quality air needed for the operation.Semi-mobile installations are applied primarily to minimise material <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> save transport costs. Another reason for choosing the semi-mobile option for an installation is bulk testing of new ore bodies.Capacity of a system very much depends on the size fraction sorted, but a 250tph capacity is a good estimate for semi-mobile installations, considering a capacity of 125tph sorter feed and 125tph undersize material.During the last decade both generic plant designs and customised designs have been developed, for example in the framework of the i2mine project.|$|R

The most common types of rock support in use today are the combination of rock bolts <b>and</b> mesh <b>screens</b> <b>and</b> various forms of shotcrete. More recently, innovative spray-on polymer linings {{have been developed for}} use as an alternative type of rock support. Initial research indicates that bolt <b>and</b> <b>screen</b> support is relatively inexpensive but is not as productive as either shotcrete or polymer linings and is not readily automated. Shotcrete is significantly more productive than using <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> bolts, but is considerably more expensive and requires substantially more material handling.

40|$|High-throughput <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> {{optimization}} {{experiments are}} critical {{to a number of}} fields, including chemistry and structural and molecular biology. The separation of these two steps may introduce false negatives and a time delay between initial <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> subsequent optimization. Although a hybrid method combining both steps may address these problems, miniaturization is required to minimize sample consumption. This article reports a "hybrid" droplet-based microfluidic approach that combines the steps of <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> optimization into one simple experiment and uses nanoliter-sized plugs to minimize sample consumption. Many distinct reagents were sequentially introduced as approx. 140 -nl plugs into a microfluidic device and combined with a substrate and a diluting buffer. Tests were conducted in approx. 10 -nl plugs containing different concentrations of a reagent. Methods were developed to form plugs of controlled concentrations, index concentrations, and incubate thousands of plugs inexpensively and without evaporation. To validate the hybrid method and demonstrate its applicability to challenging problems, crystallization of model membrane proteins <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> of solutions of detergents and viscous precipitants were demonstrated. By using 10 μl of protein solution, approx. 1, 300 crystallization trials were set up within 20 min by one researcher. This method was compatible with growth, manipulation, and extraction of high-quality crystals of membrane proteins, demonstrated by obtaining high-resolution diffraction images and solving a crystal structure. This robust method requires inexpensive equipment and supplies, should be especially suitable for use in individual laboratories, and could find applications {{in a number of areas}} that require chemical, biochemical, <b>and</b> biological <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> optimization...|$|R

We measured urinary corticosterone responses of male cane toads (Rhinella marina) to capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only, <b>and</b> to toe-clipping under field conditions. Urinary testosterone concentrations and white blood cell proportions were also measured. Urinary corticosterone metabolite concentrations increased 6 h after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only <b>and</b> remained high for 24 h; corticosterone returned to baseline levels after 48 h and remained low at 72 h post capture <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> Corticosterone concentrations in toads subjected to toe-clipping increased at 6 h to significantly higher concentrations than after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only, then decreased more slowly than after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling,</b> <b>and</b> were still elevated (approximately double basal level) 72 h after toe-clipping. Testosterone did not change significantly after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only, whereas after toe-clipping testosterone decreased at 6 h and remained low at 72 h. There were weak short-term effects of toe-clipping compared with capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only on white blood cell proportions.
