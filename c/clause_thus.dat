25|$|Typically, in passive clauses, what {{is usually}} {{expressed}} by the object (or sometimes another argument) of the verb is now {{expressed by the}} subject, while what is usually expressed by the subject is either deleted, or is indicated by some adjunct of the <b>clause.</b> <b>Thus,</b> turning an active verb into a passive verb is a valence-decreasing process ("detransitivizing process"), because it turns transitive verbs into intransitive verbs. This {{is not always the}} case; for example in Japanese a passive-voice construction does not necessarily decrease valence.|$|E
25|$|In {{these two}} {{landmark}} decisions, Engel v. Vitale (1962) and Abington School District v.

While the Engel decision held that the promulgation of an official state-school prayer stood in violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment <b>Clause</b> (<b>thus</b> overruling the New York Courts’ decisions), Abington held that Bible readings and other public school-sponsored religious activities were prohibited. Madalyn Murray's lawsuit, Murray v. Curlett, contributed to the removal of compulsory Bible reading from the public schools of the United States, and has had lasting and significant effects.|$|E

30|$|The {{simplest}} {{kinds of}} subordinate clauses are content clauses that function as object.

Their production was not marked by any particular difficulties.|$|R

An alternative to strict originalist theory is advocated by Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the Court's supporters of substantive due process rights. Breyer believes the justices need to look at cases in light of how their decisions will promote what he calls [...] "active liberty," [...] the Constitution's aim of promoting participation by citizens in the processes of government. That is an approach that ostensibly emphasizes [...] "the document's underlying values" [...] and a broad look at a law's purpose and consequences.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a first-order version of Categorial Grammar, {{based on the}} idea of encoding syntactic types as definite <b>clauses.</b> <b>Thus,</b> we drop all explicit requirements of adjacency between combinable constituents, and we capture wordorder constraints simply by allowing subformulae of complex types to share variables ranging over string positions.

Some compilers, such as GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), provide a warning when compiling code containing an assignment operator inside an if statement, though there are some legitimate uses of an assignment inside an if-condition.

Wage setters react to a trading partner's imminent crisis, because a loss of international competitiveness changes their governments' optimal escape <b>clauses.</b> <b>Thus,</b> not only actual devaluations but an increasing crisis probability in one country may trigger currency crises elsewhere.

Our idea consists in building blocking clauses of literals corresponding {{not only to}} propositional variables encoding states, but also to more general subformulas over these variables encoding sets of states. This way our approach alleviates an exponential blow-up {{in the number of}} blocking clauses. A hybrid algorithm for verifying Timed Automata is proposed, where the timed part of blocking clauses is computed using Difference Bound Matrices.

These problems can be solved efficiently for formulas with bounded treewidth.

In this paper we show that solution methods for formulas with treewidth two can be combined with specialized techniques for dealing with "long" <b>clauses,</b> <b>thus</b> obtaining time bounds independent of the treewidth. This leads to the definition of a new class of tractable instances for SAT and its extensions. This class is related to a particular class of reducible hypergraphs, that extends partial 2 -trees and hypertrees...|$|R
