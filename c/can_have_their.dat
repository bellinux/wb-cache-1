5|$|Final Fantasy XIV is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) {{in which}} the player controls a customized Adventurer avatar {{from one of the}} five playable races. Each race has two tribes, and all but two allow for the selection of male or female characters. The avatar <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> eye and hair color, facial features, and skin tone customized, and features such as birthmarks and scars can be added. Their chosen tribe, along with their chosen patron deity, affect their stats and elemental attributes. The game's opening varies depending on which starting location is chosen. Two different types of quests are available for players: story quests, which are unlocked as characters accumulate experience points (EXP) and raise their experience level while unlocking new abilities; and Levequests (leves), side quests accessed through the Adventurers' Guilds. Leves are broken down into multiple types, focusing on gathering or combat. Levequests are associated with particular non-playable characters (NPCs). As the player completes leves, they gain favor with three different factions and unlock new abilities, with rewards only coming from the NPCs within the factions who issued the quest. Gaining favor also unlocks a new type of level called Faction leves, which deplete a character's favor when completed.|$|E
