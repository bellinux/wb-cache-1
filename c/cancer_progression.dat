5|$|Many CAS family {{proteins}} {{have altered}} activity and functional roles in <b>cancer</b> <b>progression</b> and metastasis, with functional roles in influencing cellular adhesion, migration and drug resistance. Changes in CASS4 {{may also be}} associated with human malignancies. CASS4 function was linked to {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) in a study by Miao et al. that correlated elevated CASS4 expression with lymph node metastasis and high TNM stage. In addition, this study detected a significant difference in cytoplasmic accumulation of CASS4 protein between high (H1299 and BE1) and low (LTE and A549) metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines. These may suggest CASS4 as a possible prognostic marker in clinical management of NSCLC.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{understanding}} the underlying genetic mechanisms that initiate or drive <b>cancer</b> <b>progression,</b> oncogenomics targets personalized cancer treatment.

25|$|The oncoprotein BCL-2 is {{associated}} with the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer, due to its high levels of expression in androgen-independent tumours in advanced stages of the pathology. The upregulation of BCL-2 after androgen ablation in prostate carcinoma cell lines and in a castrated-male rat model further established a connection between BCL-2 expression and prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>progression.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many men {{diagnosed}} with low-risk prostate cancer {{are eligible for}} active surveillance. This term implies careful observation of the tumor over time, {{with the intention of}} treatment for a cure if there are signs of <b>cancer</b> <b>progression.</b> Active surveillance is not synonymous with watchful waiting, an older term which implies no treatment or specific program of monitoring, with the assumption that palliative, not curative, treatment would be used if advanced, symptomatic disease develops.|$|E
25|$|In theory, non-hematological cancers can {{be cured}} if entirely removed by surgery, {{but this is}} not always possible. When the cancer has metastasized to other sites in the body prior to surgery, {{complete}} surgical excision is usually impossible. In the Halstedian model of <b>cancer</b> <b>progression,</b> tumors grow locally, then spread to the lymph nodes, then {{to the rest of the}} body. This has given rise to the popularity of local-only treatments such as surgery for small cancers. Even small localized tumors are increasingly recognized as possessing metastatic potential.|$|E
25|$|Treatment with {{docetaxel}} increasing {{survival time}} {{in people with}} certain types of cancer. While some clinical trials show median survival times to be increased by approximately only three months, the range of survival time is large. Many people survive beyond five years with treatment from docetaxel, however {{it is difficult to}} attribute these findings directly to treatment with docetaxel. Improved median survival time and response indicates that docetaxel slows metastatic <b>cancer</b> <b>progression</b> and can lead to disease-free survival. Conjunctive treatment of prednisone with docetaxel has been shown to lead to improved survival rate as well as improved quality of life and reduction of pain compared with treatments with mitoxantrone.|$|E

50|$|The {{expression}} {{and functions of}} FHL2 varies greatly depending on the cancer types. It appeared that phenomenon is highly related to the differential mechanistic transcriptional regulations of FHL2 in {{the various types of}} cancer. However, the participation of fhl2 mutations and the posttranslational modifications of fhl2 in carcinogenesis cannot be ignored. In fact, functional mutation of fhl2 has been identified in a patient with familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and is associated with its pathogenesis. This implied that fhl2 mutation may also profoundly affect the diverse <b>cancer</b> <b>progressions.</b> However, records describing the effects of fhl2 mutations on carcinogenesis are scarce.|$|R

25|$|UV {{radiation}} causes {{damage to}} the DNA of cells, typically thymine dimerization, which when unrepaired can create mutations in the cell's genes. When the cell divides, these mutations are propagated to new generations of cells. If the mutations occur in protooncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, the rate of mitosis in the mutation-bearing cells can become uncontrolled, leading {{to the formation of}} a tumor. Data from patients suggest that aberrant levels of activating transcription factor in the nucleus of melanoma cells are associated with increased metastatic activity of melanoma cells; studies from mice on skin cancer tend to confirm a role for activating transcription factor-2 in <b>cancer</b> <b>progression.</b>|$|E
25|$|Urokinase, {{also known}} as urokinase-type {{plasminogen}} activator (uPA), is a serine protease present in humans and other animals. The human urokinase protein was discovered, but not named, by McFarlane and Pilling in 1947. Urokinase was originally isolated from human urine, {{and it is also}} present in the blood and in the extracellular matrix of many tissues. The primary physiological substrate of this enzyme is plasminogen, which is an inactive form (zymogen) of the serine protease plasmin. Activation of plasmin triggers a proteolytic cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in thrombolysis or extracellular matrix degradation. This cascade had been involved in vascular diseases and <b>cancer</b> <b>progression.</b>|$|E
25|$|MPyV {{contains}} three proteins extensively {{studied for}} their ability to induce neoplastic transformation (that is, carcinogenesis); these proteins are expressed from the early region of the viral genome and are known as large, middle, and small tumor antigen. Murine polyomavirus and its close relative hamster polyomavirus are historically the only two known viruses whose genomes contain middle tumor antigen, by far the most efficient of the three early proteins at inducing carcinogenesis. In 2015 the genome sequence of a rat polyomavirus was reported to contain middle tumor antigen as well, consistent with expectations that it evolved uniquely in the rodent lineage of the polyomavirus family. Expression of MT from a transgene or introduction in cell culture can be sufficient to induce transformation. Studies using MT have played key roles in understanding host-cell oncogenes and their effects on carcinogenesis, particularly {{in the study of the}} Src family of tyrosine kinases. Transgenic mice expressing MT are widely used as models for <b>cancer</b> <b>progression</b> and metastasis, particularly of breast cancer.|$|E

25|$|HMGA2 protein {{specifically}} targets the {{promoter of}} ERCC1, thus reducing expression of this DNA repair gene. ERCC1 protein expression was deficient in 100% of 47 evaluated colon cancers (though {{the extent to}} which HGMA2 was involved is not known). A 2012 study showed that in normal tissues, HGMA1 and HMGA2 genes are targeted (and thus strongly reduced in expression) by miR-15, miR-16, miR-26a, miR-196a2 and Let-7a. However, each of these HMGA-targeting miRNAs are drastically reduced in almost all human pituitary adenomas studied, when compared with the normal pituitary gland. Consistent with the down-regulation of these HMGA-targeting miRNAs, an increase in the HMGA1 and HMGA2-specific mRNAs was observed. Three of these microRNAs (miR-16, miR-196a and Let-7a) have methylated promoters and therefore low expression in colon cancer. For two of these, miR-15 and miR-16, the coding regions are epigenetically silenced in cancer due to histone deacetylase activity. When these microRNAs are expressed at a low level, then HMGA1 and HMGA2 proteins are expressed at a high level. HMGA1 and HMGA2 target (reduce expression of) BRCA1 and ERCC1 DNA repair genes. Thus DNA repair can be reduced, likely contributing to <b>cancer</b> <b>progression.</b>|$|E
25|$|Scientists have {{established}} a few prostate cancer cell lines to investigate the mechanism involved in the progression of prostate cancer. LNCaP, PC-3 (PC3), and DU-145 (DU145) are commonly used prostate cancer cell lines. The LNCaP cancer cell line was established from a human lymph node metastatic lesion of prostatic adenocarcinoma. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were established from human prostatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to bone and to brain, respectively. LNCaP cells express androgen receptor (AR); however, PC-3 and DU-145 cells express very little or no AR. AR, an androgen-activated transcription factor, belongs to the steroid nuclear receptor family. Development of the prostate is dependent on androgen signaling mediated through AR, and AR is also important during the development of prostate cancer. The proliferation of LNCaP cells is androgen-dependent but the proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells is androgen-insensitive. Elevation of AR expression is often observed in advanced prostate tumors in patients. Some androgen-independent LNCaP sublines have been developed from the ATCC androgen-dependent LNCaP cells after androgen deprivation for study of prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>progression.</b> These androgen-independent LNCaP cells have elevated AR expression and express prostate specific antigen upon androgen treatment. The paradox is that androgens inhibit the proliferation of these androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.|$|E

40|$|Obesity and {{cachexia}} represent divergent {{states of}} nutritional and metabolic imbalance but both are intimately linked to cancer. There is an extensive overlap in their signalling pathways and molecular components involved such as fatty acids (FAs), which likely {{play a crucial}} role in cancer. Forkhead box (FOX) proteins are responsible of a wide range of transcriptional programmes du ring normal development, and the FOXO 3 - FOXM 1 axis is associated with <b>cancer</b> initiation, <b>progression</b> and drug resistance. Free fatty acids (FFAs), FA synthesis and ?? - oxidation are associated with <b>cancer</b> development and <b>progression.</b> Meanwhile, insulin and so me adipokines, that are up - regulated by FAs, are also involved in cancer development and poor prognosis. In this review, we discuss the role of FA metabolism in cancer and how FA metabolism integrates with the FOXO 3 - FOXM 1 axis.

500|$|Biologically, Hsp90A {{differs from}} Hsp90B in that Hsp90A is {{presently}} understood {{to function as}} a secreted extracellular agent in wound healing and inflammation in addition to its intracellular roles. These two processes are often hijacked by cancer allowing for malignant cell motility, metastasis and extravasion. [...] Current research in prostate cancer indicates that extracellular Hsp90A transduces signals that promote the chronic inflammation of cancer-associated fibroblasts. [...] This reprogramming of the extracellular milieu surrounding malignant adenocarcinoma cells is understood to stimulate prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>progression.</b> [...] Extracellular HSP90A induces inflammation through the activation of the NF-κB (RELA) and STAT3 transcription programs that include the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. [...] Coincidentally NF-κB also induces expression Hsp90A., thus providing a model where newly expressed Hsp90A would also be secreted from the stimulated fibroblast thereby creating positive autocrine and paracrine feedback loops resulting in an inflammatory storm at the site of malignancy. [...] This concept requires further attention as it may explain the correlation of increased levels of Hsp90A in the plasma of patients with advanced stages of malignancy.|$|E

50|$|Genetic loss or {{systemic}} knockdown of Malat1 using {{antisense oligonucleotides}} (ASO) in the mouse mammary carcinoma model results in slower tumor growth accompanied by significant differentiation into cystic tumors {{and a reduction}} in metastasis. At the molecular level, the ASO-Malat1 hybrid stimulates a naturally occurring cellular enzyme that degrades the Malat1 lncRNA. Malat1 knockdown results in alterations in gene expression and changes in splicing patterns of genes involved in differentiation and protumorigenic signaling pathways. Metastatic tumors have a dependency on Malat1—they can't thrive without it. And very importantly, only the cancer cells seem to require it. In so far as MALAT1 has been identified to be involved in tumorigenesis of various types of cancer such as lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer Malat1 ASOs represent a potential therapy for inhibiting such <b>cancers</b> <b>progression.</b>|$|R
