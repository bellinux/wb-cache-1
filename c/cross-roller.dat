40|$|Abstract. According to the {{property}} of contact problem, the calculation formula of contact stress of <b>cross-roller</b> slewing bearing is derived under the action of eccentric axial load. The finite element model of slewing bearing is analyzed in ANSYS, and then the finite element analysis software is {{used to analyze the}} contact stress. In this way, the distribution condition of contact stress between roller and rings is obtained. By comparing the finite element analysis results with theoretical analysis results, the correctness of finite element analysis is certified, which provides a guide for the design and optimization of slewing bearing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{manufacture}} {{the micro}} parts or micro structures effectively and precisely, a high precision 3 -axis micro milling machine is built. All the three axis {{are driven by}} linear piezoelectric ultrasonic motors and the slides are supported by <b>cross-roller</b> guide. Investigations are firstly made to analyze {{the impact of the}} non-linear characteristics in the servo mechanism on the performance of the servo system. To achieve the positioning and tracking accuracy at sub-micrometer and micrometer level respectively, on one hand, a optical linear encoder with the resolution of 50 nm is applied to close the control loop and a high performance DSP based motion control card is used to carried out the reference command. On the other hand, sophisticated control and compensation strategies are also implemented to overcome the non-linear characteristics in the servo system. Positioning and tracking experiments show that, with this well-tuned control system, the positioning and tracking accuracy are ± 0. 5 µm and ± 2. 4 µm respectively. Using this machine, a micro part with 5 µm thin-walled structure is machined successfully...|$|E
40|$|Controller design {{procedure}} for prototype tracking mount of Movable SLR (Satellite Laser Ranging), ARGO-M is presented. Tracking mount of ARGO-M is altitude-azimuth type {{and it has}} two axes of elevation and azimuth to control its position. Controller consists of velocity and acceleration feed-forward controller, position controller at outer loop, velocity controller at inner loop. There {{are two kinds of}} position control modes. One is the pointing mode to move from one position to the other position as fast as possible and the other one is tracking mode to follow SLR trajectory as precise as possible. Because the requirement of tracking accuracy is less than 5 arcsec and it is very tight error budget, a sophisticated controller needs to be prepared to meet the accuracy. Especially, ARGO-M is using the <b>cross-roller</b> bearing at each axis to increase the mechanical accuracy, which requires add-on controller DOB (Disturbance observer) to suppress friction load and low frequency disturbances. The pointing and tracking performance of the designed controller is simulated and visualized using MATLAB/ Simulink and SimMechanics and the experimental results using test are presented as well...|$|E
