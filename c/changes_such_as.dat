5|$|A {{variety of}} {{modifications}} ("mods") {{have been created}} for the Windows version of the game; these mods add multiple gameplay <b>changes,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> new player characters and levels. Popular mods include Unleashed Project, an effort to re-create Sonic Unleashed in Sonic Generationss engine; Super Mario Generations, a mod that replaces Sonic with Mario; and Super Sonic Generations, which expands upon the character's super forms.|$|E

Rather, they dispute the occurrence of major evolutionary changes {{over long periods of}} time, which by definition cannot be directly observed, only inferred from microevolutionary processes and the traces of macroevolutionary ones.|$|E

5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding <b>changes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E

5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural <b>changes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the release}} of the game's second demo in March 2011, the team's goals for the mod had {{expanded}} to a total overhaul of Brawl to better match Melees gameplay mechanics. A newer build added 11 characters and was first playable at the Genesis 2 tournament. The second demo, released on April 15, 2012, added four new characters as well as more stages and changes in multiple characters' gameplay mechanics. Players of this second demo reported a number of bugs, but these were fixed shortly afterwards in version 2.1. A demo version numbered 2.5 was announced on September 10, 2012; it featured <b>changes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> balance updates, aesthetic improvements, stage updates, and palette swaps for the characters. Version 2.5 was released on December 28.|$|E
5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral <b>changes</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E

5|$|Humans are {{not alone}} in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral <b>changes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social <b>changes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II were re-released both {{separately}} {{and as a}} combined game for the PlayStation. The collection was released in Japan in 2002 as Final Fantasy I & II Premium Package and in Europe and North America in 2003 as Final Fantasy Origins. This version {{was similar to the}} WonderSwan Color remake and featured several <b>changes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> more detailed graphics, a remixed soundtrack, added full motion video sequences, art galleries of Yoshitaka Amano's illustrations, and a memo save function. On December 18, 2012, the port was re-released as part of the Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box release.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between civilization and barbarism mirrors Latin America's {{difficulties in the}} post-Independence era. Literary critic Sorensen Goodrich argues that although Sarmiento {{was not the first}} to articulate this dichotomy, he forged it into a powerful and prominent theme that would impact Latin American literature. He explores the issue of civilization versus the cruder aspects of a caudillo culture of brutality and absolute power. Facundo set forth an oppositional message that promoted a more beneficial alternative for society at large. Although Sarmiento advocated various <b>changes,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> honest officials who understood enlightenment ideas of European and Classical origin, for him education was the key.|$|E
5|$|The immensely {{complex and}} ambitious F-111 design and {{construction}} process forced the Australian government to quickly adopt sophisticated American procurement and project management methods. Although Australia originally planned to buy the American F-111A design, RAAF liaison officers requested country-specific <b>changes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a long-distance radio, Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Melbourne participated in an intake redesign and provided metal fatigue expertise, and an Australian test pilot evaluated the Australian version's longer wings and performance in tropical conditions. The differences from the F-111A caused it to be designated the F-111C in 1966.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a kind}} of {{continuum}} {{with three}} semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and hybrid swarms (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within wildlife management and habitat management. Global climate change is creating other <b>changes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.|$|E

5|$|A {{new game}} {{mechanic}} {{to the series}} {{is the use of}} a slate found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of the slate is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on the slate and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve the slate and return it to its original space if the player drops it. Slate symbols can cause environmental <b>changes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> rain or increased wind, which may be necessary for solving puzzles. The slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will have to leave the slate behind if they want to climb a ladder.|$|E
5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice subtle <b>changes,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{the flavor of the}} cake changing, and a painting given to him by Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence that reality has changed, and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg, the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy Tactics Advance {{uses the}} {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy Tactics, but introduced certain <b>changes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a customizable map {{for the world}} of Ivalice. While built for the Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy Tactics Advances graphics are vibrantly colored and extensively detailed, and though environments and characters are wholly sprite-based, facial expressions are easily identifiable and many motion frames {{have been given to}} create a smooth animation. The game also introduced an option to switch between three display modes. Two of the modes are optimized for gameplay on Game Boy Advance and the new Game Boy Advance SP respectively, and there's also a TV mode for better color display while playing this game into a television screen by using a Game Boy Player which, must be attached to a Game Cube for this to work.|$|E
