50|$|A <b>confirming</b> <b>house</b> is a {{specialised}} UK {{agency that}} purchases and arranges {{the export of}} goods on the behalf of overseas buyers. They finance the movement of goods into the country by offering short-term credit to importers and guaranteeing, or confirming, payment to the suppliers in the suppliers own domestic currency. The <b>confirming</b> <b>house</b> usually negotiates the price with the suppliers, ships, insures and provides information on the goods on the overseas buyers' behalf.|$|E

50|$|Confirming houses: These are {{intermediate}} sellers {{that work}} for foreign buyers. They receive the product requirements from their clients, negotiate purchases, make delivery, and pay the suppliers/manufacturers. An opportunity here arises {{in the fact that}} if the client likes the product it may become a trade representative. A potential disadvantage includes supplier’s unawareness and lack of control over what a <b>confirming</b> <b>house</b> does with their product.|$|E

The team comes in one by one to say goodbye to Amber, and after Wilson himself says goodbye, he shuts off Amber's bypass and she passes away.
