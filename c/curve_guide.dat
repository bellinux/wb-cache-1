40|$|The use of <b>curved</b> <b>guide</b> tubes for {{transporting}} frozen hydrogen pellets offers great flexibility for {{pellet injection}} into plasma devices. While this technique {{has been previously}} employed, an increased interest in its applicability has been generated with the recent ASDEX Upgrade experimental data for magnetic high-field side (HFS) pellet injection. In these innovative experiments, the pellet penetration appeared to be significantly deeper than for the standard magnetic low-field side injection scheme, along with corresponding greater fueling efficiencies. Thus, {{some of the major}} experimental fusion devices are planning experiments with HFS pellet injection. Because of the complex geometries of experimental fusion devices, installations with multiple <b>curved</b> <b>guide</b> tube sections will be required for HFS pellet injection. To more thoroughly understand and document the capability of <b>curved</b> <b>guide</b> tubes, an experimental study is under way at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). In particular, configurations and pellet parameters applicable for the DIII-D tokamak and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) were simulated in laboratory experiments.

40|$|Neutron optics {{involves}} treating neutrons {{similarly to}} beams of light. The problem encountered {{in this paper}} involves determining the possible final conditions of neutrons traveling through neutron guides of various geometries. This problem can be addressed analytically through acceptance diagrams or numerically through ray tracing. An acceptance diagram is a graphical means of displaying the possible final conditions of neutrons, representing their vertical and angular ranges. Ray tracing uses the Monte Carlo Method to numerically plot the possible outcomes by following the paths of many individual neutrons until they reach the exit of the guide. How acceptance diagrams are developed and the mathematical explanation for the paths of individual neutrons within these acceptance diagrams will be explained for both straight <b>guides</b> and simple <b>curved</b> <b>guides.</b> Ray tracing for simple <b>curved</b> <b>guides</b> and guides of more complex geometries will be discussed as well...|$|R

[Phys. Rev. A 67, 043406 (2003) ] selects molecules by their forward velocity and effective electric dipole moment. Here we describe two main modifications {{with respect to}} previous work: (1) A segmented hexapole guide is used that produces a harmonic potential for the linearly Stark-shifted levels of ND₃. A <b>curved</b> <b>guide</b> is combined with a straight hexapole guide, and independent high-voltage supplies are employed to allow for bandpass velocity filtering. (2) State-selective laser ionization is used to obtain time- and state-selective detection of the guided molecules.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} addresses the representation, construction and interactive control of 3 D curves for various applications. Interactively controlling curves with empirical physical attributes of stiffness and elasticity that bend and wrap around 3 D scene geometry is a common and challenging problem. In this paper we address this problem with a novel 3 D curve called a cord. A cord is created and subsequently controlled in real-time by defining a secondary <b>curve</b> called the <b>guide</b> <b>curve.</b> The <b>guide</b> <b>curve</b> represents the general 3 D path that the user wishes the cord to follow while bending and wrapping around scene geometry. Cords have attributes of length, stiffness, and elasticity {{that allow them to}} empirically capture a range of behavior from wire to string to rubber bands. Cords that make contact with geometry have a representation in the 2 D parameter space of scene objects and can be used not only as geometry for modeling and animation but as 2 D parametric strokes for rendering. We present techniques for the creation and interactive control of cords and show examples illustrating their creative use within the animation system Maya. ...|$|R

However, a bent guide can be well approximated by a series of straight segments that are connected at a small angle [73]. Our electric guide is composed from multiple straight segments each 100 mm long and connected with a 1 ° tilt angle. Because we decided to build the magnetic guide from permanent magnets instead of electromagnets, a truly <b>curved</b> <b>guide</b> was not realistic, and we decided to use straight segments also here.

40|$|A {{method of}} calculating {{dispersion}} <b>curves</b> for <b>guided</b> waves in slight, azimuthally anisotropic formations is developed with perturbation theory. The fluid {{is assumed to}} be inviscid, the formation perfectly elastic and homogeneous, and the ·borehole wall cylindrical. The first step is calculating the elastic moduli for a transversely isotropic formation whose moduli are close to those for the azimuthally anisotropic formation. The perturbative method then uses the particle displacements for a guided wave in the transversely isotropic formation and the difference between the elastic moduli in the two formations to determine a first order correction to the wavenumber. These corrections are used to calculate the perturbation in the phase velocity. To test the method, the elastic moduli of an isotropic formation were pe~turbed to make it transversely isotropic. The exact dispersion curves and those estimated by the perturbative method are very close. The perturbative method was used to calculate dispersion <b>curves</b> for <b>guided</b> waves in two different geologic settings - a formation with aligned, vertical cracks and another with a tilted bed. In both examples the dispersion <b>curves</b> for the <b>guided</b> waves appear similar to typical dispersion curves for either isotropic or transversely isotropic formations.

Our aim was to compare two consecutive periods in the same team. The limit between the two periods is the time when the surgical team moved from one hospital to another. The judgement criteria to evaluate the control of this technique were the rate of conversion to laparotomy and the peri- and early post-surgical complications. Long-term anatomic and functional results are also probably highly relevant in this analysis, this surgery being functional. One of our limitations is probably the consecutive evaluation with different stand-back in both groups.
