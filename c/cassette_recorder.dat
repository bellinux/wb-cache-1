5|$|Most Spectrum {{software}} was originally distributed on audio cassette tapes. The Spectrum {{was intended to}} work with a normal domestic <b>cassette</b> <b>recorder,</b> and despite differences in audio reproduction fidelity, the software loading process was quite reliable and faster than on competing systems of the time.|$|E
5|$|The T series, {{produced}} from 1968 to 1975, {{was the last}} of the tonewheel spinet organs. Unlike all the earlier Hammond organs, which used vacuum tubes for preamplification, amplification, percussion and chorus-vibrato control, the T series used all-solid-state, transistor circuitry, though, unlike the L-100, it did include the scanner-vibrato as seen on the B-3. Other than the T-100 series models, all other T-Series models included a built-in rotating Leslie speaker and some included an analog drum machine, while the T-500 also included a built-in <b>cassette</b> <b>recorder.</b> It {{was one of the last}} tonewheel Hammonds produced.|$|E

Johnny finally {{comes out of the}} bathroom and retrieves the <b>cassette</b> <b>recorder</b> he attached to the phone and listens to an intimate call between Lisa and Mark. Johnny has an emotional breakdown, destroying his apartment and committing suicide via gunshot. Hearing the commotion, Denny, Mark and Lisa rush up the stairs to find his body. Mark and Denny blame Lisa for Johnny's death, with Mark abandoning her. Denny asks Lisa and Mark to leave, but they stay and comfort one another as the police arrive.|$|E

5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio <b>cassette</b> <b>recorder,</b> enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.|$|E
5|$|The main method {{employed}} by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often {{powered by a}} car battery), with a long wire antenna slung up between two trees. Around this time, VHF/FM transmitters were being built by more adventurous builders. A surge in pirate radio occurred when cheap portable transmitters became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, or could be built for less. The operation of a pirate radio station required a good quality <b>cassette</b> <b>recorder,</b> a transmitter and a high roof, with tower blocks providing the ideal transmission site for pirate radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting {{from the roof of}} a fifteen storey tower block could reach a forty-mile radius. Radio shows were often pre-recorded at home, with the pirate radio station operators setting up temporary transmitters on the roof of tower blocks.|$|E

25|$|The Hewlett Packard HP 9830 {{was one of}} {{the first}} desktop {{computers}} in the early 1970s to use automatically controlled cassette tapes for storage. It could save and find files by number, using a clear leader to detect the end of tape. These would be replaced by specialized cartridges, such as the 3M DC-series. Many of the earliest microcomputers implemented the Kansas City standard for digital data storage. Most home computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s could use cassettes for data storage as a cheaper alternative to floppy disks, though users often had to manually stop and start a <b>cassette</b> <b>recorder.</b> Even the first version of the IBM PC of 1981 had a cassette port and a command in its ROM BASIC programming language to use it. However, IBM cassette tape was seldom used, as by 1981 floppy drives had become commonplace in high-end machines.|$|E
25|$|When {{the patient}} visits a doctor, the latter spends {{time with the}} former {{discussing}} his medical problems, including history and/or problems. The doctor performs a physical examination and may request various laboratory or diagnostic studies; will make a diagnosis or differential diagnoses, then decides on a plan of treatment for the patient, which is discussed and explained to the patient, with instructions provided. After the patient leaves the office, the doctor uses a voice-recording device to record {{the information about the}} patient encounter. This information may be recorded into a hand-held <b>cassette</b> <b>recorder</b> or into a regular telephone, dialed into a central server located in the hospital or transcription service office, which will 'hold' the report for the transcriptionist. This report is then accessed by a medical transcriptionist, it is clearly received as a voice file or cassette recording, who then listens to the dictation and transcribes it into the required format for the medical record, and of which this medical record is considered a legal document. The next time the patient visits the doctor, the doctor will call for the medical record or the patient's entire chart, which will contain all reports from previous encounters. The doctor can on occasion refill the patient's medications after seeing only the medical record, although doctors prefer to not refill prescriptions without seeing the patient to establish if anything has changed.|$|E

500|$|The ZX Spectrum +2 was Amstrad's first Spectrum, coming {{shortly after}} their {{purchase}} of the Spectrum range and [...] "Sinclair" [...] brand in 1986. The machine featured an all-new grey case featuring a spring-loaded keyboard, dual joystick ports, and a built-in <b>cassette</b> <b>recorder</b> dubbed the [...] "Datacorder" [...] (like the Amstrad CPC 464), but was in most respects identical to the ZX Spectrum 128. The main menu screen lacked the Spectrum 128's [...] "Tape Test" [...] option, and the ROM was altered to account for a new 1986 Amstrad copyright message. These changes resulted in minor incompatibility problems with software that accessed ROM routines at certain addresses. Production costs had been reduced and the retail price dropped to £139–£149.|$|E
500|$|Klepacki {{was raised}} by a family of musicians of Polish and Italian descent who played on the Las Vegas strip. He drew art as a hobby, but music prevailed in his early interests. He {{received}} his first drumset at age 8 and began performing professionally by age 11. Among his early influences were electronica and heavy metal groups, including Depeche Mode, Afrika Bambaataa, AC/DC, and Iron Maiden. Seeking to master guitar, bass, and keyboards, he formed local bands and created a demo tape of original material by age 17. His impetus for diversifying his instrumental abilities was [...] "not being {{able to communicate with}} other band members on ideas...for original songs." [...] His first piece of audio gear was a TASCAM 4-track <b>cassette</b> <b>recorder,</b> which he used to record demos, band practices, and live shows.|$|E

500|$|Similarly to Wasserman's {{unfinished}} commission, 1968's The Alphabet {{was composed}} of both live action and animation. The abstract 16mm movie was inspired by an experience related by Lynch's wife Peggy, who had once seen her niece reciting the alphabet in her sleep while suffering from a nightmare. Peggy was the sole live action actor in the film, which depicted in animation the nightmares [...] of a young girl. The film displays several elements that would continue throughout Lynch's oeuvre, {{including the use of}} meticulous sound design to convey unease. The sound of his infant daughter crying was recorded on a faulty <b>cassette</b> <b>recorder</b> and included in the film's soundtrack; the malfunctioning of the recorder not only lent the sound a desirably distorted quality but allowed Lynch to return it to where he had purchased it from upon finishing the film.|$|E
500|$|After her fifteenth birthday, Rachel McKnight, {{a member}} of a {{fundamentalist}} Mormon community in Utah, listens to a <b>cassette</b> <b>recorder</b> {{for the first time and}} hears a cover of [...] "Hanging on the Telephone" [...] by an obscure rock band on a blue cassette. Her brother, Mr. Will, takes it from her, stating that it is to be used only for God's purposes. When she discovers she is pregnant, she is convinced that she has conceived miraculously, like the Virgin Mary, through the medium of the cassette. After being questioned by her parents, Mr. Will is blamed for impregnating her, and is asked to leave the community, while Rachel is told she will be married the next day. Rather than undergo a shotgun marriage arranged by her father, Paul, she escapes to Las Vegas, along with Mr. Will, who is sleeping in the bed of the family's pickup truck.|$|E
500|$|Pausch {{was known}} for some lectures in his {{previous}} jobs.
