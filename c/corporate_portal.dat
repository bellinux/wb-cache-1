40|$|ABSTRACTThough still {{evolving}} in real world, {{the discussion}} regarding customer relationships {{has moved to}} the virtual world, making the relationship between marketing, the Internet, and the corporate portals {{part of the new}} day-by-day business. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate how corporate portals help to promote and develop the relationship between companies and their customers. In order to achieve this objective we developed an exploratory research, based on a single case study. The first phase of the analysis sought to understand the company’s strategic objectives in relation to its <b>corporate</b> <b>portal</b> and the tools used to establish and develop relationships with their customers. This research was conducted through in-depth interviews with executives directly involved with a company’s <b>corporate</b> <b>portal.</b> Using triangulation, the result obtained in the interviews provided the basis for the second phase of the investigation which consisted of a survey conducted with clients of the company under review. This second phase investigated the relationship of the clients with the <b>corporate</b> <b>portal</b> and their understanding with respect to the same items listed by the company as their goals for the portal. At the end of this study a comparison was done between the company’s goals and the understanding of customers about these goals. Emerging from that data were considerations about the efficiency of the portal to the achievement of the relationship marketing objectives as well as contributions to a better positioning of the <b>corporate</b> <b>portal</b> tools opposite to the company strategy and to the needs and expectations of their customers...|$|E

40|$|Web Portal Software Systems {{have become}} a very {{effective}} communication medium for sharing. Our Portal Management System dramatically simplifies the creation and management of portals. A <b>corporate</b> <b>portal</b> is a web-based platform to access with security {{a broad range of}} information, services, applications and expertise. The <b>corporate</b> <b>portal</b> management system platform offers a flexible and robust content management solution that allows employees, customers and partners to safely collaborate on, contribute to and manage business content anywhere around the world. It can be utilised as an extranet that serves both internal and external users or as an intranet for internal communication in an organisation. Corporate portals can also provide single sign-on capabilities between their users and various other systems. The focus of our software is on presenting documents and content in an effective manner to individuals, groups, customers, partners and vendors. Portal content, services and applications can be customized and personalized to the need of different users or user groups. Content will be published on portal by a content management tool. Before publishing the content, it will be approved by management by using workflow. The basic and the most important function of the <b>Corporate</b> <b>Portal</b> Management System is the routing of data using the concept of workflow along with the various features like scheduling, commenting module and other similar features which make the software using service highly interactive and communicative.

40|$|Abstract. Unlike other Web applications, <b>corporate</b> <b>portals</b> reckon {{to provide}} an {{integration}} space for corporate services. Mashups contribute to this goal by brin-ging a relevant customization technique whereby portal users can supplement portal services with their own data needs. The challenge {{is to find a}} balance bet-ween portal reliability and mashup freedom. Our approach is to split responsibili-ties between service providers and portal users. Providers decide on how services can be mashuped, portal users determine the supplemented content, and finally, the portal engine mediates between the two. This permits portal services to be reliably customized through user mashups. The approach is realized for Liferay as the portal engine, portlets as the realization of portal services, and XBL as the integration technology...|$|R
