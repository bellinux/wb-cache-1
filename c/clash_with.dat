5|$|The {{final draft}} went smoothly, {{except for a}} <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> the editors of The Russian Messenger, about which very little is known. Since the {{manuscript}} Dostoyevsky turned in to Katkov was lost, it is unclear to what the editors had objected in the original.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1979 Islamic {{revolution}} in Iran, in 1981 Bahraini Shī'a fundamentalists orchestrated a failed coup attempt {{under the auspices}} of a front organisation, the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. The coup would have installed a Shī'a cleric exiled in Iran, Hujjatu l-Islām Hādī al-Mudarrisī, as supreme leader heading a theocratic government. In December 1994, a group of youths threw stones at female runners during an international marathon for running bare-legged. The resulting <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> police soon grew into civil unrest.|$|E

5|$|The colonial {{impact on}} the Igbo in Achebe's novels is often {{effected}} by individuals from Europe, but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose. The character of Obi in No Longer at Ease succumbs to colonial-era corruption in the city; the temptations of his position overwhelm his identity and fortitude. The courts and the position of District Commissioner in Things Fall Apart likewise <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> {{the traditions of the}} Igbo, and remove their ability to participate in structures of decision-making.|$|E

Murray offered to play with 2012 Wimbledon Doubles champion Jonathan Marray, because Marray was unable to convince anyone to join him on court. For Murray and Marray's first competitive match together, they won a doubles clash against Gaël Monfils and Juan Mónaco only to lose in the second round to the No 2 seeds Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona responded quickly, as Carles Puyol found Eto'o {{with a long}} throw-in {{down the}} right wing. The Cameroonian then found Messi, who cut inside and hit a curling 25-yard shot that just shaved {{the top of the}} crossbar. A quick-passing move from United followed, {{culminating}} with a through-ball to Park in the inside right channel, only for Valdés to cut out the pass, taking out the South Korean in the process. The resulting throw-in eventually broke to Ronaldo, whose 30-yard shot went just wide. Valdés' <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> Park, however, left him requiring treatment, and although the injury was not sufficient to necessitate a substitution, Valdés chose to leave his next few goal kicks to Piqué.|$|E
