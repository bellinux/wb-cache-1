The restaurant was named after {{the architect of the}} hotel, Sir George Gilbert Scott. Wareing believes in promoting good quality, seasonal British food in his menus, and using small suppliers.|$|E

5|$|The most {{well known}} French <b>chef</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Ages was Guillaume Tirel, {{also known as}} Taillevent. Taillevent worked in {{numerous}} royal kitchens during the 14th century. His first position was as a kitchen boy in 1326. He was chef to Philip VI, then the Dauphin who was son of John II. The Dauphin became King Charles V of France in 1364, with Taillevent as his chief cook. His career spanned sixty-six years, and upon his death he was buried in grand style between his two wives. His tombstone represents him in armor, holding a shield with three cooking pots, marmites, on it.|$|E
5|$|He first {{worked at}} the Savoy Hotel under chef Anton Edelmann in 1988 {{at the age of}} 18 where he was {{employed}} as a commis chef, before leaving in 1993 to join Albert Roux at Michelin starred Le Gavroche where he first met Gordon Ramsay. Stints at other restaurants in New York City, Amsterdam and at Gravetye Manor in Sussex followed. Wareing joined Gordon Ramsay's Aubergine when it opened in 1993, where he became Sous Chef behind Head Chef Ramsay and would go on to work with him {{over the course of the}} following 15 years, which led to Wareing being called Ramsay's protégé. While he was at Aubergine in 1995, he was awarded the title of Young <b>Chef</b> <b>of</b> the Year by the Restaurant Association.|$|E
5|$|It {{remained}} in {{use as a}} small public house, until it was extensively refurbished and reopened as a high quality restaurant. It was awarded a coveted Michelin star in 2007, one of thirteen newly starred restaurants in the UK in that year's Guide. In 2010, Martin Blunos joined Crown restaurants as executive <b>chef</b> <b>of</b> the group which oversaw both the Crown at Whitebrook and the Crown at Celtic Manor. That same year, it won a Gold Award from Visit Wales for the rooms on site. As of 2011 {{it was one of}} only four establishments in Wales to hold a Michelin star.

5|$|The {{in-flight}} food is catered by TajSATS Air Catering, another {{joint venture}} between Tata and a Singaporean company, headed by Chef Arun Batra, formerly the executive <b>chef</b> <b>of</b> the Taj Hotels group. Vistara offers four different meals for each cabin for different {{time of the day}} — breakfast, refreshment, lunch and dinner with options of one vegetarian and one non-vegetarian dish in economy class; two vegetarian dishes and one non-vegetarian dish in premium economy; and two vegetarian and two non-vegetarian dishes for business-class cabin.

5|$|The {{restaurant}} was {{moved into the}} Berkeley Hotel in 2003 where it replaced Pierre Koffmann's La Tante Claire, {{in the same year}} that Wareing became Chef Patron of the Grill Room at the Savoy Hotel, and he was named <b>Chef</b> <b>of</b> the Year by Caterer and Hotelkeepers Catey Awards. The return to the Savoy meant that he was competing against Anton Edelmann, his former boss from the River Room at the hotel. Rather than serve a menu similar to the French driven Pétrus, Wareing chose to continue to serve the British cuisine that the Grill Room was known for, including his take on previous menu items such as steak and kidney pudding and potted shrimps. Pétrus went on to be awarded two Michelin stars and five AA Rosettes, while the Savoy Grill achieved its first Michelin star in the hotel's history in 2004.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Charles Ritz in 1976, the hotel went into a period of slow decline. As it lost its luster, its {{clientele}} diminished, {{and for the first}} time in its existence it began to lose money. It was rescued, however, in 1979 by an Egyptian businessman, Mohamed Al-Fayed, who purchased the hotel for $20million and installed a new managing director, Frank Klein. Klein in turn put Guy Legay, the former <b>chef</b> <b>of</b> the three-star Ledoyen, in charge of the kitchen. Al-Fayed renovated it completely over several years without stopping its operation; this was achieved by annexing two town houses, joined by an arcade with many of Paris's leading boutiques. The renovation of the hotel was headed by the architect Bernard Gaucherel from 1980 to 1987. The entire ten-year renovation cost a total of $250million. The restaurants were given a new look, and a swimming pool, health club, and spas were created in the basement. The Little Bar was renamed the Hemingway Bar. In 1988 the Ritz-Escoffier School of French Gastronomy was established in honour of Auguste Escoffier.|$|E

5|$|Aiello plotted to {{eliminate}} both Lombardo and Capone, and {{starting in the}} spring of 1927 made several attempts to assassinate Capone. On one occasion he offered money to the <b>chef</b> <b>of</b> Diamond Joe Esposito's Bella Napoli Café, Capone's favorite restaurant, to put prussic acid in Capone's and Lombardo's soup; reports indicated he offered between $10,000-$35,000. Instead, the chef exposed the plot to Capone, who responded by dispatching men to destroy one of Aiello's stores on West Division Street with machine-gun fire. More than 200 bullets were fired into the Aiello Brothers Bakery on May 28, 1927, wounding Joe's brother Antonio. During the summer and autumn of 1927 a number of hitmen Aiello hired to kill Capone were themselves slain. Among them were Anthony Russo and Vincent Spicuzza, who Aiello had offered $25,000 each to kill Capone and Lombardo. Aiello eventually offered a $50,000 reward to anyone who eliminated Capone. At least 10 gunman tried to collect on Aiello's bounty, but ended up dead. Capone ally Ralph Sheldon attempted to kill both Capone and Lombardo for Aiello's reward, but Capone henchman Frank Nitti's intelligence network learned of the transaction and had Sheldon shot in front of a West Side hotel, although he didn't die.|$|E
