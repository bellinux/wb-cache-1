40|$|SUMMARY A <b>counter</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> {{method was}} {{compared}} with a double diffusion test for detecting Aspergillusfumigatus antibodies. Of 70 patients, 23 gave positive results in both tests and the remainder gave negative results. Fifteen patients with proven aspergillosis gave positive results in both tests. The detection of Aspergillus fumigatus precipitins is of importance in the diagnosis {{of all forms of}} human aspergillosis. The principal serological method at present used to detect these antibodies is the double diffusion test. <b>Counter</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> (CIEP) is a simple and rapid method which has been reported to be useful for detecting antibodies in persons with fungal infections including candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis (Gordon e...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo review {{phage typing}} of 12 {{clusters}} of nosocomial Klebsiella infections which occurred between 1974 and 1997, and to compare phage typing and K serotyping. Materials and methodsA total of 489 clinical and laboratory Klebsiella isolates were phage typed using 110 different phage preparations and K typed by <b>counter</b> current <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> against 77 K antisera. ResultsA total of 152 phage types (PT) and 82 K types were found. Thirty-six phage types and 14 K types were represented {{only by the}} reference type strains. Of the remaining 68 K types, 60 could be subdivided into from two to 10 phage types. Ten out of 12 clusters of nosocomial Klebsiella infections could be verified as outbreaks by phage typing, whereas two clusters {{were found to be}} accumulations of sporadic cases. K typing performed retrospectively confirmed these results. In addition, for a subset of 104 epidemiologically unrelated isolates, O typing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis typing data were available.

The virus was titrated by using reverse passive haemagglutination (RPHA) test and egg infective dose fifty (EID 50). The FV was inoculated into 9 -to 11 -day-old embryonated chicken eggs through chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM). At each passage, {{the virus in}} the chorio-allantoic fluid (CAF) and embryos was confirmed by AGPT and titrated by RPHA test. Geometric mean titer (GMT) of the virus in CAF was 37 to 64 in 1 - 3 rd passage, 111 to 239 in 4 - 7 th passages. In 8 to 15 th passages, virus titer remained from 294 to 588 and in 16 - 24 th passages virus titer ranged from 675 to 2195.

40|$|Abstract Background Chhattisgarh {{state in}} central India is highly endemic for malaria and {{contributes}} about 13 % of annually reported malaria {{cases in the}} country with predominance of P. falciparum. Entomological investigations were carried out in a tribal forested area of district Bastar located {{in the southern part of}} Chhattisgarh state to record the prevalence of sibling species of Anopheles fluviatilis and An. culicifacies complexes. The vector species complexes were investigated at sibling species level for their biology in terms of resting and feeding behavior and malaria transmission potential. Methods Indoor resting vector mosquitoes collected during 2010 â€“ 2011 were identified to sibling species by cytotaxonomy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The blood meal source analysis and incrimination studies were done at sibling species level by <b>counter</b> current <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. Results Analysis of sibling species composition revealed predominance of An. fluviatilis species S in the study area, which was found to be highly anthropophagic and rested in human dwellings whereas the sympatric species T was primarily zoophagic. Incrimination studies showed high sporozoite rate in species S, thereby confirming its vectorial efficiency. An. culicifacies was encountered in low numbers and comprised species B and C in almost equal proportion. Both these species were found to be exclusively zoophagic. Conclusion The observations made strongly suggest that species S of Fluviatilis Complex is the principal vector of malaria in certain forest areas of district Bastar, Chhattisgarh state and should be the target species for vector control operation. Vector control strategies based on biological characteristics of Fluviatilis S will lead to substantial decline in malaria incidence in such areas. </p...|$|R

Immunoblotting was more sensitive in detecting anti-Sm, anti-SS-B and anti-PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen); CIE was more sensitive for anti-nRNP and anti-SS-A. Overall, the prevalence of these anti-ENA antibodies in SLE was increased by 9 - 20 % if immunoblotting was used in addition to CIE. Sera specific for the 52 kDa peptide of the SS-A antigen (anti- 52 kDa SS-A) were better detected by immunoblotting. Anti-PCNA antibody was found in 6. 3 % of SLE patients and was associated with active disease and hemolytic anemia. The positive rate of anti-Sm was 9 % by CIE and 23. 7 % by immunoblotting and this antibody was a specific marker for SLE using either method.
