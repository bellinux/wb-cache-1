40|$|A new {{approach}} of predicting the residual stresses following a CO 2 and fibre laser surface treatment of Si 3 N 4 and ZrO 2 <b>engineering</b> <b>ceramics</b> is proposed. The approach used a {{three-point bending test}} to predict the localized residual stresses present within the <b>engineering</b> <b>ceramics</b> by using condition of static equilibrium and bending moment. This allowed one to determine the local microscopic residual stresses present {{and an understanding of}} the stress state within the surface and through the cross-section of the as-received and the laser radiated <b>engineering</b> <b>ceramics.</b> The findings showed that both of the CO 2 and the fibre laser radiated samples induced tensile residual stress into the <b>engineering</b> <b>ceramics</b> through the high temperature gradient that was inhibited by the laser treatments in comparison to the as-received samples. The results were more significant for the fibre laser surface treated ZrO 2 engineering ceramic in particular as opposed to the CO 2 laser radiated ZrO 2 engineering ceramic. It was postulated that the difference in the depth of energy absorbed by the fibre laser in comparison to the CO 2 laser as well as the temperature difference between the two lasers was inducing different level of thermal energy into the sub-surfaces of the ZrO 2 and the Si 3 N 4 <b>engineering</b> <b>ceramics.</b> This inherently had generated variation in the residual stress induced within the bulk of the <b>engineering</b> <b>ceramics</b> as there was more expansion and contraction produced within the samples radiated by the fibre laser as opposed to the CO 2 laser which produced lower processing temperature...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper investigates finance companies’ {{corporate}} {{social reporting}} in Bangladesh, a developing country. A favorable investment climate {{is one of}} the preconditions for a country to prosper economically. This can be ensured by good corporate social reporting by finance sector companies. In Bangladesh, finance sector companies together hold 43. 82 % of total market capitalization on the Dhaka Stock Exchange and 26. 54 % of GDP, which is proportionately large for a country like Bangladesh. No studies have previously explored the commitment to environmental and social disclosure by finance sector companies operating in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis instruments are used to analyse corporate social reporting by listed finance companies in Bangladesh. Findings: Analysis of annual reports published in 2007 - 2008 reveals that 41 % of listed finance sector companies made some kind of CSR disclosures. As a developing country, this figure is quite impressive compared to CSR disclosures in other sectors, like <b>ceramics,</b> <b>engineering,</b> IT, paper and printing. However, extensive survey of the contents, form, nature and extent of corporate social reporting of finance companies reveals that three quarters of all disclosures are generalized qualitative statements without any attempt at quantification. More than half of disclosures are located in the director’s report, and the average length of disclosures amounted to less than half a page. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature as no previous studies have reported on finance sector companies and their record in corporate social reporting in developing countries, such as Bangladesh...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on {{corporate}} social reporting by the pharmaceutical companies in Bangladesh to see how it stands with the rapid growth in this sector. No studies have previously explored the commitments to environmental and social disclosure by pharmaceutical companies operating in Bangladesh. Content analysis instruments are employed to analyze corporate social reporting by listed pharmaceutical companies in Bangladesh. Analysis of annual reports published in 2007 - 2008 reveals that 33. 33 % of listed pharmaceutical companies made some kind of CSR disclosures. As a least developing country, this figure is quite impressive compared to CSR disclosures in other sectors, such as <b>ceramics,</b> <b>engineering,</b> IT, paper and printing. However, an extensive survey of the contents, form, nature and extent of corporate social reporting of pharmaceutical companies reveals that more than three quarters of all disclosures are generalized qualitative statements without any attempt at quantification. More than half of disclosures are located in the director's report and separate section of a company's annual report, and the average length of disclosures amounted to less than one quarter of a page. Without question, pharmaceutical companies have a moral obligation to society to provide people, especially the poor, with affordable medication. As it is a growing industry with $ 700 million investment and more than 230 manufacturers is continuously expanding, rising to new heights with new and improved products [...] -it would be interesting to know the CSR practice of major players of this industry.

50|$|Just as {{the elastic}} {{properties}} of materials, like elastic moduli and strength, vary among material class, so too does the fracture toughness. Figure.1 graphs the fracture toughness vs. strength for various materials and materials classes. However, unlike most elastic properties, fracture toughness displays a wide variation across materials, about 4 orders of magnitude. As can be expected, metals hold the highest values of fracture toughness. Since cracks cannot easily propagate in tough materials, this makes metals highly resistant to cracking under stress and gives their stress-strain curve a large zone of plastic flow. Comparatively, <b>engineering</b> <b>ceramics</b> {{have a lower}} fracture toughness, which leads to ease of cracking, but show an exceptional improvement in the stress fracture that is attributed to their 1.5 orders of magnitude strength increase, relative to metals. Of note is the fracture toughness of composites (made by combining <b>engineering</b> <b>ceramics</b> with <b>engineering</b> polymers) (in the zone of engineering alloys), which greatly exceeds the individual fracture toughness of the constituent materials.|$|R

40|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>ceramics</b> {{have been}} widely used in modern {{industry}} for their excellent physical and mechanical properties, and they are difficult to machine owing to their high hardness and brittleness. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is the appropriate process for machining <b>engineering</b> <b>ceramics</b> provided they are electrically conducting. However, the electrical resistivity of the popular <b>engineering</b> <b>ceramics</b> is higher, and there has been no research on the relationship between the EDM parameters and the electrical resistivity of the <b>engineering</b> <b>ceramics.</b> This paper investigates the effects of the electrical resistivity and EDM parameters such as tool polarity, pulse interval, and electrode material, on the ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic's EDM performance, in terms of the material removal rate (MRR), electrode wear ratio (EWR), and surface roughness (SR). The results show that the electrical resistivity and the EDM parameters have the great influence on the EDM performance. The ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic with the electrical resistivity up to 3410 Ω·cm can be effectively machined by EDM with the copper electrode, the negative tool polarity, and the shorter pulse interval. Under most machining conditions, the MRR increases, and the SR decreases with the decrease of electrical resistivity. Moreover, the tool polarity, and pulse interval affect the EWR, respectively, and the electrical resistivity and electrode material have a combined effect on the EWR. Furthermore, the EDM performance of ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic with the electrical resistivity higher than 687 Ω·cm is obviously different from that with the electrical resistivity lower than 687 Ω·cm, when the electrode material changes. The microstructure character analysis of the machined ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic surface shows that the ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic is removed by melting, evaporation and thermal spalling, and the material from the working fluid and the graphite electrode can transfer to the workpiece surface during electrical discharge machining ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic...|$|R
