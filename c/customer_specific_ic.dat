40|$|In the 80 's, {{almost all}} the GaAs IC {{companies}} offered on a commercial basis to fabricate prototype MMIC's designed or not by the customer himself into the foundry proprietary processes. Most of the leading GaAs IC companies have today discontinued their foundry service to focus on large volume production of standard parts like power amplifiers for mobilecom terminals. However the traditional custom foundry business is well alive and kicking and will reach 250 MEuros in 2000 representing 20 % of the total GaAs MMIC market. It is no longer limited to prototyping but also includes small to medium volume production of <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> <b>ICs</b> (CSICs). The various GaAs custom foundry services are reviewed in detail including process guarantees, CAD support and the "known good die" issue. The economics of a GaAs foundry service is revisited and a business perspective for the coming years is given...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{methods that}} {{are capable of}} {{improving}} the revenue and profitability of a financial services company are presented. Of particular interest is the use of <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> information for pricing insurance products and segmenting a customer population based on the expected profitability of the customers. A prerequisite is the possibility for customers to have many different financial services products from the same provider. The thesis presents multivariate credibility models for how <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> information from one (or many) financial services products is related to <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> information from another financial services product. The models are foremost applied to the context of cross-selling (selling additional products to existing <b>customers)</b> where <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> information from the offered cross-sale product is not available before the sale. As products are related, it is reasonable to use an appropriate (credible) amount of <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> information from another product (or products), for estimating the profitability expected to emerge from the offered cross-sale product. In four separate but related articles, it is shown that having appropriate models for pricing and customer segmentation is of great importance for a financial services company aiming at running a profitable and growing business...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ⎯ This article {{describes}} an implementation method for the <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> control of measurement devices and automation systems. The interface between {{the system and}} the user is implemented {{by means of a}} standardized mobile storage card. Additionally to the Flash storage function the cards are optionally equipped with a microcontroller for the execution of <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> programs. This interface enables the customer to develop his own specific algorithm in a simple and secure way. Due to the mobile characteristics of the card, all <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> control, data acquisition and logging of measurement results are done on the user’s card. Additionally the timing influence on the measurement program is reduced to a minimum. The card interface separates the measurement program from the user program in a way which provides both real-time advantages and security features to the customer and to the measurement device vendor.

40|$|AbstractUntil now, mass-customisation of (wearable) {{products}} {{has been}} seen as higher added value which had (and will have) to compete with ready to wear offers. However, there are fields of application for which <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> product design, including benefits as optimized fit, is not just an added value but a fundamental need. This {{is due to the fact}} that off-the shelf products do not meet the morphological or problem specific diversity needed to assure the functionality of the products. Thus, individualized products are in a lot of cases not just an additional feature but a prerequisite for successful curing. The FASHION-ABLE virtual development and production framework is set up on digital development data of the future products as well as workflow specific data and information objects that are processed in dedicated process steps. Thus first of all the relevant information and data objects will be highlighted and described and in a second step aligned with the underlying workflow. The basic information for individualized production of orthotics is composed out of a <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> 3 D scan that is used to extract the relevant measures and the configuration of the orthotic. To enable automated adaption of pattern to customer measures, 2 D CAD models that are enhanced with MtM rules are coexisting with 3 D simulation ready CAD data, also enhanced with the same MtM rules to enable virtual proof of fit. These CAD data are provided in a modular way to ensure a lean variant-capable setup. Bringing these CAD data together with the <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> configuration and the 3 D scan then enables to simulate a virtual prototype as well as to generate an optimized <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> marker...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{success of}} a product family heavily depends {{on the degree of}} reuse {{achieved}} when developing product family based <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> applications. If a significant amount of the customer requirements can be realized by using the communality and the variability defined for the product family, the reuse level is high; if not, the reuse level is low. In this paper we elaborate on the influence of customer requirements on the degree of reuse achieved within a product family. We argue that the level of reuse can be increased by considering the capabilities of the product family when defining the requirements for the <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> application. We finally show how this can be supported by product family specific use cases. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} how a company may handle {{the interplay between}} the {{development}} of standard products and <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> solutions. There are three aims of the thesis. The first aim concerns how a buyer and a supplier in interaction arrive at a solution involving a mix of standard and <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> product features. The second aim concerns how the supplier can manage the balance between exploitation of standard products and exploration of new product features during {{the development of a}} particular solution. The third aim concerns how the development of specific solutions affects the development of the standard product. The frame of reference is primarily based on the Industrial Network Approach, and deals with utilization and development of products within networks of interdependent resources. While resource utilisation is seen as dependent on how the resources are embedded into the network, resource development takes place when their features are changed {{in order to make the}} resources fit into new combinations. The thesis is based on a case study focusing on a Swedish ERP-system provider’s development of new product features. The main part of the case deals with the company’s development of a <b>customer</b> <b>specific</b> solution in interaction with one particular buyer whose requirements could not be met by existing produc...|$|R
