25|$|Under an {{amendment}} of 2002, {{the leader of}} the party winning the largest number of seats in the election is invited by the governor-general to form the government, if he <b>can</b> <b>muster</b> the necessary majority in parliament. The process of forming such a coalition in PNG, where parties do not have much ideology, involves considerable horsetrading right up until the last moment. Peter O'Neill emerged as Papua New Guinea's prime minister after the July 2012 election, and formed a government with Leon Dion, the former Governor of East New Britain Province, as deputy prime minister.|$|E

It feels tired and uninspired." [...] Nathan Slavik of DJBooth praised the song's depth and said it featured [...] "a rewind-worthy verse from Kanye and a completely superfluous Big Sean." [...] Jesal Padania of RapReviews called the song riotously enjoyable, but said that Ross' contribution did not add anything to the song.|$|E
500|$|The New York Herald Tribune thought On Her Majesty's Secret Service to be [...] "solid Fleming", {{while the}} Houston Chronicle {{considered}} the novel to be [...] "Fleming at his urbanely murderous best, a notable {{chapter in the}} saga of James Bond". Gene Brackley, writing in the Boston Globe wrote that Bond [...] "needs all the quality he <b>can</b> <b>muster</b> to escape alive" [...] from Blofeld's clutches {{in the book and}} this gives rise to [...] "two of the wildest chase scenes in the good guys-bad guys literature". Regarding the fantastic nature of the plots, Brackley considered that [...] "Fleming's accounts of the half-world of the Secret Service have the ring of authenticity" [...] because of his previous role with the NID.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Matt Wales {{had a more}} mixed {{opinion about}} the episode, rating it a [...] "good" [...] 7 out of 10. He {{considered}} it imaginative with [...] "more brilliant ideas...than most other shows <b>can</b> <b>muster</b> in an entire season", but he thought the episode [...] "never quite brought its cacophony of ideas {{together to form a}} satisfying whole", and the conclusion [...] "failed to resonate effectively against the hodgepodge of insane ideas and action". Because of the large amount of ideas, Wales also pointed out that the characterisation was [...] "scant", especially on Liz 10 and the Smilers. However, he praised Smith's and Gillan's chemistry and Moffat's [...] "crackling dialogue". In February 2013, Moffat cited [...] "The Beast Below" [...] as his least-favourite among the episodes he wrote, describing it as [...] "a bit of a mess".|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} {{act of the}} show, Jack conspires with {{the cast and crew}} to give Liz a last-minute {{birthday}} surprise which he wants to appear {{as though it had been}} planned all along. Meanwhile, Carol safely lands his plane and rushes to greet Liz on set. All they <b>can</b> <b>muster</b> on short notice is a polka band and a large cake with Fonzie on it—gifts that were intended to celebrate janitor Jadwiga's birthday. She proceeds to ruin the TGS goodnights and tear into the cake with her bare hands. In Jack's office, Liz and Jack share a drink as Liz's birthday wish. In the final scene, as Jack takes a drink, the program reverts to a pre-recorded segment and Jack says, [...] "That's more like it." [...] The episode ends with a live goodnight from the TGS stage by the cast of the episode, a la Saturday Night Live.|$|E
500|$|A lone [...] rider {{formed the}} day's breakaway. Daniel Sesma slipped {{ahead of the}} peloton after only [...] Given the stage's flat profile and the limited power one rider <b>can</b> <b>muster</b> on his own, he was allowed an {{advantage}} of nearly ten minutes at one point, before the chase began. When he was caught, at the [...] to go mark, the [...] team took {{to the front of}} the field to try to set up an attack by their leader Giovanni Visconti. Visconti never had much of an advantage, but the work done by his team did put sprinters like Mark Cavendish into more difficulty than anticipated on the short climb that preceded the finish. For the second day in a row, Cavendish had to chase back on to the main field prior to the mass sprint finale. In the sprint, world champion Thor Hushovd again led out race leader Tyler Farrar, but may have been too strong in so doing, as he briefly opened up a gap on his team leader. Cavendish lost the wheel of his leadout man Mark Renshaw, and again failed to factor into the finish. Hushovd's early leadout left Farrar to go for the finish line from [...] out, which proved too far as Juan José Haedo was able to come around the American at the last moment and just pip him at the line for the victory. Farrar, however, retained the race leadership for another day.|$|E

[...] Reflections of a Radical Moderate was published by Westview Press in 1996. Reflections expresses his outlook:I am a moderate – a radical moderate. I believe profoundly in the ultimate value of human dignity and equality. I therefore believe as well in such essential contributions to these ends as fairness, tolerance, and mutual respect.

2500|$|The Allegory of the Cave (often said by {{scholars}} to represent Plato's own epistemology and metaphysics) is intimately connected to his political ideology (often said to also be Plato's own), that {{only people who}} have {{climbed out of the}} cave and cast their eyes on a vision of goodness are fit to rule. Socrates claims that the enlightened men of society must be forced from their divine contemplations and be compelled to run the city according to their lofty insights. Thus is born the idea of the [...] "philosopher-king", the wise person who accepts the power thrust upon him by the people who are wise enough to choose a good master.

He stated in the review that the game was [...] "another excellent, thrilling platformer from the insane team at Twisted Pixel." [...] He added that the game was much more challenging than the first installment, but that it was also more creative, adding new gameplay elements and spots of humor.
