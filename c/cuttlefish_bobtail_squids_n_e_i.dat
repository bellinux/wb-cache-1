5000|$|<b>Bobtail</b> <b>squid</b> (order Sepiolida) are a {{group of}} {{cephalopods}} closely related to <b>cuttlefish.</b> <b>Bobtail</b> <b>squid</b> {{tend to have a}} rounder mantle than cuttlefish and have no cuttlebone. They have eight suckered arms and two tentacles and are generally quite small (typical male mantle length being between 1 and 8 cm).|$|R

5000|$|William Adam (27 September 1909, The Hague [...] - [...] 3 November 1988, Brussels) was a Dutch / Belgian malacologist who {{specialised}} in cephalopods. Adam {{described a}} number of <b>cuttlefish</b> and <b>bobtail</b> <b>squid</b> species, including Euprymna hoylei, Sepia cottoni, Sepia dollfusi, Sepia dubia, Sepia reesi, Sepia sewelli, Sepia thurstoni, Sepia vercoi, and Sepiola knudseni.|$|R
50|$|Reid is a {{graduate}} of Macquarie University, where she obtained a science degree in 1984, completed a Masters in 1990 and went on to complete a PhD in 1996. She has a particular interest in cephalopods, including <b>cuttlefish</b> and <b>bobtail</b> <b>squids.</b> In 2000, she co-authored the book A Guide to Squid, Cuttlefish and Octopuses of Australasia with Mark Norman. Reid has also previously studied velvet worms. Her work has been published in a number of scientific journals, including Invertebrate Taxonomy, Bulletin of Marine Science, Australian Natural History, Zootaxa and others. Species described by Reid include Sepia tanybracheia, Sepia koilados (2000) and Ken's cuttlefish (Sepia grahami) (2001). Reid is member of the Society of Editors (NSW) and Sustainable Population Australia.|$|R
40|$|First {{observations}} on reproduction of Neorossia caroli {{from the southern}} Sardinian sea are reported, based on the analyses of an egg clutch and specimens collected by bottom trawl on sandy and muddy grounds. The egg clutch, consisting of 13 white eggs of 9 mm length with embryos at an advanced developmental stage, was found at 1200 m depth, attached {{to a piece of}} hard substrate. Adult specimens were collected in a depth range between 400 and 1600 metres. DNA sequences indicated that embryos, spermatangia and adults belonged to the same species, the carol <b>bobtail</b> <b>squid,</b> <b>N.</b> caroli. Fecundity analysis made on 40 females showed a variable number of eggs (20 - 611) in the ovaries, with the combined presence of advanced and developing oocytes, and few smooth eggs ready to be spawned in the oviducts of mature females. Several sperm reservoirs (spermatangia) were embedded in the mantle of some of the females, in the anterior ventral area overlying the oviduct...|$|R

50|$|Like other <b>bobtail</b> <b>squid,</b> {{southern}} dumpling squid have a light organ fuelled by symbiotic bioluminescent bacteria.

There are large semi-circular fins on the rear half of the mantle. Although they can change colour, they are usually an iridescent green or yellow with brown spots. The <b>bobtail</b> <b>squid</b> have four rows of suckers on each arm and both their arms and tentacles are armed with toothed horny rim.|$|R
