50|$|These {{calcareous}} meadows {{are traditionally}} cut for hay. They have diverse flora, with many green-winged orchids {{and one of}} the largest populations in the county of meadow saffron. Other species include ox-eye daisy and <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Cranebank has water meadows {{which have}} a number of locally rare species, such as <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower</b> and ragged robin. It also has ox-bow lakes, and there are 26 species of {{butterflies}} and 12 of damselflies and dragonflies.|$|E
5000|$|Over half {{this site}} is managed as farmland, {{and the rest}} is ancient oak {{woodland}} also has coppiced sweet chestnut and hornbeam, with an understorey of ash, elder and hazel. Invertebrates include damselflies, dragonflies, glow-worms and wood ants. Common blooms found on the reserve in the summer include Bluebells, Bugles, <b>Cuckoo</b> <b>Flowers,</b> Wood Anemones, Primroses, Dog Violets, and Wood Sorrels.|$|R
5000|$|The larvae {{are well}} known for the self-generated foam nests, that can be {{observed}} in Spring in meadows (especially on <b>Cuckoo</b> <b>Flowers,</b> Cardamine pratensis and broom, Genista species). Their larvae in the foam nests are largely protected from predators and also get the necessary moisture for the development and temperature, so their mortality remains low even in bad weather. The larval stage lasts about 50 days. The adults leave the foam nest only when it is completely dried. This takes about ten days. The females mate soon after.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{wonderful}} Whitsun-day morning {{that none of the}} little party could ever forget. The sunrise could not be seen in that deep, narrow place, but the sky was of a strange pale shining blue, and the tender young green of the trees overhead was touched with gold, the glades of the wood were intensely blue with hyacinths, and with all sorts of delicate greens twined above in the bushes over them. A wild cherry, all silver white, was behind their Altar, the green floor was marbled with <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flowers</b> and buttercups, and the clear little stream whose voice murmured by was fringed with kingcups and forget-me-nots. The scents were of the most delicious dewy freshness; and as to the sounds! Larks sang high up in the sky, wood pigeons cooed around, nightingales, thrushes, every bird of the wood seemed to be trying to make music and melody.|$|R

50|$|This {{is mainly}} fen with diverse flora, {{and there are}} also areas of damp {{grassland}}, ditches and dykes. The grassland is grazed by cattle, and it has flowering plants including marsh pennywort and <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower.</b> The site has a nationally rare plant, marsh pea.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower</b> (Cardamine pratensis), a {{herbaceous}} perennial, can {{be found}} throughout Wales. Bog rosemary (Andromeda polifolia), a small flowering shrub, {{can be found}} in central Wales. Within the British Isles, the Snowdon lily (Gagea serotina) is found only on the slopes of Snowdon.|$|E
60|$|It was broad {{daylight}} now, a lovely May morning, such as generally called forth the maidens, small and great, to the meadows to rub their fresh cheeks with the silvery dew, {{and to bring}} home kingcups, <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flowers,</b> blue bottles, and cowslips for the Maypoles that were to be decked. But all was silent now, not a house was open, the rising sun made the eastern windows of the churches a blaze of light, and from the west door of St. Paul's the city beneath seemed sleeping, only a wreath or two of smoke rising. Ambrose found the porter looking out for his master in much perturbation. He groaned {{as he looked at}} the tablets, and heard where the Dean was, and said that came of being a saint on earth. It would be the death of him ere long! What would old Mistress Colet, his mother, say? He would have detained the youth with his inquiries, but Ambrose said he had to speed down to the Temple on an errand from the Dean, and hurried away. All Ludgate Hill was now quiet, every house closed, but here and there lay torn shreds of garments, or household vessels.|$|R
40|$|A {{realistic}} and accurate product cost estimation is of high importance during the design phases {{of products and}} assembly lines. This paper presents a methodology that aims at supporting decision makers during the design phases of assembly lines by taking into consideration product designs, processes and resources alternatives. First, we introduce a new variant of the Assembly Line Balancing and Equipment Selection Problem, in which Product Design Alternatives are considered. Since the ability to estimate product costs provides grounds for making better decisions, a new detailed cost model whose aim is to translate the complex and interrelated consequences of product design and manufacturing technologies and processes choice into one single cost metric is proposed. In order {{to solve the problem}} under study, 34 Multi-Objective Algorithms were developed. The list of developed algorithms includes variants of Evolutionary Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimisation, Artificial Bee Colony, <b>Cuckoo</b> Search Optimisation, <b>Flower</b> Pollination Algorithm, Bat Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimisation. The performances of all these algorithms are compared based on fifty well-known problem instances in accordance with four multi-objective quality indicators. Finally, the algorithms are ranked using a nonparametric statistical test...|$|R
50|$|Chance was {{a member}} of the British Ornithologists' Union - from which his egg {{collecting}} eventually resulted in his expulsion - and served on the Council of the British Oological Association. He named his daughter Cardamine, alluding to the scientific name of the <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower</b> Cardamine pratensis.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} {{of water and}} unimproved grassland and patches of semi-natural woodland, particularly around Greenfields Nature Reserve, has created a habitat that includes <b>Cuckoo</b> <b>flower</b> and water voles, {{as well as many}} butterfly species. The area around Staggs Brook is now managed to maintain it as a suitable habitat for the water voles, which are a protected species in the UK.|$|E
50|$|A {{colourful}} {{variety of}} flowers {{may be seen}} throughout spring and summer. These include <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower,</b> marsh-marigold, great burnet, meadowsweet, common knapweed, meadow vetchling, marsh ragwort, meadow buttercup, sorrel, ragged-robin, reed canary-grass, sweet vernal-grass and meadow brome. The wet conditions encourage many sedges including brown sedge, oval sedge, yellow sedge and carnation sedge. The slender spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis) grows in this meadow which is rare in Gloucestershire.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{positioned}} {{to the north}} of the River Cary at an altitude of 30 m on flat and gently sloping ground. The plant community contains a very high proportion of herbaceous species. Areas immediately adjacent to the river bank are frequently waterlogged and contain numerous tussocks of Soft rush (Juncus effusus). Associated plants include Meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), <b>Cuckoo</b> <b>flower</b> (Cardamine pratensis) and Common fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica).|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{the area}} may not {{represent}} the best that Suffolk has to offer, {{it is part of}} the history and heritage of Lawshall and one of the richest remaining grasslands in the parish. In addition to the sight of buttercups on the green, there is quite a variety of broad leaved plants. These include blue bugle, pink <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower,</b> edible common sorrel, cowslip, the strange adder's tongue and the occasional orchid.|$|E
50|$|Within the reserve, 417 {{species of}} {{vascular}} plants, {{many of which}} are rare, have been identified. This includes the regionally rare <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower</b> and the sand violet, as well as the nationally endangered butternut, population of which has dwindled due to the butternut canker disease. Fauna includes the locally rare northern long-eared bat, the nationally vulnerable Louisiana waterthrush and the northern brook lamprey, as well as the nationally threatened Jefferson salamander.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is {{traditionally}} managed by a late summer hay cut, which allows wildflowers {{to set their}} seeds. There is then cattle grazing. The willow pollards are recut regularly {{to reduce the risk}} of splitting. There are earlier cuts every 3 years to help to increase the frequency of rarer species found in the field which include common knapweed, yellow rattle, <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower,</b> bird's foot trefoil and marsh bedstraw. This helps remove nutrients at the peak of the hay growing season.|$|E
50|$|The site {{contains}} curragh (wetlands - willow scrub), broadleaved trees, dub (pond), neutral grassland and embankments of tall grassland. This {{variety of}} habitats {{leads to a}} diversity of wildlife and plant life. Some of the plants/trees that grow there are silver birch, ash, holly, rowan, marsh marigold, yellow flag, reed canary grass, hemlock water-dropwort, woody nightshade and <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower.</b> Among {{the wide variety of}} birds on the site are the grey wagtail, goldcrest, woodcock, chiffchaff and hen harrier. There are also invertebrates, bats, and many frogs and spawn in early summer.|$|E
50|$|Bavington Crags is {{situated}} within {{an area of}} acid grassland characterised by an abundance of crested dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and mat-grass (Nardus stricta). The dip-slope areas of the site provide a habitat for, unusual to Northumberland, chives (Allium schoenoprasum), hairy stonecrop (Sedum villosum) bristle club-rush (Isolepis setacea), changing forget-me-not (Myosotis discolor), field madder (Sherardia arvensis), and early hair-grass (Aira praecox). Maiden pink (Dianthus deltoides) is found in dry soil on ledges. Wetter areas exhibit mat-grass, carnation sedge (Carex panicea), spring sedge (C. caryophyllea), <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower</b> (Cardamine pratensis), red fescue (Festuca rubra), wild thyme (Thymus praecox), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) and lady’s bedstraw (Galium verum).|$|E
50|$|There are eleven meadows {{which are}} on {{alluvium}} and Lower Lias clays near {{the confluence of}} the Rivers Eye and Dikler. The citation states they are one of the richest and largest traditional meadow systems remaining in the Cotswolds. The meadows are divided by well developed ancient hedges and there are occasional hedgerow trees. The meadows which make up the SSSI support a wide range of species. These include southern marsh orchid and early marsh orchid. They support great burnet, <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower,</b> quaking grass, ragged robin, pepper saxifrage and meadow rue. Wetland species grow alongside the River Eye. These include yellow iris, marsh marigold and meadowsweet.|$|E
50|$|The Callows are a {{classified}} as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The Irish Wildlife Trust has a reserve on Bullock Island. Protection of the Callows is particularly important due to the many species of birds occurring on the Callows. Recorded are, amongst others, black-tailed godwit, corncrake, curlew, golden plover, lapwing, mute swan, redshank, sandpiper, whooper swan and wigeon. Mammals recorded include American mink, fox and otter. Grazing of cattle keeps alder and willow from spreading. Sections of Callow at higher elevation and therefore less prone to flooding have a greater diversity of plants, in particular clover, creeping buttercup, <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower,</b> marsh bedstraw, marsh marigold, meadow grass, meadowsweet, sedge and water mint.|$|E
50|$|A {{profusion of}} daffodils {{in early spring}} is welcomed by the residents. Marsh {{marigold}} by the river, wood sorrel and wood avens on the river bank. The caraway flower comes in summer in damp pasture near the river. The caraway is the county flower of Carmarthenshire and is similar in appearance to the lady's smock, or <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower.</b> There are purple orchids near some silver leaf limes {{at the top of}} the village. The dominant trees are beech and ash and some sycamore and oaks to a lesser degree. Yellow pimpernel can be seen for short periods in shady banks under ash trees. Red campion, stitchwort and bluebell contribute a magnificent red, white and blue to the hedgerows in spring. Dog violet and birds foot trefoil grow for shorter periods.|$|E
50|$|The Onchan {{wetlands}} (Curragh Kiondroghad) is a 1 acre {{nature reserve}} in Onchan village {{that contains a}} variety of habitats. The site was donated to the Manx Wildlife Trust in 1988 and {{is open to the}} public for viewing and has a footpath which is suitable for wheelchair users. The site contains curragh (wetlands - willow scrub), broadleaved trees, dub (pond), neutral grassland and embankments of tall grassland. This variety of habitats leads to a diversity of wildlife and plant life. Some of the plants and trees that grow in the wetlands are silver birch, ash, holly, rowan, marsh marigold, yellow flag, reed canary grass, hemlock water-dropwort, woody nightshade and <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower.</b> Birds recorded on the site are the grey wagtail, goldcrest, woodcock, chiffchaff and hen harrier along with invertebrates and bats. There are also many frogs and spawn in early summer.|$|E
50|$|Watercress Fields has formal {{football}} {{pitches and}} a play area {{as well as}} areas for informal recreation. It is an important site linking areas {{in the south of}} Ashford to the town centre {{and other parts of the}} Green Corridor. The river has a natural profile with many meanders, and wide margins of vegetation that support riverside species such as <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower</b> and alder (some of the alders have succumbed to a disease - however dead wood is a good habitat for invertebrates). The river itself supports Water Voles, having sufficient food resources and bankside cover. The rest of the park has an open character that is interspersed with woodland gardens and areas of long grass that are important habitats for bird species and invertebrates. In the past it is thought that watercress may have been grown on the site. Further along the river at Leacon Road there are some riverside sculptures of aquatic wildlife and an old fording point that once linked this area with Beaver Lane.|$|E
5000|$|Declared a Local Nature Reserve in 2006 by Sandy Town Council and {{designated}} an 'Urban Fringe' site, The Riddy is {{a species}} rich habitat, being {{described by the}} Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire as [...] "an oasis of wild flowers, bird song and a wonderful view among a sea of arable fields". In the meadows many different grasses and other plants grow, such as <b>cuckoo</b> <b>flower</b> (Cardamine pratensis). The pond, stream and ditches support aquatic plants, such as arrowhead (Sagittaria sagittifolia), celery-leaved buttercup (Ranunculus sceleratus), purple-loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), water-plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica) and duckweed. Chub (Squalius cephalus) and carp can both {{be found in the}} 500 yards m stream, along with the nationally protected water vole (Arvicola amphibius). Numerous birds frequent The Riddy, some which feed in the meadows including redwing (Turdus iliacus), fieldfare (Turdus pilaris) and northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), whilst sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) have been observed [...] "patrolling" [...] the mature hedgerows. Grey herons (Ardea cinerea) and common terns (Sterna hirundo) hunt fish, and in the autumn, song thrushes (Turdus philomelos) can be seen at the reserve. Grey wagtail (Motacilla cinerea) and kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) have also been recorded on the reserve.|$|E
