5000|$|Rowles uses {{mixed media}} to {{investigate}} the material substance {{and structure of the}} human body. Her major series of work include Re-constructions (2014- [...] ); Contortions (2004-13); Hyperplasia (1989-98); and Vests (1982-). Prior to 2000, Rowles’s work dealt with the social and emotional associations of clothing. For Vests, she created soft, suspended sculptures from a variety of materials, such as vinyl, rubber, plastic toys, zippers, and chenille wire, which playfully critique gender norms. With the Contortion series, Rowles turned to the structure of the body itself, crocheting forms suggestive of osteoporotic bones and digestive tracks. Specifically invoking the aging body, the sculptures were inspired by the artist’s experience of caring for her elderly mother. For Re-Constructions, Rowles created suspended sculptures out of molded layers of sheer fabric, to which she added wire mesh, <b>crepe</b> hair, <b>rubber,</b> bone, and silkscreened imagery. The visceral, skin-like quality of this work is reminiscent of Louise Bourgeois’s sculptures of the 1960s.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effect of temperature and time depolymerization of natural latex rubber using NaNO 2, H 2 O 2 and Ascorbic Acid (0. 4 : 0. 2 : 0. 1) mol at pH about 5 towards its molecular weight reduction, then studied the effect on the quality of adhesives produced. The stages of this research include making concentrated natural rubber latex, its depolymerization, <b>rubber</b> <b>crepe</b> making, <b>rubber</b> compounding and followed by rubber adhesives manufacturing. Depolymerization is conducted by varying the temperature (50, 70 and 90 oC) with the duration (4, 6, 8, and 10 hours). The indication of molecular weight reduction is determined by the mooney viscosity test, while the quality of the rubber adhesives is evaluated from the Brookfield viscosity test and its peel strength. Concentrated Natural Rubber was successfully prepared using 2 % (v / v) ammonium laurate 20 % and 0. 2 % (v / v) 2 % sodium alginate resulted in dry rubber content 49. 36 %, mechanical stability 91 seconds, ammonia 0. 58 % and Viscosity Mooney 193. 80 cp. Chemical depolymerization is able to reduce the viscosity mooney of natural rubber approximately 95 %. The results showed that the greatest molecular weight reduction was depolymerization at 70 ° C for 8 hours indicated by decreasing the mooney viscosity from 193. 80 to 10. 05 cp. From the results of testing the quality of the adhesives, the lower the molecular weight the adhesive power between layers of rubber is higher with lower Viscosity Brookfield. The peel strength of resulted adhesive ranges from 4. 76 - 17. 25 kg / inch 2 with brookfield viscosity between 1966 - 3810 cp.

30|$|Para {{rubber tree}} (Hevea brasiliensis) {{is a major}} {{economically}} important bio-resource because its sap-like extract (known as latex) can be collected and is {{the primary source of}} natural rubber. The white or yellow latex occurs in latex vessels in the bark, mostly outside the phloem. According to world food and agriculture organization (FAO) statistics, in 2010, Thailand produced the highest quantity (3, 051, 780 metric tons) of natural rubber in the world followed by Indonesia (2, 788, 300 metric tons) and Malaysia (858, 900 metric tons) [1]. International Rubber Study Group (IRSG) estimated the production of Para rubber of the world in 2011 to be 10.7 million tons which is more than that of the year 2010 (10.2 million tons) [2]. Main Para rubber products include field latex, concentrated latex, <b>rubber</b> sheet, <b>crepe,</b> and block <b>rubber.</b> Incisions are made orthogonally to the latex vessels, just deep enough to tap the vessels without harming the tree’s growth, and the sap is collected in small buckets. It is known that harvesting can be started once the trees are 5 – 6  years old. The field latex is the primary raw material for other processes. Total solid content (TSC) and dry rubber content (DRC) of field latex are the most important parameters in trading. However, the conventional wet-lab measurement procedures in terms of these parameters are time consuming and require technical experts. Therefore, it is preferable to introduce convenient evaluation technique at in-line process for rubber products or on-site work of Para rubber tree plantation.|$|R

40|$|Footwear sole wear {{by natural}} use or {{artificial}} abrasion either increases or decreases slip resistance on floors {{with and without}} lubricant. The objectives of this paper were to study the effect of footwear sole abrasive wear on slip resistance on ice with respect to temperature, and to compare the slip resistance of abraded soles on melting and hard ice with that on lubricated steel plate. The kinetic coefficient of friction (COF) of nine pairs of footwear were measured with the stationary step simulator developed at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, {{before and after the}} new footwear soles were artificially abraded. Two-way factorial ANOVA showed that the abrasion of nine pairs of footwear had no significant effect on COF on melting ice (Mean COF with abrasion= 0. 056, std= 0. 0158, COF without abrasion= 0. 055, std= 0. 0205, P= 0. 805). On hard ice, however, the COF of abraded soles measured (mean COF= 0. 244) was significantly higher than without abrasion (mean COF= 0. 180, p< 0. 001), and than abraded soles on lubricated steel (mean= 0. 137, p< 0. 001). There is statistical significance between the three types of surfaces (p< 0. 001). On hard ice, regardless of abrasion, curling footwear with <b>crepe</b> <b>rubber</b> soling showed significantly higher COF (mean= 0. 343 after abrasion, 0. 261 before abrasion) than other types (p< 0. 001).

The abrasion requirement could be specified if developing a new standard to measure COF on ice in the future. Of the footwear measured, the curling footwear with <b>crepe</b> <b>rubber</b> soling performed best in terms of slip resistance property. Therefore, <b>Crepe</b> <b>rubber</b> soling is highly recommended for use on hard ice. Melting ice is much more slippery, in which sole abrasion does not improve slip resistance.

40|$|In Sri Lanka most {{commonly}} used treatment methods for <b>crepe</b> <b>rubber</b> factories are pond/lagoon system and activated sludge system. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify the most cost effective and commercially viable treatment system to treat the effluent generated from <b>crepe</b> <b>rubber</b> factories. Mechanically aerated lagoon/pond system at Eheliyagoda Rubber Factory and activated sludge system at Parakaduwa Rubber Factory have been selected for this study. The average flow rates during the study period for the ETP at Eheliyagoda Factory is 30 m 3 /d and it is 60 m 3 /d for the ETP at Parakaduwa Factory. Also it is observed that the Eheliyagoda Factory uses 19 % more water and the Parakaduwa Factory uses 43 % more water than the water quantity stated in the Guidelines for Natural Rubber Industry. Considerable variations of influent BOD 5 & COD to the treatment plants have been observed due to the changes in weather pattern and latex tapping activities are generally affected by the weather. pH of the wastewater generated in both factories is always less than 6. 0 and the BOD 5 & COD removal efficiencies of the anaerobic treatment unit in both plants are less than 30 %. The average BOD 5 & COD of the treated wastewater obtained from the ETP at Eheliyagoda Factory is 53 mg/l and 229 mg/l respectively. Also the 60 % of BOD 5 readings and 90 % of COD readings of the treated wastewater obtained from the ETP at Eheliyagoda Factory meet CEA standards. The average BOD 5 & COD of the treated wastewater obtained from the ETP at Parakaduwa Factory is 77 mg/l and 340 mg/l respectively. The 22 % of BOD 5 readings and 78 % of COD readings of the treated wastewater obtained from the ETP at Parakaduwa Factory meet CEA standards. The average TSS values of the treated wastewater obtained from the treatment plants at Eheliyagoda & Parakaduwa Factories are 315 mg/l & 171 mg/l. Total BOD 5, COD & TSS removal efficiencies of the ETP at Eheliyagoda Factory are 93. 5 %, 94. 5 % & 67. 5 % respectively. Such removal efficiencies for the ETP at Parakaduwa Factory are 90. 5 %, 91. 3 % and 68. 3 % respectively. When considering the removal efficiencies of the aerobic facultative unit of each treatment system, they are higher in the MAL than the Activated sludge tank. The initial capital cost of the activated sludge process at Parakaduwa Factory is lower than the mechanical aerated lagoon system at Eheliyagoda Factory. But when comparing the cost for operation & maintenance of the treatment systems, it is lower in the treatment plant at Eheliyagoda Factory and it is 54. 5 % of the cost for the treatment system at Parakaduwa Factory. For the period of 10 years of the operation of the treatment plants, the unit cost for wastewater treatment in terms of Rs/kg at Parakaduwa Factory and Eheliyagoda Factory are Rs 1. 59 and Rs 1. 53 respectively. Also the one kilogram of BOD load, treatment costs for Parakaduwa Factory and Eheliyagoda Factoty are Rs 46. 14 and Rs 47. 11 respectively. Since the low operational & maintenance cost and high treatment efficiency of MAL system, it can be concluded that the mechanical aerated lagoon system is more cost effective wastewater treatment process for natural rubber industry where the land is available. Gravity flow to each treatment unit where ever possible and daily pH correction of the raw wastewater should obtained to achieve cost effective performance in both systems. It is also recommended to maintain a correct DO &. MLSS in the aeration tank at Parakaduwa Factory and to install a sand bed as a last unit for the plant at Eheliyagoda Factor...|$|E

The effects {{of the structure of the}} rubber producing industry (-natural and synthetic), economics of production, characteristics of demand and some aspects of marketing on the short and long term competitive position are analysed. It is concluded that natural rubber can remain competitive in all aspects if, greater co-operation between the natural rubber producers can be achieved to formulate a unified programme of production, research and development and marketing. In view of certain problems peculiar to Sri Lanka, the second part analyses the state of the rubber industry in Sri Lanka in respect of the changes taking place in other natural rubber producing countries, the developments in the synthetic rubber industry and the changing technological requirements of the rubber consuming industries. The commercial, economic and technical viability of certain projects in Sri Lanka and the areas for future research at the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka are briefly explored. Since Sri Lanka is the largest producer of premium grade pale <b>crepe</b> <b>rubber</b> and in view of the declining demand for this rubber, the competitive position of pale crepe is studied in some detail and some recommendations are included to improve its competitive position. In view of the anticipated strong demand for natural rubber in the future, it is recommended that Sri Lanka should plan now to increase rubber production at a faster rate by 1980 ’s. It is also concluded that it is desirable to produce more special purpose premium grades of natural rubber in Sri Lanka than to produce more complex derivatives in the short term and a long term approach towards producing powdered rubber, liquid and thermoplastic rubber from latex is necessary...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{global climate}} has been {{changing}} with the elevated CO 2 in the atmosphere; hence identification of effective measures to mitigate or combat {{the adverse effects}} of climate change is at uttermost importance. The goal of Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) for planting 40, 000 ha of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) in the Uva province may partly address this issue sequestering the key greenhouse gas (GHG), CO 2. Farmers in the area usually practice intercropping sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) under immature rubber plants for extra income during the initial period of rubber cultivation. In the process of valuing rubber cultivation in mitigating the climate change effect, information on net greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from rubber/sugarcane intercropping system is required. Being scanty of such knowledge, this study was aimed to estimate the carbon footprint in the cultivation of rubber/sugarcane intercropping system in Sri Lanka. GHG emissions from the cultivation of rubber and sugarcane were calculated using the information available in the smallholdings having rubber/sugarcane intercropping in Monaragala district (IL 2). GHG emission resulting from raw rubber processing, i. e. Ribbed Smoked Sheets (RSS) and <b>Crepe</b> <b>Rubber</b> (CR), was assessed using the data available in Kumarawatta Estate, Monaragala and Dartonfield Estate, Agalawatta, respectively. Also, GHG emission resulting from processing refined sugar was gathered from Palwatta Sugar Industries (Ltd), Monaragala. Carbon sequestration capacities of both crops were adopted from previous studies. Guidelines of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were used in the estimation of carbon footprint. GHG emission in the process of cultivating rubber for its lifespan (30 years) was 65. 15 CO 2 -eq ton/ha. When sugarcane was cultivated in rubber lands for four year period as a rubber/sugarcane intercropping system, GHG emission increased only by 9. 72 CO 2 -eq ton/ha. Processing of RSS throughout the lifespan was responsible for additional 93. 49 CO 2 -eq ton/ha emission whilst that for processing CR was limited to 50. 14 CO 2 -eq ton/ha. Processing of refined sugar during four year intercropping period was accountable only for 0. 62 CO 2 -eq ton/ha emission. In conclusion, carbon footprint (Net GHG emission) of cultivating rubber/sugarcane intercrop to produce CR and refined sugar was - 1537. 02 CO 2 -eq ton/ha/ 30 yr whilst that for RSS and refined sugar was - 1493. 73 CO 2 -eq ton/ha/ 30 yr. Increase in carbon footprint by intercropping sugarcane was only ca. 0. 5 % over mono cropping rubber. Potential application of this information in developing carbon trading projects is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Slip {{and fall}} {{accidents}} and associated injuries on {{ice and snow}} are prevalent among outdoor workers {{and the general public}} in winter in many regions of the world. To understand and tackle this multi-factorial problem, a multidisciplinary approach was used to identify and evaluate slip and fall risks, and to propose recommendations for prevention of slips and falls on icy and snowy surfaces. Objectives were to present a systems perspective of slip and fall accidents and related risk factors; to evaluate the integration of slip resistance, thermal insulation, and usability of footwear by subjective trials. Further, to study the interaction mechanisms between footwear soling material and ice; to investigate and describe the relationship of ice and snow living experience and participation in winter sports with slips and falls; and to explain the role and mechanisms of lower extremity muscles in maintaining gait dynamic balance on inclined icy surface. The following methods were applied: 1) a systematic analysis of multiple risk factors through literature review; 2) direct observation; 3) videotaping; 4) subjective evaluations of slipperiness, thermal comfort and usability using rating scales; 5) a tribological study of the Coefficient of Friction (COF); 6) a questionnaire survey to identify and evaluate risk factors related to slips and falls; 7) a biomechanical study of human locomotion on ice. A systematic analysis of slips and falls on icy and snowy surfaces made it possible to use a multi-faceted approach to evaluation and prevention. The slip resistance, thermal insulation and usability of footwear tested were not suitably integrated, indicating the need of improving anti-slip properties and usability of footwear for use in cold environments. The artificially abrasive wear of soling materials improved slip resistance on hard ice, but not on melting ice. When comparing hard ice, melting ice and lubricated steel surfaces, the highest slip resistance was observed on hard ice, then on lubricated steel plate. Melting ice was most slippery. Curling footwear with <b>crepe</b> <b>rubber</b> soling showed significantly higher COF than other types. The footwear tested included winter footwear, professional footwear, safety footwear, and footwear considered to be slip resistant by manufacturers did not provide adequate protection against slips and falls on melting ice. Thus, additional measures should be taken to reduce slip and fall risk on melting ice. Slip and fall events declined with increased living experience in cold environments and winter sports participation. Biomechanical studies showed both increased and decreased magnitudes of gait muscle activities (EMG) at different gait phases and a generating of cautious gait strategies with an anticipated icy surface. These findings provided insights into how the proactive kinetic and kinematic adjustments of gait are achieved and the control mechanisms of stabilizing gait and posture through certain muscle activities when ascending on an icy slope. The mechanisms identified may be applied to develop intervention, rehabilitation and training techniques, which prevent slip and fall risks and associated injuries on icy surfaces and to improve performance in human locomotion, e. g., for winter sports. Measurement methods of slipperiness on ice and snow, related standards, task-related factors, slip resistant footwear, and intervention programs should be further studied and developed.

40|$|Raw rubber {{processing}} factories generate {{large amounts of}} wastewater containing organic pollutants & various process chemicals. Factory effluents exhibit high BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) & COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) concentrations, ammonia & suspended solids that are amenable to biological treatment methods. Rubber Research Institute (RRI) of Sri Lanka developed a novel & cost effective biological effluent treatment technique for rubber-processing effluents discharged by <b>crepe</b> <b>rubber</b> & centrifuged latex factories. Treatment system, based on high rate anaerobic digestion coupled with aerobic stabilization also consists of settling & sand filtration. The main feature of this technique {{is the use of}} a low cost, septic tank type anaerobic digester filled up with coir fibres for the attachment of useful microorganisms for effective biological conversion. Biological kinetic expressions have been derived for the design & control of effluent treatment plants where aerobic digestion is used commonly as the only treatment method. The kinetic coefficients in these expressions are widely used in design calculations. For a specified waste, a given biological community & a particular set of operating conditions the kinetic coefficients are fixed, Kinetic coefficients used for the design of domestic effluent treatment plants cannot be applied for the design of industrial effluent treatment plants as the waste composition & biological communities involved are different. Also kinetic coefficients for the anaerobically pretreated wastewater could be very different to those of the raw wastewater even for the same type of waste. No kinetic study has been carried out yet for the RRI developed treatment process for making possible improvements & modifications for optimal operation & performance of the aerobic treatment system to reduce, capital, operational & maintenance costs under low loading conditions. The objective {{of this study is to}} find out the kinetic coefficients required for the design of activated sludge process from anaerobically pretreated rubber industry wastewater. The obtained values of kinetic coefficients were used to model an existing treatment system. A pilot-scale continuously aerated stirred tank was used as a model reactor. Reactor was operated without a recycle stream & fed with a steady flow of anaerobically pretreated wastewater obtained from a full-scale rubber industry effluent treatment plant. Samples were taken for five different runs at five different mean-cell residence times (). BOD & MLVSS (Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids) of each sample for each run were measured according to Standard Methods for the Examination of Water & Wastewater. The following kinetic coefficients were estimated by a graphical method using measured data & the standard kinetic expressions. • Y = cell yield coefficient • kd= cell decay coefficient • Ks = half-velocity constant • k = maximum substrate concentration per unit mass of microorganisms • μm = maximum specific growth rate). The obtained kinetic. coefficients show significant differences to those of domestic wastewater reported in literature. Maximum substrate concentration per unit mass of microorganisms (k) is less than one-half of the corresponding value for domestic wastewater. This implies more than double the concentration of microorganisms is required to be maintained in the aeration tank than that for domestic wastewater. Half-velocity constant (Ks) is more than double the concentration of the corresponding value for domestic wastewater. It implies that the microorganisms have high affinity to anaerobically digested substrate. This could be expected because most anaerobically digested intermediate products & end products are considered good substrates for heterotrophic organisms. The cell yield coefficient (Y) is comparatively higher & the cell decay coefficient (kd) relatively lower than those for domestic wastewater leading to a higher μm. maximum specific growth rate. Therefore a richer microorganism concentration could be expected in the aeration tank. Obtained kinetic coefficients were used to model an existing activated sludge treatment system. The minimum mean-cell residence time calculated with the obtained kinetic coefficients lead to a value of O. 9 (d) with a safety factor of 3. 33 & is within the accepted range for plant operation (2 - 20). Sludge washouts are very unlikely due to the fulfillment of the condition > 1 / μm indicating a good waste stabilization. Calculations revealed significant difference between the predicted & operated condition of the plant. The obtained kinetic coefficients were used to optimize the plant operation by estimating sludge recirculation rate, aeration rate & sludge production rate. The findings will help improve the treatment system design & reduce the associated costs...|$|E
