Factors such as product characteristics, product pricing, and compatibility protection strategies must interact properly for green innovation to be sustainable. <br /...|$|R

30|$|This {{means that}} {{learning}} will always proceed as learners {{as well as}} their teachers, peers, and parents continuously assess what has already been learned, what can be learned, and what will have to wait to be learned. Therefore, in a learner-centered classroom, assessment is a constant process. The teacher <b>makes</b> <b>every</b> <b>attempt</b> to move beyond summative assessment, which only focuses on learners’ achievement after experiencing some instruction. The focus is shifted to the process of learning whereby assessment occurs continuously and formatively while the learner is still learning (Stiggins 2002). Thus, assessment is there for learning as the students {{are in the process of}} learning. Admittedly assessment of learning will always remain an essential component of learning as it can show whether the learning objectives have been achieved. However, it should not be the only form of assessment that is practiced.|$|R

Second, I argue that we should stop thinking of responses to climate change in terms of the precautionary principle, which counsels action {{even in the absence of}} scientific consensus about a threat.
