Despite his militant tactics, Wilson was a relative moderate whose goal was to establish friendly relations with shipowners and formal <b>conciliation</b> <b>procedures</b> in the shipping industry to enable disputes to be resolved without recourse to strikes or lockouts. This goal was steadily achieved after shipowners recognised the union in 1911 and began working closely with officials during the First World War.

40|$|Prior to {{bringing}} suit {{on behalf of}} an employee, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission must follow specific procedural requirements and must engage in conciliation. The purpose of conciliation is for opposing parties to avoid the court system by encouraging out-of-court settlements. Employers {{in the majority of}} circuits can argue failure to conciliate as an affirmative defense when employers feel the Commission has failed its duty to conciliate. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently held that conciliation efforts are not judicially reviewable and as such cannot be raised as an affirmative defense. This Comment will explain why a minimal review of conciliation efforts is necessary, and Congress should amend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) to provide courts the power to sanction the Commission or an employer that does not engage in good faith in conciliation. A minimal review of conciliation efforts is the proper standard because it provides the Commission with deference to determine the appropriate conciliation agreement in the circumstances, but also provides an incentive for the parties to conciliate properly the first time. Furthermore, Congress should amend 42 U. S. C. § 2000 e- 5 (f) to provide that a party who has engaged in bad faith conciliation may have to pay the other party’s attorney’s fees or negotiation costs. A minimal review of <b>conciliation</b> <b>procedures</b> and a statutory amendment are the best way to ensure the statutory requirements are meaningfully followed...|$|R

The Job Separations Survey was a small ad hoc survey {{carried out by the}} Office of National Statistics on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry during 2001 - 2002. The main objectives of the survey were to provide a statistically representative picture of employees experience of dismissal and redundancy and the use of grievance procedures. The number of applications to Employment Tribunals saw a steady rise until the end of 2001. In the first half of 2002, applications fell, but the number still exceeded 100, 000. However, information on the nature of dismissals and other involuntary job changes is limited, and there was a need to discover how readily employees resort to <b>conciliation</b> <b>procedures</b> and tribunals, and whether potential tribunal cases are dealt with by internal grievance procedures or other means. Another reason for the survey was a desire to explore the reasons behind discrepancies between employer and employee data in this area. The survey was based on Wave 5 Labour Force Survey (LFS) respondents who had been interviewed between December 2000 and November 2001. Main Topics : Topics covered included respondents experiences with dismissal and termination of employment; whether they had received advice or trade union help; whether the case had been referred to Employment Tribunal; whether they had received or felt they were entitled to any money or pension payments; employment history before and after the termination of the job in question; and demographic details such as age, gender, social class, occupational status, ethnic group and household composition.

30|$|The {{revision}} is extensive, {{with the}} aim of promoting conciliation and discouraging lawsuits, reducing their length (currently up to 6 - 7 years for the three levels of judgment), limiting the uncertainty about the costs of firing for firms, without restricting workers’ fundament rights. In order to achieve these goals, first, a preliminary <b>conciliation</b> <b>procedure</b> has been made compulsory and, second, different sanctions for illegitimate dismissals have been substituted for former unified sanctions, which typically were identified in the worker’s reinstatement. On the one hand, discriminatory dismissals (on the ground of race, gender or sexual orientation etc.) continue obviously to be prohibited and thus become null after a sentence has been delivered, so that the dismissal is regarded as if it had never occurred. On the other hand, the reinstatement of workers illegitimately dismissed for economic and disciplinary motives has been restricted to cases where the court recognizes the manifest nonexistence of the motive. In all other cases, it is replaced by a monetary compensation, ranging from 12 to 24  months of salary, depending on the employee’s length of service and other criteria.|$|E

40|$|The {{matters in}} the fight against crime through a prism of foreign {{countries}} are in the centre of attention of a domestic and foreign criminal law science and lawenforcement practice. The modern science of criminal law has a theoretically reasonable doctrine answering positions and principles about a lawful state, the complete concept of punishment; however, there is an inevitable practice of wide application punishment of custodial sanction which against a steady tendency of growth of registered criminality becomes a sharp social and legal problem. In this sense experience of mediation’s application in criminal cases in court practice of Federal Republic of Germany is interesting as comparable alternative form of conflicts solution which is enough effective. Mediation means development of an extrajudicial decision for victims, a <b>conciliation</b> <b>procedure</b> for all participants of the conflict with assistance of one or several intermediaries who are independent, neutral and external persons carrying out exchange and communications function between the parties, with the purpose of conflict settlement by participants. Mediation gives the opportunity of constructive handling with criminal cases and is a good addition to traditional court practice as it means the co-operative and constructive decision of problems existing between the direct parties and contributes to internal security provision, so a share of relapses after processes of reconciliation of the criminal and a victim is much more low than in comparable cases in traditional criminal procedures.

The main objective of the Code of Ethics is minimi- sing the negative impact of tourism on the environment and a cultural heritage while maximizing the benefits of tourism in promoting sustai- nable and responsible development, including poverty alleviation, as well as understanding among nations. The Code of Ethics is not a legally binding instrument and therefore its acceptance is voluntary. The voluntary nature of this instrument is a feature on wich the WTO places particular emphasis. The application of the Code may, nevertheless, be advanced by the incorporation of its contents and provisions into appropriate legislation, regulations and professional codes. Such provisions, based on the Code and adopted at national or industry levels, would be binding according to the terms of reference of each adopting constituency. In 2004, after five years from the adoption of the Code, World Committee on Tourism Ethics, a specialized structure (body) of the WTO, decided to carry out a survey his members to assess the degree of implementation of the Code and for the establishment the future strategy for promoting and the implementation of the Code. The results indicate that a great part of the WTO’ s members had already incorporeted the principles of the Code into their laws, regulations or tourism development plans.

Formulization of the conceptual foundations of law-enforcement politics is not possible without judicial bodies, because the court was and still is a body which embodies the judicial authority. 2. One of the factors that govern development of the judicial authority in the federal state is the need for search of the optimum ratio of federal center and the subjects of the Federation powers in the field of judicial authority. 3. Revival of the magistrate’s courts as an independent socio-legal institution in modern Russia is caused by the following main objective reasons related to the process of reformation and modernization in all spheres of public life. 4.
