25|$|The ABC {{model of}} flower {{development}} was first formulated by George Haughn and Chris Somerville in 1988. It {{was first used}} as a model to describe the collection of genetic mechanisms that establish floral organ identity in the Rosids, as exemplified by Arabidopsis thaliana, and the Asterids, as demonstrated by Antirrhinum majus. Both species have four verticils (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels), which are defined by the differential expression {{of a number of}} homeotic genes present in each verticil. This means that the sepals are solely characterized by the expression of A genes, while the petals are characterized by the co-expression of A and B genes. The B and <b>C</b> <b>genes</b> establish the identity of the stamens and the carpels only require <b>C</b> <b>genes</b> to be active.

25|$|Glycophorin C and D encode the Gerbich (Ge) antigens. There {{are four}} alleles, Ge-1 to Ge-4. Three types of Ge antigen negativity are known: Ge-1,-2,-3 (Leach phenotype), Ge-2,-3 and Ge-2,+3. A 3.4 {{kilobase}} pair deletion within the gene, which probably arose because of {{unequal crossing over}} between the two repeated domains, {{is responsible for the}} formation of the Ge-2,-3 genotype. The breakpoints of the deletion are located within introns 2 and 3 and results in the deletion of exon 3. This mutant gene is transcribed as a messenger RNA with a continuous open reading frame extending over 300 nucleotides and is translated into the sialoglycoprotein found on Ge-2,-3 red cells. A second 3.4 kilobase pair deletion within the glycophorin <b>C</b> <b>gene</b> eliminates only exon 2 by a similar mechanism and generates the mutant gene encoding for the abnormal glycoprotein found on Ge-2,+3 erythrocytes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe CYP 2 <b>C</b> 18 <b>gene</b> was {{investigated}} in order to characterize its molecular basis in the CYP 2 C subfamily. A mutation of the CYP 2 <b>C</b> 18 <b>gene</b> was identified at the 5 ′-flanking region of the gene, which could be detected by digestion with DdeI. The allele frequency of the mutant CYP 2 <b>C</b> 18 <b>gene</b> was 21. 4 %.

40|$|Background: Cowpox virus (CPXV), a rodent-borne Orthopoxvirus (OPV) that is {{indigenous}} to Eurasia can infect humans, cattle, felidae and other animals. Molecular characterization of CPXVs isolated from different geographic locations {{is important for}} the understanding of their biology, geographic distribution, classification and evolution. Our aim was to characterize CPXVs isolated from Fennoscandia on the basis of A-type inclusion (ATI) phenotype, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles of atip gene fragment amplicon, and phylogenetic tree topology in conjunction with the patristic and genetic distances based on full length DNA sequence of the atip and p 4 <b>c</b> <b>genes.</b> Methods: ATI phenotypes were determined by transmission electron microcopy and RFLP profiles were obtained by restriction enzyme digestion of the atip gene fragment PCR product. A 6. 2 kbp region spanning the entire atip and p 4 <b>c</b> <b>genes</b> of Fennoscandian CPXV isolates was amplified and sequenced. The phylogenetic affinity of Fennoscandian CPXV isolates to OPVs isolated from other geographic regions was determined {{on the basis of the}} atip and p 4 <b>c</b> <b>genes.</b> Results: Fennoscandian CPXV isolates encoded full length atip and p 4 <b>c</b> <b>genes.</b> They produce wild type V+ ATI except for CPXV-No-H 2. CPXVs were resolved into six and seven species clusters based on the phylogeny of the atip and p 4 <b>c</b> <b>genes</b> respectively. The CPXVs isolated from Fennoscandia were grouped into three distinct clusters that corresponded to isolates from Norway, Sweden and Finland. Conclusion: CPXV is a polyphyletic assemblage of six or seven distinct clusters and the current classification in which CPXVs are united as one single species should be re-considered. Our results are of significance to the classification and evolution of OPVs...|$|R

The chr 3 N and chr 3 <b>C</b> <b>genes</b> conferred chromate resistance when expressed in Escherichia coli strain W 3110. The cloned chr 3 N gene alone did not confer chromate resistance on E. coli, suggesting that both chr 3 N and chr 3 <b>C</b> <b>genes</b> are required for function.

A previously described two base pair insertion in exon 29 of the <b>C</b> 4 <b>gene</b> was detected in the paternal MHC haplotype [HLA-A 2, B 40, SC 00, DR 6]. The maternal haplotype [HLA-A 30, B 18, F 1 C 00, DR 3] carried a <b>C</b> 4 <b>gene</b> with a one base pair deletion in exon 20 generating a premature stop codon.

40|$|AbstractOverexpression {{of protein}} kinase C-α and protein kinase C-δ {{has been shown}} to {{modulate}} a number of biological effects, including the cell growth and differentiation. We hypothesized that heparin, a potent antimitogenic drug, could affect the cell proliferation by inhibiting the expression of specific protein kinase <b>C</b> <b>genes.</b> Heparin, markedly but not completely, inhibited the serum-stimulated protein kinase C-α and -δ mRNA expression. Protein kinase C inhibition or down-regulation significantly decreased the serum-induced protein kinase <b>C</b> isoenzyme <b>gene</b> expression.
