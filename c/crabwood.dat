40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>crabwood</b> tree (Carapa guianensis Aubl.) is {{a forest}} species of great {{importance}} for the Amazon people. In Brazil, it is frequently found in floodplain forests throughout the Amazon basin, {{but it can also}} be found in terra firme forest. It is a tree of multiple uses with great potential for forest management, because it presents high density and aggregate distribution. Its wood is of high commercial value, as well as the oil extracted from its seeds, which is widely targeted by the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. However, much of the potential of the oil production can be lost by damages to the seeds, especially those causedby insects. Among them, the moths are prominent: Hypsipyla ferrealis and Hypsipyla grandella. Our objective was to identify the species of Lepidoptera occurring in fruits of <b>crabwood</b> trees in a floodplain forest in Macapá, State of Amapá. The study was conducted in the Fazendinha Protected Area, where all the adult and productive <b>crabwood</b> trees were inventoried. We collected 67 fruits directly from the canopy of five <b>crabwood</b> trees, using rappel techniques and/or spurs. After assessing the biometric variables of fruits and seeds, we isolated healthy seeds from damaged seeds. The latter were sent to the Laboratory of Entomology Embrapa Amapá, following they were placed in plastic trays covered with voil and daily monitored until the emergence of adult insects. All adults were mounted, deposited in an entomological box and properly identified. Two fruits collected at 35 m height were infested. We obtained 21 pupae, emerging 18 adults: Hypsipyla ferrealis (11 specimens) and Hypsipyla grandella (7 specimens) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Crabwood</b> (Carapa guianensis Aubl.) is a {{fast growing}} tree species with many uses among Amazonian local communities. The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effect of seasonal rainfall pattern on growth rates, and seasonal and diurnal changes in leaf gas exchange and leaf water potential (&# 936;L) in <b>crabwood.</b> To assess the effect of rainfall seasonality on growth and physiological leaf traits an experiment was conducted in Manaus, AM (03 º 05 ' 30 " S, 59 º 59 ' 35 " S). In this experiment, six 6 -m tall plants were used to assess photosynthetic traits and &# 936;L. In a second experiment the effect of growth irradiance on stomatal density (S D), size (S S) and leaf thickness was assessed in 0. 8 -m tall saplings. Stomatal conductance (g s) and light-saturated photosynthesis (Amax) were higher in the wet season, and between 09 : 00 and 15 : 00 h. However, no effect of rainfall seasonality was found on &# 936;L and potential photosynthesis (CO 2 -saturated). &# 936;L declined from - 0. 3 MPa early in the morning to - 0. 75 MPa after midday. It increased in the afternoon but did not reach full recovery at sunset. Growth rates of <b>crabwood</b> were high, and similar in both seasons (2 mm month- 1).

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} oil extraction from <b>crabwood</b> seeds {{was observed in}} three municipalities (Anama, Manacapuru e Silves) {{in the state of}} Amazonas. In 1992 and 2004 a total of 38 producers were interviewed. Seeds of two species (Carapa procera D. C. and Carapa guianensis Aubl.) were used for oil extraction. The complex process requires about two months and can be divided into three stages: 1. seed collection by gathering and storing good seed (3 - 5 days). 2. "seed cake" preparation by cooking the seeds in boiling water (1 - 3 hours), followed by a second storage period (up to 20 days), completed by removing the seed coat and kneading the seed mass; 3. Oil extraction (up to 30 days) by collecting the oil dripping from the "seed cake" placed on an inclined plate. Oil extracted in the shade was considered of better quality than in the sun, but the process needed more time. A second extraction with the press ("tipiti") used for manioc flour was rarely used. Comparing the methods of the producers, some minor variations were observed apparent consequences in yield as well as quality. The first and second stages of the process involved the collaboration of relatives and/or neighbors, whereas the last stage was executed by only one woman. Transmission of traditional knowledge is passed from generation to generation by orality and observation. This study revealed that young persons no longer participated. This may cause, in the near future a loss of knowledge and skill in performance for <b>crabwood</b> seed oil extraction by the traditional method...|$|E

A andiroba (Carapa guianensis Aubl.) é espécie de crescimento rápido e muito utilizada pelas comunidades da Amazônia. O principal objetivo deste estudo foi determinar o efeito da sazonalidade da chuva na taxa de crescimento, variação diurna das trocas gasosas e potencial hídrico foliar &# 936;L em andiroba. Para determinar o efeito sazonal no crescimento e características fisiológicas foliares dessa espécie, um experimento foi realizado em Manaus, AM (03 º 05 ' 30 " S, 59 º 59 ' 35 " S). Assim, seis plantas (6 m de altura) da espécie foram utilizadas para determinar as suas características fotossintéticas e o &# 936;L. Em um segundo experimento, o efeito da irradiância na densidade estomática (S D), tamanho estomático (S S) e espessura foliar foi determinado em mudas de 0, 8 m de altura. A condutância estomática (g s) e a fotossíntese em luz saturante (Amax) foram máximas na estação chuvosa e entre 9 h e 15 h. Entretanto, não houve efeito sazonal no &# 936;L e na fotossíntese potencial (CO 2 saturada). &# 936;L declinou de - 0, 3 MPa pela manhã para - 0, 75 MPa após o meio-dia, aumentando à tarde e não se recuperando completamente ao anoitecer. A taxa de crescimento foi alta e similar nas duas estações do ano (2 mm mês- 1). A espessura foliar e a S D foram 19 % e 47 % maiores nas folhas de sol, sendo o contrário observado quanto ao S S.
