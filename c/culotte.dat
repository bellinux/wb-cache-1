After three weeks in this state, they were marched to Aix-en-Provence and were confined in the prison there. After a month imprisoned in Aix, Maximilien Robespierre fell and the Reign of Terror came to an end. The British were paroled. Eyre and the officers were taken to Romans, in Dauphiné where Eyre remained until May 1795 when he was released in exchange for a French officer. He faced a court-martial for the loss of Speedy, but was honourably acquitted.|$|E

Susan, of Pool, had been sailing from Alicante when captured. Spider captured Sans <b>Culotte</b> and recaptured Susan some seven leagues west of Guernsey on 5 March. Sans-Culotte was a 15-ton and 20-man privateer from Saint-Malo, commissioned in 1793 under Captain Eudes. At capture, Sans Culottes was armed with 12 swivel guns and had a crew of 22 men.|$|E

2500|$|During the Revolution, the <b>culotte,</b> {{or short}} {{trousers}} with silk stockings, and the extravagance fashions, lace and bright {{colors of the}} nobility had disappeared, and were replaced by trousers and greater simplicity. The purpose of men's fashion was to show one's wealth and social position; colors were dark and sober. Under the Empire, the <b>culotte</b> returned, worn by Napoleon and his nobles and the wealthy, but trousers were also worn. Men's fashion was strongly influenced by the French aristocrats who returned from exile in England; they introduced English styles, including the large overcoat they called the carsick, {{going down to the}} feet; the jacket with a collar going up to the ears; a white silk necktie wrapped around the neck; an English high hat with a broad brim, and high boots. In the late Empire, men's fashion tried for a more military look, with a narrow waist and a chest expanded by several layers of vests.|$|E

2500|$|During the French Revolution, men's costume became {{particularly}} {{emblematic of}} {{the movement of the}} people and the upheaval of the aristocratic French society. It was the long pant, hemmed near the ankles, that displaced the knee-length breeches culottes that marked the aristocratic classes. Working-class men had worn long pants for much of their history, and the rejection of culottes became a symbol of working class, and later French, resentment of the Ancien Régime. The movement would be given the all encompassing title of sans-culottes, wearing the same as the working class. There was no <b>culotte</b> [...] "uniform" [...] per se, but as they were turned into a larger symbol of French society, they had certain attributes attributed to them. In contemporary art and description, culottes become associated with the Phrygian cap an classical symbol. French citizens on all levels of society were [...] obligated to wear the blue, white and red of the French flag on their clothing, often {{in the form of the}} pinned the blue-and-red cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the Ancien Régime, [...] thus producing the original Tricolore cockade. Later, distinctive colours and styles of cockade would indicate the wearer's faction although the meanings of the various styles were not entirely consistent and varied somewhat by region and period.|$|E
