25|$|By {{the second}} week of the trial, {{testimony}} had begun to focus upon the extent of police knowledge of the criminal activities Haarmann had engaged upon following his 1918 release from prison and issues relating to the trust bestowed upon him. Until Haarmann had been arrested for sexual assault upon Karl Fromm and his apartment had been searched, the police had seemingly never seriously suspected that the individual responsible for the sharp increase in missing person cases relating to boys and young men filed in Hanover in 1923 and 1924, or the discovery of more than 500 human bones in and around the Leine River in May and June 1924, was actually an individual whom they had regarded as a trusted informant, despite the fact some of the victims were last seen in his company, and that he had amassed a lengthy <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> <b>for</b> various criminal offenses including sexual assault and battery.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{beaching}} of the MSC Napoli, as {{a result}} of severe damage incurred during European storm Kyrill, there was confusion in the press and by the authorities about whether people could be prevented from helping themselves to the flotsam which was washed up on the beaches at Branscombe. Many people took advantage of the confusion and helped themselves to the cargo. This included many BMW motorbikes and empty wine casks as well as bags of disposable nappies (diapers). The legal position under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is that any such finds and recovery must be reported within 28 days to the Receiver of Wreck. Failure to do so is an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act and can result in a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> <b>for</b> theft by finding. After several days, the police and Receiver of Wreck, in conjunction with the landowner and the contracted salvors, established a cordon to prevent access to the beach. A similar situation occurred after the wreck of the MV Cita in 1997.|$|E

He then teams up with Summer and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) to investigate the crime. Andrew suspects Sonya when he learns that she has a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> <b>for</b> assault and no alibi. Sonya is questioned and released. The teens follow Diana, who meet with Jack. Natasha gets Jack's phone and Andrew gives it to Brennan, who then arrests Diana for conspiracy to commit murder. Soon after, Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) receives anonymous texts telling her that Diana did not push Paul. When Paul wakes from his coma, he remembers arguing with someone on the night he was pushed. He then mentions Diana's name. Shortly after, Diana receives a call informing her that the police are on their way to her hotel. Diana escapes and visits Paul, where she tells him she did not push him.|$|E

At the time, he had served in the Commons for 14 years, one of the last CCF MPs left from the 1957 federal election, representing the Skeena electoral district. He was known for his caustic, no-nonsense approach to politics, and was frequently in trouble with the Speaker of the House of Commons.

40|$|This article uses unique {{data from}} over 300 {{criminal}} trials in four large counties {{to study the}} relations between the existence of a prior <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> and defendants testifying at trial, between testifying at trial and juries 2 ̆ 7 learning about a <b>criminal</b> <b>record,</b> and between juries 2 ̆ 7 learning about a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> and their decisions to convict or acquit. Sixty percent of defendants without <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> testified compared to 45 percent with <b>criminal</b> <b>records.</b> <b>For</b> testifying defendants with <b>criminal</b> <b>records,</b> juries learned of those records in about half the cases. Juries rarely learned about <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> unless defendants testified. After controlling for evidentiary strength and other factors, statistically significant associations exist (1) between the existence of a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> and the decision to testify at trial, (2) between the defendant testifying at trial and the jury learning about the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s prior record, and (3) in cases with weak evidence, between the jury learning of a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> and conviction. <b>For</b> cases with strong evidence against defendants, learning of <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> is not strongly associated with conviction rates. Juries appear to rely on <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> to convict when other evidence in the case normally would not support conviction. Use of prior record evidence may therefore lead to erroneous convictions. Prosecutors and judges should consider the increased likelihood of erroneous conviction based on use of prior convictions in decisions to prosecute and in evidentiary rulings...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} the causal effect {{of participation in}} the mandatory military service on the involvement in criminal activities.

Using a unique set of administrative data that includes draft eligibility, participation in the military service, and <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> <b>for</b> all Argentine males born between 1958 and 1962, we find that participation in the military service increases the likelihood of developing a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> in adulthood. The effects are not only significant for the cohorts that performed military service during war times, but also for those that provided service at peace times. We also find that military service has detrimental effects on future performance in the labor market. JEL Classification: K 4...|$|R
