40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to extract fusion-required {{academic}} fields and fusion priority based on the various relationship between other academic fields and architecture·urban academic fields. Initial set of academic fields were gathered through practical worker-oriented survey (respondents: 254) in related academic fields. Then final set of academic fields (21 fields, 120 subjects) were reclassified through investigation of previous studies and cases of other fusion education. The result of this study is based on the expert survey (respondents: 37). Research finding are as follow, the first is that the sector- 1 academic fields (economics, energy and resources, business management, environment, law) had high practical usability, academic relationship, expected effect. So these academic fields <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>consider</b> a fusion firstly. The second is that the sector- 3 academic fields (electronics, mechanical engineering, medical engineering) had low practical usability, academic relationship, relatively high expected effect. According to this result, sector- 3 academic fields <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>consider</b> a fusion in mid- and long-term point of view. The last is that the sector- 2 academic fields (information and communication technology, human sensibility ergonomics) had low practical usability, intermediate academic relationship, slightly high expected effect. Therefore sector- 2 academic fields <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>consider</b> a fusion in mid- short-term point of view...|$|R

Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland.|$|E

After {{dissolving}} the Holy Roman Empire, he reduced the number of German states from 300 to less than 50, prior to the German Unification. A byproduct of the French occupation was a strong development in German nationalism. Napoleon also significantly aided the United States when he agreed to sell the territory of Louisiana for 15 million dollars during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson. That territory almost doubled the size of the United States, adding the equivalent of 13 states to the Union.|$|E

5|$|Other {{psychologists have}} {{questioned}} the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning.
