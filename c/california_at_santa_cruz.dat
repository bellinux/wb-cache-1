40|$|The {{following}} paper discusses my {{preparation for}} {{and execution of}} the role of Nancy in the University of <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz’s</b> 2015 production of The Congressladies, an adaptation of Aristophanes’ Ecclesiazusae. During this process there were questions that continually resurfaced. Why do people enjoy watching and performing political satire, an art form that has tenaciously persisted from Ancient Greece until now? If our ensemble was writing song parodies to critique current events, why adapt Aristophanes’ 2400 year old play, instead of writing a new show altogether? What is the importance of actors in political satire? Through my research and performance, I was able to deeply engage with these questions. I will discuss this research, the intensely collaborative rehearsal process, and the execution of my role. Additionally, I will touch upon the Congressladies’ reception by its audiences...|$|R

50|$|From 1963 to 1967 {{he studied}} philosophy, English and French {{literature}} and language at Würzburg University {{to which he}} added German literature after his first state exam in 1967 (second state exam in 1969). Again at Würzburg University in 1973, he took his PhD with a dissertation {{on the problems of}} literary interpretation, adopting and adapting perspectives of the theory of language and philosophy of science. In 1977, he took his Habilitation at Konstanz University with a book written {{from the point of view}} of a theory of consciousness, on the functional history of the 19th century English novel, especially the novels of George Meredith. Pfeiffer’s scholarly development is marked by the adjustment and relocation of literary studies in broader media and cultural contexts. These, in turn, are re-examined in anthropological terms. In 1978, he became Professor of English at the Ruhr University Bochum, and in 1979 Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Siegen (Professor Emeritus as of 2009). Since 2007 he has been at Jacobs University Bremen (Professor Emeritus as of end of 2011).
