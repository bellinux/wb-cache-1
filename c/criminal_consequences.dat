50|$|English {{criminal}} law derives its main principles {{from the common}} law. The main elements of a crime are the actus reus (doing something which is criminally prohibited) and a mens rea (having the requisite criminal state of mind, usually intention or recklessness). A prosecutor must show that a person has caused the offensive conduct, or that the culprit had some pre-existing duty {{to take steps to}} avoid a <b>criminal</b> <b>consequence.</b> The types of different crimes range from those well known ones like manslaughter, murder, theft and robbery to a plethora of regulatory and statutory offences. It is estimated that in the UK, there are 3,500 classes of criminal offence. Certain defences may exist to crimes, which include self-defence, intention, necessity, duress, {{and in the case of}} a murder charge, under the Homicide Act 1957, diminished responsibility, provocation and, in very rare cases, survival of a suicide pact. It has often been suggested that England and Wales should codify its {{criminal law}} in an English Criminal Code, but there has been no overwhelming support for this in the past.|$|R

40|$|The rise {{of social}} {{policies}} and legislative measures has been foundational for regulating stricter <b>criminal</b> <b>consequence</b> for offenders engaging in sexual crimes against children. Although these crimes have occurred and been documented for several decades, no policy or legislative measure has successfully prevented {{child sexual abuse}} from occurring within family households. In her book, Julia C. Davidson examines a variety of policies that have been implemented, more specifically within the United Kingdom, that present a useful framework into the controversial debates surrounding the degree of punishment for sexual offenders {{and the level of}} legal protection of minors. A significant part of the book explores the British government’s reaction to the increasing number of child sexual abuse cases happening within the country. Davidson’s qualitative and quantitative analyses of reported cases yield important insights into the damaging effects victims of child sexual abuse experience. These insights augment the book’s central argument that much of the current legislation in Britain on the punishment and control of sex offenders is a reactionary measure coming out of public anxiety and media responses. The book begins by fully defining childhood and abuse with subsequent chapters focusing on numerous theoretica...|$|R

50|$|Lorazepam is {{not usually}} fatal in overdose, but may cause fatal {{respiratory}} depression if taken in overdose with alcohol. The combination also causes synergistic enhancement of the disinhibitory and amnesic effects of both drugs, with potentially embarrassing or <b>criminal</b> <b>consequences.</b> Some experts advise that patients should be warned against drinking alcohol while on lorazepam treatment, but such clear warnings are not universal. Synergistic adverse effects may also occur when lorazepam is administered with other drugs, such as opioids or other hypnotics. Lorazepam may also interact with rifabutin. Valproate inhibits the metabolism of lorazepam, whereas carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin increase its rate of metabolism. Some antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opiates, antipsychotics and alcohol, when taken with lorazepam may result in enhanced sedative effects.|$|E

50|$|There are {{different}} opinions on {{who should be}} held liable {{in case of a}} crash, in particular with people being hurt. Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction. Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue, there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible: it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues, not only due to protection of the brand image, but also due to financial and <b>criminal</b> <b>consequences.</b> However, there are also voices that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle. Experts suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of autonomous vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident. Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the autonomous operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.|$|E

40|$|The age of {{criminal}} responsibility {{acts as a}} gate-keeping mechanism to the criminal justice system. It is {{the age at which}} society deems that its children are old enough to be held responsible for criminal acts and no longer in need of sheltering from the <b>criminal</b> law <b>consequences</b> of their behaviour. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child asks contracting states to establish a minimum age 'below which children shall be presumed not to have the capacity to infringe penal law'. In all Australian criminal jurisdictions, protection of children from the criminal justice system takes the form of two age barriers. First, a lower one under which a child is conclusively presumed too young to ever be capable of guilt (currently under the age of 10) and a higher one where the presumption {{of criminal}} incapacity (sometimes termed the presumption of doli incapax) is conditional and, therefore, rebuttable.

40|$|At present, {{approximately}} 2, 000 Australians {{are waiting}} for a kidney transplant, though only about 500 transplants are performed each year. Those who still wait at least have the alternative of enduring the inconvenience of dialysis treatment until an organ is available. However, in many other countries, dialysis treatment is not an option. Nor is there a well developed cadaver organ retrieval program.

Electrodermal activity was recorded while participants anticipated and re-sponded to a 105 dB signaled or unsignaled white-noise burst. Using an extreme groups design, the authors used Child Psychopathy Scale (D. R. Lynam, 1997) scores from a community sample of 335 male adolescents (age 16) to form control (n 65) and psychopathy-prone (n 65) groups. Significantly more psychopathy-prone participants were nonresponders in the signaled anticipatory (p. 014), signaled responsivity (p. 037), and unsignaled responsivity (p. 003) conditions compared with controls. Anticipatory hyporesponsivity of psychopathy-prone adolescents similar to the electrodermal hyporesponsivity found in psychopathic adults suggests that this autonomic impairment is present by adolescence and may predispose individuals to adult psychopathy.

50|$|Prior to the Lunacy Act lunacy {{legislation}} in England was {{enshrined in the}} County Asylums Act of 1808, which established institutions for poor and for criminally-insane, mentally ill people.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether it}} is lawful in Australia to terminate one or more fetuses in a multiple pregnancy selectively and, if so, under what circumstances. It begins by addressing the preliminary question whether selective reduction is covered by laws relating to abortion and provides a brief outline {{of the law of}} abortion in Australian jurisdictions. The article then considers selective reduction of high-order multiple pregnancies, before turning to selective reduction of twin pregnancies in a range of circumstances. The article demonstrates that the law of abortion, as applied to selective reduction of multiple pregnancies, is uncertain and that there are considerable variations from one State to another. It concludes that the law in this area is in need of reform to recognise that some reductions are not performed prima facie to prevent danger to the mother's health and to remove the need for doctors to assert symptomatology of mental illness in order to guard against <b>criminal</b> law <b>consequences.</b> Further, {{there is a need to}} clarify whether selective reduction/termination is abortion for the purposes of the law, and to achieve greater consistency across jurisdictions.
