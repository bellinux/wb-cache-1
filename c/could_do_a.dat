5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven to myself that I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E
25|$|Austin Trevor debuted {{the role}} of Poirot on screen in the 1931 British film Alibi. The film {{was based on the}} stage play. Trevor reprised {{the role of}} Poirot twice, in Black Coffee and Lord Edgware Dies. Trevor said once that he was {{probably}} cast as Poirot simply because he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> French accent. Leslie S. Hiscott directed the first two films, with Henry Edwards taking over for the third.|$|E
25|$|Brother Walfrid {{regularly}} invited Hibs {{to play in}} Glasgow before Celtic were formed. This {{included a}} match against Renton that drew a crowd of over 12,000. Glasgow had a far greater Irish population than Edinburgh. Brother Walfrid realised that a Glasgow club <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot more to help the Irish population in that city than relying on charity from an Edinburgh club. This led in November 1887 {{to the formation of}} Celtic, who played their first match in May 1888 with players mostly borrowed from Hibs.|$|E
60|$|Yes, I told him, I could hinder him, because I knew he <b>could</b> no more <b>do</b> <b>an</b> unkind {{thing by}} me than he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>an</b> unjust one; {{and to put}} {{him out of his}} pain, I told him I was with child.|$|R

25|$|Timothy Hutton plays Archie Goodwin, and I can't see {{how anyone}} <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> better job. Not only does he catch Archie's snap-brim Thirties tone with sharp-eared precision, {{but he also}} bears an uncanny {{physical}} resemblance to the dapper detective-narrator I've been envisioning all these years. No sooner did Hutton make his first entrance in The Golden Spiders than he melded completely with the Archie of my mind's eye. I can no longer read a Stout novel without seeing him, or hearing his voice.|$|E
25|$|In Scott's first appearance, {{his body}} would glow green or be {{bathed in a}} green light {{whenever}} he used his power, such as passing through a wall or flying. During his earliest appearances, he would project a beam of green light from his ring that <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> variety of things such as move objects, melt metal, shrink objects, or put out fires. He rarely used it as an actual weapon and preferred to fight with his fists like any other pulp-adventure hero would do. The ring made him invulnerable to any weapon not made of wood.|$|E
25|$|Several {{registers}} {{could be}} read onto the read bus simultaneously. When this occurred, data from each register was inclusive-ORed onto the bus. This inclusive-OR feature was used to implement the Mask instruction, which was a logical AND operation. Because the AGC had no native ability to do a logical AND, but <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> logical OR through the bus and could complement (invert) data through the C register, De Morgan's theorem was used to implement {{the equivalent of a}} logical AND. This was accomplished by inverting both operands, performing a logical OR through the bus, and then inverting the result.|$|E

25|$|By using tape, I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to}} the twenty-six or twenty-seven {{minutes the}} program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E
25|$|The second Indian raid was {{conducted}} on the same target by eight Canberras led by Wing Commander Surinder Singh, which again left the airport's terminal and other buildings untouched. Two transport aircraft—a Lockheed Constellation belonging to the Portuguese airline TAP and a Douglas DC-4 belonging to the Goan airline TAIP—were parked on the apron. On the night of 18 December, the Portuguese used both aircraft to evacuate the families of some government and military officials in spite of the heavily damaged runway. During the first hours of the evening, airport workers hastily recovered part of the runway. The first aircraft to leave was the TAP Constellation commanded by Manuel Correia Reis, which took off using only 700 metres; the debris from the runway damaged the fuselage with 25 holes and a flat tire. To take off in the short distance, the TAP pilots had jettisoned all the extra seats and other unwanted equipment so that they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> 'short take-off'. The second to leave was the TAIP DC-4, piloted by TAIP Director Major Solano de Almeida. Both aircraft used the cover of night and very low altitudes to break through Indian aerial patrols and escape to Karachi, Pakistan.|$|E

500|$|Between 1971 and 1973, Sonny and Cher's {{recording}} {{career was}} revived with four albums released under Kapp Records and MCA Records: Sonny & Cher Live (1971), All I Ever Need Is You (1972), Mama Was a Rock and Roll Singer, Papa Used to Write All Her Songs (1973), and Live in Las Vegas Vol. 2 (1973). Cher later commented on this period: [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> whole album... in three days... We {{were on the}} road... and we were doing the Sonny & Cher Show".|$|E
500|$|Although Johar and Mansukhani wanted Chopra {{to wear a}} gown for {{the song}} [...] "Desi Girl", Malhotra {{suggested}} a sari. They considered it unsuitable for a character in Miami, but Malhotra said that if they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> song like [...] "Desi Girl" [...] in Miami Chopra could wear a sari and [...] "treat it like a dress". They later agreed on the sari, Chopra's only Indian costume in the film. Malhotra designed a modern sari, giving it a Western feel with a long, silver-sequined skirt and a bikini-type blouse. The designer chose silver because only a silver sari could compete with the golden swimsuit.|$|E
50|$|Von Hoene <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>an</b> uncanny vocal {{impersonation}} {{of horror}} icon Boris Karloff, {{and so he}} was also the off-screen voice announcer for the show.

Commenting on the collection in 1995, Hiller commended their professionalism in the studio, stating; [...] "They were tremendously fast, we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>an</b> album in two weeks. They would bring up their own harmonies. They were a joy {{to work with and}} it shows".|$|R
500|$|Burge {{was linked}} with {{a move to}} Peterborough United in May 2013, though also stated that [...] "I am {{confident}} I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> job at Championship level". He also had a trial spell with Burnley. He eventually {{signed a contract with}} League Two side Newport County on 30 August 2013. Illness and injuries limited his contribution {{at the beginning of the}} 2013–14 season. He impressed in central midfield during the second half of the campaign and manager Justin Edinburgh was reported to have opened talks to extend Burge's stay at Rodney Parade beyond the summer. Despite these reports, Burge left the club in May 2014.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{exposure}} {{he received from}} Kane, Jay-Z was still without a record deal. He began selling tapes from his car with help from friend Damon Dash. The success of his street-level marketing led to a deal with Payday Records, which released his first solo single, [...] "In My Lifetime" [...] and its B-side [...] "I Can't Get wid Dat". In an unconventional move, Jay-Z then spurned the record contract he had long sought and left Payday Records to form his own label, Roc-A-Fella Records, with Damon Dash and Kareem [...] "Biggs" [...] Burke. Jay-Z later explained {{that he thought he}} <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> better job of marketing his records on his own: ...|$|E
500|$|The Byrds {{moved quickly}} to record a self-produced {{follow-up}} to Byrdmaniax, {{in an attempt to}} stem the criticism that the album was receiving in the music press and as a reaction to their own dislike of Melcher's overproduction. [...] Johnny Rogan has speculated that the Byrds' decision to produce their next album themselves was an attempt on the band's part to prove that they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> better job than Melcher had done on their previous record. [...] While in England for an appearance at the Lincoln Folk Festival, the Byrds decamped to CBS Studios in London with engineer Mike Ross and between July 22 and 28, 1971, they recorded an album's worth of new material.|$|E

500|$|Made-up stories did not {{exclusively}} comprise Animaniacs writing, as Hastings remarked: [...] "We weren't really there to tell compelling stories... you <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, {{or you could}} parody a commercial... you could do all these kinds of things, and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up." [...] Writers for the series wrote into Animaniacs stories that happened to them; the episodes [...] "Ups and Downs," [...] "Survey Ladies," [...] and [...] "I Got Yer Can" [...] were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Stoner, respectively. Another episode, [...] "Bumbie's Mom," [...] both parodied the film Bambi and was a story based on Stoner's childhood reaction to the film.|$|E
500|$|On 16 February 1951 Driberg {{surprised}} {{his friends}} by announcing his engagement to Ena Mary Binfield (née Lyttelton). A former Suffolk county councillor, {{she worked as}} an administrator at the Marie Curie Hospital in London and was well known in senior Labour circles; she had met Driberg in 1949, at a weekend party given by the government minister George Strauss. According to her son, she was fully aware of Driberg's sexual preferences, but looked forward to some political excitement, and [...] "thought they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> useful job as Mr. and Mrs." [...] Driberg's motives are less clear, but he told his friend John Freeman that he needed someone to run Bradwell Lodge, {{to which he had}} returned in 1946 after its release by the RAF.|$|E
500|$|In {{many of her}} World Grand Championship portraits, Nipper {{painted a}} montage {{depicting}} the horse's life and show career. She first used this technique for a portrait of Pride's Generator. When Nipper asked the horse's owner, Claude Crowley, if she <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> montage, Nipper said, [...] "He said 'I don't know what that is, but why not?'" [...] The style soon caught on and was requested by other horse owners. Nipper herself bred Tennessee Walking Horses, and once bred a mare to The Whole Nine Yards, a World Grand Champion, of whom she had previously painted a portrait. Although the portrait was painted before the horse ever won a title, Nipper depicted him with roses around his head. The horse's owner later said she almost sent the picture back.|$|E
