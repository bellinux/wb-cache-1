5|$|Originally, the {{aircraft}} was to conduct flight tests at Gostomel {{for three months}} before transferring to the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky, near Moscow. However, the first prototype was lost when it was making its fourth flight on 10 February 1995. During the flight, {{the aircraft}} suffered a sudden deviation from its intended flightpath and collided with the An-72 <b>chase</b> <b>plane</b> before spiralling into the ground, erupting into flames; the test crew of seven were killed. Although there were initial allegations of technical issues with the aircraft, it was later determined that the crash had been caused by human error.|$|E
5|$|HB1001 {{made its}} first flight on 1December1977 {{at the hands of}} Lockheed test pilot, Bill Park. He would fly the next four sorties, all chased by a T-38 piloted by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Ken Dyson. Dyson, an F-15 Eagle pilot, was {{previously}} approached by United States Air Force personnel about the project in 1976. He made his first flight on HB1001 on 17January1978, chased by Park. In fact, the two would be the only test pilots of Have Blue, alternating between the demonstrator and the <b>chase</b> <b>plane.</b> Flight test results allowed engineers to refine the FBW system. At the same time, they verified predictions made earlier by aerodynamic engineers on the aircraft's behavior.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of design work, KnAAPO constructed the first prototype, which was finished in mid-2007. The prototype, Su-35-1, was then transferred to the Gromov Flight Research Institute at Zhukovsky Airfield, in preparation for its maiden flight. On 19 February 2008, Sergey Bogdan took the aircraft aloft for its 55-minute first flight from Zhukovsky, accompanied by an Su-30MK2 acting as a <b>chase</b> <b>plane.</b> Bogdan later piloted the second prototype on its maiden flight on 2 October from KnAAPO's Dzyomgi Airport. The flight-test programme was expected to involve three flying prototypes, but on 26 April 2009, a day before its scheduled maiden flight, the fourth Su-35 (there's a static test aircraft) crashed during a taxi run at Dzyomgi Airport. The aircraft struck a barrier {{at the end of}} the runway and was destroyed by fire; the pilot ejected and sustained burn injuries. A commission was opened to investigate the crash, but several sources initially speculated that the incident had been the result of a brake failure or a faulty fuel pump.|$|E

NASA's internal projections show the number of operational jet trainers falling to 16 by 2015. The agency spends $25–30 million annually to fly and maintain the T-38s.|$|E
25|$|On September 1961, a B-58 on {{training}} {{flight from the}} United States Air Force Strategic Air Command base at Carswell suffered a fire and failure of the left main gear. A <b>chase</b> <b>plane</b> was sent to examine the aircraft in flight. Through the night, eight sessions of mid-air refuelling were conducted, using an improved technique, and once daylight broke a successful emergency landing was made at Edwards Air Force Base. The USAF made a training film about the incident, including film of the landing.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, two ex-Blue Angels F-11As {{were taken}} from storage at Davis-Monthan AFB and {{modified}} by Grumman as testbeds to evaluate inflight thrust control systems. BuNo 141853 was fitted with a Rohr Industries thrust reverser and BuNo 141824 was kept in standard configuration as a <b>chase</b> <b>plane.</b> Tests of the inflight thrust reversal were carried out by Grumman at Calverton beginning in March 1974 and continued at NATC Patuxent River, Maryland until 1975. Following the completion of these tests, both planes were returned to storage at Davis Monthan AFB. These were the last Tigers to fly.|$|E

25|$|NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center (formerly the Dryden Flight Research Center) at Edwards, California has {{operated}} two T-34C aircraft. The first aircraft was previously flown at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, {{where it was}} used for propulsion experiments involving turboprop engines. In 1996 this aircraft was moved Dryden as a chase aircraft. That aircraft was returned to the U.S. Navy in 2002. The second T-34C was obtained in early 2005 from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) at NAS Patuxent River, where {{it was due to}} be retired. At Armstrong, the T-34C is primarily used for chasing remotely piloted unmanned air vehicles which fly slower than NASA's F/A-18 mission support aircraft can fly. As a NASA mission support <b>chase</b> <b>plane,</b> the back seat would be occupied by a photographer or flight test engineer during research missions. It is also used for required pilot proficiency flying.|$|E
500|$|Flight tests {{proceeded}} fairly smoothly until 4May1978, when HB1001 {{was making}} its 36th flight. The aircraft pitched {{up just as}} it made contact with the ground which forced the pilot, Bill Park, to abort the landing and make a second attempt. The impact had however been so hard that the landing gear had become jammed in a semi-retracted position. Efforts to lower the gear were unsuccessful and Bill Park was forced to climb again, and eject when his fuel ran out. The aircraft was destroyed on impact {{in the vicinity of}} the Groom Lake facility. Park survived, but suffered a concussion, forcing him to retire from further test flights. Dyson, who was in the <b>chase</b> <b>plane,</b> recounted: [...] "Just before touchdown the airplane pitched up... It seemed it slammed down on the ground real hard... He [...] raised the gear on the go around, and when he tried to extend it on approach, only one of the mains and the nose wheel came down. All this time, gas was being consumed... I suggested he climb up to 10,000 feet for ejection... He started climbing, but the engine started flaming out, from the lack of fuel, so he ejected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yeager {{is fully}} retired from {{military}} test flying, after having maintained that status {{for three decades}} after his official retirement from the Air Force. On , 1997, on the 50th anniversary of his historic flight past Mach 1, he flew a new Glamorous Glennis III, an F-15D Eagle, past Mach 1. The <b>chase</b> <b>plane</b> for the flight was an F-16 Fighting Falcon piloted by Bob Hoover, an air-show pilot who had been Yeager's wingman for the first supersonic flight. This was Yeager's last official flight with the U.S. Air Force. At {{the end of his}} speech to the crowd, Yeager concluded, [...] "All that I am ... I owe to the Air Force." [...] Later that month, he was the recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his achievements.|$|E
25|$|Five Meteor NF.11s were {{transferred}} to the Centre d’Essais en Vol (Flight Test Centre) in 1958, where they were used as equipment testbeds and <b>chase</b> <b>planes,</b> and were later joined by two NF Mk.13s and two NF Mk.14s. The test aircraft were used {{in a wide variety}} of experiments, including radar and missile tests and during the development of Concorde.|$|R
50|$|Weapons testing forms only a {{small part}} of the unit’s task. Most weapons testing is {{conducted}} together with the Eglin AFB based testing squadrons. Some F-16s are painted in a regular gray USAF scheme for weapons testing, but other color schemes are used, such as white aircraft with red tails and ventral fins. These aircraft are very often used as <b>chase</b> <b>planes</b> for other aircraft test programs.|$|R
50|$|The {{significance}} of the friendship mission was particularly emphasized by the Scandinavian government, which waived the customary rigorous clearance through customs for Tony and his entourage of 11 persons. In Norway and Sweden, government officials checked no passports and required only that Tony's father, Gary, and Dr. Lance Allyn, a Hanford, California surgeon who was piloting one of the <b>chase</b> <b>planes,</b> sign declarations {{that they were not}} bringing in anything illegal.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first test}} {{flight of the}} RB-57F {{prototype}} was conducted on 23 June 1963 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The prototype showed remarkable power, reaching [...] in 18 minutes with a steady rate of climb of 2,725 fpm (831 mpm). Its RB-57D <b>chase</b> <b>plane</b> was unable to match it in maneuverability. The wing design created tremendous lift even at idle speeds; the aircraft was airborne after a takeoff roll of only [...] at sea level. Because of this it also proved difficult to land, and if an engine failed during takeoff, TF33 main engine thrust was limited to 70% power to maintain directional control. Despite some shortcomings the design had shown exceptional performance and Big Safari authorized the First Chip production program in August 1963 for the fabrication of 19 more RB-57Fs from existing B-57 airframes.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these problems, one fully {{operational}} Airacuda squadron was eventually assembled, and operated from 1938 until 1940. Funds were appropriated, but never released, {{for the purchase}} of two groups of Airacudas. Continuing problems gave the aircraft a reputation as [...] "hangar queens". Near the end of the type's operational life, the aircraft were flown primarily for photo opportunities and always accompanied by a <b>chase</b> <b>plane</b> for safety. Eventually {{the decision was made to}} disperse the aircraft to various airfields to give pilots an opportunity to add the unusual aircraft to their log books. Airacudas were sent at various times to Langley Field, Virginia; Maxwell Field, Alabama; Hamilton Field, California; and Wright Field, in Dayton, Ohio. YFM-1 38-488 was displayed at the 1940 World's Fair in New York, finished in the markings of the 27th Pursuit Squadron. During this time, the aircraft saw limited flight time, as few pilots were interested in flying the unusual aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|One {{theory is}} that the Tu-144 maneuvered to avoid a French Mirage <b>chase</b> <b>plane</b> that was {{attempting}} to photograph its unique canards, which were advanced for the time, and that the French and Soviet governments colluded with each other to cover up such details. The flight of the Mirage was denied in the original French report of the incident, perhaps because it was engaged in industrial espionage. More recent reports have admitted the existence of the Mirage (and the fact that the Soviet crew were not told about the Mirage's flight) though not its role in the crash. However, the official press release did state: [...] "though the inquiry established that there was no real risk of collision between the two aircraft, the Soviet pilot was likely to have been surprised." [...] Howard Moon also stresses that last-minute changes to the flight schedule would have disoriented the pilots in a cockpit with notably poor vision. He also cites an eyewitness who claims the co-pilot had agreed to take a camera with him, which he may have been operating {{at the time of the}} evasive manoeuver. The initial approach may have been an attempted landing on the wrong runway, which occurred due to a last-minute shortening of the Tu-144's display.|$|E
50|$|Walker was {{the chief}} project pilot for the X-3 program. Walker {{reportedly}} considered the X-3 {{to be the worst}} airplane that he ever flew. In addition to research aircraft, Walker flew many <b>chase</b> <b>planes</b> during test flights of other aircraft, and he also flew in programs that involved the North American F-100 Super Sabre, McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Boeing B-47 Stratojet.|$|R

5|$|On {{his first}} day at Edwards, Armstrong was tasked his first assignments, which were to pilot <b>chase</b> <b>planes</b> during {{releases}} of experimental aircraft from modified bombers. He also flew the modified bombers, and {{on one of these}} missions had his first flight incident at Edwards. On March 22, 1956, Armstrong was in a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket. He sat in the right-hand pilot seat while the left-hand seat commander, Stan Butchart, flew the B-29.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{authoritative}} {{and well}} researched account of General Bond's death {{is provided by}} the book [...] "Red Eagles: America's Secret MiGs" [...] In it, the author states that on 26 April 1984 Bond, who was about to retire, made a farewell visit to [...] "an Air Force Systems Command unit" [...] believed to have been the 6513th Test Squadron, Red Hats, at Groom Lake. The Red Hats, like the 4477th TES Red Eagles based at Tonopah Test Range, clandestinely operated Soviet aircraft. On a previous visit to Groom, Bond had flown the secret YF-117A prototype. The MiG-23 was known as YF-113 in US service and, along with a greater number of MiG-21s, was part of a collection of Soviet-built aircraft that the 4477th flew. Bond insisted on flying the MiG-23 BN fighter-bomber after a cursory briefing over the cockpit rail, even though it was considered a difficult aircraft and pilots usually received several hours of ground instruction before flying it. On his second high-speed flight, he was flying at 40,000 feet and over Mach 2, and had left the T-38 <b>chase</b> <b>plane</b> that was flying with him far behind, when a hydro-mechanical inhibitor activated, preventing him from disengaging the afterburner. It was designed to avoid sudden shut-downs at high speed that could damage the Tumansky R-29 engine, or even cause it to explode and destroy the aircraft. At such speeds, with the wings fully swept back to 72°, the MiG had very limited pitch authority and was inclined to yaw and roll. Bond lost control, made a distress call ("I gotta get out of here") and was then killed in the ejection, when the slipstream broke his neck and shredded the canopy of his parachute. The aircraft crashed in the desert, diving in at a 60° angle and impacting on what is now known as Jackass Flats, part of Area 25 that was still contaminated from NERVA nuclear rocket testing years before. Bond's body was discovered by a USAF sergeant on his way to work, who removed the rank insignia from Bond's flight suit with a pocket knife before going to get help.|$|E

50|$|The {{engine was}} first flown in the Teledyne Ryan YQM-98 Compass Cope R high {{altitude}} UAV, as the YF104-GA-100.

50|$|The A-7s {{were used}} as a {{deception}} and training aircraft by the group between 1981 and 1989. It was selected because it demanded a similar pilot workload expected in the F-117A, was single seat, {{and many of the}} F-117A pilots had F-4 or F-111 backgrounds. A-7s were used for pilot training before any F-117As had been delivered, to bring all pilots to a common flight training base line. Later, the A-7s {{were used as}} <b>chase</b> <b>planes</b> on F-117A tests and other weapon tests at the Nellis Range.|$|R
50|$|Scaled Composites again courted {{publicity}} {{by announcing}} in advance the final test flight, SpaceShipOne flight 15P, {{intended to be}} the program's first spaceflight. About 11,000 people went to Mojave Spaceport to watch the flight, which was also televised. The flight was run as an airshow, with both the principal craft and the <b>chase</b> <b>planes</b> making takeoffs and landings {{in front of the}} crowd, and celebratory flybys when the test succeeded. The flight was not only a technical success but also a popular success, stimulating intense public interest in spaceflight.|$|R
