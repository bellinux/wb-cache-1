The Speaker's official duties include maintaining order in the House, recognizing members during debate, appointing committee chairs and determining the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>committees,</b> and determining which committee has jurisdiction over which bill.

Election of the People's Deputy of Ukraine to a committee takes place based on propositions of parliamentary factions registered in compliance with quotas defined by the parliamentary regulations (Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada). If the number of parliamentary faction's members of Verkhovna Rada is equal to the number of committees or is bigger than the number of committees the parliamentary factions send no less than one representative to each committee of the Supreme Council of Ukraine.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, President Obama and the {{governors}} of Maryland and Pennsylvania independently formed committees to provide advice about all aspects of fracking. A study conducted on {{the composition of the}} advisory committees of the Marcellus Shale gas area showed that no member of these committees had public health expertise and that among 51 members of the committees, no member had expertise in environmental public health, even after enlarging the category of experts to “include medical and health professionals who could be presumed to have some health background related to environmental health, however minimal”. This cannot be explained by the purpose of the committee since all three executive orders of the different committees mentioned environmental public health related issues. The authors found that a quarter of the opposed comments mentioned the possibility of bias in favor of gas industries in the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>committees.</b> The authors concluded that political leaders did not want to raise public health concerns that could handicap further economic development due to fracking.|$|E

5000|$|Issues {{also exist}} {{regarding}} the way risk assessment is conducted {{and whether it}} reflects some interests more than others. Firstly, an issue exists about whether risk assessment authorities are able to judge the impact of hydraulic fracturing in public health. A study conducted on the advisory committees of the Marcellus Shale gas area [...] has shown that not a single member of these committees had public health expertise and that some concern existed about whether the commissions were not biased in their composition. Indeed, among 51 members of the committees, {{there is no evidence}} that a single one has any expertise in environmental public health, even after enlarging the category of experts to [...] "include medical and health professionals who could be presumed to have some health background related to environmental health, however minimal". This cannot be explained by the purpose of the committee since all three executive orders of the different committees mentioned environmental public health related issues. Another finding of the authors is that a quarter of the opposed comments mentioned the possibility of bias in favor of gas industries in the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>committees.</b> The authors conclude saying that political leaders may not want to raise public health concerns not to handicap further economic development due to hydraulic fracturing.|$|E

There is an even number of decision makers at each of various skill levels and each committee has an odd number of members. Surprisingly, even with the symmetric assumptions {{in the spirit of}} Condorcet, a symmetric <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>committees</b> is not always optimal. In other words, decision makers with different skill levels should not generally be evenly divided among the committees.

40|$|This paper studies how {{the gender}} <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>committees</b> affects promotions. We exploit {{evidence}} from a large-scale randomized natural experiment: {{the system of}} centralized examinations to determine academic promotions that was implemented in Spain between 2002 and 2006. These competitions involved around 30, 000 candidacies and 7, 000 (randomly selected) evaluators. In exams to full professor positions, we find that evaluators tend to favor same-sex candidates who belong to their own academic network. This evidence {{is consistent with the}} existence of old boys and old girls networks. In exams to associate professor positions, senior evaluators do not exhibit any gender preference. Female junior evaluators exhibit an opposite-sex preference when assessing candidates from their own institution, perhaps for strategic reasons. Our results suggest that gender quotas may not necessarily increase female representation. Their effect will depend {{on the extent to which}} academic networks are gendered, evaluators’ strategic concerns, and the position at stake...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} whether {{the manipulation of}} committee sizes {{can serve as a}} strategic tool of the majority party to further its influence over policy outcomes in the US House. Previous research notes the influence of the majority party’s preferences on the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>committees</b> but takes the size of committees as exogenous. We argue that the determination of sizes is an important first step and potential tool to shape committee composition, given vacancy constraints like the property rights norm. Using assignment and revealed legislator ideology data from the 80 th to 111 th Congresses, our results support this view of strategic expansion as a majority party strategy particularly for ‘‘prestige committees,’’ which are most central to a party’s agenda. Expansion indeed results in committees that are ideologically closer to the majority caucus median. Keywords committee expansion, legislative organization, party control As levels of partisanship in the US Congress have steeply increased over the past few decades, congressional scholars have turned to explaining the causes and consequences of such growth.

40|$|In {{representative}} democracies, citizens give politicians {{the authority}} {{to decide on the}} implementation of a variety of policies. Delegation has clear advantages in terms of benefits of specialization. However, delegation may create agency problems between citizens and their politicians. Politicians may exert too little effort, implement inefficient policies, extract rents, or otherwise perform badly. In this thesis, principal-agent problems between citizens and politicians are central to the analysis. The main objective is to explain several institutional arrangements, observed in governments, {{in the light of the}} agency problems. The agency problems between voters and politicians are characterized by two essential ingredients. First, politicians are often better informed about the effects of public policies than the electorate. Second, the preferences of politicians are not necessarily aligned with the preferences of the electorate. We examine how the selection of politicians as well as some regulations governing politicians’ actions helps to reduce the incidence of policy failures. Each chapter focuses on a different component of the political decision making process. In the first chapter, we consider the interaction between different types of politicians in electoral competition. We show why a political culture may be self-reinforcing. The second chapter shows why there is a strong incentive for a leader in office to replace a critical member of parliament. The third chapter tries to provide an explanation for the observed variety in the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>committees</b> in U. S. Congress. Finally, the last chapter provides a rationale for the sequential nature of information collection in advocacy systems...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the role <b>of</b> <b>committees</b> in collective decision-making processes in a world where agents must be motivated to collect information. Committees improve the quality of decision-making by providing information and by coordinating the collection of information. We address two types of questions. First, how does the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> a <b>committee</b> affect final decisions? Second, what is the optimal <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> a <b>committee</b> from the decision maker's point of view? As to the latter question, we show that the cost of information collection plays an important role. If this cost is low, then the preferences <b>of</b> the <b>committee</b> members should be aligned to those of the decision maker. Members with similar preferences as the decision maker collect the proper pieces of information. Moreover, manipulation of information does not occur if the preferences of the decision maker and the members are consonant. If the cost of searching is high, then the committee should be composed of members with polarized preferences. Outliers have a strong incentive to search for information...|$|R
