40|$|International audienceA {{number of}} cirrus ice <b>crystal</b> {{scattering}} <b>models</b> are tested using measurements of total reflectance and polarised reflectance {{obtained from the}} space-based polarisation and directionality of Earth's reflectances (POLDER) instrument. In this paper, 1 day of global POLDER data is utilised taken from the 25 June 2003 to test the assumed ice <b>crystal</b> <b>models.</b> The POLDER instrument is able to test the validity of various ice <b>crystal</b> <b>models</b> since it can measure the total reflectance and polarised reflectance at up to 14 different viewing directions almost simultaneously between the scattering angles of about 60 - 180 °. It is found that ice <b>crystal</b> <b>models</b> that are randomised (in this case the randomisation element is through distortion) from some pristine ice crystal geometry best fit simultaneous measurements of total and polarised reflectance. The optimal distortion parameter that best describes the POLDER measurements {{is found to be}} 0. 40, which has been applied to a randomly oriented six-branched bullet-rosette and randomly oriented chain-like aggregate. Moreover, distorted ice crystals that have undergone significant distortions beyond 0. 40 may fit the total reflectance measurements but not the polarisation measurements. Therefore, total reflectance measurements by themselves do not provide sufficient information to constrain assumed complex/distorted ice <b>crystal</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

50|$|Sakharov {{observed}} that many condensed matter systems {{give rise to}} emergent phenomena that are analogous to general relativity. For example, crystal defects can look like curvature and torsion in an Einstein-Cartan spacetime. This allows one to create a theory of gravity with torsion from a World <b>Crystal</b> <b>model</b> of spacetime in which the lattice spacing is {{of the order of}} a Planck length.Sakharov's idea was to start with an arbitrary background pseudo-Riemannian manifold (in modern treatments, possibly with torsion) and introduce quantum fields (matter) on it but not introduce any gravitational dynamics explicitly. This gives rise to an effective action which to one-loop order contains the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. In other words, general relativity arises as an emergent property of matter fields and is not put in by hand. On the other hand, such models typically predict huge cosmological constants.|$|E
