40|$|The article {{considers}} the traditional economic theory {{of international trade}} based {{on the concept of}} <b>comparative</b> <b>costs.</b> Thus countries will export products in which they have advantages in <b>comparative</b> factor <b>cost</b> terms and import those in which other countries have such advantages. It notes that this theory needs to be applied with caution in the modern world. Firstly, advanced factors of production like the educational infrastructure may be more important than the traditional factors of land, labour and capital. Secondly, branded goods distort trade patterns, since they sell on perceived brand value rather than on cost plus. The economic theory of <b>comparative</b> <b>costs</b> still influences where multinationals choose to locate their activities, and still determines prices for commodities. However, international trade in branded goods now takes place in conditions in which <b>comparative</b> <b>costs</b> of factors of production, whether advanced or traditional, may play quite a minor par...|$|R
6000|$|Here England has the {{advantage}} over Sweden in both cotton and [...] iron, since she can produce x yards of cotton in ten days’ labor [...] to fifteen days in Sweden, and y cwts. of iron in twelve days’ [...] labor to fifteen days in Sweden. The ship which takes x yards of [...] cotton to Sweden, and there exchanges it, as may be done, for y [...] cwts. of iron, brings back to England that which cost Sweden [...] fifteen days’ labor, while the cotton with which the iron was [...] bought cost England only ten days’ labor.

60|$|In {{the case}} of these {{domestic}} manufactures, the <b>comparative</b> <b>cost</b> of production, on which the interchange between countries depends, is much lower than {{in proportion to the}} quantity of labor employed. The work-people, looking to the earnings of their loom for a part only, if for any part, of their actual maintenance, can afford to work for a less remuneration than the lowest rate of wages which can permanently exist in the employments by which the laborer has to support the whole expense of a family. Working, as they do, not for an employer but for themselves, they may be said to carry on the manufacture at no cost at all, except the small expense of a loom and of the material; and the limit of possible cheapness is not the necessity of living by their trade, but that of earning enough by the work to make that social employment of their leisure hours not disagreeable.|$|E

60|$|Let us {{revert to}} our old example, {{and to our}} old figures. Suppose that the trade between England and Germany in cloth and linen is established, and {{that the rate of}} {{interchange}} is 10 yards of cloth for 17 of linen. Now suppose that there arises in another country, in Flanders, for example, a linen manufacture; and that the same causes, the working of which in England and Germany has made 10 yards exchange for 17, would in England and Flanders, putting Germany out of the question, have made the rate of interchange 10 for 18. It is evident that Germany also must give 18 yards of linen for 10 of cloth, and so carry on the trade with a diminished share of the advantage, or lose it altogether. If the play of demand in England and Flanders had made the rate of interchange not 10 for 18 but 10 for 21, (10 to 20 being in Germany the <b>comparative</b> <b>cost</b> of production,) it is evident that Germany could not have maintained the competition, and would have lost, not part of her share of the advantage, but all advantage, and the trade itself.|$|E

6000|$|As I {{have said}} elsewhere(260) after Ricardo (the thinker {{who has done}} most toward {{clearing}} up this subject),(261) “it is not {{a difference in the}} absolute cost of production which determines the interchange, but a difference in the <b>comparative</b> <b>cost.</b> It may be to our advantage to procure iron from Sweden in exchange for cottons, even although the mines of England as well as her manufactories should be more productive than those of Sweden; for if we have an advantage of one half in cottons, and only an advantage of a quarter in iron, and could sell our cottons to Sweden at the price which Sweden must pay for them if she produced them herself, we should obtain our iron with an advantage [over Sweden] of one half, as well as our cottons. We may often, by trading with foreigners, obtain their commodities at a smaller expense of labor and capital than they cost to the foreigners themselves.

60|$|Whether {{agricultural}} produce increases in absolute {{as well as}} <b>comparative</b> <b>cost</b> of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agencies—increase of population and improvement in agricultural skill. In some, perhaps in most, states of society (looking at the whole surface of the earth), both agricultural skill and population are either stationary, or increase very slowly, {{and the cost of}} production of food, therefore, is nearly stationary. In a society which is advancing in wealth, population generally increases faster than agricultural skill, and food consequently tends to become more costly; but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement. Such an impulse has shown itself in Great Britain during the last fifteen or twenty years [before 1847]. In England and Scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population, insomuch that food and other {{agricultural produce}}, notwithstanding the increase of people, can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago; and the abolition of the Corn Laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement. In some other countries, and particularly in France, the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population, because though agriculture, except in a few provinces, advances slowly, population advances still more slowly, and even with increasing slowness, its growth being kept down, not by poverty, which is diminishing, but by prudence.|$|E
60|$|If wages, {{in any of}} the {{departments}} of industry which supply exports, are kept, artificially or by some accidental cause, below the general rate of wages in the country, this is a real advantage in the foreign market. It lessens the <b>comparative</b> <b>cost</b> of production of those articles in relation to others, and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor. Take, for instance, the case of the United States in respect to certain commodities. In that country tobacco and cotton, two great articles of export, are produced by slave-labor, while food and manufactures generally are produced by free laborers, who either work on their own account or are paid by wages. In spite of the inferior efficiency of slave-labor, there can be no reasonable doubt that, {{in a country where the}} wages of free labor are so high, the work executed by slaves is a better bargain to the capitalist. To whatever extent it is so, this smaller cost of labor, being not general, but limited to those employments, is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products, both in the home and in the foreign market, as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor. If the slaves in the Southern States were emancipated, and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in America, that country might be obliged to erase some of the slave-grown articles from the catalogue of its exports, and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price. Their cheapness is partly an artificial cheapness, which may be compared to that produced by a bounty on production or on exportation; or, considering the means by which it is obtained, an apter comparison would be with the cheapness of stolen goods.|$|E

Therefore, we are fairly confident in drawing the conclusion that for our country sample, net trade {{does not seem to be}} explained by <b>comparative</b> <b>costs,</b> technical differences, or scale economies.

60|$|He shewed, {{that the}} {{advantage}} of an interchange of commodities between nations consists simply and solely in this, that it enables each to obtain, with a given amount of labour and capital, a greater quantity of all commodities taken together. This it accomplishes by enabling each, with a quantity of one commodity which has cost it so much labour and capital, to purchase a quantity of another commodity which, if produced at home, would have required labour and capital to a greater amount. To render the importation of an article more advantageous than its production, {{it is not necessary}} that the foreign country should be able to produce it with less labour and capital than ourselves. We may even have a positive advantage in its production: but, if we are so far favoured by circumstances as to have a still greater positive advantage in the production of some other article which is in demand in the foreign country, {{we may be able to}} obtain a greater return to our labour and capital by employing none of it in producing the article in which our advantage is least, but devoting it all to the production of that in which our advantage is greatest, and giving this to the foreign country in exchange for the other. It is not a difference in the absolute cost of production, which determines the interchange, but a difference in the <b>comparative</b> <b>cost.</b> It may be to our advantage to procure iron from Sweden in exchange for cottons, even although the mines of England as well as her manufactories should be more productive than those of Sweden; for if we have an advantage of one-half in cottons, and only an advantage of a quarter in iron, and could sell our cottons to Sweden at the price which Sweden must pay for them if she produced them herself, we should obtain our iron with an advantage of one-half, as well as our cottons. We may often, by trading with foreigners, obtain their commodities at a smaller expense of labour and capital than they cost to the foreigners themselves. The bargain is still advantageous to the foreigner, because the commodity which he receives in exchange, though it has cost us less, would have cost him more. As often as a country possesses two commodities, one of which it can produce with less labour, comparatively to what it would cost in a foreign country, than the other; so often it is the interest of the country to export the first mentioned commodity and to import the second; even though it might be able to produce both the one and the other at a less expense of labour than the foreign country can produce them, but not less in the same degree; or might be unable to produce either except at a greater expense, but not greater in the same degree.|$|E
