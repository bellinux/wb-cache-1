Among weather disasters, drought {{plays a major role in}} large-scale crop losses. This paper discusses utility of operational satellite-based vegetation health (VH) indices for modelling <b>cereal</b> <b>yield</b> and for early warning of drought-related crop losses. The indices were tested in Saratov oblast (SO), one of the principal grain growing regions of Russia. Correlation and regression analysis were applied to model <b>cereal</b> <b>yield</b> from VH indices during 1982 – 2001. A strong correlation between mean SO's <b>cereal</b> <b>yield</b> and VH indices were found during the critical period of cereals, which starts two–three weeks before and ends two–three weeks after the heading stage. Several models were constructed where VH indices served as independent variables (predictors). The models were validated independently based on SO <b>cereal</b> <b>yield</b> during 1982 – 2012. Drought-related <b>cereal</b> <b>yield</b> losses can be predicted three months in advance of harvest and six–eight months in advance of official grain production statistic is released.

40|$|The key {{hypothesis}} of policy-makers during the 1980 s was that raising tubewell density would trigger agrarian upsurge in Bihar {{as it did}} in Punjab, Haryana and western UP.

Examining some medium and long-run factors that explain the evolution of food production, with special focus on cereals, using data of the World Bank for the last 45 years, and a regression for a cross-section of 106 countries, we show that: a) the capacity to feed a growing population has been associated to a sustained increase in productivity, measured by the <b>cereal</b> <b>yields</b> b) the increase in <b>cereal</b> <b>yields</b> is negatively associated to the increase in land under cereal production c) there is large room to go on increasing cereal production and productivity in low and middle-income countries, profiting from the productivity gap that differentiate them from the high-income countries.

40|$|In cereal {{production}} on stockless organic farms, green manure (GM) {{is commonly used}} to improve soil fertility. The clover-grass swards are mown frequently and the herbage is commonly mulched. The {{purpose of this study}} was to increase knowledge of the N-dynamics in such rotations, in order to suggest methods for improving N efficiency and thus organic <b>cereal</b> <b>yields.</b> The hypothesis was that spring application of biogas residue from anaerobic digestion of GM herbage increases the N uptake and yield of a subsequent barley crop, compared with repeatedly in situ mulching of the same GM herbage in the preceding season. The effect of various GM treatments on spring barley yields and nitrogen dynamics was investigated, at four sites differing in soil and climatic conditions. The results suggest that, under the Norwegian climate, mulching of GM herbage can increase <b>cereal</b> <b>yields</b> compared to its removal, depending on soil type and rotation history. However, the use of GM herbage for biogas production appears to be much more N-efficient on farm level.

Empirical orthogonal functions and correlation analyses were applied to regional and large-scale climate variables to ascertain the links between climate and winter <b>cereal</b> <b>yield.</b> Interactions between climate and winter cereal productivity in Spain can be summarized as follows: {{the start of the}} growing season depends on minimum temperature, and crop maturity is affected by drought, maximum temperature, sea-level air pressure, moisture fluxes, and the jet stream, as well as by indices of the Scandinavian Pattern, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Southern Oscillation. A statistical approach has been derived to describe variability in cereal productivity in Spain taking into account the previous potential predictors.

40|$|In {{the local}} {{agriculture}} of the West African Sudanian and Sahelian savanna zones, the major cereal crops are grown in patterns {{closely linked to}} major toposequence land types. Moreover, crops are commonly grown in intercrop combinations of which cereal/cowpea is the most widespread. The present series of experiments investigates the impact of cereal density and of a cowpea intercrop on the grain yields of maize, sorghum, pearl millet, and several introduced sorghum genotypes. In all the studies, a spreading and photosensitive local cowpea cultivar was used. In some seasons, even a low cowpea intercrop density of 5000 plants/ha could significantly reduce sorghum and maize yields on moisture-stressed soils, whilst with adequate soil moisture <b>cereal</b> <b>yields</b> were increased. The competitive effects of the cowpea intercrop, particularly on drought sensitive lands, were enhanced by increasing cowpea density, by lowering cereal density, by sorghum cultivars with relatively open leaf canopies (e. g., the local Guiniensis types) and by a relatively high phosphate status of the soil. Because of the unpredictability of rainfall during the growth season and large local variations in soil fertility, high densities of cowpea and <b>cereal</b> would increase <b>yield</b> variation between locations and between years which is not beneficial for subsistence farmers.
