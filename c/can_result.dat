5|$|Aberrations in {{prenatal}} development <b>can</b> <b>result</b> {{in various}} forms of thyroid dysgenesis which can cause congenital hypothyroidism, and if untreated {{this can lead to}} cretinism.|$|E
5|$|Alter {{substrate}} or ligand binding. Circularly permuting {{a protein}} <b>can</b> <b>result</b> {{in the loss}} of substrate binding, but can occasionally lead to novel ligand binding activity or altered substrate specificity.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in myxedema and severe cases <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in myxedema coma.|$|E
5000|$|Heart valves: Stenosis <b>can</b> <b>results</b> {{from the}} {{increased}} rigidity of the connective tissue {{as well as}} chronic inflammation.|$|R
50|$|Surgery <b>can</b> rarely <b>result</b> in hypoparathyroidism.|$|R
5000|$|Arterial damage — Arterial pseudoaneurysms may form at {{injection}} sites, which <b>can</b> rupture, potentially <b>resulting</b> in hemorrhage, distal ischemia, and gangrene. Inadvertent intra-arterial injection <b>can</b> also <b>result</b> in endarteritis and thrombosis, with ultimately similar consequences.|$|R
5|$|Another {{disorder}} {{is that of}} thyroid dysgenesis which <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in various presentations {{of one or more}} misplaced accessory thyroid glands. These can be asymptomatic.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the thyroid}} are functional–caused by {{dysfunction}} {{in the production}} of hormones, and nodes and tumors either benign or malignant. Functional disorders can cause inflammation as can some other forms of thyroiditis. Functional disorders <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in the overproduction or underproduction of hormones. Any of the functional thyroid disorders <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in the gland's enlargement and cause a swollen neck termed a goitre.|$|E
5|$|In Nigeria, {{at least}} half a million suffer from vaginal fistula, {{largely as a result of}} lack of medical care. Early marriages <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in fistula.|$|E
50|$|Extreme {{psychological}} stress <b>can</b> also <b>result</b> in periods stopping.|$|R
50|$|Droughts and {{overstocking}} <b>can</b> also <b>result</b> in inland fish kills.|$|R
50|$|In Oomycetes, oospores <b>can</b> also <b>result</b> from asexual reproduction, by apomixis.|$|R
5|$|Inhaling helium {{directly}} from pressurized cylinders or even balloon filling valves is extremely dangerous, as high flow rate and pressure <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in barotrauma, fatally rupturing lung tissue.|$|E
5|$|Like all livestock, Brumbies {{can carry}} the {{parasite}} Cryptosporidium parvum, which <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in serious gastroenteritis in people drinking contaminated drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Magpie attacks {{can cause}} injuries, {{typically}} wounds to the head, and being unexpectedly swooped while cycling <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in {{loss of control}} of the bicycle, which may cause injury.|$|E
5000|$|Ineffective or {{insufficient}} platelets <b>can</b> also <b>result</b> in coagulopathy (bleeding disorders).|$|R
30|$|Complex {{adaptive}} {{systems are}} subset of dynamic non-linear system (McDaniel and Driebe 2001). In non-linear agent interactions, the inputs are {{inversely proportional to}} output (Lansing 2003). In these amazing systems, small changes <b>can</b> <b>results</b> in a big change and vice versa. Mathematically, {{the behavior of the}} non-linear system can be described as non-linear polynomial equations.|$|R

5|$|Mercury {{poisoning}} <b>can</b> <b>result</b> {{from exposure}} to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury), by inhalation of mercury vapor, or by ingesting any form of mercury.|$|E
5|$|Reflections in {{more complex}} scenarios, such as {{found on a}} network of cables, <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in very {{complicated}} and long lasting waveforms on the cable. Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as they are known persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E
5|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} the result of a galactic {{collision}} that <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in the formation of an elliptical galaxy.|$|E
50|$|Many species <b>can</b> cross-fertilise, <b>resulting</b> {{in great}} {{morphological}} variety and complicating classification.|$|R

40|$|Diploma thesis {{describes}} {{analysis of}} influence of surface texturing on non-conformal rubbing surfaces. High speed camera {{was used to}} observe the effect of micro-dents of various depths on film thickness under pure rolling and rolling/sliding conditions. It can be concluded from the obtained results that micro-texture of suitable sizes <b>can</b> <b>results</b> in film thickness increase without lubrication film breakdown...|$|R
5|$|Toxic effects include {{damage to}} the brain, kidneys and lungs. Mercury {{poisoning}} <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in several diseases, including acrodynia (pink disease), Hunter-Russell syndrome, and Minamata disease.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery dissection, {{a tear in}} {{the arteries}} in the neck which provide blood to the brain <b>can</b> <b>result</b> from {{rotation}} of the neck while the neck is extended. This can occur {{in a variety of}} contexts, but is an event which could occur in some yoga practices. This is a very serious condition which <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in a stroke.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over {{a short period of}} time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.|$|E
50|$|Irish-born {{photographer}} Deirdre O'Callaghan {{spent four}} years spent photographing the men of Arlington House for a personal photographic project, and her first book, Hide That <b>Can,</b> <b>resulted.</b> Published in 2002 by Trolley in London, it was awarded Book of the Year by both the International Centre of Photography in New York and Les Rencontres de la Photographie in Arles.|$|R
50|$|The VCT {{can give}} false positives. If the shock {{the animals are}} {{receiving}} is too low, then animals might ignore the shock and continue to get food or water which <b>can</b> skew <b>results.</b> Drugs that increase thirst or appetite <b>can</b> give inconsistent <b>results.</b>|$|R
30|$|As we <b>can</b> see, the <b>results</b> <b>can</b> {{be stored}} by {{a table with}} the time slot index; {{according}} to this table, SUs can determine the optimal transmission power.|$|R
5|$|After a {{star has}} {{finished}} generating energy through thermonuclear fusion, it evolves {{into a more}} compact, degenerate state. During this process {{the dimensions of the}} star are significantly reduced, which <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in a corresponding increase in angular velocity.|$|E
5|$|Air can {{be trapped}} {{under the skin}} in necrotizing infections such as gangrene, {{occurring}} as a late sign in gas gangrene, {{of which it is}} the hallmark sign. Subcutaneous emphysema is also considered a hallmark of fournier gangrene. Symptoms of subcutaneous emphysema <b>can</b> <b>result</b> when infectious organisms produce gas by fermentation. When emphysema occurs due to infection, signs that the infection is systemic, i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location, are also present.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reports of}} {{poisoning}} in humans are rare, ingestion of ferric chloride <b>can</b> <b>result</b> in serious morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or misdiagnosis. Early diagnosis is important, especially in seriously poisoned patients.|$|E
