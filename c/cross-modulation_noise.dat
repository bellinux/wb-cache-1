40|$|In this paper, we have {{analyzed}} {{the level of}} cross-modulation moise required for CDMA mobile station and proposed a guideline for optimum design. From the analysis, the level of <b>cross-modulation</b> <b>noise</b> {{is determined by the}} system's noise figure(NF) and VCO's phase noise and there is a trade-off relationships between them. In addition, w have determined the value of LAN's IIP 3 and duplexer;s idolation to satusfy the above level in designing the system. Therefore, this paper will give a guideline for a selection of components in designing cdma 2000 mobile station. ope...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we have derived the Noise-Equation to {{determine}} the level of <b>cross-modulation</b> <b>noise</b> that is required for designing multi-band CDMA handset from IS- 98 standard. From this Noise-Equation, also we were able {{to determine}} each component's specification and forecast the performance(or margin) of designing handset. In conclusion, we have designed and implemented the multi-band CDMA handset of Qualcomm's Zero-IF structure and verified validity of the Noise-Equation. In result, we have got the result of ± 0. 5 ㏈ error between Noise-Equation and actual measurement. Therefore, this paper will give a guideline for design of the Multi-Band CDMA handset. ope...|$|E
40|$|Unbalanced quadriphase-shift-keying (QPSK) is an {{attractive}} means for transmitting two digital data streams which in general have different average powers, data rates, and data formats. Previous analyses of the tracking performance of Costas loop demodulators of unbalanced QPSK have accounted only for the filtering effect produced by the loop's two arm filters on the equivalent additive noise perturbing the loop. When the bandwidth of these filters is {{selected on the basis}} of the order of the data rate, as is typical of optimum Costas loop design, the filtering degradations of the data modulations themselves and the <b>cross-modulation</b> <b>noise</b> produced by their multiplication in the loop often cannot be neglected. The purpose of this paper is to incorporate these additional filtering effects into the analysis. Many of the results obtained herein are in the form of closed-form expressions which can easily be evaluated numerically for design and performance prediction purposes...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 77 - 79). Two gyro-interaction rocket {{experiments were}} {{performed in the}} lower ionosphere. The basic experimental procedure consists in the radiation of periodic pulses of gyrofrequency energy from a transmitter within the rocket payload. With {{the use of this}} technique, rate coefficients for two processes were evaluated. With a strong gyrofrequency pulse the local electron density is increased. The rate of removal of these excess electrons, which is believed to be due to attachment, was determined in the range of 45 to 65 km. When the gyrofrequency pulse is weak, the disturbance is only a slight increase of electron energy. This increases the collision frequency and hence affects the absorption of the sensing wave. The rate of loss of excess electron energy was determined by this method. At altitudes above the sensing wave reflection level <b>cross-modulation</b> of plasma <b>noise</b> was detected. An RF probe, with which the frequency dependence of the real part of the input impedance of an antenna was detected, was included in one experiment to measure electron density and collision frequency. In addition the data confirms some of the theoretical implications of Balmain's work. The device was designated a real impedance probe. (Author) ...|$|R
