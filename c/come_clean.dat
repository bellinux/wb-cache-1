500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{character}} development of Shane in the episode, {{as well as}} the execution of Otis. Nate Rawlings of Time felt that it was a dark moment for the series, and felt that it added anticipation to future development.

Given Rick’s extremely rigid morale [...] code and Shane’s now demonstrated willingness {{to do whatever it takes}} to survive, the showdown promises to be bigger than just a battle of two alpha males. The Rick/Shane divide is a battle of two leaders with different ideas of humanity and survival." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger opined that [...] "both the multi-layered opening [...] illustrates how Shane’s impulsive nature makes him a valuable if ruthless warrior." [...] Handlen appreciated the character development of Shane, writing, [...] "Shane has long been the dark horse of the group, the one most likely to go off the morality reservation, and this reveal works well to bring him that much closer to darkness. It's not the subtlest moment [...] but, given how friendly and cool Otis was, and given how well the two seemed to be working together, it's a strong twist." [...] He added that because of the death of Otis, the show now has a sense of direction. [...] "His decision to sacrifice Otis is easy enough to rationalize; somebody had to get back for Carl's sake, Shane was faster, and both of them probably weren't going to make it. That's the beauty of it. In a certain light, he made the right choice." [...] Morgan Jeffrey wrote: [...] "This week's installment delivered even more scares than usual — Shane's escape from the high school was almost unbearably tense." ...|$|E
