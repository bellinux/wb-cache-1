A technical limitation, particularly for genetic studies, is {{the method of}} direct observation used for quantifying this response, {{with the potential for}} bias or inconsistencies. We report the use of a computerized method based on latency between photobeam interruption measures as a reliable scoring criterion in mice. The different computer measures obtained during contextual fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>tests</b> showed high correlations with hand-scored freezing; r values ranged from 0. 87 to 0. 94. Previously reported strain differences between C 57 BL/ 6 J and DBA/ 2 J in context-dependent fear conditioning were also detected by the computer-based system. In addition, the use of computer-scored freezing of 199 (BALB/cJ × C 57 BL/ 6 J) F 2 mice enabled us to detect a suggestive gender-dependent chromosomal locus for contextual fear conditioning on distal chromosome 8 by QTL analysis.

40|$|Objective(s) Single {{injection}} of naloxone, a selective antagonist of morphine, {{prior to the}} drug <b>conditioning</b> <b>testing</b> was used to investigate on morphine dependence. Materials and Methods Conditioning to morphine (2. 5 - 10 mg/kg, s. c.) was established in adult male Wistar rats (weighing 200 - 250 g) using an unbiased procedure. Nitric oxide agents were microinjected into the central amygdala prior to naloxone-paired place <b>conditioning</b> <b>testing.</b> Results The results showed that morphine produced a significant dose-dependent place preference in animals. Naloxone (0. 1 - 0. 4 mg/kg, i. p.) injections pre-testing of the response to morphine (7. 5 mg/kg, s. c.) caused a significant aversion at the higher doses (0. 4 mg/kg, i. p.). This response was reversed by micro{{injection of}} L-arginine (0. 3 - 3 µg/rat, intra-central amygdala) prior to naloxone {{on the day of}} the testing. The response to L-arginine was blocked by pre-injection of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (intra-central amygdala). Conclusion A single injection of naloxone on the test day of morphine place conditioning may simply reveal the occurrence of morphine dependence in rats, and that the nitric oxide in the central amygdala most likely plays a key role in this phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of corrosion on fatigue design {{must be considered}} in numerous component parts in the automotive industry. By using appropriate coatings the negative {{influence of}} corrosion under static and cyclic loading can be suppressed. Using the aluminum cast alloy AlSi 7 Mg 0, 3 T 6 as an example, selected material-coating-systems were to be characterized under mechanical-thermal-corrosive complex loadings and characteristic properties for the fatigue design under cyclic loadings were to be determined. <b>Conditioning</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out with uncoated, anodized and chemical-nickel-plated specimen at different temperatures in the media fuel E 5 (fuel with 5 % ethanol added) and E 10 (fuel with 10 % ethanol added) and followed by SEM examined. The cyclic fatigue tests with chemically-nickel-plated and tempered aluminum in the fuel E 5 at 100 °C no reduced influence on the fatigue strength, within the scattering, was discerned. This result agrees with the <b>conditioning</b> <b>tests</b> in the fuel E 5 at 100 °C, where no corrosion was observed. Despite the coating of the specimens salt spray fog leads to a clear reduction in the fatigue strength. Using a damage accumulation calculation, it could be shown, that the real damage sum of the callipers and specimens, despite different types of coating, are comparable...|$|R

5000|$|The {{auditory}} sensitivity thresholds {{have been}} measured behaviorally for one individual young female Indian elephant. The <b>conditioning</b> <b>test</b> for sensitivity requires the elephant {{to respond to}} a stimulus by pressing a button with its trunk, which results in a sugar water reward if the elephant correctly identified the appropriate stimulus occurrence. To determine auditory sensitivity thresholds, a certain frequency of sound is presented at various intensities to see at which intensity the stimulus ceases to evoke a response. The auditory sensitivity curve of this particular elephant began at 16 Hz with a threshold of 65 dB. A shallow slope decreased to the best response at 1 kHz with a threshold of 8 dB, followed by a steep threshold increase above 4 kHz. According to the 60 dB cut-off, the upper limit was 10.5 kHz with absolutely no detectable response at 14 kHz. [...] The upper limit for humans is considered to be 18 kHz. The upper and lower limits of elephant hearing are the lowest measured for any animals aside from the pigeon. By contrast, the average best frequency for animal hearing is 9.8 kHz, the average upper limit is 55 kHz.|$|E
50|$|In {{experiments}} using heart-rate conditioning, Pigeons {{have been}} found to be able to detect sounds in the infrasonic range at frequencies as low as 0.5 Hz. For frequencies below 10 Hz, the pigeon threshold is at about 55 dB which is at least 50 dB more sensitive than humans. Pigeons are able to discriminate small frequency differences in sounds at between 1 Hz and 20 Hz, with sensitivity ranging from a 1% shift at 20 Hz to a 7% shift at 1 Hz. Sensitivities are measured through a heart-rate <b>conditioning</b> <b>test.</b> In this test, an anesthetized bird is presented with a single sound or a sequence of sounds, followed by an electric shock. The bird’s heart-rate will increase in anticipation of a shock. Therefore, a measure of the heart-rate can determine whether the bird is able to distinguish between stimuli that would be followed by a shock from stimuli that would not. Similar methods have also been used to determine the pigeon’s sensitivity to barometric pressure changes, polarized light, and UV light. These experiments were conducted in sound isolation chambers to avoid the influence of ambient noise. Infrasonic stimuli are hard to produce and are often transmitted through a filter that attenuates higher frequency components. Also, the tone burst stimuli used in these experiments were presented with stimulus onset and offsets ramped on and off gradually in order to prevent initial turn-on and turn-off transients.|$|E
