50|$|Common mode failure, or <b>common</b> <b>cause,</b> <b>failure</b> {{has a more}} {{specific}} meaning in engineering. It refers to events which are not statistically independent. That is, failures in multiple parts of a system caused by a single fault, particularly random failures due to environmental conditions or aging. An example is {{when all of the}} pumps for a fire sprinkler system are located in one room. If the room becomes too hot for the pumps to operate, they will all fail at essentially the same time, from one cause (the heat in the room). Another example is an electronic system wherein a fault in a power supply injects noise onto a supply line, causing failures in multiple subsystems.|$|E

From the investigation, four core {{aspects of the}} definition for the <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> are extracted, and improved classifications for root causes and coupling factors of the <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> are suggested. This thesis also explores a framework {{for the inclusion of}} the impact of the <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> in risk and reliability evaluations. From the investigation of the framework, the relationship among definition of the <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure,</b> causes of the <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure,</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> parametric model, parameter estimation and system model is provided. Especially, this thesis focuses on the <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> parametric model that is used to quantify <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> effect on the risk assessment. The thesis investigates popular <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> parametric models (Beta Factor model, Alpha Factor model, Multiple Greek Letter model, and Multiple Beta Factor model.), and discusses their features. After the investigation of <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> parametric model, this thesis focuses on the Beta Factor Model and its parameter estimation. For the parameter estimation, two conventional approaches (data based and checklist based) and a relatively new approach (PDS method) are presented. The main contribution of this thesis is ⅰ) to identify challenges of the PDS estimator in the PDS method and ⅱ) to suggest improved approach for determining the value of PDS estimator. This thesis identifies underlying assumptions and constraints in PDS estimators, and proposes improved approach to determine CCF group size. Case study is conducted to apply this improved approach. This new approach is realized as a computer program using Microsoft Excel and its embedded Visual Basic, so that the industries can easily use the new approach...|$|E

40|$|As {{the nuclear}} weapon {{stockpile}} ages, there is increased concern about common degradation ultimately leading to <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> of multiple weapons that could significantly impact reliability or safety. Current acceptable limits for {{the reliability and}} safety of a weapon are based on upper limits on the probability of failure of an individual item, assuming that failures among items are independent. We expanded the current acceptable limits to apply to situations with <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure.</b> Then, we developed a simple screening process to quickly assess the importance of observed common degradation for both reliability and safety to determine if further action is necessary. The screening process conservatively assumes that common degradation is <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure.</b> For a population with between 100 and 5000 items we applied the screening process and conclude the following. In general, for a reliability requirement specified in the Military Characteristics (MCs) for a specific weapon system, common degradation is of concern if more than 100 (1 -x) % of the weapons are susceptible to common degradation, where x is the required reliability expressed as a fraction. Common degradation is {{of concern for the}} safety of a weapon subsystem if more than 0. 1 % of the population is susceptible to common degradation. Common degradation is of concern for the safety of a weapon component or overall weapon system if two or more components/weapons in the population are susceptible to degradation. Finally, we developed a technique for detailed evaluation of common degradation leading to <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> for situations that are determined to be of concern using the screening process. The detailed evaluation requires that best estimates of common cause and independent failure probabilities be produced. Using these techniques, observed common degradation can be evaluated for effects on reliability and safety...|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} qualitative {{result of}} fault trees is the minimal cut set (MCS) for top event failure to occur.

An MCS having events with identical characteristics are susceptible to <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failures.</b> Through a quantitative evaluation the dominant cut sets with the highest risk contribution can be identified (Stamatelatos et al. 2002 b).

40|$|The use {{of smart}} sensors in highly {{critical}} (safety) applications {{is still being}} debated. In this paper, we compare the dependability aspects of deploying smart sensors vs. conventional ones using an FMEA. There appear to be some significant differences. Some failure modes do not exist in conventional sensors, e. g. those involving information overload and timing aspects. Other failure modes emerge {{through the use of}} different technologies, e. g. those involving complexity, data integrity and human interface. When using smart sensors we suggest the use of a set of guidelines for their deployment: 1. Do not send data to the smart sensor. 2. Use the smart sensor in burst mode only. 3. Use a smart sensor with the least possible number of operational modes. 4. Use the simplest possible sensor for the application. In redundant sensor configurations, <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> becomes the dominant failure scenario. The failure modes of smart sensors suggest that smart sensors might be more susceptible to <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure</b> than conventional ones. Dominant are failures having their origin in the human interface, complexity and information overload. The guidelines given will also reduce the probability of <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>failure.</b> In redundant sensor configurations a possible design method is the use of diversity. Diversity has the advantage that it can reduce the probability that two or more sensors fail simultaneously, although this effect is limited by the fact that diverse sensors may still contain the same faults. A disadvantage of diversity can be the increased complexity of maintenance, which in itself can lead to a higher probability of failure of the smart sensors. Whether the use of diversity is advisable depends on the design of the smart sensors and the details of their application. ...|$|E
