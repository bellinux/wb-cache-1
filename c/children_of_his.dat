5|$|By 1869 Calcraft's mother, Sarah, {{was living}} as a pauper in a workhouse at Hatfield Peverel near Chelmsford. Calcraft was ordered to pay 3shillings a week towards her upkeep, to which he objected, arguing that his brother and sister {{should be made to}} help, and that he had three <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own to support, {{although}} there is no record of his marriage.|$|E

5|$|In {{another version}} of the story, the king adopted all of the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sister Rangorimanana. He then devised a test to {{determine}} which one would succeed him. He requested his messengers to bring the children a package including lemons, meat, honey, rice, milk and a reed, and to note which child took the reed and stood near the central pillar of the house; this child was Rakotomavo.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} life, Richard Gibbs {{recognised}} that the diverse {{interests of the}} large family, {{and the need to}} invest heavily in even basic refurbishment of the house to make it weather-secured and habitable, would require the family to sell Tyntesfield. Recognising also that substantial death duties would become payable on his death, Richard drew up a will based around a trust that would allow his fortune to pass to the surviving <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother and half sister, a total of 19 beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|On 30 December 1915, Natal {{was lying}} in the Cromarty Firth with her squadron, {{under the command of}} Captain Eric Back. The captain was hosting a film party aboard and had invited the wives and <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> officers, one {{civilian}} friend and his family, and nurses from the nearby hospital ship Drina to attend.

5|$|During her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth {{was third}} {{in the line of}} {{succession}} to the throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father, the Duke of York. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young. Many people believed that he would marry and have <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own. When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis. Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became heir presumptive. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession.|$|E
5|$|Having no <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own, David adopted his kinsman, {{the young}} prince Bagrat, {{heir to the}} Bagratid throne of Kartli (Iberia). He did so {{at the request of}} the {{energetic}} Georgian nobleman Iovane Marushis-dze. Through his fortunate bloodlines Bagrat was destined to sit upon two thrones. Furthermore, through his mother Gurandukht, sister of the childless Abkhazian king Theodosius III, Bagrat was a potential heir to the realm of Abkhazia. Making a plan for the creation of an all-Georgian state, David occupied Kartli for his foster-son in 976 and repulsed the troops from the easternmost Georgian kingdom of Kakheti, which had recently occupied the western sector of Kartli with its rock-hewn city of Uplistsikhe. Two years later, in 978, David and Marushis-dze secured the crown of Abkhazia for Bagrat by displacing Theodosius III.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico on 20August 1966, Lerew married Josephine Henriette Oude Reimerink, a Dutch {{national}} {{he had met}} {{three years}} earlier. He was promoted ICAO's Chief of Flight Branch in April 1969, in which capacity he served until retiring from the organisation in 1972. In retirement, Lerew and his wife restored houses and travelled extensively. Their expeditions resulted in two narrow escapes, in December 1974 when they tired of the oppressively humid weather in Darwin and left just before Cyclone Tracy struck on Christmas Day, and in February 1976 {{when they decided to}} camp well away from Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, which was devastated soon after by an earthquake that left over 22,000 people dead. The couple eventually settled in Vancouver, where John Lerew died of cancer on 24February 1996, aged eighty-three. He was survived by Josephine and the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first marriage.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was further aggravated {{by the absence}} of a clear successor, made more pressing because of Nerva's old age and sickness. He had no natural <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own and only distant relatives, who were unsuited for political office. A successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the Empire and it appears that, by 97, Nerva was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius Nigrinus Curiatius Maternus, the powerful governor of Syria. This was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Marcus Ulpius Traianus, commonly known as Trajan, a general of the armies at the German frontier.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs {{sometimes}} went {{to great}} lengths to prevent this. On her marriage to Louis XIV of France, Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV of Spain, was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne. When monarchs or heirs apparent wed other monarchs or heirs, special agreements, sometimes in the form of treaties, were negotiated to determine inheritance rights. The marriage contract of Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England, for example, stipulated that the maternal possessions, as well as Burgundy and the Low Countries, were to pass to any future children of the couple, whereas the remaining paternal possessions (including Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan) would first of all go to Philip's son Don Carlos, from his previous marriage to Maria Manuela of Portugal. If Carlos were to die without any descendants, only then would they pass to the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> second marriage. On the other hand, the Franco-Scottish treaty that arranged the 1558 marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Francis, the son and heir of Henry II of France, had it that if the queen died without descendants, Scotland would fall to the throne of France.|$|E

25|$|Though {{he always}} hoped {{to return to}} his beloved Welgelegen, Henry died childless in London in 1811, leaving a capital of 12 million guilders, an art collection, and several large properties. He was a generous uncle to his many nieces and nephews in London, Heemstede, and Pennsylvania. On his death, his {{accumulated}} wealth was split between the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cousin Jan (who inherited Deepdene), the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cousin Maria (who inherited Hope Lodge), and the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sister Harriet (who inherited villa Welgelegen). Before his death, he commissioned a family portrait with his sister Harriet and the family of his adopted son John Williams Hope and Harriet's daughter Ann. The painting, by Benjamin West, shows a model of Welgelegen that sits above a mahogany chest, probably designed by Thomas Hope. The painting currently hangs in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. A fitting place, since it is built itself in the neo-classical style and is so close to where Harriet and Henry were born, in Braintree.|$|E
