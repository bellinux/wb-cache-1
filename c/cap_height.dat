5|$|Some {{distinctive}} {{characteristics in}} Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' {{with a small}} eye and the bowl of the 'a' which has a sharp hook upwards at top left. Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters {{on the model of}} Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the <b>cap</b> <b>height.</b> The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the bottom right of the italic 'h' bends inwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{handwriting}} {{found in}} New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often {{written in a}} distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between uncial script (or majuscule) and minuscule. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the baseline and the <b>cap</b> <b>height,</b> while the minuscule letters had ascenders and descenders that moved past the baseline and <b>cap</b> <b>height.</b> Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} metal type faces, the metal type of Akzidenz-Grotesk shows {{variation}} between sizes, with adaptation of letter-spacing and proportions to different sizes. In addition, there is variation between weights: Karl Gerstner notes that even comparing one size (20pt), the medium and bold weights have different x-height, <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> and descender length {{to the light}} and regular weights. This is common with nineteenth-century sans-serifs, which were often not designed as {{with the intention of}} forming an extended family that would match together. The differences in proportions between different sizes and weights of Akzidenz-Grotesk has led to a range of contemporary adaptations, reviving or modifying different aspects of the original design.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The gas seepage {{characteristics}} of four kinds of broken rocks of different gradations {{and the relationship}} between the <b>capping</b> <b>height</b> and the porosity were studied by means of the simulation experiment and the theoretical analysis. The results show that the air flow in the capping layer composed of broken rocks is in the non-Darcy state which can be described as Forchheimer equation and Ergun equation. Moreover, {{on the basis of the}} experimental data, the relational expressions between the permeability, the non-Darcy β factor and the porosity were determined. Through the numerical fitting, the equation of the minimum <b>capping</b> <b>height</b> and the porosity was ultimately derived, which provided the basis and the reference for the determination of <b>capping</b> <b>height</b> and the air leakage control of mine...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to extra font width and weight combinations, the fonts are digitally interpolated, so that character widths scale uniformly with changing font weights. For fonts {{within a specific}} font weight, <b>caps</b> <b>height,</b> x-height, ascender and descender heights are the same. For oblique fonts, the slope is increased from 12° to the 16° of Frutiger's original drawings, and the character widths were adjusted optically.

500|$|Among Bembo's more {{distinctive}} characteristics, {{the capital}} [...] "Q"s tail starts from the glyph's centre, the uppercase [...] "J" [...] has a slight hook and {{the sides of}} the [...] "M" [...] splay outwards slightly. The 'A' has a flat top. Many lowercase letters show subtle, sinuous curves; the termination of the arm of both the r and the e flare slightly upward and outward. The lowercase [...] "c" [...] and [...] "e" [...] push slightly forwards. Characters [...] "h", [...] "m", and [...] "n" [...] are not quite vertical on their right-hand stems, with a subtle curve towards the left going down the stroke. In italic, the k has an elegantly curved stroke in the lower-right and descenders on the p, q and y end with a flat horizontal stroke. In the 1950s, Monotype noted that its features included: [...] "serifs fine slab, fine-bracketed and in l.c. prolonged to right along baseline." [...] This meant that many of the serifs (especially the horizontals, for example on the W) are fine lines of quite uniform width, rather than forming an obvious curve leading into the main form of the letter. The ascenders reach above the <b>cap</b> <b>height.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic (sometimes collectively {{referred}} to as LGC) scripts, one can refer to {{the distance from the}} baseline to the top of regular lowercase glyphs (mean line) as the x-height, and the part of a glyph rising above the x-height as the ascender. [...] The distance from the baseline {{to the top of the}} ascent or a regular uppercase glyphs (cap line) is also known as the <b>cap</b> <b>height.</b> The height of the ascender can have a dramatic effect on the readability and appearance of a font.

2500|$|The epigraphic ancient Ionian sampi is not {{normally}} rendered {{with the modern}} numeral character in print. In specialized epigraphical or palaeographic academic discussion, it is either represented by a glyph , or by a Latin capital serifed T as a makeshift replacement. As this character {{has in the past}} never been supported in normal Greek fonts, there is no typographical tradition for its uppercase and lowercase representation in the style of a normal text font. Since its inclusion in the Unicode character encoding standard, experimental typographical stylizations of a lowercase textual Sampi have been developed. The Unicode reference glyph for [...] "small letter archaic sampi", according to an original draft, was to have looked like the stem of a small τ with a square top at x height, but was changed after consultation with Greek typesetting experts. The glyph shown in current official code charts stands on the baseline and has an ascender slightly higher than <b>cap</b> <b>height,</b> but its stem has no serifs and is slightly curved leftwards like the descender of an ρ or β. Most type designers who have implemented the character in current fonts have chosen to design a glyph either at x height, or with a descender but no ascender, and with the top either square or curved (corresponding to ancient scribal practice.) ...|$|E

40|$|Experiments are {{performed}} using an idealized {{version of an}} operational forecast model to determine the impact on banded frontal clouds {{of the strength of}} deformational forcing, low-level baroclinicity, and model representation of convection. Line convection is initiated along the front, and slantwise bands extend {{from the top of the}} line-convection elements into the cold air. This banding is attributed primarily to M adjustment. The cross-frontal spreading of the cold pool generated by the line convection leads to further triggering of upright convection in the cold air that feeds into these slantwise bands. Secondary low-level bands form later in the simulations; these are attributed to the release of conditional symmetric instability. Enhanced deformation strain leads to earlier onset of convection and more coherent line convection. A stronger cold pool is generated, but its speed is reduced relative to that seen in experiments with weaker deformational strain, because of inhibition by the strain field. Enhanced low-level baroclinicity leads to the generation of more inertial instability by line convection (for a given <b>capping</b> <b>height</b> of convection), and consequently greater strength of the slantwise circulations formed by M adjustment. These conclusions are based on experiments without a convective-parametrization scheme. Experiments using the standard or a modified scheme for this model demonstrate known problems with the use of this scheme at the awkward 4 km grid length used in these simulations.

40|$|The {{response}} of piles and two-pile groups to lateral loading {{has been studied}} by field tests and computationally. Due {{to the lack of}} field test data and because of uncertainty concerning the pile/soil system {{it has been suggested that}} further experimental studies of pile groups under lateral loading should be undertaken. The research was conducted through a series of tests on vertical single piles and two-pile groups at various spacing and pile <b>cap</b> overhang <b>heights,</b> to identify the lateral stiffness, bending moment and axial force distribution. Attempts were also made to measure the in-situ total lateral soil pressure on the pile walls. Piles were designed to behave as "long" pile since most piles used in the U. K. are long and flexible. Piles were instrumented with strain gauges for measurement of bending moments and axial forces. Field tests were conducted in a sand trench using 4. 0 m long piles. A stiff steel pile cap was used to connect head of the two piles firmly together. Linear elastic back analyses of single pile tests were carried out to estimate the soil modulus profile with depth. Thereafter comparisons were made between the field test results on two-pile groups, published analyses and also a three dimensional finite element analysis. Tests results showed that the lateral stiffness of a two-pile groups tends towards a limit as spacing increases. A similar result was found from predictive and finite element analyses. The ratio between the maximum pile shaft bending moment and horizontal force varied between dry and wet season, being greater in the latter. The ratio between maximum reverse bending moment and horizontal load increased as the pile spacing and the overhang increased. Similar results results were found by finite element analysis. One of the main achievements in this research was the measurement of the axial forces in the vertical piles due to lateral loading. It was found that as the pile spacing increased and pile <b>cap</b> overhang <b>height</b> decreasd the peak axial forces per unit load decreased. Similar results were obtained by three dimensional finite element analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{inherent}} functionality of {{a printed}} wiring board can be dramatically increased by embedding electronic components into the board. For resistors, capacitors and inductors technological turnkey solutions are offered by major manufacturers and also novel technologies are under development. Application examples for passives integration into flexible PCBs will be given. A further boost of functionality will be accomplished by the integration of active chips into the board. An overview of different approaches and the respective sets of enabling technologies for the integration of chips into the board will be given. Two of the approaches for the chip integration into the board {{will be discussed in}} detail. A prerequisite for those technologies is the chip thinning, which is now available as a commercial service for chip thicknesses down to 20 µm. In the chip in polymer (CIP) approach the thin chip is precisely positioned and soundly attached onto the board surface. After lamination of a copper coated resin foil via contacts are drilled through the laminate to the contact pads of the chip. The transfer of precise chip position parameters with respect to the board is essential for this step. The wiring on the laminate foil to the chip and to other components is subsequently structured. Process parameters and results will be presented. For the embedding of chips into flexible PCBs the chip is flipped onto the substrate surface and thermode bonded. The process implies soldering. Therefore electroless Ni(P) is deposited onto the Al bond pads of the chip which is subsequently covered with small caps of solder. The solder <b>cap</b> <b>heights</b> are in the range of 4 to 8 µm {{in order to keep the}} interconnection height low. The solder joint is realized by thermode bonding of the chip onto the structured wiring of the substrate using no-flow underfiller. The chip containing layer is then laminated and contacted to outer layers of the board by conventional through hole technique. An assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches will be given on the status of our present understanding of the technological challenges...|$|R
