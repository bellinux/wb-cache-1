50|$|The clutch is {{hydraulically}} {{operated by a}} master/slave cylinder setup with a normal <b>clutch</b> <b>fork</b> and throw out bearing. The flywheels used with these gearboxes are dual mass versions (petrol engines) to eliminate the noise that 3-axle (3-shift) gearboxes can make in neutral, and a regular (single mass) flywheels for the diesel engine.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} the project is to setup the {{manufacturing}} process and the economic study {{as well as the}} production plant layout and waste management of the gear box for industrial vehicle. The gear box contains 21 main parts and 11 parts will be explained in this project, including: Shaft 1, Shaft 2, Casing, Sliding part, <b>Clutch</b> <b>fork,</b> Pin, Sealing plate 1 - 2, Transmission Plate 2, Washer 2, Gear 1 and Gear 2. Firstly we have to do the marketing study in order to estimate the amount of the production we expect to sell in the first and the following years. The marketing study is done by analyzing the data from Spain and European database in industrial section together with the assumption based on reality. The results from this part are the expected production per year which can let us make the decision for the machine type and it will be used in economic study as well. Then the proper manufacturing process and specific tool’s type for each part will be decided and written on the Phase Document and the Summary of the Operation. These 2 documents are in the form that suitable to be used in reality effectively. Not only the manufacturing procedure, we also indicate the proper cutting condition and the calculations of cycle time, cutting force, machine power and the quality verification for each part. The data obtained by the calculation will be used to choose the specific model of machines, the amounts of machines and workers required to achieve the expected production. After we have the clear image of the production line, we shall advance to the economic study. The economic study is a good and reliable tool to indicate the profitability of the business. Every possible cost of the company will be taken into account and be presented as “ Hour Cost “. As well as the economic indicators such as Cash Flow, Period of Pay back, Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) will be presented {{to be sure that the}} investment of this business will be profitable. The final tasks are the production plant layout and the waste management. The production plant layout will be designed sketchily as well as the specific suitable location. The waste management is the explanation the way to deal with the chips and chemical waste to be responsible for the social and environment...|$|E

50|$|In the (very limited) {{production}} application the water-cooled engine {{retained the}} vertical cylinder but placed the crank driven supercharger piston and its cylinder under the crankcases. The radiator was mounted between the twin downtubes of the plunger suspended {{double cradle frame}} and drive {{was taken to the}} four speed gearbox via a chain primary drive and dry multidisc <b>clutch.</b> Girder <b>forks</b> equipped the front end and were fitted with a full width hub as was the rear wheel.|$|R

The pointed stem was directed almost horizontally in front of him, and it remained in that position for about twenty minutes, when he lowered it with a gesture of discouragement.|$|R

The main bearings, crank pins, transmission main shaft, <b>clutch</b> bushing, shifter <b>fork</b> guide bar, and rocker arms are lubricated by pressurized oil, whereas the rest of the engine is lubricated by “oil splash.” ...|$|R
