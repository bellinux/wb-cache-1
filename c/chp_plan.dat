40|$|The growing {{environmental}} awareness and the apparent conflicts between {{economic and environmental}} objectives turn energy planning problems naturally into multi-objective optimization problems. In the current study, mixed fuel combustion is considered as an option to achieve tradeoff between economic objective (associated with fuel cost) and emission objective (measured in CO 2 emission cost according to fuels and emission allowance price) because a fuel with higher emissions is usually cheaper than one with lower emissions. Combined heat and power (CHP) production is an important high-efficiency technology to promote under the emission trading scheme. In CHP production, the production planning of both commodities must be done in coordination. A long-term planning problem decomposes into thousands of hourly subproblems.

40|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) {{production}} is universally accepted {{as one of}} the most energy-efficient technology to produce energy with lower fuel consumption and fewer emissions. In CHP production, heat and power generation follows a joint characteristic. Traditional CHP production is usually applied in backpressure plants, where the joint characteristic can often be represented by convex (linear programming, LP) model. Advanced CHP production technologies such as backpressure plants with condensing and auxiliary cooling options, gas turbines, and combined gas and steam cycles may require non-convex models. Cost-efficient operation of a CHP system can be planned using an optimization model based on hourly load forecasts. A long-term planning model decomposes into thousands of hourly model, which can be formulated as mixed integer programming (MIP) problems. In this paper, we introduce the EBB algorithm, for solving the hourly non-convex CHP models of a long-term planning problem under the deregulated power market. EBB is based on a double bounding Branch and Bound (B&B) algorithm where linear subproblems are solved through an efficient envelope-based dual algorithm. We compare the performance of EBB with realistic models against the ILOG CPLEX 9. 0 MIP solver and the Power Simplex (PS) based B&B algorithm (PBB). PS is an extremely efficient specialized Simplex algorithm developed for convex <b>CHP</b> <b>planning</b> problems.

In the CHP plant, the generation of heat-and-power follows a joint characteristic, which makes the determination of both the marginal power production cost (MPPC) and the feasible operating region for the plant more complicated than for the power-only generation plant. Due to the interdependence between heat and power production, the power-ramp constraints, which limit how much the power production of a CHP plant may increase or decrease between two successive periods, may also imply constraints on the heat production.

In CHP plants (units), generation {{of heat and}} power follows joint characteristics, which means that production planning must be done in coordination. We introduce in this paper the DP-RSC 1 algorithm, which is a variant of the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm based on linear relaxation of the ON/OFF states of the units and sequential commitment of units one by one. The time complexity of DP-RSC 1 is proportional to the number of generating units in the system, the number of periods over the planning horizon and the time for solving a single-period economic dispatch problem. We have compared the DP-RSC 1 algorithm with realistic power plants against the unit decommitment algorithm and the traditional priority listing method. The results show that the DP-RSC 1 algorithm gives somewhat more accurate results (0. 08 - 0. 5 % on average, maximum 10 % for the individual sub-case) and executes 3 - 5 times faster on average than the unit decommitment algorithm.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the unit commitment in multi-period {{combined heat and power}} (<b>CHP)</b> production <b>planning,</b> considering {{the possibility to}} trade power on the spot market. In CHP plants (units), generation of heat and power follows joint characteristics, which means that production planning for both heat and power must be done in coordination. We present an improved unit decommitment (IUD) algorithm that starts with an improved initial solution with less heat surplus so that the relative cost-efficiency of the plants can be determined more accurately. Then the subsequent decommitment procedures can decommit (switch off) the least cost-efficient plants properly. The improved initial solution for the committed plants is generated by a heuristic procedure. The heuristic procedure utilizes both the Lagrangian relaxation principle that relaxes the system-wide (heat and power) demand constraints and a linear relaxation of the ON/OFF states of the plants. We compare the IUD algorithm with realistic test data against a generic unit decommitment (UD) algorithm. Numerical results show that IUD is an overall improvement of UD. The solution quality of IUD is better than that of UD for almost all of tested cases. The maximum improvement is 11. 3 % and the maximum degradation is only 0. 04 % (only two sub-cases out of 216 sub-cases) with an average improvement of 0. 3 - 0. 5 % for different planning horizons. Moreover, IUD is more efficient (1. 1 - 3 times faster on average) than UD. Combined heat and power production Unit commitment Energy optimization Unit decommitment Deregulated power market...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{comprehensive}} framework for solving long-term {{combined heat and power}} (<b>CHP)</b> operations <b>planning</b> problems is developed. The framework has two main parts - {{the first is}} a modelling framework which allows for modelling arbitrary CHP plants and is aimed at the formulation of an optimization problem for CHP production and trade planning. The second is a solution algorithm which exploits the knowledge of the problem structure so that the problem is solved more efficiently. There exist very powerful stateof- the-art general-purpose solvers for mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems, such as Gurobi. However, even these solvers fail to find a feasible solution within reasonable time for production planning problems of large dimensions. An idea followed in this thesis is to achieve reasonable computation times of large problems by employing the knowledge of the special problem structure. For this purpose, a customized branch and bound (B&B) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm exploits the knowledge of the block-diagonal problem substructure, to obtain tight bounds. The bounds are much tighter than bounds produced by solving a linear relaxation of the solved MILP problem, which is the way of bound computation commonly used within general-purpose implementations of B&B. Besides an enhanced horizon cutting algorithm is developed, with the purpose of providing high-quality feasible solutions for the customized B&B algorithm. Efficiency of the proposed algorithm was evaluated based on 64 test cases using real-world data of three existing CHP plants. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to plain Gurobi usage. In most cases the proposed algorithm finds a certificate of near-optimality sooner than plain Gurobi does. More importantly, the proposed algorithm was able to find good feasible solutions for problems, for which Gurobi fails to find any feasible solution within the specified time limit.

The purpose of the Georgia Environmental Advocacy Groups Health Education Needs Assessment was to better understand community concerns, to identify hazardous waste sites that might warrant some degree of public health evaluation, to find community leaders and personnel interested in assisting the Chemical Hazards Program in implementing public health interventions, to inform the community about the services offered to the public by the Georgia Department of Public Health and to better understand the best methods for distributing health education material. This is the first time the Chemical Hazards Program has conducted an environmental advocacy group leader needs assessment. The results of this pilot study will help the development of future needs assessments conducted by the CHP. Survey development began in August of 2011 and Georgia State University Institutional Review Board approval was granted January 2012. Participants were selected due to their current leadership role of a Georgia environmental advocacy group/organization. Contact information was found for 137 environmental group leaders. Depending on available contact information, potential participants either received the survey through the mail or electronically via email. Surveys were distributed on January 13, 2012 and had to be returned by February 20, 2012. Twenty-one Georgia environmental advocacy group leaders participated in the survey. A majority of participants cited protect/restore natural habitats as the main purpose of their organization, but the survey did reveal 10 environmental groups that focused on protecting human health. Seven of participants that were dedicated to protecting human health expressed interest in working further with the GDPH to develop or implement public health interventions. The survey was also successful in informing participants about the Chemical Hazards Program. Prior to the needs assessment, more than 80 % of participants were not aware of the program. Many pertinent suggestions were also made to aid in the development of the brochure aimed at educating community members about the services offered by the CHP. Although a variety of environmental health concerns were cited by the participants, water quality was most often mentioned. More participants reported they were very concerned about drinking water than any other environment. Ninety percent also reported being either concerned or very concerned about contamination in oceans, lakes and streams. A section of the survey also addressed hazards found within the home, unclean drinking water was selected by far the most often as being of greatest concern compared to all other indoor hazards. Many participants listed specific waste or industrial sites that are of concern among members of their community as a source of contaminants. A few contaminated environments were also listed including specific rivers and lakes. Though many did not list specific sources, the majority of participants cited water contamination as being a chemical contamination issue that has the greatest impact on human health. The survey helped reveal specific community concerns regarding potential chemical contaminants and sites that may lead to the CHP conducting public health assessments/consultations and exposure investigations. The survey also revealed the need for general environmental health education and intervention activities based on concerns of the participants as well as the lack of concern by many. The survey was also successful in identifying individuals that may help the CHP gain future partnerships and identifying creative methods for distributing health education material.

As these schemes use waste heat from electricity generation, the power station associated with them must, for reasons of efficiency, be near to a region where the heat usage per unit area (heat-load density) is high. To <b>plan</b> <b>CHP</b> schemes, the heat-load density of urban areas needs to be mapped and monitored. To calculate heat-load density for residential areas workers have conventionally multiplied the number of dwellings per unit area by the average head-load per dwelling.

In this paper the use of remotely sensed data from the Landsat Multispectral Scanning System (MSS) to estimate heat-load density is proposed. A survey using these data for the City of Sheffield was faster and no less accurate than a survey performed by conventional means. However, Landsat MSS data were unable to discriminate between more than four classes of heat-load density, a level of discrimination that may be increased if Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or SPOT High Resolution Visible (HRV) data were to be used in future surveys of this kind. ...|$|R

Many CHP technologies and systems exist and {{can easily be}} proposed as candidates for introduction and/or widespread use in the Norwegian market. However, today they may be far from cost-effective given the current energy market and framework situation. These constraints can, however, change relatively fast. Hence, it is important to evaluate the feasibility of small-scale CHP technologies and systems in this perspective. What will the most promising small-scale CHP technologies based on biomass be in the near to medium term future? What are the limiting factors? What can be done to speed up the introduction of small-scale CHP solutions based on biomass in the Norwegian market? This work evaluates techno-economics of various CHP solutions based on biomass in the Norwegian market. Traditional financial indicators such as financial internal rate of return and net present value are used to assess the solutions. The methodology includes the following sequential steps: estimation of the economic production costs of various options for biomass CHP for power and heat generation and sorting these options in ascending order of costs to present the supply curve to meet the national target. Finally, the analysis includes various incentive schemes, feed-in tariffs/green certificates, investment based tax exemptions (8 years for each technology), prolonged tax exemption (+ 5 years for each technology), investment subsidies (in % for each technology) and low-interest loans (decided for each technology). Based on the evaluations, MSW backpressure turbine, biogas engine and industrial backpressure turbine are profitable without any subsidy under Norwegian framework conditions. With additional subsidy from grid deduction fee and green certificates, district heat ORC, district heat backpressure turbine and gasification with micro gas turbine are feasible with profitability of internal rate of return above 11 %. Other gasification technologies are feasible under prevailing market conditions.

Even though national guidelines are available that address the ethical issues of pain management, patients with SCD often receive suboptimal pain control, especially during acute painful episodes. This project planned to determine some methods of improving patient care and satisfaction of pain management in hopes of being able to translate these methods to other health care systems. At the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (<b>CHP)</b> individualized pain <b>plans,</b> which include lists of each patient's most recent pain medications, have been in place since 2002. Retrospective data was analyzed to determine whether admission rates have decreased since this time due to improved care and treatment of patients with SCD. Additionally, patient and parent satisfaction with current pain management was evaluated by the use of surveys, with questions regarding overall perceptions of treatment and care. We had also proposed to implement a quality improvement program in the ED to further improve care of patients with sickle cell disease presenting with vaso-occlusive pain crises and then reassess patient and parent satisfaction. However, time restraints did not allow a quality improvement program to be implemented at this time. This study found that admission rates since 2002 had decreased at CHP, since the time that individualized pain plans were designed and put into practice. Baseline measurements of patient and parent satisfaction found that, overall, participants were satisfied with the care and treatment of pain they received in the ED. Future studies should involve developing further methods of improving patient satisfaction with pain management; a possible avenue to pursue may be working on decreasing wait times in the ED.

The region includes California, Nevada, Hawaii, and the Pacific territories. The PCEAC was operated as one of nine regional clean energy application centers, originally established in 2003 / 2004 as Regional Application Centers for combined heat and power (CHP). Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, these centers received an expanded charter to also promote district energy and waste energy recovery, where economically and environmentally advantageous. The centers are working in a coordinated fashion to provide objective information on clean energy system technical and economic performance, direct technical assistance for clean energy projects and additional outreach activities to end users, policy, utility, and industry stakeholders. A key goal of the CEACs is to assist the U. S. in achieving the DOE goal to ramp up the implementation of CHP to account for 20 % of U. S. generating capacity by 2030, which is estimated at a requirement for an additional 241 GW of installed clean technologies. Additional goals include meeting the Obama Administration goal of 40 GW of new CHP by 2020, key statewide goals such as renewable portfolio standards (RPS) in each state, California’s greenhouse gas emission reduction goals under AB 32, and Governor Brown’s “Clean Energy Jobs Plan” goal of 6. 5 GW of additional CHP over the next twenty years. The primary partners in the PCEAC are the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Energy and Resources Group (ERG) at UC Berkeley, the Advanced Power and Energy Program (APEP) at UC Irvine, and the Industrial Assessment Centers (IAC) at San Diego State University and San Francisco State University. The center also worked {{with a wide range of}} affiliated groups and industry, government, NGO, and academic stakeholders to conduct a series of CHP education and outreach, project technical support, and related activities for the Pacific region.

40|$|Policy {{instruments}} clearly {{influence the}} choice of production technologies and fuels in large energy systems, including district heating networks. Current Swedish policy instruments aim at promoting the use of biofuel in district heating systems, and at promoting electric power generation from renewable energy sources. However, there is increasing pressure to harmonize energy policy instruments within the EU. In addition, natural gas based combined cycle technology {{has emerged as the}} technology of choice in the power generation sector in the EU. This study aims at exploring the role of policy instruments for promoting the use of low CO 2 emissions fuels in high performance combined heat and power systems in the district heating sector. The paper presents the results of a case study for a Swedish district heating network where new large size natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) combined heat and power (CHP) is being built. Given the aim of current Swedish energy policy, it is assumed that it could be of interest in the future to integrate a biofuel gasifier to the CHP plant and co-fire the gasified biofuel in the gas turbine unit, thereby reducing usage of fossil fuel. The goals of the study are to evaluate which policy instruments promote construction of the <b>planned</b> NGCC <b>CHP</b> unit, the technical performance of an integrated biofuelled pressurized gasifier with or without dryer on plant site, and which combination of policy instruments promote integration of a biofuel gasifier to the <b>planned</b> <b>CHP</b> unit. The power plant simulation program GateCycle was used for plant performance evaluation. The results show that current Swedish energy policy instruments favour investing in the NGCC CHP unit. The corresponding cost of electricity (COE) from the NGCC CHP unit is estimated at 253 SEKMW- 1, which is lower than the reference power price of 284 SEKMWh- 1. Investing in the NGCC CHP unit is also shown to be attractive if a CO 2 trading system is implemented. If the value of tradable emission permits (TEP) in such as system is 250 SEKtonne- 1, COE is 353 SEKMW- 1 compared to the reference power price of 384 SEKMWh- 1. It is possible to integrate a pressurized biofuel gasifier to the NGCC CHP plant without any major re-design of the combined cycle provided that the maximum degree of co-firing is limited to 27 – 38 % (energy basis) product gas, depending on the design of the gasifier system. There are many parameters that affect the economic performance of an integrated biofuel gasifier for product gas co-firing of a NGCC CHP plant. The premium value of the co-generated renewable electricity and the value of TEPs are very important parameters. Assuming a future CO 2 trading system with a TEP value of 250 SEKtonne- 1 and a premium value of renewable electricity of 200 SEKMWh- 1 COE from a CHP plant with an integrated biofuelled gasifier could be 336 SEKMWh- 1, which is lower than both the reference market electric power price and COE for the plant operating on natural gas alone...|$|R
40|$|A steady growing {{global demand}} for energy and rising {{greenhouse}} gas emissions has resulted in several initiatives from the European Union {{with the purpose of}} increasing energy efficiency. A part of this strategy is the introduction of energy performance certificates for buildings, containing a numerical primary energy indicator. Another instrument is to encourage an increased use of cogeneration. As a member of the European Economic Area agreement, these events also affect Norway. The main aim of the project was to investigate how various relevant parameters influence the primary energy factor of district heating when a combined heat and power (CHP) plant is the heat producing unit. The study was to be based on Norwegian conditions. To select relevant technologies, a mapping of existing and <b>planned</b> <b>CHP</b> facilities connected to district heating (DH) networks in Norway was carried out. The findings were that at present, there are nine steam cycle CHP plants connected to DH networks that are based on waste incineration, one steam cycle that is based on demolition wood and one reciprocating engine that is running on biogas. The installed electric capacity ranged from 0, 3 MW to 22, 8 MW and the annual district heating production from 1, 5 GWh to 196 GWh. Based on this, it was decided to study steam cycle CHP plants further. Three different sizes were chosen: 2 MWel, 10 MWel and 25 MWel. In addition, the situation in Europe was looked into. Here, steam cycle and combined cycle were found to be the two most dominant CHP technologies. To have a different technology to compare with, a combined cycle with 22, 7 MWel capacity was also included in the study. By running plant simulations, the effects of part load operation, various district heating supply and return temperatures and different fuel types were quantified. STEAM Pro was utilised to design the steam cycle models, while GT Pro was used to design the combined cycle models. STEAM Pro was also used to perform design simulations for different temperature levels in the DH network and to study the effect of different types of fuels. To be able to investigate the part load performance of the plants based on a given district heating demand, the models from STEAM Pro and GT Pro was imported into Thermoflex and modified. Reducing the DH supply temperature from 120 to 80 &# 176;C and the return temperature from 80 to 35 &# 176;C in the 10 MW steam cycle plant increased the power efficiency by 25 % and the power to heat ratio by 33 %, but the total efficiency was only slightly increased. Variation of fuel, on the other hand, influenced the power efficiency and the total efficiency almost equally, and the power to heat ratio was hence left relatively unaltered. The results from the simulations at the defined full load conditions showed that power efficiency was more than twice as high for the combined cycle than for the steam cycle plants, and the power to heat ratio was almost four times higher for the CC plant. The total efficiency was approximately 10 % lower for the combined cycle than for the steam cycles. Performance also varied between the different sizes of steam cycles, and both boiler type and turbine size influenced power efficiencies and power to heat ratios. In contrast, the total efficiencies were close to equal. Part load had a great influence on power efficiency and power to heat ratio for all technology types. Especially at very low load levels, the power efficiency was considerably reduced. The combined cycle experienced a total fall in power efficiency of 40 %, while the reduction varied from 60 % to only 29 % for the steam cycle plants. The part load total efficiency was only slightly reduced for all plants. Based on the part load simulations, annual efficiencies and power to heat ratios were calculated for different annual load distributions. The annual power to heat ratio and power efficiency was clearly influenced by changes in the annual load distribution pattern, while the effect was less notable for the annual total efficiencies. To calculate the primary energy factors, the total efficiency and power to heat ratio results from the CHP plant simulations were implemented in an excel tool developed by [16]. Some other modifications were also performed. The district heating primary energy factors (PEFDH) for the defined base case varied from 0, 85 for the Combined Cycle* alternative to 1, 4 for the 2 MW steam cycle plant. The base case was defined to have medium energy density(8 MWh/m). This was later found to not represent the actual Norwegian conditions, where the average energy density is closer to 4 MWh/m. When this energy density was used, the PEFDH for the 10 MW steam cycle plant increased 9, 4 %, from 1, 38 to 1, 51. This value is still considerably lower than the primary energy factor for the average electricity production in the Nordic countries, which is 2, 16. It was found that the combined heat and power plant parameters had a significant influence on the primary energy factors. The power to heat ratio was particularly important when the power bonus method was utilised. One main conclusion is therefore that {{it is important that the}} performance indicators that are used for the CHP plant are realistic, and takes into account technology type, part load performance and what load duration curve the plant is subject to. In most of the cases studied, the fuel handling process and the use of additives contributed most to the primary energy losses related to the PEFDH, while the sum of primary energy losses was dominated by the losses occurring in the CHP plant and the fuel handling. Nevertheless, what process and parameters that could potentially improve the PEFDH most depended on technology and choice of allocation method. In all cases studied, pump work related to circulating the DH water and energy consumption related to ash transport, construction and dismantling of the CHP plant and DH pipes were negligible or close to negligible. Heat loss became a considerably more dominant primary energy loss contributor when a low energy density was assumed. In the end, the calculation of primary energy factors involves many choices that influence the results. It is therefore important that the calculation method becomes more standardised. As it is today, some processes are optional, for instance the use of additives. In this study, the use of additives had a non-negligible influence on the results. Furthermore, the CHP simulation results underlined the importance of taking type of CHP technology and operational conditions into account when calculating primary energy factors for this kind of systems. According to NS-EN 15316 - 4 - 5, the power bonus method is the allocation method that should be utilised when calculating primary energy factors for district heating. This makes the district heating primary energy factors extremely dependent on power to heat ratio and the choice of PEF for avoided electricity. If the amount of avoided electricity production in fact is smaller than the full amount of CHP production or if the PEF of the avoided electricity is lower than what is assumed, this might lead to a severe underestimation of the PEFDH. The ultimate goal with the use of primary energy is to encourage more efficient energy use. It is therefore important that the issues mentioned in the two paragraphs above are further studied and discussed as a part of exploring how a standard method should be designed to face this challenge. </p...|$|R
