5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting human trafficking in the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking National <b>Coordination</b> <b>Centre</b> (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March, Australia {{took control}} for {{co-ordinating}} search, rescue, and recovery operations.

Following the fourth phase of the search, the ATSB took responsibility for defining the search area. In May, the search strategy working group was established by the ATSB to determine the most likely position on the aircraft at the 00:19 UTC (08:19 MYT) satellite transmission.

The JACC is an agency within Australia's Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, headed by Judith Zielke.

5|$|The Norwegian Ministry of Justice owns 12 Mk43B Sea Kings {{which are}} {{operated}} by the Royal Norwegian Air Forces's 330 Squadron. The aircraft are used for SAR and air ambulance missions and are {{under the command of}} the Joint Rescue <b>Coordination</b> <b>Centre</b> of Southern Norway and Northern Norway. Introduced in May 1973, they were originally stationed at Bodø Main Air Station, Ørland Main Air Station, Sola Air Station and Station Group Banak. In 1997, the squadron conducted 237 SAR and 747 air ambulance missions. From 1995 to 1998, one helicopter was stationed at Ålesund Airport, Vigra, and since 1999, one has been stationed at Rygge Air Station.

40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{the use of}} (binary) logistic regression and stochastic frontier analysis to assess the operational effectiveness of the UK Coastguard (Maritime Rescue) <b>coordination</b> <b>centres</b> over the period 1995 - 1998. In particular, {{the rationale for the}} Government's decision - confirmed in 1999 - to close a number of <b>coordination</b> <b>centres</b> is scrutinized. We conclude that the regression models developed in this paper represent a performance measurement framework that is considerably more realistic and complex than the one apparently used by the UK Government. Furthermore, we have found that the <b>coordination</b> <b>centres</b> selected for closure were not necessarily the ones that were least effective in their primary purpose - that is, to save lives. In a related paper, we demonstrate how the regression models developed here can be used to inform the application of data envelopment analysis to this case...|$|R

The Protective Security <b>Coordination</b> <b>Centre,</b> of the National Security and Criminal Justice Group from the Australian Attorney-General's Department, oversaw security planning through the APEC 2007 Security Branch, formed expressly for the APEC meetings. In order to secure and monitor the summit, the New South Wales Police Force instituted the APEC Police Security Command. Many public roads in Sydney were closed, as leaders, officials, and personnel travelled in motorcades around the city centre. Figures released by the state government at a Senate committee hearing show that security measures at APEC cost $170million.|$|E

It made its recommendations in 1959, which were implemented in 1970 with the creation of the Joint Rescue <b>Coordination</b> <b>Centre</b> of Southern Norway (JRCC SN) and the Joint Rescue <b>Coordination</b> <b>Centre</b> of Northern Norway (JRCC NN).|$|E
