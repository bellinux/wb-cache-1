5000|$|For {{model year}} 1973, Suzuki {{introduced}} the GT185 twin-cylinder model equipped with Ram Air <b>cooling,</b> <b>drum</b> brakes {{front and rear}} and a combination electric starter/generator setup [...] - [...] marketed in North America as the [...] "Adventurer". For model year 1974, the GT185 gained a single-disc front brake to rationalize it with the other GT models. It then remained basically unchanged, except for colour and trim items (which included a tail fairing in the 1977 'B' model and cast wheels in the final year 1978 'EC' model), {{through to the end}} of production with the 1978 MY.|$|E
50|$|Nd-Fe-B powder is {{combined}} with synthetic resin or polymer to form the bonded magnets. An important way of manufacturing these magnets is {{through the process of}} injection molding. The Nd-Fe-B alloy used for the production process is formed by a rapid quenching method. The hot molten Nd-Fe-B alloy is forced through a tiny nozzle unto a water <b>cooling</b> <b>drum</b> that is rotating at a very high speed to form thin crystalline Nd-Fe-B alloy ribbons that will be crushed into powder. The powder is further subjected to heat treatment to improve its coercive force and then mixed with the synthetic resin.The resulting mixture is kneaded, pelletized and then sent to the injection molding process. A mold which will form the desired shape of the magnet is first custom designed from a metal and the pellets are fed into the mold and melted at high pressure. Mechanical or hydraulic pressure is applied to the mixture so as to ensure that all cavities within the mold are filled. An external magnetic field (for anisotropic magnets) is also applied on the magnet during the injection molding process. It is then allowed to cool and removed with ejecting pins. Excess materials on the finished magnet is trimmed off and recycled. The finished magnet is inspected and packed up.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an analytical {{model for the}} prediction of the substrate temperature in vacuum web coaters. The model {{is based on the}} theory of heat transfer between a continuously moving workpiece and a stationary source, or sink, of energy. The investigation concerns the Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) of a metal layer on a polymer film by means of thermal evaporation, but many aspects apply equally well to sputtering and electron beam evaporation. The contributions to the specific heat load on the web are quantified, and the influence of the heat exchange between the film and the <b>cooling</b> <b>drum</b> is discussed in detail. After satisfactorily comparing the predictions with available literature results, the model is used as a guideline for a series of experimental tests aimed at determining the influence of the operating conditions on the final quality of the products obtained from vacuum deposition of thick metal layers on thin polymer substrates. The experimental results demonstrate the influence of the mechanical traction of the web on the thermal conductance between the film and the <b>cooling</b> <b>drum...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{low cost}} {{solution}} for a mini roll to roll web coating system is presented. The design {{is very simple}} and involves only three active rolls, two winding/unwinding rolls and a <b>cooling</b> <b>drum.</b> No extra load cells are used to control the web winding mechanism operation. To reach such result it has been necessary to develop an adequate control solution which acts on the two winding roll torques to make the web moving properly. The effect of the control mechanism is to increase electronically the total mechanical inertia of the roll to roll system. In such manner the stick-slip motion of the web, induced by the dry friction affecting {{the rotation of the}} rolls, is avoided. The effectiveness of this strategy has been corroborated: a first test showed that the web moves continuously while it is kept tense; in a second experiment a-Si material has been deposited by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition technique. For that material the optical transmission measurements at several points over the deposited area indicate a satisfactory uniformity. The presented tests validate the goodness of the new control method...|$|E
30|$|In summary, we {{investigated}} {{the characteristics of}} IAIA multilayer electrodes grown on PET substrates using a specially designed lab-scale R 2 R sputtering system at room temperature. In two steps, we prepared the IAIA multilayer {{as a function of}} the top IZO thickness. It was found that the optical transmittance of the IAIA multilayer was significantly influenced by the thickness of the top IZO layer, which was grown on identical AIA multilayers. However, the sheet resistance of the IAIA multilayer was maintained between the range 5.01 to 5.10 Ω/square regardless of the top IZO thickness because the sheet resistance of the IAIA multilayer was mainly dependent on thickness of the Ag layers. In addition, all IAIA multilayers show an amorphous structure and a very smooth surface due to the low substrate temperature which is maintained by the <b>cooling</b> <b>drum.</b> Furthermore, the high failure strain of the inserted Ag layer improved the robustness of the IAIA multilayer electrode. These results indicated that the R 2 R sputter-grown IAIA multilayer electrode is a promising candidate to replace conventional amorphous ITO electrodes.|$|E
40|$|Performance {{investigations}} of two equipments for the cooling of metal strips {{are presented in}} the paper. The so called "brush cooling equipment" enables heat transfer coefficients up to 150 W/m 2 K. The cooling intensity depends on adapted strip winding force. Partial roughening of the strip has to be considered as unwanted concomitant phenomenon. An optimum for high cooling performance and moderate roughening was detected. Heat transfer coefficients of up to 600 W/m 2 K are demonstrated with the "gaseous cooling equipment". The designed <b>cooling</b> <b>drum</b> ensures high gas pressure up to 100 mbar inside the contact zone of the metal strip and the drum. Partially evacuation prevents high gas pressure in the vacuum process chamber. The realized pressure separation of six orders of magnitude enables the combination of "gaseous cooling equipment" with high-rate sputtering or electron beam evaporation. The demonstrated heat transfer coefficients describe a distinctive performance incr ease compared to known state of the art. Extensions concerning deposition rate or deposition of thick layers onto thin metal foils get feasible. In future should be checked whether the new developed equipments can be adapted for the cooling of plastic films as well...|$|E

40|$|Substrate {{heating and}} {{deposition}} rate have been modeled for the thermal evaporation of Lithium {{in a vacuum}} web coating system. To aid in modeling the substrate heat load due to the Li deposition process a novel, self-consistent, thermodynamic model was developed that allows calculation of the deposition rate (for Li or any material) {{as a function of}} only evaporator geometry and temperature. Substrate heating due to both radiation and Li condensation are accounted for. With no free parameters, the self-consistent thermodynamic model predicts Li deposition thickness to within the 5 % accuracy, at 10 micron film thickness, of our measurement technique. Input to the model is the measured liquid temperature, the measured temperature on the crucible at the point farthest from the liquid and geometrical characteristics of the crucible/substrate arrangement including the measured areas of the exposed substrate and reservoir-substrate gaps. The temperature rise of the substrate (Polyethylene Teraphthalate, or PET) is then calculated based upon the Li flux, reservoir temperature and geometry, radiation heat load and the <b>cooling</b> <b>drum</b> temperature. Free parameters in this last step are the emissivity of the Li/PET surface and the heat transfer coefficient between the PET and the drum. The model predictions are compared to measurements...|$|E

500|$|The band {{used more}} loud guitar sounds for the record. Armstrong said [...] "We were like, 'Let's just go balls-out on the guitar sound— plug in the Les Pauls and Marshalls {{and let it}} rip'". Armstrong added tracks of {{acoustic}} guitar-playing throughout the record to augment his electric guitar rhythms and <b>Cool's</b> <b>drumming.</b> For most of the record, Dirnt used an Ampeg SVT bass amplifier, recording with his signature Fender Precision Bass. For the album, he and Cavallo strived for a [...] "solid, big, thunderous" [...] bass sound as opposed to one centered on countermelodies. Dirnt ran his bass guitar through an Evil Twin direct box, a staple of his recording methods since Dookie. Cool also employs unorthodox instruments for punk music—timpani, glockenspiel, and hammer bells—which he received out of a promotional deal with Ludwig.

40|$|Electron beam {{evaporation}} with deposition {{rates of}} hundreds of nanometer per second is predestined to fit large throughput. In a few cases, high-rate vacuum depositions demand effective cooling of the substrate to exploit their potential, otherwise substrate or layer temperature represents limiting factors. Therefore {{a new kind of}} cooling equipment for vacuum coating of metal strips was developed. As a result, the practical realized heat transfer coefficient (HTC) was increased from 50 W/m 2 K for common <b>cooling</b> <b>drums</b> up to 1000 W/m 2 K.

5000|$|... "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" [...] is set {{in common}} time and {{composed}} in the key of F minor, like [...] "Holiday", its prelude. The opening features an electric guitar with tremolo playing the verse progression, which is a i-III-VII-IV progression (Fm-A♭-E♭-B♭). The song's distinct tremolo effect on the opening guitar was achieved by digitally manipulating the recording in ProTools. It was difficult to produce, as it needed to remain {{in sync with the}} song's tempo. Armstrong added tracks of acoustic guitar-playing to augment his electric guitar rhythms and <b>Cool's</b> <b>drumming.</b> Billie Joe's vocals begin, accompanied by acoustic guitar.

Sintered iron linings are used with fin <b>cooled</b> <b>drums,</b> and the brake drum webs are lightened by drilled lightening holes which also permit the flow of cooling air. The brake drums are cast aluminum with cast-in iron braking surfaces. The rear brakes are inboard mounted next to the differential so that braking torque is transmitted directly to the frame without influencing any of the rear wheel articulating members. Braking effort distribution is 57% front and 43% rear {{to take advantage of the}} superior braking characteristics of the weight distribution afforded by the rear engine type vehicle. The brakes may be actuated by either one of two pedals so that the driver may use either foot depending on the particular driving situation. An unusual brake master cylinder utilizes two pistons operating in series so that it either the front or rear brakes fail the remaining brakes can be actuated.|$|R
