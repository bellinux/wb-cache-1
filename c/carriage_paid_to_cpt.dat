30|$|Company E is an {{industrial}} {{systems and equipment}} manufacturer with a diverse product range, from industrial power systems and robotics to low voltage products and automated process systems. Globally, the company is present in 100 countries, has 300 manufacturing locations, 150, 000 employees and a turnover of approximately 40 billion €. In Sweden, the company employs 9000 people in 30 different locations. As such, the company has multifaceted supply chains with both complex inbound and outbound flows for MTS and MTO. It is estimated that, based on volume, MTS dominates, whereas measured in value, MTO is the dominating strategy. Considering palletised goods, the ratio of inbound to outbound volume is 60 / 40. Local manufacturing sites predominantly serve local markets, which makes the inbound flows of interest for this case study. However, the product range is so diverse that any one characterisation of the flows {{is bound to be}} inaccurate in some sense. The company controls and optimises its own flows by purchasing A to B transports. Supply is delivered according to Incoterms EXW (Ex Works) and FOB, and deliveries using DAP and <b>CPT</b> (<b>Carriage</b> <b>Paid</b> <b>To).</b> The logistics organisation does not influence the supply strategy and acts as an internal supplier of transport, given the demand derived from the manufacturing and purchasing functions. One of the objectives of the logistics organisation is to increase the level of central control over the physical flows to and from the many sites at different geographical locations. The centralised control and coordination aims to increase the efficiency of the physical flow of goods within the company’s supply and distribution networks.|$|R
30|$|Company F is an {{industrial}} materials and tools manufacturer {{with expertise in}} materials technology {{and a range of}} products, including industrial tooling equipment for mining, machining solutions to advanced materials, and construction equipment. The company is organised in five business divisions. Globally, the company employs 47, 500 and has an annual turnover of 9.25 billion €. The company identifies its strategic strength as a technology leader in the premium segment of its sector—a segment characterised by high entry barriers. The division included in this case study is the materials technology division, which employs around 7000 people in Sweden. It produces advanced steel materials for further manufacturing by its customers and has an annual turnover of 1.5 billion €. The significant flows in the case are movement back and forth between offshore production sites and final distribution to customers. A common supply chain starts with products made in Sweden, which are shipped to their own production sites in China, then back to Sweden for final adaptation before being shipped out to the final customer. In the case of a final customer in China, the products in various manufacturing stages are shipped between continents several times, which obviously amplifies the impact of transport lead time. Deviation in lead time can also impact the levelling of production in production facilities in cases of MTO products. About 30 % of the orders can be delivered directly from stock, whereas 70 % are MTO. The transport services are purchased via a forwarder with regular allotments that are booked in advanced and modified if necessary. The Incoterm <b>CPT</b> (<b>Carriage</b> <b>Paid</b> <b>To)</b> is used. The company aims to control the flow from origin to destination, meaning that one way or another, the liner shipping leg of any transport always falls within the purview of the company. The transport lead time is {{a significant portion of the}} total lead time, which means that, especially for the MTO segment, its impact on the customers’ lead time is substantial. The annual volumes for the relevant flows are about 6000 TEUs.|$|R

While {{this class}} of drug is used to treat various solid tumors, CPT is only effective in 13 - 30 percent of the patient population. Although the mechanism of the CPT resistance pathway is not fully understood, we found cancer cells degrade topoisomerase I (topoI) in response <b>to</b> <b>CPT.</b> The observed relationship between higher basal DNA-PKcs mediated phosphorylation of topoI, rapid degradation of topoI, and resistance <b>to</b> <b>CPT</b> suggested that DNA-PKcs is a critical regulator of the phosphorylation status of topoI {{and the rate of}} topoI degradation in response <b>to</b> <b>CPT.</b> The data shows CTDSP 1 (a dual phosphatase) acts as a negative regulator of DNA-PKcs. Because CTDSP 1 functionality plays a role in maintaining higher basal phosphorylation levels of topoI, CTDSP 1 impairment contributes <b>to</b> greater <b>CPT</b> resistance. This renders the CPT chemotherapy treatment ineffective. We hypothesized inducing the catalytically inactive form of CTDPS 1 via both knockdown and inhibition experiments would increase cancer cell resistance <b>to</b> <b>CPT</b> {{as a result of an}} overactive topoI degradation pathway. The function of CTDSP 1 was impaired in the two colon cancer cell lines, HCT 15 and HCT 116, by silencing with siRNA and using Rabeprazole (a pharmacological agent known to inhibit CTDSP 1). Inhibition of CTDSP 1 phosphatase activity resulted in greater phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs and increased the rate of topoI degradation in the cells in response <b>to</b> <b>CPT.</b> Cellular resistance was also more notable in the sensitive HCT 116 cell lines. HCT 15 cells degrade topoI rapidly and are resistant <b>to</b> <b>CPT.</b> Thus, the effect of CPT is not as pronounced in this cell line. CTDSP 1 knock down cells showed the greatest DNA-PKcs phosphorylation and topoI degradation when treated with CPT. In addition, the present study includes a clonogenic assay that shows a larger cell survival fraction in Rabeprazole treated HCT 116 cells in comparison to controls after exposure <b>to</b> <b>CPT.</b> A higher survival fraction after CPT exposure is reflective of greater CPT resistance. This suggests that cell viability is enhanced during CPT chemotherapy treatment in CTDSP 1 null colorectal cancer cells. Lastly, An EGFP read out experiment of topoI tagged to EGFP demonstrated CTDSP 1 inhibition results in reduced topoI levels in colorectal cancer cells. The present study showed the potential link between lower topoI levels and greater resistance <b>to</b> <b>CPT</b> by showing that both effects are outcomes of silencing CTDSP 1. 2018 - 07 - 11 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R

NYH/CAM 50 cells had reduced topoisomerase I (topo I) content and activity, and consequently CPT-induced DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) were reduced, as measured by alkaline elution. In contrast, NYH/CAM 15 cells had identical topo I content and activity as compared with wild-type (wt) cells. CPT-mediated SSBs {{and the rate of}} their reversal after drug removal were also equal in wt and NYH/CAM 15 cells, as were doubling time, the fraction of cells in S-phase and DNA synthesis rate in response <b>to</b> <b>CPT.</b> As the conversion of DNA SSBs to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) is thought to represent a critical event leading to cell death, we measured DNA DSBs by neutral elution.

Topoisomerase I inhibitors such as camptothecins (CPTs) are a potent anti-neoplastic drug and are currently being used in clinics. However, the efficiency of this drug remains low, only 13 - 30 % of patients respond to the drug. It has been shown that topol degradation by ubiquitin proteasomes pathway provides drug resistance. Our lab has shown that breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA 1 ubiquitinates topol and initiates the degradation of topol in response to the drug. Topol ubiquitination by BRCA 1 is understood however the precise mechanism is not known. To understand the mechanism of resistance of this drug the present study aims to characterize the association between topoisomerase I (topol) and BRCA 1 in the response <b>to</b> Camptothecin (<b>CPT).</b> A cell viability assay was performed to demonstrate the relationship between rate of topol degradation and response <b>to</b> <b>CPT.</b> GST-pull down and Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine the nature of topol and BRCA 1 association. Co-localization experiments were performed to observe the interaction of the proteins in the cell in response <b>to</b> <b>CPT.</b> It was observed that the rate of topol degradation determined the response <b>to</b> <b>CPT.</b> In the response <b>to</b> <b>CPT,</b> topol and BRCA 1 form a protein complex and BRCA 1 acts as an E 3 -ligase to ubiquitinate topol which is degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP). Also, it was observed that BRCA 1 and topol colocalize in the cell nucleus in the CPT response. The association of topol and BRCA 1 has functional implications in the degradation of topol and understanding this association could lead to the development of new drugs that could prevent topol degradation thereby enhancing CPT efficiency...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} plasma glucose lowering on coronary circulatory function in type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Twenty patients with type 2 diabetes and 18 weight-matched controls were studied. At baseline, myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured with [(13) N]ammonia and positron emission tomography at rest, during cold pressor testing (CPT), and during adenosine hyperaemia. In diabetic patients, MBF and blood chemistry were analysed again after 3 months of glucose-lowering treatment with glyburide and metformin. RESULTS: Although hyperaemic MBF did not differ significantly between the patients and controls (1. 81 (0. 38) v 1. 97 (0. 43) ml/min/g; mean (SD)), the CPT-induced MBF increase (DeltaMBF) was significantly less in diabetic patients than in controls (0. 07 (0. 07) v 0. 25 (0. 12) ml/min/g; p< 0. 001). Treatment with glyburide and metformin significantly decreased plasma glucose concentrations from 207 (76) to 134 (52) mg/dl (p< 0. 001). This decrease in plasma glucose was paralleled by a significant increase in DeltaMBF in response <b>to</b> <b>CPT</b> (0. 20 (0. 16) from 0. 07 (0. 07) ml/min/g; p< 0. 001), which tended to be lower than in controls at baseline (0. 20 (0. 16) v 0. 25 (0. 12) ml/min/g; p = NS). The decrease in plasma glucose concentrations correlated significantly with the improvement in DeltaMBF in response <b>to</b> <b>CPT</b> (r = 0. 67, p< 0. 01).

40|$|Background—Transplant-associated {{coronary}} arteriopathy {{is manifested}} {{in its early}} stages by paradoxical coronary artery constriction in response to endothelium-dependent vasodilator stimuli such as the cold pressor test (CPT) and is a major cause of death or retransplantation. Estrogen has vasoactive properties that abolish coronary artery endothelial dysfunction in native hearts. We hypothesized that estrogen attenuates inappropriate coronary artery constriction in cardiac allografts. Methods and Results—Coronary artery diameter and systemic hemodynamic responses to a 90 -second CPT were measured before and 15 minutes after double-blind, randomized administration of intravenous conjugated estrogens (1. 25 mg) or placebo in men with male cardiac allografts. Before estrogen, 9 men exhibited an abnormal 15. 163. 0 % CPT-induced decrease in coronary artery diameter. However, repeat CPT did not induce significant coronary artery constriction when performed 15 minutes after estrogen. CPT responses before and after estrogen were significantly different (P 5. 02). Placebo did not influence coronary artery responses <b>to</b> <b>CPT</b> in 6 men. Systemic hemodynamic responses <b>to</b> <b>CPT</b> were not influenced by estrogen or placebo. Estrogen was the only significant determinant of changes in coronary artery responses <b>to</b> <b>CPT.</b> Conclusions—Conjugated estrogens acutely abolish abnormal CPT-induced coronary artery constriction in male cardiac allografts.

As topoisomerases contain a number of free sulfhydryl groups which may be targets of ·NO/·NO-derived species, we have investigated the roles of ·NO/·NO-derived species in the stability and activity of topo I. Here we show that ·NO/·NO-derived species induces a significant down-regulation of topoisomerase I protein via the ubiquitin/ 26 S proteasome pathway in human colon (HT- 29) and breast (MCF- 7) cancer cell lines. Importantly, ·NO treatment induced a significant resistance <b>to</b> <b>CPT</b> only in MCF- 7 cells. This resistance <b>to</b> <b>CPT</b> did not result from loss of topoisomerase I activity as there were no differences in topoisomerase I-induced DNA cleavage in vitro or in tumor cells, but resulted from the stabilization/induction of bcl 2 protein.
