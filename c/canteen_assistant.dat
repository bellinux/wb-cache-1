50|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Brown {{joined the}} NAAFI and was {{assigned}} as a <b>Canteen</b> <b>Assistant</b> onboard , a P class destroyer, for service during World War II. Unlike other services, the NAAFI only accepted men {{from the age of}} 17 onwards, so Brown had to lie about his age to join.|$|E
50|$|He {{stripped}} {{off his clothes}} and jumped into the cold sea. Colin Grazier also volunteered and followed him across. The two men were then joined by 16-year-old NAAFI <b>canteen</b> <b>assistant</b> Tommy Brown, and they began the task of searching the rapidly sinking u-boat for any vital documents, code books or machinery.|$|E
50|$|At the Faculty of Social Science at Liverpool University Mumford {{carried out}} {{research}} in industrial {{relations in the}} Liverpool docks and in the North West coal industry. In order to collect information for the dock research, she became a <b>canteen</b> <b>assistant</b> in the canteens used by the stevedores for meals. Each canteen was in {{a different part of}} the waterfront estate and served dockers working on different shipping lines and with different cargoes. The coal mine research required her to spend many months underground talking to miners at the coal face.|$|E
50|$|Other notable storylines {{in series}} 2 {{included}} the arrival and departure of prospective sponsor governors Jerry Preston and Roger Aspinall, drug-dealing by Gemma Seddon and Jed Seddon, the alcoholism of trainee teacher Russell Millen, the perversion of <b>canteen</b> <b>assistant</b> Kevin Hurst, the bullying of Mika Grainger by fellow-pupil Leigh-Ann Galloway, {{the return of}} former pupil Maxine Barlow, {{and the arrival of}} a new sixth former named Brett Aspinall (son of governor Roger), who starts an affair with the new school secretary and breaks a lot of the teenage girls' hearts during the series. His true love, however, is Mika Grainger.|$|E
50|$|Series 3 {{also sees}} {{the arrival of}} new staff and pupils. Two new members of staff are Jasmine Koreshi (played by Shabana Bakhsh), a young English teacher, and Matt Wilding (played by Chris Geere), the newly {{appointed}} head of Music and Drama who lives with his partner Colin. Pupils introduced in the third series include Aleesha Dillon (played by Lauren Thomas), Danielle Harker (played by Lucy Dixon), Karla Bentham (played by Jessica Baglow), who has Asperger syndrome, Paul Langley (played by Thomas Milner), and Bolton Smilie (played by Tachia Newall). The first half also saw the departure of ex-bully Lewis Seddon, {{who served as a}} <b>canteen</b> <b>assistant</b> {{in the first half of}} the season.|$|E
50|$|The {{ship was}} ordered to proceed to Ascension Island, where after three days it {{proceeded}} to the Falklands. On the morning of 7 May, {{he was invited to}} practice on a general-purpose machine gun, being informed afterwards that he was to take up that role instead at action stations should active service be declared, with his former role of casualty coordinator in sickbay being taken by his <b>Canteen</b> <b>Assistant,</b> Nigel Woods. Whilst onroute, active service was declared and Leake signed on to the Royal Navy on a temporary basis, becoming a petty officer in the Royal Navy, but continuing in his previous role as Canteen Manager. Being a member of the Navy allowed him to be covered by the protections of the Geneva Convention.|$|E
5000|$|Fasson and Able Seaman Colin Grazier, {{along with}} NAAFI <b>canteen</b> <b>assistant</b> Tommy Brown, swam naked to the U-559 {{and entered the}} sinking submarine, which had water pouring in through seacocks left open by the Germans. Working in {{complete}} darkness, fully aware that the submarine could sink without warning at any time, Fasson and Grazier located documents which Brown carried up to men in a whaler. They continued searching until the submarine suddenly foundered - [...] "sank like a stone," [...] drowning Fasson and Grazier; Brown survived. Fasson and Grazier were subsequently awarded the George Cross, while Brown - as a civilian employee in the Navy - received the George Medal. The awards {{were published in the}} London Gazette on 14 September 1943.|$|E
50|$|Lieutenant Francis Anthony Blair Fasson and Able Seaman Colin Grazier dived {{into the}} sea and swam to the submarine, with Brown {{following}} them over. The German crew had opened the boats seacocks, and water was pouring into the vessel. The two Navy men {{made their way into}} the captains cabin where Fasson found a set of keys. They unlocked drawers and found two code books: the Short Weather Cipher and Short Signal Book. Brown carried these documents up the iron ladder of the U-boats conning tower to Petards whaler, climbing with one hand while holding the documents in the other. After his third trip down and up the ladder, he called for his shipmates {{to get out of the}} boat, but the submarine sank before they could escape. Brown himself was dragged under with the submarine, but managed to fight his way back to the surface and was picked up by the whaler. He was promoted to Senior <b>Canteen</b> <b>Assistant</b> following the incident.|$|E
5000|$|The German crew hurriedly {{scrambled}} overboard {{without destroying}} their codebooks or Enigma machine and, crucially, {{having failed to}} open all the sea-water vents to scuttle the U-boat properly. Three Royal Navy sailors, Lieutenant Anthony Fasson, Able Seaman Colin Grazier and NAAFI <b>canteen</b> <b>assistant</b> Tommy Brown, then boarded the abandoned submarine. There are differing reports {{as to how the}} three British men boarded the U-boat. Some accounts (such as that of Kahn) say that they [...] "swam naked" [...] to U-559, which was sinking, but slowly. Sebag-Montefiore states that they either leapt from Petard or, in Browns case, from a whaler. They retrieved the U-boats Enigma key setting sheets with all current settings for the U-boat Enigma network. Two German crew members, rescued from the sea, watched this material being loaded into Petards whaler but were dissuaded from interfering by an armed guard. Grazier and Fasson were inside the U-boat, attempting to get out, when it foundered; both drowned.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas William Brown GM ( [...] 1926 - 13 February 1945) was an English {{recipient}} of the George Medal, the youngest person to have ever received that award. In October 1942, as a NAAFI <b>canteen</b> <b>assistant,</b> {{he was involved in}} the action between Petard and , being one of three men to board the sinking submarine in an effort to retrieve vital documents, and {{was the only one of}} the three to survive. These documents would later lead the Bletchley Park codebreakers to crack the German Enigma code. After this heroic deed, it was revealed that he was underage to be at sea. He returned home to North Shields. In 1945 he died from injuries sustained while rescuing his sister Maureen from a house fire in South Shields whilst on leave from HMS Belfast. His family were presented with his medal by King George VI in 1945, and later presented it to the NAAFI in 1985.|$|E
5000|$|On 30 October 1942, a Sunderland {{flying boat}} {{reported}} the sighting of a submarine {{north of the}} Nile delta area.Petard, with , , [...] and , {{was involved in the}} sinking of [...] After many hours of searching and attacks with depth charges, the U-boat was forced to the surface. Both Petard and Hurworth engaged the U-boat with their [...] "pom-poms" [...] and Oerlikons after the main armament (4-inch guns) was found to be ineffective. With illumination from the searchlights of both Petard and Hurworth, the First Lieutenant, Anthony Fasson and Able Seaman Colin Grazier swam across to the U-boat, went below and proceeded to gather a new, four-rotor Enigma machine, code-books and other important documents together for transfer to the Petard. They were helped by a 16-year-old NAAFI <b>canteen</b> <b>assistant,</b> Tommy Brown, who was originally thought to have swum across to the sinking submarine as well; but when asked at the subsequent inquiry how he had boarded the U-Boat, he testified that he [...] "got on board just forward of the whaler on the port side when the deck was level with the conning tower". That whaler, under the command of Sub-Lieutenant Connell, went alongside the U-boat in the darkness. Note - A four-rotor Enigma machine was not recovered in this action - only the code books - the Enigma machine itself sank with the U boat.|$|E
50|$|The Short Weather Cipher was {{critical}} in the cryptanalysis of the Naval Enigma M4 and yielded excellent cribs. On 30 October 1942, {{a copy of the}} Wetterkurzschlüssel, the short weather cipher, and of the short signal book, the Kurzsignale, were recovered as part of a daring raid on the U-boat U-559, when three Royal Navy sailors, Lieutenant Anthony Fasson, Able Seaman Colin Grazier and NAAFI <b>canteen</b> <b>assistant</b> Tommy Brown, then boarded the abandoned submarine, and recovered the documents after a 90-minute search. They reached the Government Code and Cypher at Bletchley Park after a three-week delay, on 24 November 1942. The documents which cost the lives of Fasson and Grazier proved to be particularly important in breaking the Naval Enigma M4. The version of the short weather cipher recovered was the Eisenach version. Unlike the first version Weimar, the Eisenach did not list the 26 rotor positions that were indicated by a letter, to be used in enciphering weather reports. Thus, Hut 8 cryptanalysts thought that all four rotors were used to encipher weather reports. Testing on the Bombes began to surface weather kisses (identical messages in two cryptosystems). On 13 December 1942, a crib obtained using the Short Weather Cipher gave a key with the Naval Enigma M4 rotatable Umkehrwalze (reversing roller or reflector) in the neutral position, making it equivalent to a standard Enigma and thus making B-Dienst messages potentially breakable on existing bombes. Hut 8 learned that the 4-letter indicators for regular U-boat messages were the same as 3-letter indicators for weather messages the same day, except for one extra letter. This meant that once the key was found for a weather message on any day, the fourth rotor had to be only tested in 26 positions to find the full 4-letter key. By {{the end of the day}} on Sunday 13 December, Rodger Winn of the Submarine Tracking Room at Bletchley Park knew that Shark Enigma Cipher was broken.|$|E
