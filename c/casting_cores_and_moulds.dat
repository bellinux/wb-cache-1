40|$|The {{development}} of the foundry technology {{in the last years}} is shaped by the equilibrium between economics and ecology. The quality requirements to the castings, like good surfaces, dimensional stability and minimization of the sand induced defects, have to be fulfilled. On the other hand economical (binder costs) and environmental conditions thereby should not be ignored. Regarding the variety of materials applied in the foundry such as silica sand, bentonite, lustrous carbon former, organic binder systems etc. shows that the quantity and the variety of the developed pollutants must be many times larger. These can occur during the entire production process. In the context of this thesis fundamental chemical aspects of the pollutant formation from <b>core</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulding</b> sand systems on a laboratory scale were investigated. The steps during the casting process were simulated with the help of simple experimental arrangements. In these experimental arrangements the thermal stress of defined quantities of <b>core</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulding</b> sand took place. The pyrolysis products developing thereby were detected and characterized by chemical analytics. In a first step based on the spectrum of emitted pyrolysis products the connections between the chemistry of the macromolecular binder systems and their decomposition behaviour was qualitatively described. This part served to answer to the questions “What can develop?”(emission potential of the binder) and “What part of it really develops?” (type of the emitted or absorbed materials). The reaction-kinetic approach to the pyrolytical processes in <b>core</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulding</b> sands supplied a picture of the temporal and mechanistical proceeding of the emission and absorption of the pollutants. The questions about the moment of developing pollutants (“When develops it?”) and about their formation mechanisms (“How develops it?”) can be answered thereby. Finally the obtained results were expressed in a mathematical form. This enables quantification and comparability of the binder and process parameters. Structures and patterns of the experimental data record were worked out by the application of statistical methods...|$|R

Further aims {{for research and development}} are to investigate the influence of reclaimed waterglass-sand on other core binder systems, additionally the influence of waterglass-bound sand on the moulding sand bound with bentonite. Waterglass-bound sands with small additions of bentonite showed good results, because residual compressive strength was significantly reduced compared to sands without additional to bentonite. Drying by microwave was more effective than hardening by CO_ 2. Reclaimed waterglass-bound sand could be used completely in the same system (monosystem) without problems. Some types of reclaimed sand systems with organic binders could only be used in the waterglass process, if they were dried by microwaves.

40|$|M. Tech. (Metallurgy) Abstract: In {{the last}} decade, {{the growing demand}} for {{ecological}} and economical casting processes {{has led to the}} promotion and continuous interest in the non-toxic and cheap, inorganic binders in foundry <b>core</b> making <b>and</b> <b>moulding</b> processes. The new generation inorganic binders usually come in two parts, part one is the binder and part two is a breakdown agent. There is a knowledge gap on the strength development and residual strength of the one component new generation inorganic binders in South Africa. The relationship of performance and residual strength is also unknown with local silica sands from different geological origins in South Africa. The foundrymen have limited knowledge on the strength development and residual strength that can be obtained from new generation single component inorganic binders. This study provides information to foundries and binder manufacturers on strength development and residual strength of single component inorganic binder systems with different local sands. The methodology of the study was achieved through experimental work in the laboratory and a casting trial in a local foundry. The laboratory experiments involved characterisation of the silica sands, strength development and residual strength testing of the binder with different sands and curing processes. The findings of the study did show that the different sand sources show different strength development and residual strength. The new generation single component inorganic binders can achieve good strength development when using a sand with good physical and chemical characteristics. The no bake ester cured achieved a highest strength of 280 N/cm 2 after 24 hours. The carbon dioxide cured achieved a highest strength of 164 N/cm 2 after 24 hours with minimal gassing time. The heat cured achieved a highest strength of 419 N/cm 2. The results indicate good strength development. High temperature residual strength of these binders is relatively low ranging from 0 - 31 N/cm 2 depending on the curing method and silica sand source.

Therefore research concentrates on solutions of long known problems, like an easier removal of complex or ceramic cores increasing thus the productivity and {{the reduction of the}} gas evolution of organic binder material during casting, with benefits for both the productivity and the ecological balance. This doctoral thesis develops a new way of meeting the above mentioned requirements by introducing a new binder material named “Carbon AeroSands”. Carbon AeroSands are a composite material of carbon aerogels, used as the binder, and conventional foundry sands. The basis of carbon aerogels are polymeric aerogels which are converted to carbon by a suitable pyrolysis procedure. Such a procedure for composites of foundry sands with polymeric aerogels was developed in this thesis leading to a new <b>core</b> <b>and</b> <b>mould</b> material with sufficient mechanical stability. The experimental investigations performed looked in detail at the microstructure of the composite and the carbon aerogel inside the binder bridges, reactions between the aerogel and the sands during pyrolysis, the bending and compression strength, the thermal conductivity, the porosity and specific inner surface. The degassing of the Carbon- Aerosands during Al-casting was investigated and revealed that this new binder material has outstanding low gas evolution compared to conventional polymeric binders. Procedures could be developed to fully oxidize and degrade the carbon aerogel binder at temperatures even in the range of typical solution and homogenization treatments of aluminium cast alloys. Test castings of real components conclude the characterization and show the potential for applications in light metal and steel castings...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: most endodontically treated teeth need post <b>and</b> <b>core</b> {{restoration}} to do acceptablepercentage {{of their}} function but selection of proper post <b>and</b> <b>core</b> {{system can be}} difficult andambiguous. this study compared the effect of <b>cast</b> post <b>and</b> <b>core</b> <b>and</b> fiberglass post <b>and</b> <b>core</b> systemon the fracture resistance and fracture pattern of crowned endodontically treated teeth. Material and method: A total of 30 recently extracted human canines with their crown removedwere endodontically treated. Two groups of 15 specimens were formed. Teeth were restored withcast post core in the 1 st group and with fiberglass post in the 2 ndgroup. All posts were cementedwith panavia F 2 adhesive system. All fiber posts were restored with composite core. Cemented withzinc phosphate cement. Each specimen embedded in acrylic resin and then scored in universal load-testing machine (Instron). A compressive load was applied at a 45 angle to the long axis of thetooth until fracture at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Result: the Fracture resistance of 2 groups according to the (t) test analysis didn't have anysignificant difference. The mean fracture resistance of the teeth restored with cast - post systemwere 1489. 33 ± 1045. 34 and facture resistance of the teeth restored with fiber glass were 1195. 93 ± 624. 12. teeth restored with cast post exhibited higher fracture resistance than the other group. Fracture that occur in teeth restored with fiberglass post <b>and</b> composite <b>core</b> usually arerestorable <b>and</b> % 80 of fracture that occur in teeth restored with <b>cast</b> post <b>and</b> <b>core</b> are notrestorable. Discussion: considering that fracture resistance of teeth in tow groups evaluated in this studywere not significantly different and fracture of tooth restored with Fiber glass post were from apoint that was more easily restorable, compare to <b>cast</b> post <b>and</b> <b>core</b> if seems reasonable to useFiber glass post in appropriate cases. Although it is suggested to do and evaluate other clinicalstudy's in long term. Key word: Post <b>and</b> <b>Core</b> technique, Fiber glass post, fracture resistanc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the fast}} moving {{technological}} world, few researchers {{are trying to}} formulate systems with automatic mould design processes {{in order to reduce}} <b>mould</b> design <b>and</b> development time and produce a consistent mould's quality. Currently, no commercial software are able to generate <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity without user intervention during the process. Thus, an algorithm is proposed in this research to automatically generate <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity of <b>moulds</b> by using slicing and Boolean-based approach. A 3 D moulded part in a standard CAD file format is used as an input for the algorithm and the output is presented as a set of <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity in 3 D model. Two criteria to define the best generated <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity are considered at this stage which is undercut and floating lump...|$|R
