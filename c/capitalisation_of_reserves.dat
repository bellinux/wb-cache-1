40|$|The {{coal seam}} gas {{industry}} {{is an important}} and rapidly developing sector of the Australian mining industry and {{the economy as a}} whole. This sector provides an excellent site to test the relevance of the Hotelling Valuation Principle (HVP) in explaining the market <b>capitalisation</b> <b>of</b> this industry sector. In addition, the test enabled the test <b>of</b> which <b>reserve</b> classification best explains the market <b>capitalisation</b> <b>of</b> firms in the industry. Currently, the majority of listed firms in this sector do not have positive cash flows from the sale of gas. The HVP posits that market values are a function <b>of</b> company <b>reserves.</b> We test five measures <b>of</b> firm <b>reserves</b> as explanations <b>of</b> market <b>capitalisation.</b> After controlling for scale differences, we find that 2 P Reserves have the highest explanatory power. No other measure <b>of</b> <b>reserves</b> or resources plays any significant role in explaining market capitalisation. We conclude that the effort and cost undertaken by the industry in arriving at classification below the reserves category, the contingent and possible resource classification, has no meaning to capital markets...|$|R

40|$|Low {{availability}} of phosphorus (P) {{is a major}} constraint to legume production, and efforts are being made to identify legume genotypes with tolerance to low P and greater P use efficiency (PUE). Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) genotypes vary in their adaptation to low-P soils. In order to investigate to what extent this variation {{may be related to}} PUE for symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF), five genotypes, Adrar, El Kala, Djenet, Tizi Ouzou and Bejaia, were grown in semihydroponic culture with sufficient versus deficient P supply. At the flowering stage, the biomass of plants and nodules and their P contents was determined after measuring the quantity of N 2 fixed. The results showed that nodule and shoot biomass were less when P was deficient. The genotypes that presented the maximum growth during the experiment presented a high efficiency in use of the rhizobial symbiosis calculated as the slope of plant biomass regression as a function of nodulation. Under P-deficiency, efficiency in use of P for SNF was significantly increased in the genotypes El Kala, Djenet and Adrar and accompanied with an increase of the efficiency in use of the rhizobial symbiosis. Hence the large differences show that traits for more P uptake-efficient plants exist in the tested cowpea genotypes. This opens the possibility to breed for more P uptakeefficient varieties as a way to bring more sparingly soluble soil P into cycling in crop production and obtain <b>capitalisation</b> <b>of</b> soil P <b>reserves...</b>|$|R
