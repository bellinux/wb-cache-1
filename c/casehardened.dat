40|$|Lumber drying is {{the most}} energy and time {{consuming}} process within the rubberwood lumber industry. The aim ofthis study was to develop an effective drying schedule for rubberwood lumber by accelerating the moisture movement out oflumber without degrading the lumber during drying. The study explored the effect of dry bulb temperature (60 oC, 75 oC and 90 oC), steaming {{at the beginning of}} drying, predrying of lumber prior to drying, and top loading of lumber on the dryingcharacteristics and lumber quality (bow, crook, twist, end splitting and color) of 30 mm thick rubberwood lumber under thetarget EMC at 4 % and air velocity of 4 m/s. Accelerated conventional temperature drying of lumber at 90 oC reduced thedrying time by ~ 50 % from 117 hours to 54 hours but increased the energy consumption by 22 % with respect to the conventionaltemperature drying at 60 oC. The average activation energy for drying was 26 kJ/mol. Drying temperature had verylittle effect on quality of lumber after drying (bow, crook, twist, end splitting and color). Steaming at the beginning of dryingand predrying of lumber prior to drying reduced and increased the percentage of end splitting, respectively. A top load ofabout 300 kg/m 2 slightly decreased twist.

40|$|European spruce (Picea abies Karst.) {{belongs to}} the most easily dried wood species, but {{nevertheless}} cracking and warping often reduce the quality of dried sawnwood. Larger surface and end crackingwas noticed at industrial drying practice in cold winter season, especially in using fast drying schedules.

40|$|ABSTRACT Final {{conditioning}} of 25 mm thick dried E. camaldulensis lumber {{was carried}} out in small capacity batch drying kiln in laboratory, and the elastic (EL) strain and mechano-sorptive (MS) strain was analyzed by slicing method. Mean moisture content(MC) of boards increases 2. 5 - 3. 0 %, while surface MC increases from 9. 8 % to 14. 2 % and center MC always keeps at 12. 3 % or so. Difference of each slice oven-dried length, through the thickness of the board decreases with the going on of conditioning. Compressive EL strain in the surface decreases significantly during the first 9 h of conditioning, and tensile EL strain in the center doesn&# 8242;t change significantly with the going on of conditioning. Compressive EL strain of sub-surface is greater than that of surface during middle and final period of conditioning, so reverse stress gradient is formed. <b>Casehardened</b> surface is softened by moisture picking-up and then complementary shrinkage makes EL strain and MS strain decrease, but because of the effect of drying history, the change of MS strain lags behind that of M...|$|E
40|$|Abstract At {{the plant}} of Outokumpu Stainless Tubular Products AB in Molkom {{a wide range}} of butt weld {{fittings}} are produced. These are aimed mainly for the process industries and one of the products are ninety degree bend elbows in various dimensions. The elbows are made from stainless sheet metal and when formed to a tube they need to be welded along its inner radius. This is made by a pick and place type industrial robot working in a closed compartment. The assignment given by Outokumpu aims to investigate and suggest a new concept for a more reliable manufacturing process within the work cell.   The cell consists of five main areas chronologically listed as passed by the elbow: ·          Automated, vibrating conveyor. ·          Fixture with the purpose to serve the robot with one elbow at a time, placed in the correct position. ·          Industrial robot to pick up the elbow and drag it along the welding head. ·          TIG inverter with a stationary welding head·          A hydraulic press with a template of the final shape of the elbow corrects flaws.  Almost every problem in the cell and defects on the products coming out of it {{can be traced back to}} the fixture and in some cases also to the robots pick up tooling. The focus of the task was therefore put mainly on those two areas. As the work proceeded Outokumpu chose to develop a new tool for the robot themselves which they did with good results. I chose to incorporate it into my study and change focus to the fixture instead.   The problems and possible causes to them were identified and discussed with my tutor: The elbows fall incorrectly into or beside of the fixture.   Fixtures are old and worn down. The elbows path between conveyor and fixture are somewhat out of control The smaller dimensions have room enough to slip past the fixture. Edges to be welded are to far from each other or badly shaped Commissioning time, some start up steps is more complex then they need to be. Some of the setting possibilities in the working cell are unnecessary and can be fixed instead. The positions of pick up and welding head are not really fixed in the robot software, these are reprogrammed every time elbow size are changed. ·          Various errors at weldingo    Robot managed to pick incorrectly placed elbow   Proposals to solve the above specified problems: All parts in contact with the elbows are to be made of harden able steel. A suitable one is C 45 E which can be <b>casehardened</b> to about 700 HV. On the outer edge of the conveyer a support are placed to prevent excessive wear. The fixture is partially redesigned with a support to control the elbows path better. Guide arms with dual purpose are added. First they guide the elbow into the fixture and secondly they turn it to the correct angle towards the robot. Pins are used along with quick lock clamps to obtain faster and easier commissioning.

40|$|Troubleshooting {{the causes}} of bandsaw {{cracking}} {{is not a simple}} matter. An in-depth understanding of sawfiling practices is required for efficient operation and maintenance of bandsaws for sawmilling. Bandsaw cracking can result from one or several factors. The following information and checklist provide a starting point for sawfilers in determining causes of cracking in bandsaws that are 6 in. and wider. Front cracks can result from the following problems: 1. Allowing the wheels to wear round at the front, or tracking the saw too far off the front, either of which will leave the front edge unsupported 2. <b>Casehardening</b> the throats of teeth by using a grinding wheel unduly hard, running at too high a speed, or feeding too rapidly to the saw 3. Cross-aligning the wheels 4. Improper tension with the saw too open (i. e., too large a tension radius) just below the teeth Center cracks in line 2 to 3 in. back from the points of teeth are generally caused by tracking the saw too far forward of the wheels or by rounded wheels on the front edge, or both. Barring accidents and incompetence, a 12 -in. -wide 14 -gauge saw on 8 -ft wheels should never crack within a reasonable lifetime, and should wear down to at least 10 or even 8 in. in width. It is not good practice to put a narrow 14 -gauge saw that was previously run on 8 -ft wheels onto smaller wheels. The sawfiler must always check to see that saws have uniform tension, proper pitch (to prevent crowding the back on the wheels), properly aligned wheels, perfectly square or balanced swaging, perfect side dressing (to provide suitable side clearance), rounded gullets, and sharp teeth with points free of glaze or <b>casehardening.</b> Vibration increases undue bandsaw strain. Consequently, particular attention needs to be given to the wheels, their shafts, and bearings. Wheels must be round and balanced, and shafts must be free of play. Occasionally, sawfilers can determine causes of cracking from past knowledge of the bandsaw’s performance. When this does not work, however, the accompanying checklist can be used to systematically check off potential causes until, by the process of elimination, the actual cause is found...|$|R

Silva Fennica 41 (4) : 717 – 730. Deformations of timber, caused mainly by anisotropic shrinkage, can be partially directed by controlling annual ring orientation through different sawing patterns. Ring orientation also affects {{the movement of}} water from within the board to its surface, with rapidity of drying having implications for the wood colour. Here sawn silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) timber was classed into two groups according to ring orientation. Two drying methods were used. The final moisture content was lower and the colour lighter in dried boards with radial than with tangential flats, but deformations were larger in radial than in tangential boards. Both drying and ring orientation affected the final moisture content and moisture gradient of the boards. Very small differences in board sizes or shape {{had an effect on}} both colour and deformations.

Hardening and tempering process {{are used as}} a major heat treatment method. The purpose of heat treatment of low carbon steel {{is to improve the}} ductility, toughness, hardness and tensile strength. Hardening and tempering process of metals offer enormous advantages to the manufacturing industry because the heat treatment results can reveal optimum combination of mechanical properties. In this research, Ni-Cr-Mo alloys have been chosen for this purpose of investigate the characteristics of hardness and tensile strength of the low carbon alloy steel specimen. The steel samples were heat treated in electric furnaces (for carburizing, <b>casehardening</b> and tempering processes) at different temperature levels and soaking to the particular time and then cooled in quenching media. The specimens were heat treated at 9000 C for 1 hr and the specimen then undergone to tempering process for different temperature level such as 2500 C, 3500 C, 4500 C and 5500 C for different tempering time (60 min, 75 min and 90 min). The hardness properties of the treated and untreated samples were determined using standard operating procedures. All heat treatment components were checked for rockwell hardness and tensile strength. The experimental results revealed that mechanical properties of selective alloy were significantly changed by tempering treatment. By increasing the tempering time and temperature, hardness value decreases gradually also ductility increases simultaneously.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if an in-kiln monitoring system based on the acoustic emission rates of wood as it dries could be developed to monitor the traditional kiln drying process. Recording the acoustic emission rates for each of the kiln steps and then analyzing the recorded data with statistical process control (SPC) provided the means to monitor the wood drying process;The study examined the acoustic emission rates of Quecus macrocarpa Michx. (bur oak) as it was dried in a 500 board foot commercial kiln using the white oak drying schedule presented in the Dry Kiln Operator 2 ̆ 7 s Manual. Polyvinylidene fluoride film was used as the acoustic emission (AE) sensor to pick up the AE given off as the wood dried. The first seven steps of the kiln schedule were monitored for AE. The last two steps, equalizing and conditioning, were not monitored;A typical AE wave form was captured using a digital storage oscilloscope and printer. The wave form was analyzed and interpreted;It was found that significant differences existed between the mean acoustic emission rates of the first seven kiln steps. Nineteen differences were found;Statistical process control charts were created for the first seven kiln steps. The control charts indicate that steps one, four, six, and seven had a controlled drying process while steps two, three, and five had uncontrolled variations in the drying process;A slice test was done to identify the amount of stress/strain buildup in the kiln samples. Normal results were found. In the early stages of drying, the shell was in tensile stress and the core was in compressive stress. Approximately midway through the drying process the shell reversed to compressive stress and the core reversed to tensile stress;The slice test identified compressive and tensile stress. However, when the prong test was performed at the end of the drying process, no <b>casehardening</b> was found.

40|$|The study {{provides}} an overview of Mozambique timber sector, descriptive and comparative wood anatomy, drying experiments and interrelationships between mechanics, density and anatomical features of lesser used species from Mozambique. Exhaustive literature review described the timber sector as dominated by few hardwood species selectively harvested from a forest containing 118 potential wood species. The survey discussed the need to revert the current situation by proposing studies on lesser used timbers to enlarge the resource base and ensure sustainable logging practices. Afterwards, based on growing stock reported in the forest inventory, three lesser used timbers namely ntholo (Pseudolachnostylis maprounaefolia Pax), metil (Sterculia appendiculata K. Schum) and muanga (Pericopsis angolensis Meeuwen) were selected and subjected to descriptive and comparative wood anatomical studies aiming to understand their structure with regard to prospective end uses. Classical methods of wood sectioning and both light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used. The results showed that ntholo and muanga are characterized by diffuse porosity, indistinct growth rings, 18 vessel/mm 2, extractives in heartwood vessels, ray width (1 - 3 cells), % fibre proportion (ntholo 57 %; muanga 58 %). This set of anatomical features typifies dense timbers with recognized strength and good natural durability. Metil has shown wood structure characterized by very wide vessels without extractives recorded in low density (< 5 vessels/mm 2), ground tissues dominated by thin-walled axial parenchyma (50 - 61 %) and fibre proportion (17 - 27 %). Metil wood anatomy is typical for light timbers with poor natural durability. Nevertheless, metil timber seems easy to impregnate with wood preservatives as demonstrated by the high uptake of 463 kg/m 3. In addition, the study carried out drying experiments on ntholo boards aimed to assign adequate drying schedule. The experiment was conducted in two stages, i. e. non-symmetrical drying tests (NSD) and laboratory batch kiln drying (LBK). NSD was intended to select provisional schedule and LBK to test the performance of the selected schedule based on European standards. The results from NSD assigned provisional schedule (T 6 -D 2) corresponding to other tropical timbers with similar drying behaviour. The LBK lasted 266 h and ensured standard quality drying described by 8. 9 % final moisture content, a gradient of 1. 2 % and 1. 2 mm of <b>casehardening.</b> Minor deformations were recorded and twist was the largest with an average of 3. 4 mm. However, in general, the drying experiment can be regarded as successful since it provided background for industrial drying. Finally, the study determined ntholo timber mechanics and thereafter examined interrelationships with density and anatomical features of ntholo through correlation and regression analysis. The results show that ntholo is a very dense timber with high mechanical strength in comparison to well known timbers. Correlation analysis revealed fibre length as the only anatomical feature significantly correlated to density and all tested mechanical properties of ntholo. The number of vessels/mm 2 and %vessels were not significantly correlated to any of the measured properties but appeared to be key anatomical features for predictions under regression analysis. All tested properties of ntholo sapwood seemed to be influenced mainly by ground tissue proportions, while heartwood properties were described by more leveled anatomical predictors. The regression analyses show that both ntholo sapwood and heartwood densities are poor predictors for the tested mechanical properties, although may provide rough indication of tested properties given the observed correlations. The integrated analysis of results from the timber sector review, wood anatomy, drying behaviour and mechanical properties are expected to form a reliable background for a successful utilization of the relatively lesser explored timbers from Mozambique...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} the wood properties of Populus "androscoggin" (Populus trichocarpa X Populus maximowiczii) grown {{in a river}} bed plantation near Timaru. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine some general characteristics of the tree viz. diameter over bark, diameter under bark, bark thickness, eccentricity and the diameter of heartwood. (2) {{to improve the quality}} of sawn timber by drying the timber so as to reduce the effect of tension wood and growth stresses in poplar. Thirty trees were selected for this study 15 leaning trees and 15 straight trees. The study was conducted in three parts: (1) disk analysis to determine the general wood characteristics (2) determining drying characteristics based on the quality of dried flitches (3) determining the quality of dried boards after remanufacture. In the first part of the study sample disks were removed at three heights from each tree to examine the variation within the tree. The mean number of annual rings at the butt of the tree was 16 in the case of leaning trees and 17 in straight trees. The growth rate (ring width (mm)) of the leaning trees was not statistically different from the growth rate of straight thickness. It was found that thickness was positively correlated with the diameter over bark. Bark thickness also has a positive relationship with heartwood diameter and negative relationship with height. The average green moisture content of individual trees ranged from 109 % to 146 %. The moisture content decreased from the butt green to the top of the tree. A positive relationship was found between the green moisture content and the proportion of heartwood (heartwood diameter/the diameter under bark). The green density followed a similar trend to that of the distribution of green moisture content, and decreased from the butt to the top of the tree. Basic density values in the 30 trees were, - butt: 320 to 380 Kg/m³ - middle: 340 to 410 Kg/m³ - top: 360 to 430 Kg/m³. It was found that the distribution of basic density based on the "direction" in the tree was different in straight trees and leaning trees. In leaning trees the basic density of the "side" was statistically different from that of the "opposite" direction, whereas in straight trees there were no differences between directions. It was also found that the basic density of leaning trees was higher than the basic density of straight trees. Within the stem, basic density was negatively correlated with the heartwood proportion, negatively correlated with the average ring width, and positively correlated with its eccentricity. In the second part of the study, the logs from the butt and the top were converted into flitches. The flitches were then dried using six drying schedules. One of the drying options (dehumidifying) was not completed due to time limitations. Air drying schedule which was begun on 24 April 1989 finished on 30 March 1990 (11 months), with the average moisture content ranging from 17. 2 % to 25. 8 %. The other four categories of drying options were low temperature drying (40 °C), conventional drying I (60 °C), conventional drying II (80 °C) and high temperature drying (115 °C). When dried at low temperature the boards showed minor defects (warping), conventional drying I and conventional drying II decreased the drying time but the effect on defects was not significant. High temperature drying decreased the drying time and also decreased the amount on warp of the dried flitches. More boards were rejected from leaning trees than from straight trees. More boards were rejected from bottom logs than from top logs. Volumetric shrinkage was not affected by the type of tree nor the location of the board within the tree. On the other hand drying methods (temperature) had an effect on volumetric shrinkage. Below 100 °C, it was noted positively that the volumetric shrinkage was correlated with temperature, whereas at high temperatures (> 100 °C) the opposite was true. This result suggested that the allowance before sawing processes should be made in accordance with the drying methods. The higher the temperature (below 100 °C) the higher the allowance. The rejection rate showed a positive relationship with the volumetric shrinkage. In the third part of the study, 5 samples from each treatment were selected then remanufactured and the distortion measured. The result after remanufacture was different from that obtained in the second part of the study. The high temperature drying showed a high amount of bowing in remanufactured boards. This indicated that <b>casehardening</b> was present in these boards, and suggested that more reconditioning was needed for this schedule (up to 10 hours instead of 6 hours). Colour was darkened and there was loss of brightness at higher temperatures. The high temperature drying also produce a "caramel” like odour. This made the boards unsuitable for asparagus containers. Wetwood may be present in the boards used in this study, since the final moisture content varied greatly between and within the boards. Further research of this abnormal wood is needed to clarify this problem. This study also suggested that the drying methods should consider the requirement of the final product. Timber intended for manufacture of asparagus containers was suitably processed by conventional drying I or conventional drying II, whereas for other end uses (where the odour and colour were not primarily important) high temperature drying was found to be suitable used in conjunction with an increased reconditioning schedule...|$|R
