40|$|In {{addition}} to being the single greatest known environmental cause of cancer, cigarette smoke (CS) is also {{a major contributor to}} heart disease. We reported previously that 1) inhalation of either mainstream or sidestream CS promotes aortic arteriosclerotic plaque development; 2) 1, 3 butadiene, a vapor-phase component of CS, promotes plaque development at 20 ppm, which at the time was only 2 times higher than the threshold limit value; and 3) individual tar fraction carcinogens in CS, including polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrosamines, either do not promote plaque development or do so only at high concentrations. These results suggested that the tar fraction is not the primary source of plaque-promoting agents in CS. We asked whether repeated exposure to the tar fraction of CS, collected in a <b>cold</b> trap (<b>TAR),</b> promotes plaque development in an avian model of arteriosclerosis. Acetone extracts of mainstream CS tar from burning, unfiltered reference cigarettes were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and injected weekly into cockerels for 16 weeks (25 mg/kg/week). Positive controls were injected weekly with the synthetic PAH carcinogen, 7, 12 dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA) dissolved in DMSO and negative controls were injected with DMSO. Plaque location and prevalence did not differ from group to group. Morphometric analysis of plaque cross-sectional areas showed that plaque sizes, which are log-normally distributed, were significantly larger in the DMBA cockerels compared to both the TAR and DMSO groups. There {{were no significant differences in}} plaque size between DMSO and TAR cockerels. The results reported here, combined with other recent findings, support the conclusion that the primary arteriosclerotic plaque-promoting components of CS are in the vapor phase...|$|R
40|$|THE {{possibility}} that burning {{may play a}} role in the origin of certain cancers in man was suggested by Marjolin (1846). Subsequently a comprehensive study by Treves and Pack (1930) recorded twenty-nine cases of epidermoid and basal cell carcinomnas arising in burn scars. These authors took particular note of the division of these cases into two groups, those with a relatively rapid onset following the burn, and those in which the carcinoma occurred as long as thirty-five years later. Several experiments on the possible effects of burning and heat in skin carcinogenesis have yielded contradictory results; thus Kreyberg (1927) and Derom (1924) found no effect of cauterisation on tar tumor induction, although Bang (1925) induced two carcinomas in the mouse with cauterisation alone. Raposo (1928) and Choldin (1930) obtained contradictory results on the effects of hot rather than <b>cold</b> coal <b>tar.</b> Rondoni and Corbellini (1936) studied the effects of cauterisation on skin carcinogenesis in the mouse with 1, 2, 5, 6 -dibenzacridine and had results suggestive of some augmenting effect. In a previous study (Shubik, 1950) the action of cauterisation on the skin of mice pretreated with a single subeffective dose of the carcinogen 9, 10 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (that is, as a promoting agent) has been examined with negative results. Since these experiments and clinical observations all seem to suggest a definite role for burning in the origin of some neoplasias a re-investigation of the problem has been undertaken. On this occasion burning has been studied as a possible initiating factor, using croton oil as the promoting agent. Since the question of anoxia in relationship to neoplastic change has often been raised (Warburg, 1930; Goldblatt and Cameron, 1953) it was decided to investigate the action of temporary occlusion of the blood supply to the skin of mice as another possible initiating stimulus...|$|R
40|$|Dual {{fluidized}} bed (DFB) gasification of biomass generates numerous species with large differences in-size and boiling point. At the heavier (tar) end, the produced species range from benzene to coronene: In this work, {{a method for}} elucidating the pathways of tar evolution is, applied to previously presented measurements that satisfy the carbon, balance of the Chalmers 2 - 4 -MW DFB gasifier. In addition to quantifying the <b>cold</b> gas and <b>tar,</b> the measurements yield information regarding the amount and C, O, H composition of unknown condensable species (UCS). The reaction pathways were identified by means of fitting a model to the performed measurements. The employed solver varies freely the reaction rate coefficients of three global reactions (mimicking dissociation and reactions with hydrogen and steam) per modeled group, {{as well as the}} carbon distribution coefficients within a predefined reaction scheme. The mature tar (excluding primary tar) spectrum is divided into phenols, furans, benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and one-, two-, and three-ring aromatic components. In addition, UCS that are considered to contain primary tar are divided into four subgroups, to encompass two levels of reactivity with varying composition. Ultimately, the solver converges, yielding a reaction scheme that is based on the findings of earlier works and that describes the creation of mature tar from UCS. Furthermore, the importance of individual reaction routes is discerned for the pertinent measurements. Thus, it is demonstrated that the maturation of secondary tar species (e. g., toluene and phenol) is not in itself sufficient to describe the formation of the tar spectrum...|$|R

40|$|Biomass gasification, {{which is}} a primary process step in the {{production}} of biofuels, yields a combustible gas mixture (raw gas). This raw gas consists {{of a wide range of}} species, from permanent gases to condensable hydrocarbons, which are collectively known as tar. Considered as the Achilles heel of biomass gasification, tar starts to condense at temperatures of around 350 °C, causing blockage and fouling of downstream equipment. In addition to creating operational difficulties, tar is responsible for a loss of efficiency if it is not successfully converted into permanent gases. Consequently, there is a need to understand the concepts underlying tar formation and evolution, so as to guide efforts towards reducing its yield, as well as towards facilitating its removal once formed. This requires accurate quantification of all the components of the produced raw gas to evaluate the behavior of the tar. However, as the produced gas comprise such a wide range of species, several different measurement techniques are required. In this work, the effects of catalytic materials on tar were investigated in two different systems. The observed responses motivated the development of improved measurement systems, directed to fulfilling the mass balance of the gasifier. These systems were subsequently implemented to map the behaviors of the various species of the raw gas, for a range of process parameters, and to derive a reaction scheme for all the condensable species. The concepts of primary and secondary measures were studied by introducing a catalytic material directly into the Chalmers dual fluidized bed (DFB) gasifier (primary measure) and by utilizing an additional reactor for catalytic reforming of the raw gas (secondary measure). Overall, both measures resulted in significantly decreased levels of tar. However, the composition of the remaining tar differed for the two measures, as did the added amounts of oxygen. The SPA method for tar measurement was evaluated for reproducibility, which was found to be well within 10 % for the majority of the measured species. In addition, the detection limits of the SPA method have been extended throughout this work and currently extend from benzene to coronene. A high-temperature reactor, for thermal cracking of all the gas species into CO, CO 2, H 2, and H 2 O, was constructed to measure the total elemental yields of C, H, O, and N in the raw gas. This measurement allowed a mass balance for the system to be constructed, which combined with the <b>cold</b> gas and <b>tar</b> measurements, was used to obtain information regarding the yields and composition of previously unmeasured condensable species. This group contained a level of carbon similar to that found in the SPA-measured tar, thereby underlining the need for quantification through standard measurements. ii The developed measurement equipment was used to map the behavior of the gasifier under various temperatures, residence times, and steam-to-fuel ratios. The performed measurements showed that not only are the previously unmeasured species important for fulfilling the mass balance of the gasifier, but also for describing the formation of SPA-measureable tar. Subsequent modeling of the tar formation and evolution for the measured cases revealed that a substantial fraction of these species tends to form tertiary SPA tar directly, as these species are reformed. Furthermore, it was shown that additional factors, presumably related to the aging of the bed material, can significantly affect the reactivity of the gasifier and should be quantified to improve the functionality of the model...|$|R
