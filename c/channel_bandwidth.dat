25|$|Frequency (subcarrier) {{interleaving}} increases {{resistance to}} frequency-selective channel {{conditions such as}} fading. For example, when {{a part of the}} <b>channel</b> <b>bandwidth</b> fades, frequency interleaving ensures that the bit errors that would result from those subcarriers in the faded part of the bandwidth are spread out in the bit-stream rather than being concentrated. Similarly, time interleaving ensures that bits that are originally close together in the bit-stream are transmitted far apart in time, thus mitigating against severe fading as would happen when travelling at high speed.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic problem}} facing {{designers}} of color televisions was this: Sending each {{frame of the}} moving image meant sending three signals, red, green and blue. The sequential systems, like Baird's earlier efforts, sent the three images one after another. In order for motion to appear smooth, images must change at least 16 times a second. To reduce flicker, over 40 frames per second (fps) is mandatory. In sequential systems, each color requires a separate field. For this reason, very high refresh (field) rates were necessary. CBS' system refreshed at 144fps. (Peter Goldmark's CBS team tried several field rates. Within the 6 MHz allowable <b>channel</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> the most acceptable rate was 144 fps. This rate made pictures incompatible with existing systems working at 50 or 60Hz.|$|E

The OFDM guard interval for TM I is 246 microseconds, {{which means that the}} overall OFDM symbol duration is 1.246 milliseconds.
