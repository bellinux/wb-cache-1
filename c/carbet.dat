25|$|Columbus made {{a fourth}} voyage, {{nominally}} {{in search of}} a westward passage to the Indian Ocean. Accompanied by his stepbrother Bartolomeo, Diego Mendez, and his son Fernando, he left Cádiz, Spain on May 12, 1502, with his flagship, Capitana, as well as the Gallega, Vizcaína, and Santiago de Palos. He sailed to Arzila on the Moroccan coast to rescue the Portuguese soldiers who he heard were under siege by the Moors. On June 15, 1502, they landed at <b>Carbet</b> on the island of Martinique (Martinica). A hurricane was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at Santo Domingo on June 29, 1502, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered {{at the mouth of the}} Jaina River, the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. The only ship to reach Spain had Columbus's money and belongings on it, and all of his former enemies (and a few friends) had drowned, including Francisco de Bobadilla, who'd had Columbus sent back to Spain in chains two years earlier.|$|E

The women adopted the surname <b>Carbet</b> and openly lived together as a lesbian couple and family with Claude's son, Peter. The pseudonym <b>Carbet,</b> was taken from the name of the Le <b>Carbet</b> district of Martinique and was a tangible representation of their identification with their homeland.
