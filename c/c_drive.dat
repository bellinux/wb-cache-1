State maintenance starts at the end of those ramps to <b>C</b> <b>Drive</b> North and runs to Eaton Avenue where the business loop turns southward to cross the freeway. The northern end of the business loop on Easton Avenue has five lanes (two in each direction with a center turn lane) running through a commercial area next to the freeway and continues with four lanes through residential neighborhoods southward to an intersection with M-199 (Austin Avenue). BL I-94 turns southeasterly along four-lane Austin Avenue for two blocks and then southward onto four-lane Superior Street. About five blocks farther south in downtown Albion, BL I-94 intersects M-99. The two highways turn eastward running concurrently along four-lane Michigan Avenue out of downtown. East of downtown, BL I-94/M-99 passes through residential areas and turns northeasterly at the intersection with Clark Street, narrowing to two lanes. The more rural section of Michigan Avenue carrying the business loop crosses into Parma Township in Jackson County. At exit124 on I-94, BL I-94 ends and M-99 continues northward.|$|E

The chopper circuit has a full-bridge configuration employing gate-turn-off (GTO) thyristors, and. is capable of four-quadrant operation, making the drive both reversible and regenerative. The control of motor speed is achieved by a completely digital technique, which does not require any analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog converters.

In DC drive Armature voltage control is preferred because of high efficiency and good speed regulation. But it can provide speed control only below base (rated) speed because the armature voltage cannot be allowed to exceed rated value. For speed control above base speed, field flux control is employed. In a separately excited motor, flux is controlled by varying voltage across field winding. The thyristor D. <b>C.</b> <b>drive</b> remains an important speedcontrolled industrial drive, especially where the higher maintenance cost associated with the D. C. motor brushes is tolerable.

40|$|Abstract –The Direct Torque Control (DTC) {{strategy}} {{is one of}} the best strategies of speed control of Induction Motor Drive (IMD). This scheme is simple in structure and produces fast and robust response in A. <b>C</b> <b>drive</b> system. How ever, this scheme is encountered with the possible problems of high torque, flux and current ripples. The deviation of electromagnetic torque from its reference value causes vibration and noise which reduces the efficiency of the drive. The Genetic Algorithm is recently getting growing importance in soft control applications. This paper focuses on the simulation of a Direct Torque Controlled Voltage Source Inverter-fed Induction Motor Drive employing a Refined Genetic Algorithm Controller (RGAC) to encounter the above problems and to devise a more effective method of speed control. Finally, the simulation results of Conventional DTC and RGAC-DTC drive are compared. It is observed that the torque and flux ripples are less in the proposed scheme and offers improved dynamic response.
