However, the evidence supporting the reliability of diagnosis and the efficacy of treatment in this field appears scientifically weak and inconsistent. To identify and critically evaluate the scientific literature dealing with the reliability of diagnosis and the clinical efficacy of techniques and therapeutic strategies used in <b>cranial</b> <b>osteopathy.</b> Relevant keywords were used to search the electronic databases MEDLINE, PEDro, OSTMED. DR, Cochrane Library, and in Google Scholar, Journal of American Osteopathy Association and International Journal of Osteopathic Medicine websites. Searches were conducted up to end June 2016 with no date restriction as to when the studies were completed. As a complementary approach we explored the bibliography of included articles and consulted available previous reviews dealing with this topic. Regarding diagnostic processes in <b>cranial</b> <b>osteopathy,</b> we analyzed studies that compared the results obtained by at least two examiners or by the same examiner {{on at least two}} occasions. For efficacy studies, only randomized-controlled-trials or crossover-studies were eligible. We excluded articles that were not in English or French, and for which the full-text version was not openly available. We also excluded studies with unsuitable study design, in which there was no clear indication of the use of techniques or therapeutic strategies concerning the cranial field, looked at combined treatments, used a non-human examiner and subjects or used healthy subjects for efficacy studies. There was no restriction regarding the type of disease. In our electronic search we found 1280 references concerning reliability of diagnosis studies plus four references via our complementary strategy. Based on the title 18 articles were selected for analysis. Nine were retained after applying our exclusion criteria. Regarding efficacy, we extracted 556 references from the databases plus 14 references through our complementary strategy. Based on the title 46 articles were selected. Thirty two articles were not retained on the grounds of our exclusion criteria. Risk of bias in reliability studies was assessed using {{a modified version of the}} quality appraisal tool for studies of diagnostic reliability. The methodological quality of the efficacy studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Two screeners conducted these analyses. For reliability studies, our analysis leads us to conclude that the diagnostic procedures used in <b>cranial</b> <b>osteopathy</b> are unreliable in many ways. For efficacy studies, the Cochrane risk of bias tool we used shows that 2 studies had a high risk of bias, 9 were rated as having major doubt regarding risk of bias and 3 had a low risk of bias. In the 3 studies with a low risk of bias alternative interpretations of the results, such as a non-specific effect of treatment, were not considered.

40|$|Abstract Background According to the {{original}} model of <b>cranial</b> <b>osteopathy,</b> intrinsic rhythmic movements {{of the human brain}} cause rhythmic fluctuations of cerebrospinal fluid and specific relational changes among dural membranes, cranial bones, and the sacrum. Practitioners believe they can palpably modify parameters of this mechanism to a patient's health advantage. Discussion This treatment regime lacks a biologically plausible mechanism, shows no diagnostic reliability, and offers little hope that any direct clinical effect will ever be shown. In spite of almost uniformly negative research findings, "cranial" methods remain popular with many practitioners and patients. Summary Until outcome studies show that these techniques produce a direct and positive clinical effect, they should be dropped from all academic curricula; insurance companies should stop paying for them; and patients should invest their time, money, and health elsewhere. </p...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Colic {{in infants}} leads {{one in six}} {{families}} (17 %) with children to consult a health professional. One systematic review of 15 community-based studies found a wide variation in prevalence, which depended on study design and method of recording. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic overview, aiming {{to answer the following}} clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for colic in infants? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview). RESULTS: At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 47 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 22 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 10 studies and the further review of 12 full publications. Of the 12 full articles evaluated, three systematic reviews and four RCTs were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for six PICO combinations. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic overview, we categorise the efficacy for seven interventions based on information relating to the effectiveness and safety of casein hydrolysate milk, <b>cranial</b> <b>osteopathy,</b> Lactobacillus reuteri (probiotic), low-lactose milk, soya-based infant feeds, spinal manipulation, and whey hydrolysate milk...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine if <b>cranial</b> <b>osteopathy</b> has an effect on visual function, and if that effect remained once the treatment was discontinued. Background. Although anecdotal evidence indicates that patients who undergo cranial osteopathic manipulation claim to experience an improvement in visual performance, there are few publications that demonstrate changes. Methods. Subjects were evaluated for cranial asymmetry and underwent optometric examination. The treatment group received cranial osteopathic manipulation, while the control group had a light pressure applied to their cranium. Subjects were reassessed for the presence of cranial dysfunction and underwent repeat optometric examination. This protocol was carried out for a total of 8 visits during the intervention phase. All subjects then returned for 8 follow-up visits during which only the optometric measurements were performed. A questionnaire was filled out by each subject after the intervention phase to assess the subject’s perception of group assignment. Results. There was a statistically significant main effect for visit time in 8 of the 12 parameters measured. There was also a statistically significant effect for control vs. treatment in 2 of the parameters measured. Conclusions. Our study failed to consistently demonstrate a statistically significant change in visual function with the use of cranial osteopathic manipulation over time. We did see a significant change in multiple visual function parameters over time within both the control and treatment groups. Based on our results, we propose that active motion testing during cranial osteopathic assessment affects the cranial system to a level that results in a measurable effect. Grants.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Infantile colic is {{a common}} disorder, {{affecting}} around one in six families, and in 2001 was reported to cost the UK National Health Service in excess of pound 65 million per year (Morris 2001). Although it usually remits by six months of age, {{there is some evidence}} of longer-term sequelae for both children and parents. Manipulative therapies, such as chiropractic and osteopathy, have been suggested as interventions to reduce the severity of symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the results of studies designed to address efficacy or effectiveness of manipulative therapies (specifically, chiropractic, osteopathy and cranial manipulation) for infantile colic in infants less than six months of age. SEARCH METHODS: We searched following databases: CENTRAL (2012, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to April Week 3 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 17), CINAHL (1938 to April 2012), PsycINFO (1806 to April 2012), Science Citation Index (1970 to April 2012), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to April 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (1990 to April 2012) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (1970 to April 2012). We also searched all available years of LILACS, PEDro, ZETOC, WorldCat, TROVE, DART-Europe, ClinicalTrials. gov and ICTRP (May 2012), and contacted over 90 chiropractic and osteopathic institutions around the world. In addition, we searched CentreWatch, NRR Archive and UKCRN in December 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials evaluating the effect of chiropractic, osteopathy or <b>cranial</b> <b>osteopathy</b> alone or in conjunction with other interventions for the treatment of infantile colic. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In pairs, five of the review authors (a) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, (b) extracted data from the included studies and (c) assessed the risk of bias for all included studies. Each article or study was assessed independently by two review authors. One review author entered the data into Review Manager software and the team's statistician (PP) reviewed the chosen analytical settings. MAIN RESULTS: We identified six studies for inclusion in our review, representing a total of 325 infants. There were three further studies that we could not find information about and we identified three other ongoing studies. Of the six included studies, five were suggestive of a beneficial effect and one found no evidence that manipulative therapies had any beneficial effect on the natural course of infantile colic. Tests for heterogeneity imply that there may be some underlying difference between this study and the other five. Five studies measured daily hours of crying and these data were combined, suggesting that manipulative therapies had a significant effect on infant colic - reducing average crying time by one hour and 12 minutes per day (mean difference (MD) - 1. 20; 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 1. 89 to - 0. 51). This conclusion is sustained even when considering only studies with a low risk of selection bias (sequence generation and allocation concealment) (MD - 1. 24; 95 % CI - 2. 16 to - 0. 33); those with a low risk of attrition bias (MD - 1. 95; 95 % CI - 2. 96 to - 0. 94), or only those studies that have been published in the peer-reviewed literature (MD - 1. 01; 95 % CI - 1. 78 to - 0. 24). However, when combining only those studies with a low risk of performance bias (parental 'blinding'), the improvement in daily crying hours was not statistically significant (MD - 0. 57; 95 % CI - 2. 24 to 1. 09). One study considered whether the reduction in crying time was clinically significant. This found that a greater proportion of parents of infants receiving a manipulative therapy reported clinically significant improvements than did parents of those receiving no treatment (reduction in crying to less than two hours: odds ratio (OR) 6. 33; 95 % CI 1. 54 to 26. 00; more than 30 % reduction in crying: OR 3. 70; 95 % CI 1. 15 to 11. 86). Analysis of data from three studies that measured 'full recovery' from colic as reported by parents found that manipulative therapies did not result in significantly higher proportions of parents reporting recovery (OR 11. 12; 95 % CI 0. 46 to 267. 52). One study measured infant sleeping time and found manipulative therapy resulted in statistically significant improvement (MD 1. 17; 95 % CI 0. 22 to 2. 12). The quality of the studies was variable. There was a generally low risk of selection bias but only two of the six studies were evaluated as being at low risk of performance bias, three at low risk of detection bias and one at low risk of attrition bias. One of the studies recorded adverse events and none were encountered. However, with only a sample of 325 infants, we have too few data to reach any definitive conclusions about safety. AUT...|$|E
