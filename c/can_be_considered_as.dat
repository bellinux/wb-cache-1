5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is driven by}} the {{sympathetic}} nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> a specialized sympathetic ganglion. Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidant dietary {{supplements}} do not improve health {{nor are they}} effective in preventing diseases as shown by randomized clinical trials including supplements of beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E singly or in different combinations having no effect on mortality rate or cancer risk. Supplementation with selenium or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular disease. Oxidative stress <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> either a cause or consequence of some diseases, an area of research stimulating drug development for antioxidant compounds for use as potential therapies.|$|E
5|$|Forty-two {{species of}} birds have been {{observed}} on the site, 25 of which are breeding there. Twenty-two species are protected nationally; five are listed on the annex OO of the Bonn Convention, which aims to conserve migratory species throughout their range. However, no species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> heritage. The northern goshawk and Eurasian sparrowhawk benefit from the abundance of sparrows feeding. The common grasshopper warbler stops there during its migration and the common nightingale nests there occasionally.|$|E

5|$|Many {{elements}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> {{tributes to}} the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film Gilda (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature The Lost Weekend (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject which is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. Then in the end of the film, Andy passes through a movie poster to escape his cell and ultimately Shawshank.|$|E
5|$|Noisy {{binary search}} {{algorithms}} solve {{the case where}} the algorithm cannot reliably compare elements of the array. For each pair of elements, {{there is a certain}} probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. Noisy binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position. The noisy binary search problem <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> a case of the Rényi-Ulam game, which Alfréd Rényi introduced in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Numerous mixed lead(II,IV) oxides are known. When PbO2 {{is heated}} in air, it becomes Pb12O19 at 293°C, Pb12O17 at 351°C, Pb3O4 at 374°C, and finally PbO at 605°C. A further {{sesquioxide}} Pb2O3 {{can be obtained}} at high pressure, along with several non-stoichiometric phases. Many of them show defective fluorite structures in which some oxygen atoms are replaced by vacancies: PbO <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> having such a structure, with every alternate layer of oxygen atoms absent.|$|E

5|$|The Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) website, {{one of the}} top global {{earthquake}} information website {{experienced a}} massive and immediate traffic surge caused by the convergence of eyewitnesses looking for information about the shaking. Their hit times proved to mimic the seismic wave propagation generated by the earthquake. On average eyewitnesses hit the website 90s after the ground start shaking. The epicenter was determined with 30km by retropagating 2 min of EMSC website traffic without using any seismic data. The authors argue that eyewitnesses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> real time sensor, their website visit being triggerred by the ground shaking.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{corpus of}} Kilmer's work was {{produced}} between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry {{fell out of}} favor and Modernism took root—especially with {{the influence of the}} Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen especially in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Kilmer's verse is conservative and traditional, and does not break the formal rules of poetics—he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> one of the last poets of the Romantic era. His style has been criticized for not breaking free of traditional modes of rhyme, meter, and theme, and for being too sentimental to be taken seriously.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of managing design {{to achieve a}} business objective was first documented in 1907. The Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation) was established in Munich by twelve architects and twelve business firms as a state-sponsored effort to better compete with Great Britain and the United States by integrating traditional craft and industrial mass-production techniques. A German designer and architect, Peter Behrens, created the entire corporate identity (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) of Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG), and {{is regarded as the}} first industrial designer in history. His work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund's initiatives and objectives and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> first contribution to design management.|$|E

5|$|A termite nest <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> being {{composed}} of two parts, the inanimate and the animate. The animate is all of the termites living inside the colony, and the inanimate part is the structure itself, which is constructed by the termites. Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above the soil surface), and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) protrude from the earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did termites millions of years ago.|$|E
5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E
5|$|Points {{and lines}} {{may be viewed}} as special cases of circles; a point <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> a circle of {{infinitely}} small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points and lines {{may be viewed as}} limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E

5|$|The first secure {{mentions}} of Basset are in royal charters {{dating to}} around 1102, where he {{appears as a}} witness.

From his Norman lands, Basset is recorded as donating lands to the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in 1113. in 1111 Basset took part in the Michaelmas session of the Exchequer, and he continued to take part in financial affairs and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> an early Baron of the Exchequer.|$|E
