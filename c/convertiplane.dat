25|$|A <b>convertiplane</b> {{takes off}} under rotor lift like a helicopter, then {{transitions}} to fixed-wing lift in forward flight.|$|E
25|$|The <b>convertiplane</b> {{featured}} a single Continental-built R-975 radial piston engine that powered twin air compressors. The compressors pumped air via ducts {{to the main}} rotor for vertical flight, while the engine drove the two-bladed pusher propeller for horizontal flight. During forward flight the wing provided 80% of the lift with the remainder generated by the main rotor autorotating at about 50% of normal rpm. When in hover mode, the rotor turned at 410 RPM but slowed to 180 RPM for high-speed flight above 125 knots.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transverse}} {{rotor system}} of the V-12, which {{eliminates the need for}} a tail rotor, consists of two Mil Mi-6 transmission systems complete with rotors mounted at the tips of the approximately [...] span inverse tapered wings. Although the first use by Mil, the transverse system had been used by several of the early helicopters, including the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 Drache and Kamov Ka-22 Vintokryl <b>convertiplane.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Convertiplanes</b> may {{be divided}} into two broad classes, based on whether the rotor is fixed as in a {{helicopter}} or tilts to provide thrust in forward flight, as a proprotor.|$|R
5000|$|In {{most cases}} gyroplanes and {{compound}} helicopters {{use the same}} primary method of lift throughout flight without any conversion needed, so they are generally not regarded as <b>convertiplanes.</b> However, at least two aircraft did achieve a winglift higher than their rotorlift : ...|$|R
2500|$|On 20 June 1951, the Air Force and Army {{signed a}} Letter of Intent with McDonnell to award a {{contract}} to develop an aircraft based on their design. McDonnell benefited from previous design work on the Model M-28 and had a complete mockup ready for inspection by the Army and Air Force by November 1951. McDonnell was given approval to begin fabrication of what was then designated the XL-25 ("L" [...] for Liaison). As the aircraft was being constructed the designation was changed to XH-35. Finally, the aircraft became the first vehicle in the <b>convertiplane</b> series as the XV-1.|$|E
2500|$|After {{three years}} and nearly 600 hours between the two aircraft, the XV-1 {{contract}} was canceled in 1957. Ultimately, {{it was determined that}} the XV-1's <b>convertiplane</b> configuration was too complex for the small advantages gained over conventional helicopters. The piston engine could not produce enough power to optimize the design advantages. Technological advances in conventional helicopter rotor design and engines in the following years would eventually negate the XV-1's performance margin. [...] The noise level was 116dB in the cockpit, but even higher for ground personnel who described the tip jet noise as [...] "extremely irritating" [...] and the noise level was still 90dB ½ mile away. McDonnell would try to capitalize on the tip-jet rotor technology with a small crane helicopter design, designated Model 120 and first flown on 13 November 1957.|$|E
2500|$|The model glider {{successfully}} {{flown by}} Cayley in 1804 had {{the layout of}} a modern aircraft, with a kite-shaped wing towards the front and an adjustable [...] tailplane at the back consisting of horizontal stabilisers and a vertical fin. [...] A movable weight allowed adjustment of the model's centre of gravity. [...] Around 1843 {{he was the first}} to suggest the idea for a <b>convertiplane,</b> an idea which was published in a paper written that same year. [...] At some time before 1849 he designed and built a biplane in which an unknown ten-year-old boy flew. Later, with the continued assistance of his grandson George John Cayley and his resident engineer Thomas Vick, he developed a larger scale glider (also probably fitted with [...] "flappers") which flew across Brompton Dale in front of Wydale Hall in 1853. The first adult aviator has been claimed to be either Cayley's coachman, footman or butler: one source (Gibbs-Smith) has suggested that it was John Appleby, a Cayley employee: however there is no definitive evidence to fully identify the pilot. An entry in volume IX of the 8th Encyclopædia Britannica of 1855 is the most contemporaneous authoritative account regarding the event. A 2007 biography of Cayley (Richard Dee's The Man Who Discovered Flight: George Cayley and the First Airplane) claims the first pilot was Cayley's grandson George John Cayley (1826–1878).|$|E
50|$|The American Helicopter Museum & Education Center (AHMEC) {{is located}} at 1220 American Boulevard, West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States. The {{transport}} museum focuses on the history, science and technology of rotary wing aviation. The collection contains over 40 civilian and military autogyros, <b>convertiplanes</b> and helicopters, including some early generation models. The museum also has an extensive research library, the Renzo Pierpaoli Memorial Library, which contains documents, artifacts, films, and memoirs that museum members can use.|$|R
50|$|In March and April 1948, the Key West Agreement {{outlining}} {{the division of}} air assets between the Army, Navy, and Air Force, was drafted by the Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal and approved by President Harry S Truman. By April 1950, the Army airborne community was expressing an interest in transport helicopters. A panel chaired by Major General William M. Miley reported that troop parachutes were unsatisfactory {{in part because of}} the problems encountered in assembling scattered troops after an airdrop. The panel recommended the adoption of <b>convertiplanes</b> and heavy lift helicopters.|$|R

50|$|A <b>convertiplane</b> {{takes off}} under rotor lift like a helicopter, then {{transitions}} to fixed-wing lift in forward flight.|$|E
50|$|A <b>convertiplane</b> is an {{aircraft}} which uses rotor power for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and converts to fixed-wing lift in normal flight.|$|E
50|$|The <b>convertiplane</b> has a {{conventional}} wing for lift in forward flight and a rotary wing which {{acts as a}} lifting rotor for vertical flight and then tilts forward {{to act as a}} propeller in forward flight. In the tiltwing variant the whole wing-rotor assembly tilts while in the tiltrotor the wing remains fixed and only the engine-rotor assembly tilts. The requirements for a lifting rotor and a propulsive propeller differ, and the rotors for a <b>convertiplane</b> must be a compromise between the two. Some designs used what were effectively propellers rather than rotors, having a smaller diameter and being optimised for forward flight, while others chose a larger size to give better lifting power at the expense of forward speed. No <b>convertiplane</b> entered production during the post-war years, however the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor would eventually fly in 1989, finally entering service 18 years after that.|$|E

50|$|During {{his time}} at SRI, Shoulders also worked on ideas for a flying car, the Gyrodyne <b>Convertiplane.</b> It {{combined}} features of a car, a helicopter (a rotor on the roof for take-off and landing) and a small airplane (rigid wings and a rear propeller). Shoulders developed preliminary sketches and specifications, promoting {{the idea of a}} ground-to-air vehicle that could rescue long-distance commuters from hours of grid-lock traffic. In 1963, Shoulders asked the California State Senate’s Transportation Committee for permission to use his invention on public roads, and in 1964 they agreed. However, a number of nearby municipalities banned the <b>Convertiplane</b> from their airspace.|$|E
50|$|After the war, in 1954, {{the company}} built a gyrodyne, named Kayaba Heliplane. The {{development}} of this aircraft started in 1952 when Shiro Kayaba, {{the founder of the}} company, obtained the fuselage of a Cessna 170B and, during the following two years, turned it into a <b>convertiplane.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1920 Frank Vogelzang filed {{a patent}} for a <b>convertiplane,</b> but the design was never constructed. Between 1937 and 1939 the British {{designer}} L.E. Baynes developed {{a proposal for}} his Heliplane, a tiltrotor <b>convertiplane</b> having two tilting wingtip-mounted nacelles containing the engines, proprotor mounting and main undercarriage. The wheels did not retract but were partially covered and protruded {{from the rear of}} the nacelles when in forward flight. The proposed engines were of an unusual hybrid gas turbine design, in which the proprotor was driven off a gas turbine supplied in turn by a free-piston hot gas generator. Baynes was refused official backing and the type was never built. The basic design would not be revisited for some 20 years or so, and would eventually become the basis of the successful Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey.|$|E
50|$|The Sikorsky XV-2, {{also known}} by the Sikorsky Aircraft model number S-57, was a planned {{experimental}} stoppable rotor aircraft, designated as a <b>convertiplane,</b> developed for a joint research program between the United States Air Force and the United States Army. The program was cancelled before construction of the prototype began.|$|E
50|$|A <b>convertiplane</b> {{in popular}} usage is an {{aircraft}} that converts in flight {{to change its}} method of obtaining lift. The FAI define it more narrowly as an aircraft which uses rotor power for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and converts to fixed-wing lift in normal flight. This is the definition used here.|$|E
50|$|To use jet {{power for}} lift, the impracticality of tail-sitting meant it was {{necessary}} for the aircraft to take off and land vertically while still in a horizontal attitude. Solutions tried included lifting fans (typically buried in the wings), swivelling engine pods similar in concept to the <b>convertiplane,</b> dedicated lightweight lift jets or turbofans, thrust-vectoring by deflecting the jet exhaust as needed, and various combinations of these.|$|E
50|$|The {{transverse}} {{rotor system}} of the V-12, which {{eliminates the need for}} a tail rotor, consists of two Mi-6 transmission systems complete with rotors mounted at the tips of the approximately 30 m span inverse tapered wings.

50|$|The Stampe et Vertongen RSV.26/100, RSV.18/100, RSV.26/18, and SV.18 were {{a family}} of two-seat touring {{aircraft}} designed by Alfred Renard and built by Stampe et Vertongen in Belgium in the 1920s and under license by Gates Aircraft in the United States as the Gates <b>Convertiplane.</b> Originally designed as a biplane, a monoplane version soon followed, and the aircraft was eventually marketed as convertible between the two configurations. Sometimes described as a lightened version of the RSV.26/140 military trainer, the RSV.26/100 was actually a fresh design.|$|E

50|$|In 1951, the Army and Air Force {{announced}} the Convertible Aircraft Program and released the Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit designs from the aircraft industry. In October 1953, Bell Helicopter {{was awarded a}} development contract to produce two aircraft for testing purposes. The original military designation was XH-33, classifying it as a helicopter, but its designation was changed to XV-3 in the <b>convertiplane</b> series. The designation was changed once again in 1962 to XV-3A when the V-prefix was changed to mean VTOL. The leading designers were Bob Lichten and Kenneth Wernicke.|$|E
50|$|The Bell XV-3 (Bell 200) is an American {{tiltrotor}} aircraft {{developed by}} Bell Helicopter for a joint research program between the United States Air Force and the United States Army {{in order to}} explore <b>convertiplane</b> technologies. The XV-3 featured an engine mounted in the fuselage with driveshafts transferring power to two-bladed rotor assemblies mounted on the wingtips. The wingtip rotor assemblies were mounted to tilt 90 degrees from vertical to horizontal, designed to allow the XV-3 to take off and land like a helicopter but fly at faster airspeeds, similar to a conventional fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The Kellett Autogiro Corporation {{was formed}} in 1929 after it {{acquired}} a licence from Pitcairn-Cierva to build autogiros. The first three designed were all typical Cierva designs and the more advanced KD-1 {{was similar to the}} contemporary Cierva C.30. The KD-1/G-1 was the first practical rotary-wing aircraft used by the United States Army. The company stopped building autogyros in the late 1940s and switched to the design of helicopters. In the 1950s it built some ultra-light helicopters the RH-1 to test some rotor features and its last design the K-25 was an experimental <b>convertiplane</b> using tilt-rotors.|$|E

50|$|On 10 April 1958, the Rotodyne {{achieved}} {{its first}} successful transition from vertical to horizontal {{and then back}} into vertical flight. On 5 January 1959, the Rotodyne set a world speed record in the <b>convertiplane</b> category, at 190.9 mph (307.2 km/h), over a 60-mile (100 km) closed circuit. As well as being fast, the rotorcraft had a safety feature: it could hover with one engine shut down with its propeller feathered, and the prototype demonstrated several landings as an autogyro. The prototype was demonstrated several times at the Farnborough and Paris air shows, regularly amazing onlookers. In one instance, it even lifted a 100 ft girder bridge.|$|E
5000|$|Henrich Focke {{revived the}} {{design in the}} early 1950s on behalf of Brazil's Centro Técnico Aeroespacial (CTA), {{at the time the}} air force's {{technical}} center, who had contracted him to develop a <b>convertiplane.</b> The Convertiplano was built using the fuselage and wings of a Supermarine Spitfire Mk.XIV, serial RM874, acquired by the Brazilian Air Attaché's office in Brazil. Britain refused to supply the Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba engine originally selected and the design was altered to accept a mid-mounted [...] Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engine, as used in the Lockheed Constellation, instead.

5000|$|In 1952, Focke {{and other}} members of his former design team were {{employed}} by Brazil's Centro Técnico Aeroespacial (CTA), at the time the air force's technical center, to develop a <b>Convertiplane,</b> the [...] "Convertiplano", which drew heavily on Focke's wartime work on the Fa 269. Also recruited was Bussmann, a transmission specialist formerly of BMW. The Convertiplano was built using the fuselage and wings of a Supermarine Spitfire Mk 15, which was believed to be one delivered to Argentina as a sales example. Britain refused to supply the Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba engine originally selected and the design was altered to accept a mid-mounted 2200 hp Wright engine instead as used in the Lockheed Constellation, which necessitated a redesign of the transmission due to the increase in weight and vibration.
