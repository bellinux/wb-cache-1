5|$|On May 3, 1969, customs {{agents at}} Toronto International Airport {{detained}} Hendrix after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab <b>confirmed</b> <b>what</b> had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of DNA sequencing {{and the use}} of genetic data in determining relationships between species of monocots <b>confirmed</b> <b>what</b> many taxonomists had long suspected: Liliaceae s.l. was highly polyphyletic. The family was demonstrated to include a significant number of unrelated groups, which belonged to quite separate families and even orders. For instance some genera such as Hyacinthus, previously placed in Liliaceae s.l., were reclassified in families within Asparagales (in this case Asparagaceae). In 1995 Chase et al. reviewed the understanding of the lilioids and equated them to Dahlgreen's Liliiflorae, which they designated as superorder Lilianae. They pointed out that the understanding of the phylogenetics of this group was critical {{for the establishment of a}} monocot classification. They also noted that while many authors treated this group as monophyletic (having a common ancestor), a closer reading of their texts revealed evidence of paraphyly (excluding some descendants of a common ancestor). For instance, Dahlgren had based monophyly on a single synapomorphy, that of a petaloid perianth, yet in discussing his Lilliflorae admitted it was undoubtedly paraphyletic. Dahlgren treated the monocots as split between ten superorders and placed five orders (Dioscoreales, Asparagales, Liliales, Melanthiales, Burmanniales and Orchidales) in his Liliiflorae.|$|E

This <b>confirmed</b> <b>what</b> had been increasingly suspected: Pluto's gravitational influence on Uranus and Neptune is negligible, certainly not nearly enough {{to account for the}} discrepancies in their orbits. In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union.|$|E

However, in November 2016, Disney announced that their contract with Trank was terminated due to the overwhelmingly negative reviews of Fantastic Four. It was {{reported that}} the film was still in early development at Lucasfilm, and it was rumored that the film would focus on bounty hunter Boba Fett. Lucasfilm never <b>confirmed</b> <b>what</b> the plot was about, but confirmed that the film Josh Trank left was a different film from the Han Solo spin-off.|$|E
25|$|During the journey, the Cimarrons carried {{most of the}} supplies, such as {{bows and}} arrows for defense against the Spanish. Once {{they arrived at the}} spot where they planned to carry out their ambush in Nombre de Dios, a Cimarron spy was sent to the Spanish post to find out when the {{treasure}} procession would begin. He came back and reported that Treasurer of Lima was to appear on the road within the next few hours. At one point, two Cimarrons were sent to kidnap a sleeping Spanish guard and question him about the Spanish treasure. He <b>confirmed</b> <b>what</b> the English already knew and begged not to be killed. When the mule train arrived with the treasure, the Spanish saw a Cimarron hiding and quickly turned the procession around. Drake and his men still managed to ambush the train but found that it did not carry anything of much value. The Cimarrones vowed to Drake and the English that they would continue being their friends and allies.|$|E

Instead, she grew jealous of her own mother and demanded that she leave instead. When Janine refused, Annie left instead. To fill {{the gap in the}} house, Janine invited her son, Alain, and his wife, Dominique, to return to live there. Anquetil began an affair with Dominique, to make Annie jealous. Dominique had Anquetil's child but Annie still refused to return. Dominique still lives in the house, Les Elfes, where she organises conferences. Janine and Anquetil divorced. Sophie moved in with Janine, although she lives now in Calenzana, near Calvi. Both Janine and Dominique wrote their life story: neither mentioned the link between Sophie and Anquetil.|$|E

500|$|In 1833, as he {{revealed}} {{in a letter}} to his sister, Balzac entered into an illicit affair with fellow writer Maria Du Fresnay, who was then aged 24. Her marriage to a considerably older man (Charles du Fresnay, Mayor of Sartrouville) had been a failure from the outset. In this letter, Balzac also reveals that the young woman had just come to tell him she was pregnant with his child. In 1834, 8 months after the event, Maria Du Fresnay's daughter by Balzac, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, was born.

Preston, not entirely trusting the man's report, sent out one of his captains to confer with Montgomery. [...] The counteroffer, which Montgomery rejected, owing to the lateness of the season, was to hold a truce for four days, after which the garrison would surrender if no relief came. [...] Montgomery let the captain examine another prisoner from Carleton's expedition, who <b>confirmed</b> <b>what</b> the first one had reported. Montgomery then repeated his demand for an immediate surrender, terms for which were drawn up the next day.|$|E

500|$|On September 22, 1997, at 1pm, Yoshiki, hide, Pata and Heath held a {{press conference}} where they {{announced}} that X Japan would disband. Vocalist Toshi decided to leave the band as the glamorous, success-oriented life of a rock star failed to satisfy him emotionally, as opposed to a simpler life and career.

However, around twelve years later he <b>confirmed</b> <b>what</b> was long-reported in the media; that he was [...] "brainwashed" [...] via violence and abuse and conned out of money, leading to bankruptcy.

Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff, Wilde saying [...] "it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one's true friends". The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled it to Arthur Ransome {{a day or so}} before Ransome's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it <b>confirmed</b> <b>what</b> he had said in his 1912 book on Wilde; that Douglas's rivalry for Wilde with Robbie Ross and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde's public disaster; as Wilde wrote in De Profundis. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.|$|E
500|$|On 4 May fifteen {{volumes of}} the diaries {{were removed from the}} Swiss bank vault and {{distributed}} to various forensic scientists: four went to the [...] and eleven went to the Swiss specialists in St Gallen. The initial results were ready on 6 May, which <b>confirmed</b> <b>what</b> the forensic experts had been telling the management of Stern for the last week: the diaries were poor forgeries, with modern components and ink that was not in common use in wartime Germany. Measurements had been taken of the evaporation of chloride in the ink which showed the diaries had been written within the previous two years. There were also factual errors, including some from Domarus's [...] that Kujau had copied. Before passing the news to Stern, the [...] had already informed the government, saying it was [...] "a ministerial matter".

500|$|Three more psychiatrists from Penetanguishene {{were then}} called by Nosanchuk.

He considered Lamb to be anti-social, aggressive and psychopathic—unable to appreciate the incident's consequences with any depth of feeling. Elliot Barker then testified that Lamb had told him {{in an interview that}} he treated all people [...] "like bugs" [...] except for his uncle and grandmother; killing a human being, Barker told the court, meant nothing more to Lamb than swatting a fly. Barry Boyd then <b>confirmed</b> <b>what</b> Barker had said, and quoted something Lamb had told him in an interview: [...] "I hate everybody on the street. I probably will kill someone else before I die—it doesn't bother me—it's like killing a bug." [...] Elizabeth Willet, a psychologist from the Penetanguishene unit, then testified that in her tests Lamb had indeed been revealed to have a high IQ, but had also been shown to have the emotional maturity of a small child, aged between 3 and 6. He had few defence mechanisms, she said, and when confronted by impulses acted them out almost without exception and without appreciating their consequences.|$|E
