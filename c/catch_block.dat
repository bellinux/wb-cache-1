2500|$|Exception {{handling}} with Try-Catch-Finally: Unlike other [...]NET languages, {{this allows}} multiple exception types {{for a single}} <b>catch</b> <b>block.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The above do {{expression}} resembles an imperative program, which assigns the Int values {{contained in}} the 'mx' and 'my' monadic values to temporary Int variables 'x' and 'y', and raises an exception if either 'mx' or 'my' have the value Nothing. In such case, the whole do expression has value Nothing. The exception handling is declared by defining the input parameters with type Maybe Int. Rather than having to declare an error case in a try ... <b>catch</b> <b>block,</b> the behavior defined in the bind operator of the Maybe monad (return Nothing) is executed in that case.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the {{statements}} within the try block execute. If an exception is thrown, the script's control flow immediately transfers to {{the statements}} in the <b>catch</b> <b>block,</b> with the exception available as the error argument. Otherwise the <b>catch</b> <b>block</b> is skipped. The <b>catch</b> <b>block</b> can , {{if it does not}} want to handle a specific error.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} that uses compilerdirected fault-injection for coverage testing of recovery code in Internet services to evaluate their robustness to operating system and I/O hardware faults. We define a set of program-fault coverage metrics that enable quantification of Java <b>catch</b> <b>blocks</b> exercised during fault-injection experiments. We use compiler analyses to instrument application code in two ways: to direct fault injection to occur at appropriate points during execution, and to measure the resulting coverage. As a proof of concept for these ideas, we have applied our techniques manually to Muffin, a proxy server; we obtained {{a high degree of}} coverage of <b>catch</b> <b>blocks,</b> with, on average, 85 % of the expected faults per catch being experienced as caught exceptions...|$|R
40|$|Most {{mainstream}} programming languages provide constructs {{to throw}} and to handle exceptions. However, several studies argue that exception handling code is usually of poor quality {{and that it}} is commonly neglected by developers. Moreover, it {{is said to be the}} least understood, documented, and tested part of the implementation of a system. Nevertheless, there are very few studies that analyze the actual exception handling bugs that occur in real software systems or that attempt to understand developers’ perceptions of these bugs. In this work we present an exploratory study on exception handling bugs that employs two complementary approaches: a survey of 154 developers and an analysis of 220 exception handling bugs from the repositories of Eclipse and Tomcat. Only 27 % of the respondents claimed that policies and standards for the implementation of error handling are part of the culture of their organizations. Moreover, in 70 % of the organizations there are no specific tests for the exception handling code. Also, 61 % of the respondents stated that no to little importance is given to the documentation of exception handling in the design phase of the projects with which they are involved. In addition, about 40 % of the respondents consider the quality of exception handling code to be either good or very good and only 14 % of the respondents consider it to be bad or very bad. Furthermore, the repository analysis has shown (with statistical significance) that exception handling bugs are ignored by developers less often than other bugs. We have also observed that while overly general <b>catch</b> <b>blocks</b> are a well-known bad smell related to exceptions, bugs stemming from these <b>catch</b> <b>blocks</b> are rare, even though many overly general <b>catch</b> <b>blocks</b> occur in the code. Furthermore, while developers often mention empty <b>catch</b> <b>blocks</b> as causes of bugs they have fixed in the past, we found very few bug reports caused by them. On top of that, empty <b>catch</b> <b>blocks</b> are frequently used as part of bug fixes, including fixes for exception handling bugs. Based on our findings, we propose a classification of exception handling bugs and their causes. The proposed classification can be used to assist in the design and implementation of test suites, to guide code inspections, or as a basis for static analysis tools.

50|$|In Java it is {{possible}} to execute code even after return statement, because the finally block of a try-catch structure is always executed. So if the return statement is placed somewhere within try or <b>catch</b> <b>blocks</b> the code within finally (if added) will be executed. It is even possible to alter the return value of a non primitive type (a property of an already returned object) because the exit occurs afterwards as well.|$|R

5000|$|One {{criticism}} is that checked exceptions encourage programmers {{to use an}} empty <b>catch</b> <b>block</b> (catch (Exception e) {}), which silently swallows exceptions, rather than letting the exceptions propagate to a higher-level exception-handling routine. In some cases, however, exception chaining can be applied instead, by re-throwing the exception in a wrapper exception. For example, if an object is changed to access a database instead of a file, an [...] could be caught and re-thrown as an , since the caller may not {{need to know the}} inner workings of the object.|$|E

Snow plow blades could <b>catch</b> <b>block</b> edges and damage surfaces. Sand {{cannot be used}} for snow and ice control on perveous asphalt or concrete because it will plug the pores and reduce permeability. Infiltrating runoff may freeze below the pavement, causing frost heave, though design modifications can reduce this risk. These potential problems do not mean that porous pavement cannot be used in cold climates. Porous pavement designed to reduce frost heave has been used successfully in Norway. Furthermore, experience suggests that rapid drainage below porous surfaces increases the rate of snow melt above.|$|E

40|$|International audienceContext:In software, {{there are}} the error cases that are {{anticipated}} at specification and design time, those encountered at development and testing time, and those that were never anticipated before happening in production. Is it possible {{to learn from the}} anticipated errors during design to analyze and improve the resilience against the unanticipated ones in production?Objective:In this paper, we aim at analyzing and improving how software handles unanticipated exceptions. The first objective is to set up contracts about exception handling and a way to assess them automatically. The second one is to improve the resilience capabilities of software by transforming the source code. Method:We devise an algorithm, called short-circuit testing, which injects exceptions during test suite execution so as to simulate unanticipated errors. It is a kind of fault-injection techniques dedicated to exception-handling. This algorithm collects data that is used for verifying two formal contracts that capture two resilience properties w. r. t. exceptions: the source-independence and pure-resilience contracts. Then we propose a code modification technique, called ``catch-stretching'' which allows error-recovery code (of the form of <b>catch</b> <b>blocks)</b> to be more resilient. Results:Our evaluation is performed on 9 open-source software applications and consists in analyzing 241 <b>catch</b> <b>blocks</b> executed during test suite execution. Our results show that 101 / 214 of them (47 %) expose resilience properties as defined by our exception contracts and that 84 / 214 of them (39 %) can be transformed to be more resilient. Conclusion:Our work shows {{that it is possible to}} reason on software resilience by injecting exceptions during test suite execution. The collected information allows us to apply one source code transformation that improves the resilience against unanticipated exceptions. This works best if the test suite exercises the exceptional programming language constructs in many different scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Exceptions are {{provided}} by the Java programming language in order to handle errors more gracefully. However, exceptions are rare in most programs, so that most catch blocks are left unused. This paper describes an on-demand <b>catch</b> <b>block</b> translation scheme which translates catch blocks only when they are actually used. By ignoring exception handling while translating normal flow, we can reduce translation overhead and make use of more optimization opportunities. In addition, we directly connect normal flow and catch blocks after an exception is thrown, which results in faster exception handling. This is useful since many exceptions thrown at certain points are usually of the same type and handled by the same catch blocks. From experimental results, we show {{that the existence of}} catch blocks indeed do not interfere with the translation of normal flow when on-demand <b>catch</b> <b>block</b> translation is done. Also, the results show that direct connection along with method inlining results [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Protocol {{processing}} of received packets in BSD Unix is interrupt-driven and may cause scheduling anomalies that are unacceptable in systems that provide {{quality of service}} (QoS) guarantees. We propose an alternative mechanism, Signaled Receiver Processing (SRP), that generates {{a signal to the}} receiving process when a packet arrives. The default action of this signal is to perform protocol processing asynchronously. However, a receiving process may <b>catch,</b> <b>block,</b> or ignore the signal and defer protocol processing until a subsequent receive call. In any case, protocol processing occurs {{in the context of the}} receiving process and is correctly charged. Therefore, SRP allows the system to enforce and honor QoS guarantees. SRP offers several advantages over Lazy Receiver Processing (LRP), a previous solution to BSD's scheduling anomalies: SRP is easily portable to systems that support neither kernel threads nor Resource Containers (e. g., FreeBSD); gives applications control over the scheduling of protocol processing; uses a demultiplexing strategy that is appropriate for both hosts and gateways; and easily enables real-time or proportional-share scheduling...|$|E
40|$|JCilk {{extends the}} Java {{language}} to provide call-return semantics for multithreading, much as Cilk does for C. Java's built-in thread model {{does not support}} the passing of exceptions or return values from one thread back to the "parent" thread that created it. JCilk imports Cilk's fork-join primitives spawn and sync into Java to provide procedure-call semantics for concurrent subcomputations. It also introduces exceptions into that fork-join structure, leading to some some surprising semantic synergies. In particular, JCilk extends Java's exception semantics to allow exceptions to be passed from a spawned method to its parent in a natural way that obviates the need for Cilk's inlet and abort constructs. When executing in parallel, an exception thrown by a JCilk computation signals its "side computations" to abort, which yields a clean semantics in which only a single exception from the enclosing try block is handled. Because JCilk uses Java's normal exception mechanism to propagate an abort throughout the side computations, the programmer can handle clean-up by simply catching a thrown CilkAbort exception. (cont.) JCilk supports these features by introducing the concept of a "catchlet" as a mechanism for handling exceptions in a concurrent context. In my work, I have implented a runtime system for JCilk which uses a tree structure to track the dynamic state of nested try blocks. Using this tree, the runtime system is able to signal aborts to the proper side computations and determine when the <b>catch</b> <b>block</b> is able to run. The result is an efficient implementation of the JCilk specification. by John Danaher. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Discrete-event {{simulation}} programs make {{heavy use}} of dynamic memory allocation {{in order to}} support simulation's very dynamic space requirements. When programming in C one is likely to use the malloc() routine. However, a parallel simulation which uses the standard Unix System V malloc() implementation may achieve an overly optimistic speedup, possibly superlinear. An alternate implementation provided on some (but not all systems) can avoid the speedup anomaly, but at the price of significantly reduced available free space. This is especially severe on most parallel architectures, which tend not to support virtual memory. It is shown how a simply implemented user-constructed interface to malloc() can both avoid artificially inflated speedups, and make efficient use of the dynamic memory space. The interface simply <b>catches</b> <b>blocks</b> {{on the basis of their}} size.

We take neither an analytical approach (``we think exception handling is good because X and Y'') nor an empirical approach (``most developers do Z and T''). Our method is to compare analytical knowledge against empirical one. We first review the literature to find analytical knowledge on exception handling, we then set up a dataset of 32 Java software applications and an experimental protocol to statically characterize and measure the exception handling design. We eventually compare our measures against the claims on exception handling that authors have made over time. Our results show that some analytical principles for exception design do not support the empirical validation: 1) practitioners violate the principle and 2) upon analysis, there are indeed very good use cases going against this principle. This is in particular the case for ``Empty <b>Catch</b> <b>Blocks</b> are Bad'' and ``Do not Catch Generic Exceptions''...|$|R

This will contribute to the removal of some of the existing limitations related with the lack of java source codes. The generally used tools for a static analysis are FindBugs, Jlint, PMD, ESC/Java 2, Checkstyle. In this study, it is aimed to utilize PMD static analysis tool which already has been developed to find defects Possible bugs (empty try/catch/finally/switch statements), Dead code (unused local variables, parameters and private methods), Suboptimal code (wasteful String/StringBuffer usage), Overcomplicated expressions (unnecessary if statements for loops that could be while loops), Duplicate code (copied/pasted code means copied/pasted bugs). On the other hand, faults possible unexpected exception, length may be less than zero, division by zero, stream not closed on all paths and should be a static inner class cases were not implemented by PMD static analysis tool.

40|$|Program {{errors are}} a source of {{information}} leaks. Tracking these leaks is hard because error propagation breaks out of program structure. Programming languages often feature exception constructs to provide some structure to error handling: for example, the try [...] . <b>catch</b> <b>blocks</b> in Java and Caml. Mainstream information-flow security compilers such as Jif and FlowCaml enforce rigid rules for exceptions in order to prevent leaks via public side effects of computation whose reachability depends on exceptions. This paper presents a general and permissive alternative to the rigid solution: the programmer is offered a choice for each type of error/exception whether to handle it or not. The security mechanism ensures that, in the former case, it is never handled and, in the latter case, it is always handled with the mainstream restrictions. This mechanism extends naturally to a language with procedures and output, where we show the soundness of the mechanism with respect to termination-insensitive noninterference...|$|R

2500|$|Preventing wild {{pitches and}} {{avoiding}} passed balls. Although the pitcher {{has a responsibility}} to throw with reasonable accuracy, catchers must be mobile enough to <b>catch</b> (or <b>block)</b> errant pitches.

5000|$|In rugby, kicking {{during the}} flow of the game is done for {{tactical}} reasons (both offensive and defensive) or to score a goal. If the ball is recovered by the kicking team, it can lead to significant improvement in field position. It is also legal in rugby to kick at goal at any point in the game. This is called a drop goal. In American football, a team that kicks the ball during play automatically gives up possession and cannot recover the ball unless an error in catching the ball (aka [...] "muff") is made by the receiving team; because of this, punting is typically done only when teams do not expect to be able to retain possession (i.e. on fourth down). Additionally, rule changes made in the early 20th century mandated that field goals cannot be made in front of the line of scrimmage; this has led to the demise of the drop-kick field goal in American football. <b>Catching</b> and <b>blocking</b> kicked balls are integral rugby skills.|$|R
