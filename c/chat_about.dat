The final title, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, named after the mythical Deathly Hallows in the novel, was {{released to the public}} on 21 December 2006, via a special Christmas-themed hangman puzzle on Rowling's website, confirmed shortly afterwards by the book's publishers. When asked during a live <b>chat</b> <b>about</b> the other titles she had been considering, Rowling mentioned Harry Potter and the Elder Wand and Harry Potter and the Peverell Quest.|$|E

In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Joan, who died in her womb. The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.|$|E

500|$|Instead of rejoicing in the discipline-less school, Bart feels {{guilty about}} causing Principal Skinner's dismissal. In {{an effort to}} get Principal Skinner his job back, Bart {{attempts}} to expose Ned's poor leadership to Superintendent Chalmers. Despite the state of chaos at the school, Superintendent Chalmers is not concerned. However, upon hearing Ned utter a brief mention of God over the intercom, Superintendent Chalmers immediately fires Ned for reciting a school prayer. Principal Skinner is soon re-hired as principal. Bart and Principal Skinner share an amicable <b>chat</b> <b>about</b> their typically antagonistic relationship, then affectionately pat each other on the back. However, as they turn from each other, it is revealed Bart has taped a [...] "Kick Me" [...] sign on Principal Skinner's back, and Principal Skinner has taped a [...] "Teach Me" [...] sign on Bart. The two chuckle to themselves as they walk away.|$|E
500|$|Clarke's {{style has}} {{frequently}} {{been described as}} a pastiche, particularly of nineteenth-century British writers such as Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and George Meredith. Specifically, the novel's minor characters, including sycophants, rakes, and the Duke of Wellington, evoke Dickens' caricatures. Laura Miller, in her review for Salon, suggests that the novel is [...] "about a certain literary voice, the eminently civilized voice of early 19th century social comedy", exemplified by the works of Austen. The novel even uses obsolete spellings—chuse for choose and shewed for showed, for example—to convey this voice as well as the free indirect speech made famous by Austen. Clarke herself notes that Austen's influence is particularly strong in the [...] "domestic scenes, set in living rooms and drawing rooms where people mostly <b>chat</b> <b>about</b> magic" [...] where Dickens's is prominent [...] "any time there's more action or description". While many reviewers compare Clarke's style to that of Austen, Gregory Feeley argues in his review for The Weekly Standard that [...] "the points of resemblance are mostly superficial". He writes that [...] "Austen gets down to business briskly, while Clarke engages in a curious narrative strategy of continual deferral and delay." [...] For example, Clarke mentions Jonathan Strange on the first page of the novel, but only in a footnote. He reappears in other footnotes throughout the opening but does not appear as a character in the text proper until a quarter of the way through the novel.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, {{the series}} {{received}} mixed to negative reviews. John Doyle of The Globe and Mail {{said that the}} show is neither the new M*A*S*H for its lack of [...] "snarky <b>chat</b> <b>about</b> the stupidity of war and governments that encourage war" [...] nor is it Grey's Anatomy-on-the-front-lines as there are no [...] "lurid romantic entanglements". Doyle goes on to say, [...] "It's the horrors {{of war and the}} awfulness of a combat hospital seen emphatically through the prism of TV drama." [...] In concluding his review Doyle said, [...] "In the matter of Afghanistan and military life there, if you want a gruelling experience, watch the news. Combat Hospital is the entertaining version." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ward {{said that}} {{although}} Burton is a talented actress and {{has done a great}} job with the character, she did not feel she had to get to know her in order to proceed with the drawings. [...] "It was the character I was drawing for and I learned what I needed to from the show and the scripts," [...] she stated. In describing the process of drawing for a particular episode, she said she would mostly get input from Robbie Beck, the props master for the show. [...] "Schwahn always knew exactly what he wanted and it would be described in the script. So Robbie would send me the info and I would initially do some quick sketches," [...] stated Ward. All of their communication was via e-mail. [...] "I wish I could say something more exciting, like [...] and I would <b>chat</b> <b>about</b> what Peyton would be drawing," [...] stated Ward, [...] "but the only time I ever spoke with her was when they were filming at my house in Wilmington (which oddly enough was Peyton’s house on the show.)" [...] Despite this, Ward said she did not mention to Burton that she was the artist behind Peyton's artwork.|$|E
2500|$|Coverage {{was mostly}} negative. Richard Dorment wrote in The Daily Telegraph: [...] "The {{shortlist}} for this year's Turner Prize is so wilfully opaque it's irrelevant." [...] In his opinion the artists selected exemplified [...] "Euro-art, a term I've {{made up to}} describe {{a certain kind of}} technically competent, bland, and ultimately empty art made specifically for international biennales." [...] Similarly, Jonathan Jones wrote in The Guardian that the show [...] "reflect a mentality only too dominant in art magazines and curating right nowa rather overthought, overtalked, pseudo-intellectual culture." [...] In The Times, Rachel Campbell-Johnston wrote, [...] "I can't help thinking that this show will prove ... like the returns desk of Ikea on a Monday morning. Lots of frustrated people will be left staring at a pile of inscrutable junk." [...] In the Financial Times, Jackie Wullschlager wrote, [...] "Don’t go. Don’t even think about going. This year’s Turner Prize exhibition is without competition the worst {{in the history of the}} award.... a killer mix of self-indulgence and academicism." [...] Laura Cumming in The Observer agreed, [...] "If ever you were thinking of giving the Turner Prize a miss then 2008 is the ideal year." [...] saying that [...] "t is not that the art is wilfully bad ... it is just that it is almost entirely inactive." [...] In contrast, Adrian Searle wrote in The Guardian: [...] "here's a depth and complexity [...] that, it would be nice to think, might overtake the usual <b>chat</b> <b>about</b> winners and losers." ...|$|E
