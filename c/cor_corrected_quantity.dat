40|$|INTRODUCTION Recent {{methods of}} third order asymptotics can produce {{significance}} probabilities that have remarkable accuracy, but for implementation require the sample space dimension {{to be equal}} to that for the full parameter. From a practical viewpoint this effectively restricts the approximations to location, transformation and exponential models where the reduction methods of conditioning or sufficiency are available to give a variable of the same dimension as the parameter. The recent third order significance approximations have evolved from the saddlepoint method (Daniels, 1954; Barndorff-Nielsen & Cox, 1979) or from the direct analysis and Taylor series expansion of log density functions (Barndorff-Nielsen, 1986; DiCiccio, Field & Fraser, 1990; Fraser, 1990; Fraser & Reid, 1993). Some early formulas used mean and variance <b>corrected</b> <b>quantities</b> but the exceptional accuracy of some recent formulas seems to arise from a natural invariance obtained {{from the use of}} simple li...|$|R
30|$|As a next step, a line-back {{analysis}} was conducted to assign PIs {{for each of the}} process modules. By doing so, only PIs were selected which are relevant for each single module. Relevance is decided by {{the question of whether the}} single module has an influence on achieving a higher performance in the overarching context of this PI. For example, reflecting the right quantity of parts within one shipment is relevant during the reception of goods where it is suggested as a PI. Line-back, during truck registration, the <b>correct</b> <b>quantity</b> of parts within a single shipment can neither be influenced, nor checked: this PI is therefore not monitored for truck registration. On the other hand, following the process further line-back, this PI is again suggested for the supplier. This allows assigning to each process module only PIs that can be influenced and avoids overloading responsibles with PIs.|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} made of two predictor-corrector {{procedures}} for the accurate determination of global, as well as detailed, thermal buckling response characteristics of composite plates. Both procedures use first-order shear deformation theory in the predictor phase, but differ in {{the elements of the}} computational model being adjusted in the corrector phase. The first procedure calculates a posteriori estimates of the composite correction factors and uses them to adjust the transverse shear stiffnesses of the plate. The second procedure calculates a posteriori the functional dependence of the displacement components on the thickness coordinate. The <b>corrected</b> <b>quantities</b> are then used in conjunction with three-dimensional equations to obtain better estimates for the different response quantities. Extensive numerical results are presented, showing the effects of variation in the geometric and lamination parameters for antisymmetrically laminated composite plates subjected to uniform temperature rise, on the accuracy of the thermal buckling response obtained by predictor-corrector procedures...|$|R

30|$|For {{the field}} {{measurements}} by Lin et al.

Further, to see any meter reliability problems, a physical meter reading can be adopted to monitor thermal output from 2015 to 2019, followed by automatic meter reading through the mobile phone system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to serve as an introduction, for non-physicists, to the subject of light {{distribution}} in hollow structures. The motivation for light distribution is the importance of getting the maximum value from available light. We all recognize that photons cost money (one photon costs about $ 10 (exp - 25) to make) so we obviously want to try to make the maximum number of photons for a given cost. What is often overlooked, however, is that these photons have the highest value only if they are delivered to the right place in the <b>correct</b> <b>quantity.</b> This means that there is often substantial economic value in the high quality distribution of light. This problem is discussed from a very general perspective, in order to show the role of general optical films for manipulating light. The underlying physics at work in such films is described, and examples of common optical light distribution films are provided...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} {{training on the}} iPad can improve children’s quantity recognition, and whether different types of training might be warranted for children with different levels of experience. Study 1 tested the effects of multiple exemplar training (3 cars / 3 apples / 3 ducks, etc.) versus single exemplar training (3 cars / 3 cars / 3 cars, etc.) in recognizing quantities. For children just learning to recognize quantities (0 - 2 knowers), training with multiple exemplars was most effective for quantities three and four. For 3 - 6 knower children, single exemplar training was most effective for learning quantities five and six. Study 2 tested the effects of using a training set with perceptually distinct dice-like arrangements versus linear arrangements of objects in the quantity recognition task. 0 - 2 knower children tended to choose the familiar arrangements which were shown in the training session (regardless of quantity), while 3 - 6 knowers could pick out the <b>correct</b> <b>quantity</b> regardless of arrangement. This result suggests that selecting the right type of training is important for facilitating children’s early number learning. ...|$|R
