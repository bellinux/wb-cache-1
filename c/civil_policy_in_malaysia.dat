The success or failure of {{regulatory compliance}} <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia</b> will depend to a large extent on the readiness of actors to accept responsibility to implement at every level. This article highlights discussion concerning barriers to implementation of disaster management <b>policy</b> <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> Concerning the main negative attitudes as a result of a research on actors' perceptions about compliance with disaster planning <b>policy</b> <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia,</b> it is essential to recognise them as the barriers which would have to be systematically addressed by the Prime Minister's Department to minimise their negative effects on regulatory compliance implementation. Undoubtedly, some actors have reservations about accepting regulatory compliance. This reservation might be the key to the main issue towards implementation. They have broadly negative general attitudes towards regulatory compliance, arguing that currently too many barriers are present in department levels to make regulatory compliance implementation straightforward. Actors <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia</b> appear to see the process of regulatory compliance from the point of view of the existing public service system. They underestimate barriers in disaster planning by not taking appropriate and effective measures (preparedness) to reduce or minimise(mitigate) effects in response to disaster...|$|R

To achieve the objective, Vector Autoregressive Regression (VAR) method was used to generate impulse response function and variance decomposition to trace the impact of a shock <b>in</b> monetary <b>policy</b> on bank lending <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> The results show that a monetary <b>policy</b> tightening <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia</b> gives a negative impact on all the sectors.

The manufacturing, agricultural, and mining sector seems to decline more than the aggregate bank lending in response to interest rate shock.

The developments of energy <b>policies</b> <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia</b> were traced {{from the early}} 1970 s {{with the introduction of}} the country’s first energy-related policy all the way to 2010 with the country’s first endeavour towards a biobased energy system. Analyses revealed that many of the policies were either: (1) directly responding to changes in global/domestic socioeconomic and political events, or (2) provided visions to guide developments of the energy sector in alignment with the country’s growth agenda. Critical examinations of the country’s actual energy consumptions during these 40 years were also conducted to evaluate the efficacy of these energy-related policies. Three noteworthy successes <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia’s</b> energy landscape are: (1) the formation of PETRONAS as the national oil and gas company; (2) reduction of country’s over-reliance on oil as a single source of energy by significantly growing the production and use of natural gas in a short span of time; and (3) creation of a thriving oil and gas value chain and ecosystem in the country. However, the country is still critically dependent on scarce petroleum resources, despite having an abundance of renewable reserves.

This article aims to analyze issues and challenges of food security implementation <b>policies</b> <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia,</b> from 1981 to 2012. The study argues that the issues and challenges of food security policy implementation are partly due to the failure of the government to formulate an effective policy, which was not parallel with the process of globalization. Methodologically, this study has gathered both, primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected through interviews with a group of experts including the academicians, policymakers, non-governmental organizations and from the public as well as data from content analysis method. While secondary data was obtained through literature review covers both printed and electronic documents including books and journals. The results showed that food security related <b>policies</b> <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia</b> are not effective because first, Malaysia does not have a concrete and comprehensive policies since the early independence until now, secondly, the development policy implemented by the government starting from the 1980 ’s is not balanced and has neglected the development of the agricultural sector, particularly food crops; third, the implementation of policies and strategies related to food security is inconsistent nationally; and, fourth, globalization contributes to food insecurity issues. The study also demonstrates that the implementation of policies related to food security, to date, has resulted in the declining of growth in food sectors and increase food dependency on the international market. This in turn had a negative impact on human security <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> This study suggests that the agricultural sector should be given serious attention by the government in order to reduce dependence on imported food besides to ensure human security in the country...|$|R

Identification of the SVAR is achieved by imposing zero restrictions non-recursively on the contemporaneous interactions among the variables. This identification leads to the interpretation of an interest rate shock as unanticipated monetary policy. We find that unanticipated monetary policy explains very little of the variability in output and inflation at all forecast horizons but does account for some short run variability in the real exchange rate. Foreign variables explain most of the variability of output and inflation, though domestic credit is important for output at the one quarter horizon. We conclude that foreign shocks are the dominant influence on the macroeconomic performance of Malaysia. 24 page(s...|$|R

The aim {{of this research was}} to explain the discursive ‘rules’ of the construction of the medium of instruction (MOI) <b>policy</b> <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> The study of rules includes an exploration of the discursive techniques (e. g., intertextuality and interdiscursivity) employed by various individuals in their construction of the MOI <b>policy</b> debates <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> The discourse data obtained was collected from (1) the national parliament archives and (2) the archives of a selected number of mainstream and non-mainstream news media <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> The analysis focused on a specific MOI policy, i. e., PPSMI (Pengajaran dan Pembelajaran Sains dan Matematik Dalam Bahasa Inggeris tr. Teaching of Mathematics and Science <b>in</b> English) <b>Policy</b> that ran for six years (2003 - 2009). The discourse was analysed based on critical discourse analysis (Fairclough, 2001, 2009, 2013). The thesis explains the micro features within the textual formations and the macro features or the ‘conditions of possibility’ of textual formations. The analysis shows that the discursive formations were effects of local realities constructed in political terms. These formations were also effects of external factors, like the rise of English in the contemporary world. The analysis also shows that the members of the parliament and the writers of the newspaper articles made frequent reference to the global and local ‘realities’ in order to perspectivize (Reisigl &Wodak, 2009) and to legitimize (van Leewuen, 1999, 2008) their claims. The pro-policy individuals in their arguments minimized the foreign-ness associated with English <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> <b>In</b> their discourses English was constructed as a language of opportunity. Other constructions foregrounded were discourses of globalization, open market, modernity and so on. The anti-policy discourse on the other hand used the occasion of policy debates as an opportunity to address various socio-political antagonisms within the country. The pro and the anti-policy statements <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia</b> appeared to be a ‘symptom’ of a multilingual and multiethnic nationhood with large minorities.
