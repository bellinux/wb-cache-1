40|$|Variable speed {{reciprocating}} compressors (VSRC) {{present some}} advantages comparing to single speed compressors, mainly {{in terms of}} energy consumption and noise. Once the acoustic performance is analyzed, it is verified that the compressor running most {{part of the time}} at frequencies lower than the ones of the electric nets imply lower sound level for VSRC and, therefore, many home appliances manufacturers direct their use in the premium refrigerator models. Following a general market trend for comfort items, home appliances noise {{is becoming more and more}} important nowadays, implying even VSRCs demand acoustic improvements in order to reduce the sound level of the refrigerators. In such a scenario, this paper presents numerical and experimental studies carried out in an existing platform of variable speed compressors, identifying some sources and transmission paths associated to the overall sound level of the compressor itself and a representative refrigerator model. Based on the foreseen opportunities, a design optimization focusing on sources and paths is presented and, as a result, the acoustic performance of the new generation is compared to the performance of the current version of this variable speed <b>compressor</b> <b>platform...</b>|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 77 - 84 This paper {{describes}} a comprehensive {{life cycle cost}} (LCC) analysis procedure, regarding turbomachinery systems for offshore {{oil and gas production}} platforms. The LCC analysis includes the development of a cost breakdown structure, the selection of costs models, data gathering and treatment model allocation and development of the life cycle costs profile, and finally, the life cycle cost assessment. An important step is the analysis of the reliability, availability and maintainability of the plant which quantifies the potential production losses relative to the plant availability. A dilemma that, very often, challenges rotating machinery engineers is how to make a decision between mechanical and electric drives for the main <b>platform</b> <b>compressors.</b> Usually, about 50 percent of the power requirement of a platform is used for gas compressing. A case study is conducted to evaluate among different driving solutions and also to demonstrate the cost reduction and optimization potential. It can be observed that the production losses are critical for the overall outcome...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an artificial intelligence monitoring system {{developed by the}} NASA Glenn Principal Investigator Microgravity Services project to help the principal investigator teams identify the primary vibratory disturbance sources that are active, at any moment in time, on-board the International Space Station, which might impact the microgravity environment their experiments are exposed to. From the Principal Investigator Microgravity Services' web site, the principal investigator teams can monitor via a graphical display, in near real time, which event(s) is/are on, such as crew activities, pumps, fans, centrifuges, <b>compressor,</b> crew exercise, <b>platform</b> structural modes, etc., and {{decide whether or not}} to run their experiments based on the acceleration environment associated with a specific event. This monitoring system is focused primarily on detecting the vibratory disturbance sources, but could be used as well to detect some of the transient disturbance sources, depending on the events duration. The system has built-in capability to detect both known and unknown vibratory disturbance sources. Several soft computing techniques such as Kohonen's Self-Organizing Feature Map, Learning Vector Quantization, Back-Propagation Neural Networks, and Fuzzy Logic were used to design the system...|$|R
40|$|Gas lift is {{a method}} of {{artificial}} lift that uses an external source of high pressure gas for supplementing formation gas to lift the well fluids. The primary limitations for gas lift operations are the lack of formation gas or of an outside source of gas, wide well spacing and available space for <b>compressors</b> on offshore <b>platforms.</b> Generally, gas lift is not applicable to single-well installations and widely spaced wells that are not suited for a centrally located power system. Gas lift can intensify {{the problems associated with}} production of viscous crude, super-saturated brine, or an emulsion. Old casing, sour gas and long, small - internal diameter flow lines can rule out gas lift operations. Wet gas without dehydration will reduce the reliability of gas lift operations. A model relating the factors affecting potential production rate along the tubing of a gas lift oil well was developed to optimize production using analytical approach. Modified Darcy equation was employed alongside some other equation of flow such as Fanning’s equation, Reynolds’ equation and a host of others which resulted in the developed model equation. Data from four wells were used in applying the model equation and it was found that, for the four wells and the square of the velocity of oil flow is equal to the oil production rate and both vary directly with the difference in pressure between the reservoir and the well bore. This implies, the lower the well bore pressure the higher the oil production rate and oil velocity...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{centered}} around the possibilities of integrating offshore wind power together with oil and gas platforms. The motivation behind this topic {{is to reduce the}} emissions of CO 2 and other pollutive gases from conventional offshore power plants. The electrical systems on oil platforms are weaker than an onshore grid, so measures should be taken to let the wind power integration contribute to a more stable operation on the platform. To explore existing and future technologies that can achieve this {{is an important part of}} this work. Two different power systems are presented, denoted System 1 and System 2. Their schematics are shown in Fig. 1. Corresponding simulation models are built from fundamental blocks in the software PSCAD/EMTDC. Aggregated models are utilized in order to save computational time. System 1 consists of an offshore wind farm and an oil platform connected together in islanded operation. The oil platform contains an synchronous generator with an associated gas turbine and can adjust both active and reactive power quickly. The load consists of fixed-speed induction motors. The wind farm contains a back-to-back Voltage Source Converter (VSC) which is used for variable speed operation of the turbine. The converter is also used for voltage support to the system, and this functionality reduces voltage oscillations during disturbances. The most critical scenario investigated is to start a large induction motor. It is shown that the transmission cable may contribute to an increasing risk of voltage collapse during the start-up. Another critical event is when the wind power is suddenly disconnected, and the gas turbine has to adjust the power output quickly in order to avoid too large frequency deviations. The simulations show that a disconnection of the whole wind farm does not lead to critical operation or possible instability. This would not be the case in a system with slower control systems in the gas turbine and synchronous generator. System 2 consists of a VSC-HVDC connection between Kollsnes and the platform Troll A. This existing configuration is powering a gas <b>compressor</b> on the <b>platform</b> through a variable speed synchronous motor. This thesis proposes to integrate wind power on the DC-side of the Troll A VSC-terminal. The challenge is to inject wind power in a way such that the operation of the gas compressor is not disturbed. The proposed control system is working as intended, and the selected simulation cases show that the compressor system is not affected by the wind power. The DC voltage control system is able to maintain a constant voltage at the Troll terminal during normal operation. The wind farm reduces the losses in the HVDC-cable, and surplus wind power is sent to the land grid during low-load operation. The DC-voltage drops to 73 % of the rated value for 10 ms when the wind power is suddenly disconnected, but the duration is so short that it does not affect the gas compressor operation. The simulation results indicate that both configurations are feasible. However, the results are heavily dependent on the parameter data, and further research should put more efforts into gaining as correct values as possible. A sensitivity analysis is performed to System 1 as a guideline to which parameters that are most decisive, and therefore should be modeled most accurately. In addition, new simulation cases might reveal challenges that this thesis does not concern. </p...|$|R
