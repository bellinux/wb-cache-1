40|$|Today one of {{the most}} {{important}} challenges in HPC is the development of computers with a low power consumption. In this context, recently, new embedded many-core systems have emerged. One of them is Kalray. Unlike other many-core architectures, Kalray is not a co-processor (self-hosted). One interesting feature of the Kalray architecture is the Network on Chip (NoC) connection. Habitually, the communication in many-core architectures is carried out via shared memory. However, in Kalray, the communication among processing elements can also be via Message-Passing on the NoC. One of the main motivations of this work is to present the main constraints to deal with the Kalray architecture. In particular, we focused on memory management and communication. We assess the use of NoC and shared memory on Kalray. Unlike shared memory, the implementation of Message-Passing on NoC is not transparent from programmer point of view. The synchronization among processing elements and NoC is other of the challenges to deal with in the Karlay processor. Although the synchronization using Message-Passing is more complex and consuming time than using shared memory, we obtain an overall speedup close to 6 when using Message-Passing on NoC with respect to the use of shared memory. Additionally, we have measured the power consumption of both approaches. Despite of being faster, the use of NoC presents a higher power consumption with respect to the approach that exploits shared memory. This additional <b>consumption</b> <b>in</b> <b>Watts</b> is about a 50...|$|E

50|$|Commonly called 'light bulbs', lamps are the {{removable}} and replaceable {{part of a}} light fixture, which converts {{electrical energy}} into electromagnetic radiation. While lamps have traditionally been rated and marketed primarily {{in terms of their}} power <b>consumption,</b> expressed <b>in</b> <b>watts,</b> proliferation of lighting technology beyond the incandescent light bulb has eliminated the correspondence of wattage to the amount of light produced. For example, a 60 W incandescent light bulb produces about the same amount of light as a 13 W compact fluorescent lamp. Each of these technologies has a different efficacy in converting electrical energy to visible light. Visible light output is typically measured in lumens. This unit only quantifies the visible radiation, and excludes invisible infrared and ultraviolet light. A wax candle produces on the close order of 13 lumens, a 60 watt incandescent lamp makes around 700 lumens, and a 15-watt compact fluorescent lamp produces about 800 lumens, but actual output varies by specific design. Rating and marketing emphasis is shifting away from wattage and towards lumen output, to give the purchaser a directly applicable basis upon which to select a lamp.|$|R
40|$|Present-day {{waste heat}} {{production}} {{as a result}} of energy use is a climate forcing that has not drawn much attention, although Chaisson [2008] recently discussed its potential future climate impact. Current global primary energy consumption amounts to 15. 5 TeraWatts (U. S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) base year 2005; see Table 1). The global average primary energy consumption (0. 03 watts per square meter) is relatively small compared to other anthropogenic radiative forcings, as summarized in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [2007] report. Nevertheless, despite its relatively small magnitude, waste heat may have a considerable impact on local surface temperature measurements, as outlined below Unlike the globally well-mixed greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4), energy use does not occur uniformly around the globe. Assuming that energy use predominantly occurs over land (30 % of the globe) and that one-third of the land is populated, energy use for this populated land area is already 0. 3 watts per square meter. We can further investigate themagnitude of energy use by calculating energy <b>consumption</b> per country <b>in</b> <b>watts</b> per square meter using the energy consumption estimates from EIA (table 1) ...|$|R
