5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A <b>common</b> <b>opinion</b> is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E
5|$|But the {{identification}} of the poem as Stoic is not unanimous. In 1887, against the <b>common</b> <b>opinion</b> of scholars at the time, Gustave Lanson contested the idea that the poem is Stoic. More recently, in 2005, Alexander MacGregor argued that while contemporary scholars, such as Goold and Volk, read Manilius as a Stoic, the Astronomica actually breaks with or contradicts Stoic tradition in a number of places. Namely, Manilius exalts Plato, Socrates, and Pythagoras; proposes a Platonic proof for the existence of God, denies the ekpyrosis (that is, a belief in the periodic destruction of the cosmos by an immense conflagration every Great Year, followed by a cosmic recreation), never discusses the six Stoic paradoxes as discussed by Cicero, and ignores the importance of controlling the soul. Manilius also focuses on a number of decidedly Pythagorean tenets: the Pythagorean order of the planets, the importance of geometry and numbers, and the significance of tetraktys (that is, triangular figures made up of ten points arranged in four rows). Finally, in key places, the poet makes use of non-Stoics like Eudoxus of Cnidus and Cicero. Given these factors, MacGregor concludes that Manilius should be classified as an idealistic Pythagorean or a Platonist rather than a Stoic.|$|E

25|$|While {{the siege}} was {{underway}} the Duke mustered his main force at Grammont {{and his cousin}} and ally John II, Count of Nevers, his forces at Seclin.

25|$|In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court {{struck down}} the {{impositions}} {{of the death penalty}} in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.

Stewart and William O. Douglas worried explicitly about racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty. Thurgood Marshall and William J.

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 473 p. That rhetoric {{plays a major role in}} maintaining or transforming a regime should be considered an important element of regime analysis. Adopting an Aristotelian conceptual framework for examining tyranny and the rhetoric of tyrannical regimes allows us to understand modern, culturally specific, examples of political rhetoric while drawing general conclusions about the universal regularities of politics. Aristotle's cyclical account of politics contrasts and improves upon modern comparative development theory by acknowledging the real possibility of decay in a regime and, therefore, emphasizing the need to preserve stability in the regime by improving justice in the mixing of the democratic elements with the oligarchic. Drawing from Aristotle to develop the rhetoric of tyranny, I examine how rhetoric addresses the <b>common</b> <b>opinions</b> of the masses (the endoxa) and how this conforms to the modern comparative analysis of the mass political culture. Enthymemes of tyrannical rhetoric seek to legitimize the preservation of order by appealing to the authoritative or religious endoxa in the political culture of the people. My purpose with respect to analyzing the rhetoric of the political elite in Singapore and Burma is: (1) to show that by addressing the <b>common</b> <b>opinions</b> of the many, their rhetoric conforms to the principles of enthymematic persuasion in the Rhetoric; (2) to challenge the examples used to support their enthymemes, and the truth of the <b>common</b> <b>opinions</b> upon which they are based, that is, to expose them as sophistry; and (3) to show that their rhetoric conforms with Aristotle's advice for preserving tyrannies in the Politics. I find that the political leaders in Singapore and Burma have either invented endoxa (Confucian, Asian, or shared values and the creation of Buddhist ceremonies and kingly duties) or manipulated the traditional endoxa by altering historical accounts and interpreting Confucian or Buddhist traditions to conform to their political ends. Analyzing the rhetoric of benevolent despotism in Singapore and Burma produces some fundamental similarities between the rhetorical strategies undertaken by the leaders of both regimes. This includes the use of survival rhetoric and enthymemes that address religious or ethical codes deemed to be authoritative in a nation's political culture...|$|R
