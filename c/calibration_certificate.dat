30|$|Measurement {{uncertainty}} {{was evaluated}} {{based on the}} bottom-up approach (International Organization for Standardization [1995]). All the contributions were obtained from <b>calibration</b> <b>certificates</b> and from statistical analysis of repeated measurements. Trueness of the method was calculated from results of CRM analysis, while repeatability was evaluated from precision experiments. The uncertainty of volumetric operations (volumetric flasks, pipettes) was calculated by using manufacturer data on <b>calibration</b> uncertainty (from <b>certificates),</b> the uncertainty {{associated with the use}} of glassware at a temperature different from that of calibration, and the repeatability of volumetric deliveries. Uncertainty of balances was calculated from data obtained from <b>calibration</b> <b>certificates</b> (declared uncertainty) and the repeatability of weighing. After estimation, all sources of uncertainty were combined according to the law of propagation of uncertainties, obtaining the combined standard uncertainty (u(Ca)). The final result was reported as expanded uncertainty (U(Ca)), calculated as U(Ca) = k × u(Ca), where k is the coverage factor, corresponding to a 95 % confidence level.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this work}} is to {{correlate}} the homogeneity of the microstructure of two certified hardness standard blocks, both with the same hardness value range, with its uniformity hardness values. In order to identify the morphological characteristics of the blocks studied, as grain size distribution, an automatic image analysis system with software based on ASTM E 112 and ASTM E 1382 standards was employed. The hardness measurements were carried out in industrial hardness tester machine, in three {{different regions of the}} blocks. The results obtained for both blocks showed that, for the regions where coarsed grains were observed as islands of microstructure non-homogeneity, the hardness values dropped compared with those mentioned in the <b>calibration</b> <b>certificates.</b> The microstructure homogeneity plays therefore an important role on the uniformity of hardness values for reference blocks...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{calibrating}} instruments {{that do not}} have built-in data communication interfaces is very time-consuming and may be subject to human error since it involves many data readings and annotations by the technician who performs the task.

This paper explores the use of computer vision techniques in automating the process of calibrating measurement instruments with numeric digital displays {{that do not have}} data communication interfaces. Using a USB camera, the image of the instrument display is acquired; and, after its analysis, the digits are recognized and the corresponding values stored in a file to be used in issuing <b>calibration</b> <b>certificates.</b> For thistask, three different approaches were described and evaluated.

40|$|Abstract-This {{protocol}} {{was developed to}} estimate the uncertainty of measurement of a chemical analysis by utilizing in-house validation studies and quality control data. The approach was to generate {{an estimate of the}} uncertainty across the analytical concentracion range. This was to be expressed as a mathematical equation or factor that could be inserted into a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) and thus produce an uncertainty estimate from an entered analytical result. The aim is to identify as many sources of uncertainty as possible and account for them by appropriatte precision and trueness studies. Any additional sources of uncertainty are evaluated by other means such as <b>calibration</b> <b>certificates,</b> published dana, etc [...] It is not necessary to evaluate every source of uncertainty if they are deemed insignificant, unless there are a large number of them. Uncertainty components that are less than one third of the largest component are not evaluated in detail. A preliminary estimate of the contribution of each component or combination of components to the uncertainty is made and those that are not significant eliminated. The uncertainty contributions is expressed as standard deviation, and combined according to the appropriate rules, to give a combined standard uncertainty.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} uncertainty evaluation for axi-symmetric measurement machines which is compliant with GUM and PUMA methodologies. Specialized measuring machines for the inspection of axisymmetric components enable the measurement of properties such as roundness (radial runout), axial runout and coning. These machines typically consist of a rotary table {{and a number of}} contact measurement probes located on slideways. Sources of uncertainty include the probe calibration process, probe repeatability, probe alignment, geometric errors in the rotary table, the dimensional stability of the structure holding the probes and form errors in the reference hemisphere which is used to calibrate the system. The generic method is described and an evaluation of an industrial machine is described as a worked example. Type A uncertainties were obtained from a repeatability study of the probe calibration process, a repeatability study of the actual measurement process, a system stability test and an elastic deformation test.
