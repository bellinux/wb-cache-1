40|$|Robotic {{arms are}} {{indispensable}} tools in both industry and education. The robotic arm currently {{used in the}} MIT class 2. 12, Introduction to Robotics, {{is in need of}} revision. The arm is heavy, imprecise, bulky, and difficult to customize. The new design presented in this thesis resolves these issues while making the arm more user-friendly and inexpensive enough for classroom use. It uses Hitec HS- 805 BB hobby servo motors to directly drive each joint. Controlling these motors is effortless with the many commercially available servo motor drivers. Modular construction allows students to change the shape and size of the arm's workspace easily; creating and installing custom linkages is a simple task. Linkages and motor output shafts mount to a common <b>connection</b> <b>shaft</b> with one-sided cut hubs. The radial loads in these shafts are supported by maintenance-free Super Oilite bronze bearings. This robotic arm is better suited for a classroom environment than the current one. It weighs 2. 7 pounds; the old one weight 21. 2 pounds. Though its workspace and recommended linkage length are about 7 % smaller than those of the old design are, it is 87 % more precise. (cont.) It is 60 % cheaper with a materials cost of $ 120 for a two degree of freedom arm. The new motors have 343 oz-in of torque, which is sufficient to handle a 12 oz payload 17 inches from the joint axis or a 16 oz payload at 14 inches. Students will spend less time connecting wires and calibrating sensors. This arm should be a welcome addition to the introductory robotics classroom. by David Lafferty. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Abstract:- Pumps {{are often}} used in both {{industrial}} applications and mobile hydraulic machinery. In variable displacement pumps, the flow rate is dictated by the system requirements. The electro-hydraulic pump is a new integrated product, which comprise {{the combination of a}} pump and motor as a unit replacing the traditional <b>connection</b> with a <b>shaft</b> coupling. The pump is actuated without a rotating shaft utilizing a piston pump embedded in the motor. This brings with it some added advantages such as easy installation, reduction of noise in the system and decrease in power loss. In operation, the piston pump body is placed in the motor rotor, the air gap between the rotor and motor stator is filled with hydraulic oil, the rotor is directly rotated in the hydraulic oil and the control of the pressure and flow is achieved by means of the mechanical adjustment at the pressure valve. Electro-hydraulic systems with volumetric control offer a lot of advantages for pumping, due to the use of axial pistons with variable displacements possibilities. Several researchers have tried to describe the performance structure of these pumps in relation to efficiency; energy loss etc. without needed success. Previous studies have shown that using single loop suppress the steady state vibration, causes relatively good valve performance and reduces the impact on the control piston at the ends of a system’s strokes. The use of single feedback control loop reduces the pump production cost whilst maintaining reasonable performance useful for many different and acceptable commercial applications. In our research work we carried out some engineering studies of the control structures of these systems by investigating the characteristics, the convenience and dependence on control scheme and power operation. This paper focuses particularly on the automation of the control systems of these pumps.

40|$|Enlarged (Type II) {{pile shaft}} {{foundations}} are used frequently in reinforced concrete bridges {{because of the}} convenience in construction and efficiency in post- earthquake inspection and repair. According to the specifications of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the diameter of a Type II shaft {{should be at least}} 610 mm (2 ft) larger than that of the column. Hence, the column reinforcement extended into the pile shaft can be perceived as forming a non-contact splice with the pile shaft reinforcement. Because of the lack of data, the seismic design specifications of Caltrans on the embedment length of column reinforcement in Type II shafts are very conservative for large-diameter columns, which could complicate the construction work and entail high construction costs. This dissertation presents an experimental and analytical investigation to characterize the bond between concrete and reinforcing steel when a reinforced concrete member is subjected to severe cyclic loading, and determine the minimum embedment length required for column longitudinal reinforcement extended into a Type II shaft. Experiments were carried out to investigate the bond strength and cyclic bond deterioration of large-diameter bars (No. 11, 14, and 18) commonly used in large-diameter bridge columns and piles. The experimental results have been used to develop, calibrate, and validate a phenomenological bond-slip model for bars embedded in well-confined concrete. The model successfully reproduces bond deterioration caused by cyclic bar-slip reversals and tensile yielding of the bar, and has been implemented in an interface element in a finite element program. A physics-based dilatant interface model formulated with a multi-surface plasticity concept has also been developed and implemented in the finite element program to simulate bond-slip under a broad range of confinement situations. With the phenomenological bond- slip model, nonlinear finite element analysis has been conducted to extrapolate results of development length tests conducted on large-diameter bars, and assess the reliability of the development lengths required in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. Finally, two large-scale tests on column-pile shaft assemblies were conducted. The tests were combined with finite element analysis to evaluate the conservatism of the current Caltrans specifications, and provide new design recommendations that can significantly reduce the embedment length required for column reinforcement, while ensuring an appropriate performance of the column-pile <b>shaft</b> <b>connections</b> under severe seismic load...|$|R
40|$|Wet {{clutches}} are {{machine components}} using friction to transfer torque and providing interruptible <b>connection</b> between rotating <b>shafts</b> in different automobile applications including automatic transmissions. Like any friction generating machine components, wet clutches {{are susceptible to}} continuous wear and degradation during sliding. This regular deterioration process {{as well as the}} choice of operating conditions, ultimately change the overall system performance during operation due to resultant change in the system parameters. The first part of this thesis summarizes some of the notable studies on the wet clutch tribological performance and clarifies goals of the investigation. Previously, plenty of experimental studies on wet clutches have been reported but still some effects regarding the water contamination problem and the influence of mechanical design factors are not covered thoroughly. The thesis aims to experimentally analyse these two different aspects for improving wet clutch performance regarding frictional characteristics and reliability. These two investigations are focused on wet clutches in automatic transmission applications. For evaluating friction behaviour during a long clutch engagement period, suitable test equipment is designed where standard paper based friction plates and steel separator plates are tested with commercially available ATF. To investigate a clutch operated in a controlled environment is one of main the research objectives. The vital concern while designing the test rig is to monitor the clutch parameters for achieving the desired operating conditions for individual tests. Instead of using a multiple clutch plate configuration, as in real applications, a single friction and reaction plate arrangement is considered to simplify the analyses. An experimental study on wet clutch frictional behaviour under water contaminated lubrication condition reveals the change in the friction level for a water contaminated lubricant. It was shown that the friction level increased for the addition of water in the system. This is not a desirable clutch frictional behaviour for maintaining frictional stability. The increase of friction for added water was influenced by the water amount but not by the water exposure time. The test results also showed a higher change in the separator plate's roughness parameter (Ra) for water contaminated systems compared to an uncontaminated wet clutch. In the second part of this thesis, the influence of the clutch’s output shaft’s stiffness and inertia on the clutch system‘s friction reliability is experimentally evaluated. Test results show that the choice of these design factors can provide different outcome concerning clutch frictional performance and shudder sensitivity. Shudder tendency is seen to be increased for decreased torsion shaft stiffness. High frictional losses and clutch degradation are observed for systems with less inertia.
