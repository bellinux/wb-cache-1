40|$|The {{emerging}} biofuel industry demands {{large amount}} of biomass feedstock. Although commercial ethanol has been produced from primary biomass sources such as corns, the global food crisis caused {{by the use of}} primary biomass has been raised. Thus, lignocellulosic biomass, known as second generation of biomass, has become a promising source for ethanol production. However, the more complex structure requires more advance technology. MSW with more than 60 % of biodegradable composition, as one of the promising biomass sources has the potential benefits of replacing primary biomass and preventing environment from MSW pollution. In this paper, three major biodegradable municipal solid waste (BMSW) components: kitchen organic waste (KOW), green organic waste (GOW) and paper and <b>card</b> <b>waste</b> (PCW), are classified and characterised according to substrate composition, cellulose crystallinity, bulk density and particle size. The substrate composition indicates how much cellulose, lignin, hermicellulose each model waste has. The cellulose content shows the potential glucose/ethanol product yield. Other chemical composition such as lignin and hemicellulose indicates how easy of each model waste can be converted. These contents are also important information when selecting pretreatment methods and conversion process conditions in the following steps. Based on the comprehensive understanding of biomass structures and compositions, studies look into the effects of substrate properties (such crystallinity, presence of lignin and cellulose content on process performances during enzymatic hydrolysis adsorption. Results indicated how the adsorption process is affected by the substrate properties. This provides understanding of the role of substrate properties during enzyme-cellulose adsorption...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to study the working of two {{different}} combinations of stationary flats having different wire points per square inch and its impact on waste percentage reduction and cotton fiber behavior. The overall objective is to increase the yield percentage by minimizing the <b>carding</b> <b>waste</b> with the help of stationary flats, and also improving the quality of ring spun yarn. This research is partial to the performance of stationary flats only, and does not involve other parts of carding machine. Further research may be carried out on other parts of the carding machine as well. The paper tries to identify the best combination of stationary flats on C- 60 Q-pack carding machine for cotton fiber...|$|R

40|$|The {{activity}} of microorganisms {{and the availability}} of composting substrates for decomposition are seriously affected by drying and rewetting cycles. We have measured microbial biomass C (BC) and ninhydrin reactive N (BNIN) of samples of composting material taken at different times from a pile of ligno-cellulosic wastes. Dynamics of these two parameters in control samples that were kept continuously moist were compared with those of samples of the same material that had been subjected to drying and rewetting. The study was also performed on soils to investigate analogies and differences of behaviour of microbial biomass in such different substrates. Moist samples from 10 soils with different organic C content (6. 6 - 41. 9 g kg- 1 soil) were analyzed for their BC and BNIN content. The soils were then air-dried, rewetted and incubated at 25 °C for 10 days. On days 1, 3, 6 and 10 of incubation, samples were analyzed for BC and BNIN content. Compost samples from different composting stages of a mixture of cotton <b>carding</b> and yard <b>wastes</b> were air-dried, rewetted and incubated at 25 °C for 12 days, together with the corresponding moist samples (control). On days 1, 5 and 12 of incubation period, samples were analyzed for BC and BNIN content. The regression coefficient between BC and BNIN for all the compost data (continuously moist and rewetted) was 21. 4 (r = 0. 89 P < 0. 001), very close to values normally found in soils, confirming the reliability of microbial biomass measurements performed on composting substrates. Soil drying caused on average a decrease in the size of microbial biomass with respect to moist samples of 13 % for BC and 30 % for BNIN. BC and BNIN of moist and rewetted soil samples were always significantly correlated. Microbial biomass contentof rewetted compost samples up to 19 days {{from the beginning of the}} process were significantly different, but highly correlated with moist controls. No significant differences between moist and rewetted samples (RW) were found in samples collected during the maturing and curing phases. The different response to drying of soils and compost could be related to the greater increase of new available substrate in compost with respect to soil following the drying-rewetting treatment. Dynamics of BC/BNIN ratio in compost was coherent with the normal trend observed in the composition of microbial community during the process, from prevailing bacteria and actinomycetes to prevailing fungi. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

5000|$|In {{the third}} round, Antigua and Barbuda were grouped with Jamaica, Guatemala and the United States. The first fixture in his group was an away match to the United States. Most people were expecting a convincing win by the U.S. but Antigua and Barbuda {{made it a}} {{competitive}} game. After conceding the first two goals from Carlos Bocanegra and Clint Dempsey in the 8th and the 44th minute respectively, Peter Byers scored a goal on a through pass from Mikele Leigertwood to bring the match to 2-1 in the 65th minute. The Benna Boys were somehow trying to equalize but that {{came to an end}} in the 72nd minute when Hercules Gomez scored a goal. The match ended in a 3-1 loss but Antigua and Barbuda gained respect for standing toe to toe with a CONCACAF giant. Up next was a home match to Jamaica. It ended in 0-0 draw gaining their first ever point in the third round of World Cup qualifying. Next, was another tough road test versus Guatemala in the pouring rain that saw some areas of field flooded. Surprisingly, Antigua and Barbuda opened the scoring in the 39th minute from Peter Byers and took the lead into half time. In the second half, Carlos Ruiz leveled the match at 1-1 in the 60th minute. It went from bad to worse when they were reduced to 10 men. Molvin James received a second yellow <b>card</b> for time <b>wasting</b> and Ruiz scored another goal to take the lead 3 minutes later. In the 91st minute Dwight Pezzarossi sealed the match 3-1. The return leg against Guatemala in Antigua saw Guatemala win 1-0 on a wonder strike from Carlos Ruiz in the 25th minute. A home match versus the United States was the next on the schedule. The United States opened up the scoring in the 20th minute on a header from Eddie Johnson but then 5 minutes later the Benna Boys leveled the score from Dexter Blackstock from a Peter Byers pass. The match saw both teams have chances to take the lead even though the U.S. had majority of the possession. Unfortunately, Antigua and Barbuda conceded a late goal, again off of an Eddie Johnson header in the 90th minute. The match ended in a 2-1 defeat thus eliminating them from advancing to the next round. The final match of the third round was a 4-1 loss away to Jamaica ending their 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign.|$|R
