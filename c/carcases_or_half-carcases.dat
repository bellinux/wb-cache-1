Its diet consists of slow moving prey such as molluscs, echinoderms, crustaceans and chitons, supplemented with fish <b>carcases</b> <b>or</b> other carrion. Although it has no crushing claws, its mandibles are powerful and can break open bivalve and gastropod shells.

40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} syndrome {{followed by}} ascites is a metabolic disorder in broilers that occurs {{more often in}} fast-growing birds and at cool temperatures. 2. Knowledge of the genetic relationships among ascites-related traits and performance traits like <b>carcase</b> traits <b>or</b> feed efficiency traits is required to design breeding programmes that aim to improve the degree of resistance to ascites syndrome as well as production traits. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate these genetic correlations. 3. Three different experiments were set up to measure ascites-related traits (4202 birds), feed efficiency traits (2166 birds) and carcase traits (2036 birds). The birds in different experiments originated from the same group of parents, which enabled the estimation of genetic correlations among different traits. 4. The genetic correlation of body weight (BW) measured under normal conditions and in the carcase experiment with the ascites indicator trait of right ventricle to total ventricle ratio (RV:TV) measured under cold conditions was 0 · 30. The estimated genetic correlation indicated that single-trait selecting for BW leads to an increase in occurrence of the ascites syndrome but that there are realistic opportunities of multi-trait selection of birds for improved BW and resistance to ascites. 5. Weak but positive genetic relationships were found between feed efficiency and ascites-related traits suggesting that more efficient birds tend to be slightly more susceptible to ascites. 6. The relatively low genetic correlation between BW measured in the <b>carcase</b> <b>or</b> in the feed efficiency experiments and BW measured in the ascites experiment (0 · 49) showed considerable genotype by environment interaction. These results indicate that birds with high genetic potential for growth rate under normal temperature conditions have lower growth rate under cold-stress conditions due to ascite...|$|R
40|$|Comparisons {{were made}} of the behaviour, {{physiology}} and meat quality of 24 -week-old male veal calves (mean live weight 234 kg) that were slaughtered either at the veal unit (the control group) or following 3 h transportation at space allowances of either 0. 7 or 0. 95 m 2 calf- 1 and 1. 5 h of lairage. Compared with nontransported calves, transported calves had a greater heart rate during the journey and during lairage; greater plasma cortisol concentration immediately after the journey, but not after 1. 5 h of lairage; and greater plasma creatine kinase activity immediately after the journey and after 1. 5 h of lairage. The transported calves did not lie down during the journey. There was no effect of space allowance on either the heart rate or frequency of potentially traumatic events during the journey or the plasma cortisol concentration and plasma creatine kinase activity sampled after the journey. There was no effect of transport on either <b>carcase</b> bruising <b>or</b> muscle pH 24 h after slaughter. Although compared with ‘on-farm’ slaughter, the transport and handling associated with the journey to the slaughterhouse were stressful to the calves; there were no adverse effects of transport on either <b>carcase</b> bruising <b>or</b> meat quality...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to rally {{available}} information and draw up a review of literature data {{on the topic of}} how freezing of a <b>carcase</b> <b>or</b> its storage at low temperatures affects its following colonization by insects while open exposition. Forensic entomology is one of the special and ever-developing field of criminology. It uses a knowledge of the biology, ecology and especially the life cycles of insect, mainly flies and beetles, to assist in the investigation of violent crimes in estimating of post mortem interval (PMI) or determining the cause of death. Insect colonization openly exposed corpses go through 5 to 8 successional waves depending on the surrounding environment. One of the important factors is the temperature which affects the decomposition process, where decomposition processes are longer at lower temperatures and on the contrary at shorter at higher temperatures. Temperature has a similar effect on development of insect, which develops only within the effective temperatures, whose values vary by species. The study performs an experiment which should verify whether insect is able to oviposit on the frozen carcasses and whether pre-frozen carcasses slow the subsequent colonization by flies of the family Calliphoridae. During the experiments, a total of twelve pieces of domestic fowl (Gallus gallus f. domestica L.), weighing about 1. 5 kg, were sacrificed in the same way, and a half of them was frozen before the exposition. Experiment results showed that the percentage of each species in both variants differed. Frozen and fresh cadaveres differed in the total nu mber of individuals (larvae), which developed on them, {{and the way in which}} the dead bodies decayed...|$|R
60|$|Domestic races {{propagate}} {{their kind}} far more truly, and endure for munch longer periods, than most naturalists {{are willing to}} admit. Breeders feel no doubt on this head: ask {{a man who has}} long reared Shorthorn or Hereford cattle, Leicester or Southdown sheep, Spanish or Game poultry, tumbler or carrier-pigeons, whether these races may not have been derived from common progenitors, and he will probably laugh you to scorn. The breeder admits that he may hope to produce sheep with finer or longer wool and with better <b>carcases,</b> <b>or</b> handsomer fowls, or carrier-pigeons with beaks just perceptibly longer to the practised eye, and thus be successful at an exhibition. Thus far he will go, but no farther. He does not reflect on what follows from adding up during a long course of time many slight, successive modifications; nor does he reflect on the former existence of numerous varieties, connecting the links in each divergent line of descent. He concludes, as was shown in the earlier chapters, that all the chief breeds to which he has long attended are aboriginal productions. The systematic naturalist, on the other hand, who generally knows nothing of the art of breeding, who does not pretend to know how and when the several domestic races were formed, who cannot have seen the intermediate gradations, for they do not now exist, nevertheless feels no doubt that these races are sprung from a single source. But ask him whether the closely allied natural species which he has studied may not have descended from a common progenitor, and he in his turn will perhaps reject the notion with scorn. Thus the naturalist and breeder may mutually learn a useful lesson from each other.|$|R
40|$|Phoretic mites {{are likely}} the most {{abundant}} arthropods found on carcases and corpses. They outnumber their scavenger carriers in both number and diversity. Many phoretic mites travel on scavenger insects and are highly specific; they will arrive on a particular species of host and no other. Because of this, they may be useful as trace indicators of their carriers even when their carriers are absent. Phoretic mites can be valuable markers of time. They are usually found in a specialised transitional transport or dispersal stage, often moulting and transforming to adults shortly after arrival on a <b>carcase</b> <b>or</b> corpse. Many are characterised by faster development and generation cycles than their carriers. Humans are normally unaware, but we too carry mites; they are skin mites that are present in our clothes. More than 212 phoretic mite species associated with carcases {{have been reported in}} the literature. Among these, mites belonging to the Mesostigmata form the dominant group, represented by 127 species with 25 phoretic mite species belonging to the family Parasitidae and 48 to the Macrochelidae. Most of these mesostigmatids are associated with particular species of flies or carrion beetles, though some are associated with small mammals arriving during the early stages of decomposition. During dry decay, members of the Astigmata are more frequently found; 52 species are phoretic on scavengers, and the majority of these travel on late-arriving scavengers such as hide beetles, skin beetles and moths. Several species of carrion beetles can visit a corpse simultaneously, and each may carry 1 - 10 species of phoretic mites. An informative diversity of phoretic mites may be found on a decaying carcass at any given time. The composition of the phoretic mite assemblage on a carcass might provide valuable information about the conditions of and time elapsed since death...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} perceived that {{high quality energy}} and protein sources in diets for newly-weaned pigs, such as milk powders, lactose and cooked cereals, promote better performance after weaning. However, their higher cost and stability of supply sometimes requires nutritionists to explore potential for other ingredients {{for use in the}} formulation of weaner diets. Recent research in grower pigs demonstrated that lupins could be included at up to 350 g/kg in place of soybean meal, without compromising growth, <b>carcase</b> composition <b>or</b> meat quality (Kim et al., 2007). However, the use of lupins in a weaner diet to reduce or replace more expensive protein sources, such as milk products, has not been examined to date. The hypothesis tested was that increasing the concentration of whole or dehulled Australian sweet lupins in place of milk by-products such as skim milk powder and dried whey in a diet would reduce performance of weaner pigs...|$|R
60|$|These vices are the CAUSES {{of those}} storms. Religion, morals, laws, prerogatives, privileges, liberties, rights of men, are the PRETEXTS. The pretexts are always {{found in some}} specious {{appearance}} of a real good. You would not secure men from tyranny and sedition, by rooting out of the mind the principles to which these fraudulent pretexts apply? If you did, you would root out everything that is valuable in the human breast. As these are the pretexts, so the ordinary actors and instruments in great public evils are kings, priests, magistrates, senates, parliaments, national assemblies, judges, and captains. You would not cure the evil by resolving {{that there should be}} no more monarchs, nor ministers of state, nor of the gospel; no interpreters of law; no general officers; no public councils. You might change the names. The things in some shape must remain. A certain quantum of power must always exist in the community, in some hands, and under some appellation. Wise men will apply their remedies to vices, not to names; to the causes of evil which are permanent, not to the occasional organs by which they act, and the transitory modes in which they appear. Otherwise you will be wise historically,--a fool in practice. Seldom have two ages the same fashion in their pretexts and the same modes of mischief. Wickedness is a little more inventive. Whilst you are discussing fashion, the fashion is gone by. The very same vice assumes a new body. The spirit transmigrates; and, far from losing its principle of life by the change of its appearance, it is renovated in its new organs with the fresh vigour of a juvenile activity. It walks abroad, it continues its ravages, whilst you are gibbeting the <b>carcase,</b> <b>or</b> demolishing the tomb. You are terrifying yourselves with ghosts and apparitions, whilst your house is the haunt of robbers. It is thus with all those who, attending only to the shell and husk of history, think they are waging war with intolerance, pride, and cruelty, whilst, under colour of abhorring the ill principles of antiquated parties, they are authorizing and feeding the same odious vices in different factions, and perhaps in worse.|$|R

40|$|Due to its {{antibacterial}} activity, oregano oil {{has lately}} become interesting {{as a potential}} 'natural' food preservative. Oregano oil {{was found to be}} a fast acting and effective inhibitor of a strain of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, the causative agent of a serious gastro-enteritis, and was lethal to this strain when used in high enough concentrations. Starting with 106 bacteria per millilitre broth, 156 ppm was lethal within 5 min; 625 ppm was lethal within 1 min. Treated bacterial cells observed under an electron microscope were lysed and apparently empty of cell contents. The chemical composition of two oregano oils was determined. Carvacrol and thymol, both phenolic compounds, appeared to be responsible for the antibacterial activity. The other two major components p-cymene and gamma-terpinene were found to be inactive against bacteria. The food stabiliser agar improved the antibacterial action of oregano oil in broth and the action of carvacrol was improved by both agar and stabiliser carrageenan. This enhancement is presumed to be due to the delayed separation of the essential oil or carvacrol droplets from suspension. The emulsifier lecithin markedly reduced the efficacy of oregano oil, possibly because it enclosed the carvacrol in micelles so that it came less into contact with bacterial cells. Changes in protein synthesis in E. coli O 157 :H 7 cells during overnight incubation with a sub-lethal concentration of carvacrol were demonstrated. Heat shock protein 60 (HSP 60) was induced in significant amounts and flagellin synthesis was almost completely inhibited, resulting in bacteria without flagella. Flagella are essential to bacterial motility and there is some evidence to indicate that they mediate adherence of pathogenic E. coli to epithelial cells in the gut and urinary tract. Further research is planned to investigate whether carvacrol can render E. coli O 157 :H 7 aflagellate in vivo and whether this inhibits adhesion and colonisation of gut epithelial cells. Carvacrol {{in the form of a}} vapour was effective in significantly reducing viable numbers of Salmonella enteritidis on raw chicken at temperatures ranging from 4 C to 37 C. This is promising for practical applications in the food sector since many foods are stored and transported at low temperatures. Possible uses could be the inclusion of a carvacrol carrier within the packaging for fresh products to reduce growth of spoilage bacteria. Alternatively, small <b>carcases</b> <b>or</b> pieces of meat could be decontaminated by vapour before further processing. In conclusion, there are several possible applications for oregano essential oil, and the constituent carvacrol in particular, in improving food safety. The addition of essential oil or carvacrol to food products could inhibit growth and reduce numbers of spoilage bacteria and pathogens. The use of carvacrol vapour within food packaging to extend the shelf life and improve safety or as a novel decontaminant for fresh meat is another possibility. A further potential application is in improving the intestinal health of food animals, when used as a feed additive...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the Scanogram as an aid in assessing carcase composition of live sheep was made using 23 Dorset Horn rams. Live animal measurements included tracings from Scanogram photographs taken at the 12 th rib, tuber coxae and shoulder sites and an 18 -hour fasted liveweight. Half carcases were dissected into fat, muscle, bone and connective tissue. Repeatability of photograph interpretation was {{of the order of}} 0. 75 for fat depth at the 12 th rib and tuber coxae sites and M. longissirnus area, but low for shoulder fat depth. Correlations between scan and carcase measurements made at the same site were of the order of 0. 7 for 12 th rib and tuber coxae fat depth and low and non-significant for shoulder fat depth and M. longissirnus area. Scanogram measurements of fat depth at the 12 th rib and tuber coxae sites were the best predictors of percentage fat, and when considered in combination with liveweight provided the best estimate of total carcase fat weight. Liveweight was the best predictor of total muscle weight and the addition of Scanogram measurements to liveweight did not improve the accuracy of prediction. From examination of confidence intervals about predicted means it was concluded that the value of the Scanogram, as an aid to assessing carcase composition, was limited to differentiating between individual animals of widely differing <b>carcase</b> composition, <b>or</b> selecting groups of animals where confidence was required in the group mean...|$|R

Culling by a single stalker during the day and shooting in a field were the most accurate in achieving placement of a shot in a target area, but when compared across all methods, {{there were no significant differences}} in the percentages of deer that were either wounded or appeared to have died immediately after the first shot Plasma cortisol concentrations in deer shot using helicopter assistance were similar to those in deer at the slaughterhouse, but higher than deer shot at night or during the day by a single stalker, or in a field. Deer shot using helicopter assistance and also deer culled by a collaborative and single stalking during the day had lower muscle glycogen concentrations than those culled by a single stalker at night There was no evidence that a particular culling method was associated with an increased risk of accidental or pre-culling injury.

40|$|This paper {{summarise}} six studies {{undertaken by}} the Sheep CRC to elucidate certain aspects of confinement feeding of sheep. A review of confinement feeding highlighted the variability of growth rate and feed conversion of sheep and revealed that {{little is known about}} the use of sorghum for feeding sheep. The review indicated that the main factors responsible for variation of growth rate and feed conversion were adaptation to grain and feeding system, including the preparation and presentation of feed. The importance of social and physiological adaptation to grain feeding was confirmed. Factors identified as responsible for safe induction and uniform growth rates included prior exposure to grain as lambs, gradual introduction of grain and, when concentrate was provided ad libitum from the first day, the use of either virginiamycin, a pelleted feed, a total mixed ration or a step-wise increase of high-starch grain components. Separate feeding of hay and grain resulted in performance comparable with that of a pelleted diet and that of a total mixed ration. Sorghum-based concentrate diets resulted in growth rates and carcase weights similar to that for winter cereal grains or pellets. Steam flaking or expanding of sorghum had no significant effect on growth rates <b>or</b> <b>carcase</b> weights. These results can be used to determine the profitability of various feedlotting options...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a large}} base of {{evidence}} that fermented whole crop forages can be grown and conserved successfully in temperate conditions such as the UK offers. As preservatives are generally eschewed in organic production the crop is generally cut earlier in line with recommendations for fermented whole crop forages. Starch and protein levels will be lower at earlier harvest dates. This results in penalties in yield, greater losses in dry matter during fermentation {{and can lead to}} secondary fermentation when the clamp is opened to feed. Most of the research work reviewed is based on cereal whole-crop, although there is a developing body of knowledge based on intercropping of cereals and legumes as well as crops such as kale. Much of this work is addressed at the needs of the low-input and organic producer where fertiliser inputs and purchased feeds (in particular) proteins to the farm system are minimised. The bulk of this research however, has focused on production and conservation and relatively little on feeding of the forages to livestock. This is especially the case for cereal/legume mixtures which are most interesting to the organic livestock producer. This is surprising as all production of whole crop forages either as sole crops or as mixtures are ultimately as feeds for livestock. The nutritional quality (especially protein) can be somewhat lacking when grown as a sole cereal crop and the inclusion of a legume has been seen to partially overcome this although due to lower dry matter yields can detract from the objective of preventing forage production penalties where these crops are grown as nurse crops for grass re-seeds. Most workers agree that dry matter intakes are stimulated when offered as a feed to ruminants but few workers have found an increase in animal performance (weight gains, <b>carcase</b> quality <b>or</b> milk yields). There are however definitely opportunities to reduce reliance on purchased concentrates by growing and including, in particular legume-based forage mixtures to organic livestock. This attribute has become more important recently in the UK due to limited sources and costs of organic protein sources to purchase. On farm where re-seeding of pastures is practiced, whole crop forages can provide an excellent nurse crop and alternative feed to grass silage and help to overcome the seasonal production penalty usually associated with grass re-seeds...|$|R
