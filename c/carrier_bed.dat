The most common were Pickup trucks. IH made light trucks from 1907 to 1975, beginning with the Model A Auto Wagon (sometimes called the [...] "Auto Buggy"). Production commenced in February 1907 at IH's McCormick Works in Chicago, although production was moved to Akron, Ohio, in October that year. Powered by a horizontally opposed, air-cooled twin around , it was a right-hand-drive model popular in rural areas for high ground clearance on the poor roads typical of the era. It featured a rear seat convertible to a <b>carrier</b> <b>bed.</b> The Auto Wagon was renamed the Motor Truck in 1910, and was a forerunner to the successful modern pickup truck.

30|$|In {{the study}} area, the Farewell Formation {{acts as a}} {{reservoir}} unit and <b>carrier</b> <b>bed,</b> where oil migration carries through and where oil accumulation is concentrated {{at the top of}} sequence. Within the area of study, the Farewell Formation unconformably overlies marginal marine strata of the uppermost Upper Cretaceous Pakawau Group (Bal 1994). The petroleum system source generated from these directly underlying Pakawau Group sediments consists of Rakopi and/or North Cape coals and organic-rich mudstones.

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the major points of {{contention}} concerning secondary petroleum migration, to discuss the nature and primary controls of the positions of petroleum migration pathways in sedimentary basins, and to illustrate the importance of preferential petroleum migration pathways for the formation of large oil/gas fields away from generative kitchens. There is competition between the driving force (buoyancy) and the restraining force (capillary pressure controlled largely by permeability contrast) in controlling the positions of petroleum migration pathways in heterogeneous <b>carrier</b> <b>beds.</b> At a large scale, there is a critical angle of dip of the <b>carrier</b> <b>beds</b> which determines the relative importance of structural morphology or permeability contrasts in controlling the positions of petroleum migration pathways in heterogeneous <b>carrier</b> <b>beds.</b> Maximum-driving-force-controlled migration pathways occur in <b>carrier</b> <b>beds</b> with an angle of dip greater than the critical dip and the positions of petroleum migration pathways are controlled mainly by the morphology of the sealing surfaces. Minimum-restraining-force-determined migration pathways occur in <b>carrier</b> <b>beds</b> with an angle of dip smaller than the critical angle where permeability contrasts would exert a more important influence on the positions of petroleum migration pathways. Preferential petroleum migration pathways (PPMP), defined as very restricted portions of carrier-beds that focus or concentrate petroleum from a large area of the generative kitchen, determine the distribution of oil and gas in sedimentary basins. The focusing of petroleum originating from a large area of the generative kitchens into restricted channels seems to be essential not only for long-range petroleum migration in hydrostatic conditions, but also for the formation of large oil or gas fields. Regions may miss out on petroleum migration because of its three-dimensional behavior, and two-dimensional migration modeling may be misleading in predicting petroleum occurrences in certain circumstances.|$|R

The bio-startup characteristics and the mechanisms of biofilm maturation were investigated. Results showed that the NH 3 -N removal efficiency was higher than 80 % after a 10 d run, and the NH 3 -N concentration of effluent was lower than 5. 0 mg/L, which satisfies the needs of “The Pollutants Discharge Standard for Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants ” (Class -A). In other words, the suspended carrier used here did a good job. The bed finished its bio-startup process with stable nitrification efficiency. The biofilm formed on the carriers ’ wing plates, which was helpful for its adhesion and ageing biofilm to fall off. It was found through electron microscope observation and PCR-DGGE (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) that the biofilm which formed {{on the surface of}} the carrier contained plenty of microbes.

30|$|Reservoir {{physical}} properties of sandstones are mainly controlled by tectonism, sedimentation and diagenesis, among which diagenesis determines the ultimate reservoir {{physical properties}} (Rodrio and Luiz 2002; Ali et al. 2010; Swei and Tucker 2012). Unconformity represents the transformation at different degrees and types experienced by previous strata from post-geologic functions (Gao and Zha 2008). Post-geologic functions mainly refer to diagenesis such as compaction, cementation, dissolution, packing action and cataclasis. These processes are {{very common in}} unconformity and play important roles in determining the physical properties of unconformity and <b>carrier</b> <b>bed,</b> providing effective hydrocarbon migration pathways and reservoir space. In recent years, as the importance of stratigraphic hydrocarbon reservoir exploration is constantly improved, scholars begin {{to pay attention to}} unconformity diagenesis and achieve a series of important understanding in diagenesis types and its effect on reservoir physical properties (Purvis 1995; Wei et al. 1998; Miller et al. 2012). However, qualitative research of the unconformity diagenesis is still insufficient due to the unique formation mechanism and complex diagenetic process. Thus, quantitative research has increasingly become the goal of unconformity in fine evaluation.|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} {{of the size of}} petroleum secondary migration systems is vital for successful exploration for petroleum reserves. Geochemists have suggested that compositional fractionation of petroleum accompanying the migration process (geochromatography) can potentially be used to infer distances petroleum may have travelled and the ratio of oil in the reservoir to that lost in the carrier. To date, this has been attempted by measuring concentrations and distributions of specific steranes, and aromatic oxygen and nitrogen compounds in reservoired oils which have been proposed to respond to migration rather than to source maturity or other effects. We report here an experiment involving oil migration through an initially water wet siltstone under realistic subsurface <b>carrier</b> <b>bed</b> or reservoir conditions (48 MPa, 70 °C) where source facies and maturity effects are eliminated. We show that geochromatography does indeed occur even for initially water-saturated rocks and that the migration fractionations observed for alkylcarbazoles, benzocarbazoles and alkylphenols are very similar to those seen in field data sets. In contrast, sterane based migration parameters show no compositional fractionation under these conditions. </p...|$|E

It has significance for predicting sweet spots to recognize the characteristics and forming of heterogeneity in tight sandstone <b>carrier</b> <b>beds.</b> Heterogeneity responsible for spatial structure, such as the combination and distribution of relatively homogeneous rock layers, is basically established by deposition and eodiagenesis that collectively affect the mesogenesis. We have investigated the structural heterogeneity units by petrofacies in tight sandstone <b>carrier</b> <b>beds</b> of Dibei, eastern Kuqa Depression, according to core, logging, and micropetrology. There are four types of main petrofacies, that is, tight compacted, tight carbonate-cemented, gas-bearing, and water-bearing sandstones. The brine-rock-hydrocarbon diagenesis changes of different heterogeneity structural units have been determined according to the pore bitumen, hydrocarbon inclusions, and quantitative grain fluorescence. Ductile grains or eogenetic calcite cements destroy the reservoir quality of tight compacted or tight carbonate-cemented sandstones. Rigid grains can resist mechanical compaction and oil emplacement before gas charging can inhibit diagenesis to preserve reservoir property of other sandstones. We propose that there is an inheritance relationship between the late gas and early oil migration pathways, which implies that the sweet spots develop in the reservoirs that experienced early oil emplacement...|$|R

A number of unconformity-related stratigraphic reservoirs were found in Xiazijie, Urho, Mabei, Xiaoguai and other regions (Wang et al. 2005), from which {{the oil and gas}} reserves accounts for 10 % of the total reserves, indicating a good exploration prospect of stratigraphic reservoirs. However, major breakthrough still not been made in the clastic stratigraphic reservoir exploration of northwestern margin of Junggar Basin since 2005.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} threat of global warming, technologies for efficient capture and storage {{of the greenhouse}} gas CO 2 are sought after. Chemical-looping combustion is a novel CO 2 capture technology {{that can be applied}} when burning gaseous, liquid or solid fuels. By using two interconnected fluidised beds with a bed material capable of transferring oxygen from air to the fuel, a nitrogen-undiluted stream of CO 2 can be obtained with no direct efficiency loss. This thesis is focused on design, modelling and operation of a 100 kW chemical-looping combustor for solid fuels. The goal of the test rig is validation of chemical-looping combustion at a scale giving both high operational flexibility and semi industrial conditions. Two analytical models that can be applied to any chemical-looping combustor for solid fuels are presented. The first model finds the residence-time from batch-experiments. The second model estimates the gas conversion of a general fuel {{as a function of the}} oxygen <b>carrier</b> <b>bed</b> inventory. Furthermore, a cold-flow model of the 100 kW unit has been constructed. Details about the cold-flow model design and experimental results regarding fluidisation, slugging, residence-time and circulation are presented. The 100 kW unit has been operated for over 23 hours with an ilmenite oxygen carrier, using three different fuels. During this time, no instabilities in the bed inventories have been detected. Experiments aiming for optimal performance showed that gas conversion above 84 % and CO 2 capture over 99 % are possible. A detailed analysis of the relation between the global solids circulation, the fuel reactor bed inventory and the gas conversion was conducted.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{thermochemical}} conversion of solid fuels in dual fluidized bed (DFB) reactors, oxygen <b>carrier</b> <b>bed</b> materials {{have been found to}} enhance the rate of char gasification. Char gasification is typically the rate limiting step in the conversion process, which plays a role on the performance of the overall process and constrains the design of the reactor. The quantity of oxygen carried by the bed material in relation to the fuel feeding rate is likely to influence char conversion. This parameter is commonly characterized in literature by the oxygen-carrier-to-fuel ratio (ϕ), and it can be adjusted by either varying the fuel feed and/or the circulation rate of bed material in the DFB. The residence time of the fuel is typically altered by these changes, which results in an unclear role of the oxygen-carrier-to fuel ratio on the final char conversion. The present work investigates the impact of oxygen transport on char conversion in the 2 - 4 MWth DFB gasifier at Chalmers University of Technology. An iron ore is used as oxygen carrier and steam as fluidizing agent. A parametric study is conducted, in which a wide range of oxygen-carrier-to-fuel ratio (ϕ= 3 - 12) are achieved by varying fuel flow and bed material circulation. Char conversion is calculated on the basis of gas analysis and mass balance calculations. The results confirm that oxygen transport enhances char conversion, in line with previous research in smaller units. Both fuel feed and circulation of bed material {{had an impact on the}} final char conversion under the conditions tested, which differs from previous investigations. For a given residence time of the fuel particles in the reactor, char conversion was found proportional to the oxygen-carrier-to-fuel ratio...|$|E

This study employs basin modeling for four representative wells and two profiles in the Huizhou Sag to reconstruct the process of generation, expulsion, migration, and accumulation of hydrocarbon fluids. The Eocene source rocks started to generate hydrocarbon at 33. 9 [*]Ma and are currently in a mid-mature and postmature stage.

40|$|The {{influence}} of calcined and sulfated limestone addition in an oxygen <b>carrier</b> <b>bed</b> of ilmenite {{has been investigated}} for chemical-looping combustion (CLC) with solid fuel. The experiments have been performed in a laboratory-batch fluidized-bed reactor where the sample was exposed to alternative oxidizing and reducing conditions at atmospheric pressure and 970 degrees C. In each reducing period, 0. 2 g of petroleum coke was introduced to a bed of 20 g of ilmenite and 5 g of limestone particles (180 - 250 mu m). The limestone was calcined and sulfated to different levels (0, 25, or 40 %) and mixed with the ilmenite particles (125 - 180 mu m). During the reducing period, the mixture was fluidized with a flow of 600 mL(n) /min of 50 % steam in nitrogen, and during the oxidation period, the mixture was fluidized with a flow of 600 mL(n) /min of 5 % O(2) in nitrogen. Mixing CaO with ilmenite increased {{the conversion of the}} gas as well as the conversion rate of the char. Apart of the sulfur released from the fuel reacted with the lime to form CaS/CaSO(4). Concerning the mixture of CaSO(4) /ilmenite, a further improvement was seen on the char conversion because of the release of SO(2) from the sulfated limestone particle. However, this beneficial effect disappeared after 10 cycles. Thus, the tests did not show any lasting positive effect from using a mixture of CaSO(4) /ilmenite compared to CaO/ilmenite. The reason for the improved gas conversion with the addition of CaO to ilmenite seems to be the catalytic effect of CaO on the water gas shift reaction, converting CO to H(2), with the latter being much more reactive toward ilmenite...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{are several}} {{approaches}} to estimate possible storage capacities for aquifers and traps in sedimentary basins, ranging from static theoretical capacities estimates to more detailed methods involving dynamic modelling. In this paper, {{we used a}} modified version of the basin modelling software SEMI [1, 2] which applies a ray tracing technique to migrate CO 2 within a <b>carrier</b> <b>bed</b> below a sealing cap-rock. We present a modelling strategy for a systematic modelling of maximum trap storage capacities and a mapping of possible “safe” injection localities for a storage unit. Two end-member models regarding the influence of faults were tested. The basin modelling results are compared and validated with results obtained from an reservoir simulation software. Simulations were carried out for the Trøndelag Platform, offshore Norway covering an area of ca. 15, 000 km 2. The slightly north-westwards dipping Middle Jurassic Garn Formation (Fm.) is considered as a good candidate for CO 2 storage. It is widely deposited at the Trøndelag Platform, with a thickness around 120 m and shallow buried (< 2 km). It is overlain by a thick shale- mudstone sequence (the Middle Jurassic Viking Group), and thick Cretaceous shales favouring a low risk for caprock leakage. Two simulation approaches were tested. First, injection in the Garn Fm. over the whole study area were simulated, to get the maximum total trap storage capacity. The modelling showed a storage capacity of 2. 0 Gt with no faults and 5. 2 Gt using interpreted faults at top Garn Fm. level as input to the simulations. Secondly, simulations were carried out with 38 CO 2 injection sites. From these, the injection sites which caused migration out of the study area (e. g. upward to the rim of the storage unit, with only Quaternary coverage), where removed. Finally, 7 sites with very low probability for migration out of the area were selected. These “safe” injection sites were mainly mapped in the centre of the Trøndelag Platform where only a few faults are mapped...|$|E
40|$|This thesis’s {{main focus}} is a CO 2 capture {{technology}} known as chemical looping combustion (CLC). The {{technology is a}} novel form of combustion and fuel processing {{that can be applied}} to gas, solid and liquid fuels. By using two interconnected fluidised-bed reactors, with a bed material capable of transferring oxygen from air to the fuel, a stream of almost pure CO 2 can be produced. This stream is undiluted with nitrogen and is produced without any direct process efficiency loss from the overall combustion process. The heart of the process is the oxygen <b>carrier</b> <b>bed</b> material, which transfers oxygen from an air to fuel reactor for the conversion of the fuel. Oxygen carrier materials and their production should be of low relative cost for use in large-scale systems. The first part of this research centres on development and investigative studies conducted to assess the use of low-cost materials as oxygen carriers and as supports. Mixed-oxide oxygen carriers of modified manganese ore and iron ore were produced by impregnation. While copper (II) oxide supported on alumina cement and CaO have been produced by pelletisation. These oxygen carriers were investigated for their ability to convert gaseous fuels in a lab-scale fluidised bed, and characterised for their mechanical and chemical suitability in the CLC process. The modified ores and pelletised copper-based oxygen carriers’ mechanical properties were enhanced by their production methods {{and in the case of}} the modified iron ore, significant oxygen uncoupling was observed. The copper-based oxygen carriers particularly those containing alumina cement showed high conversion rates of gaseous fuels and improved mechanical stability. The second part of this research thesis focuses on the design philosophy, commissioning and operation of a dual-fast bed chemical looping pilot reactor. Based on the operational experience, recommendations for modifications to the CLC system are discussed. In support, a parallel hydrodynamic investigation has been conducted to validate control and operational strategies for the newlydesigned reactor system. It was determined that the two fast bed risers share similar density and pressure profiles. Stable global circulation rate is flexible and could be maintained despite being pneumatically controlled. Reactor-reactor leakage via the loop-seals is sensitive to loop seal bed-height, and inlet fluid velocity but can be maintained as such to ensure no leakage is encountered...|$|E

It is generally accepted that an application as secondary migration tracer requires knowledge of the composition of alkylated and benzo-substituted carbazoles in the source rock to determine the important fractionation effects of primary migration (Bennet et al., 200). Knowledge of biological precursor compounds of carbazoles is still scarce (Li et al., 1995) and alternative routes of geosynthesis of carbazoles have not been investigated in detail. Geosynthesis of alkylated carbazoles seems to be possible via nitrogen incorporation into alkylated biphenyls. The latter may originate from cyclization of various functionalized biolipid precursors, e. g. polyunsaturated fatty acids (Lang and van Aarssen, 2005). Geosynthesis or neoformation of organic compounds in sediments has been inferred for other hydrocarbons (e. g. alkylated phenanthrenes and naphthalenes) and for polar components.

Interestingly, no problems with excessive growth of filamentous bacteria have been reported for the {{activated sludge}} process when combined with biofilm growth more than a decade ago. In this context, the present work aims to compare the microbial community composition of two sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) operating in the presence and in the absence of biofilm growth, and to correlate microbial composition with the performance of the reactors. Two SBRs with a working volume of 1. 5 L were operated in parallel with a constant cycle time of 4 h, a volume exchange ratio of 0. 5 L/L and a resulting hydraulic retention time of 8 h. The duration of the individual operating phases was: 5 min fill, 225 min aerated, 5 min settle and 5 min draw. During the aerated phase airflow was applied through membrane diffusers, causing the reactor contents including the <b>carrier</b> <b>bed</b> to circulate. The SBRs were operated with synthetic water containing acetate as the only carbon source and ammonium as nitrogen source. One SBR was operated just with suspended biomass while the second one combined suspended biomass with biofilm cultivation. The biofilm was formed on a new type of polyethylene support developed by University of Minho, consisting of hollow, star-shaped, carriers with 17 mm external diameter and a height of 10 mm. The bed formed by these carriers had a specific surface area of 407 m 2 /m 3, an average porosity of 0. 74 and occupied 20 % of the reactor volume. Grab samples were taken and analyzed for acetate using a HPLC system. Observation of the filamentous microbial and microfauna communities was accomplished by microscope inspection at 100 to 1000 X magnification, in fresh samples and after Gram and Neisser staining. The microbial community of the SBR operating just with suspended growth was dominated by fungi micelar growth, while in the other reactor the communities were clearly more complex. The incorporation of carriers for biofilm growth in the other SBR apparently suppressed the excessive growth of fungi. Differences in the microfaunas community were also observed, the SBR operating just with suspended growth showing clearly a delay in the microfauna succession comparing to the other reactor.

The objects of interest are numerous buried and non-buried carbonate mounds, consisting mainly of corals, carbonate crusts and fine grained clastic sediments in the Porcupine Basin, which is located on the eastern Atlantic continental slope 200 km offshore Ireland and contains the sub-commercial Connemara oil field. To evaluate the possible link between hydrocarbon leakage and mound growth we used 2 D and 3 D basin modelling in combination with geochemical analysis of sediments from gravity cores. A total of 5 intersecting seismic lines were used as a basis for 2 D modelling of basin evolution, hydrocarbon generation and migration. Data from six exploration wells were used for calibration of the basin burial and thermal history using vitrinite reflectance, bottom hole temperatures and apatite fission track data. 3 D basin modelling was performed using data provided by UCD {{in the northern part of}} the Porcupine Basin. The results of this study indicate that a link between modelled hydrocarbon leakage and carbonate mound growth is possible both in the Belgica mound province on the eastern flank of the basin where stratigraphic pinch outs of <b>carrier</b> <b>beds</b> can lead to the localised leakage of hydrocarbons to the seafloor, as well as in the Hovland Magellan mound area in the northern half of the Porcupine Basin, where small-scale structural closures mapped on the main Miocene surfaces correlate roughly to observed mound locations.

However, further research on reservoir-forming conditions under the gypsolyte {{on the west side of}} the salt subsag indicates that the O 1 m 57 – O 1 m 510 strata near the east side of the palaeo-uplift contact directly with the Upper Paleozoic coal measure source rocks, forming a “hydrocarbon supply window”; the Yanshan Movement caused the tectonic inversion of the basin main body, resulting in the tectonic framework “high in the east and low in the west”, which is conductive to the further migration of natural gas generated by the Upper Paleozoic coal measures to the updip high position of the east side along the O 1 m 57 – O 1 m 510 <b>carrier</b> <b>beds</b> after entering the dolomite reservoir under the gypsolyte through the “hydrocarbon–supply window”. In addition, the facies changes in the dolomite rocks under the gypsum-salt provide favorable barrier condition for the regional gathering of natural gas. Therefore, it is concluded through comprehensive analysis that reservoirs may form beneath the Ordovician gypsolith in the central region of the basin on the west side of the salt subsag with hydrocarbon supplied from the Upper Paleozoic source rocks of coal measures, which is expected to open up a new situation of natural gas exploration under the Ordovician gypsum-salt layer in the Ordos Basin...|$|R

40|$|The small Neogene Krong Pa graben is {{situated}} within the continental Song Ba Rift, which is bounded by strike-slip faults that were reactivated as extensional faults in Middle Miocene time. The 500 m thick graben-fill shows an overall depositional development reflecting the structural evolution, {{which is very}} similar to much larger and longer-lived graben. The basal graben-fill consists of thin fluvial sandstones interbedded with well-oxygenated lacustrine siltstones in the basin centre, while very coarse-grained fluvial sandstones and conglomerates dominate at the basin margins. With increased subsidence rate and possibly a higher influx of water from the axial river systems the general water level in the graben rose and deep lakes formed. High organic preservation in the lakes prompted the formation of two excellent oil-prone lacustrine source-rock units. In the late phase of the graben development sedimentation rate outpaced the formation of accommodation space and fluvial activity increased again. During periods when the general sedimentation rate was in balance with the creation of accommodation space the environment changed frequently between lake deposition and intermittent vigorous fluvial activity. It is likely that the resulting interbedding of fluvial sandstones and lacustrine sediments reflects variations in precipitation. In periods of little precipitation the lakes diminished and lake bottoms became exposed. After heavy precipitation, transverse river systems transported sands from the rift shoulders across the exposed lake bottom and fluvial sands were deposited on lake bottom sediments. Subsequently, lake level rose due to increased water supply from the axial river and the sands were drowned and topped by transgressive lacustrine mudstones. These sandstones may function as <b>carrier</b> <b>beds,</b> whereas the braided fluvial sandstones and conglomerates along the graben margins may form reservoirs. The Krong Pa graben thus contains oil-prone lacustrine source rocks, effective conduits for generated hydrocarbons and reservoir sandstones side-sealed by the graben faults toward the footwall granites. In addition to the structural and climatic signals recorded by the graben-fill, sediment partitioning among the partly isolated basins along the rift axis seems to have been important...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{has focused}} {{its efforts to}} {{investigate}} the link between glacial erosion and focused fluid flow in the SW Barents Sea, on the shallow bank area of Tromsøflaket where the Ringvassøy-Loppa Fault Complex borders the Tromsø basin in west, and the Loppa High in east. Here, large, elongated depressions are identified on the buried Upper Regional Unconformity (URU) and may resemble tunnel valleys or are related to fluid flow and gas hydrate formation beneath the Barents Sea ice sheet. The thesis {{is based on a}} 3 D seismic dataset, the Caliente 3 D, two sets of 2 D seismic lines (the SH- 8601 and SH- 9103) and well data from two wells (well 7120 / 1 - 1 and 7120 / 1 - 2). Mapping of faults, stratigraphy and amplitude anomalies revealed that vertical fluid migration are dominated by the faulted nature of the study area, which promote leakage of deep thermogenic gas into shallow Tertiary units. Above the base Tertiary reflector a change from vertical to lateral migration is observed. Together with the faults, the shallowing seismic stratigraphy focusses fluid migration towards the Loppa High in East and where the permeable <b>carrier</b> <b>beds</b> are truncated by the URU. Four elongated deep depression, with well-developed bases and sides are identified on the URU, these exhibit clear orientations reminiscent of paleo ice stream directions on the Barents Sea shelf. Several theories for their generation is argued, relating them to tunnel valleys and hill-hole pairs. The spatial relation of the depressions with the fluid flow system within the study area suggests that focussed fluid flow and glacial erosion are likely to have played a major part in their origin. Eventually a four-stage conceptual model is inferred for their formation, where localized formation of gas hydrates create sticky spots underneath the Barents Sea Ice Sheet, and a weak decollement failure plane {{at the base of the}} fluctuating GHSZ leads to glacial erosion of the depressions and re-deposition of the gas hydrate bearing sediment...|$|R
40|$|The Late Middle Ordovician Trenton Limestone is {{a highly}} {{productive}} carbonate hydrocarbon reservoir across the eastern United States. Enhanced secondary porosity and permeability within the Trenton Limestone generated by hydrothermal dolomitization (HTD) in Michigan and New York have allowed for extensive hydrocarbon reservoirs to be developed. In these areas, carbonate facies assemblages {{have been shown to}} significantly control the distribution of diagenetic alterations and influence the geometry and lateral continuity of reservoir-grade porosity and permeability. South-central Kentucky provides an exploratory region for post-depositional hydrothermal alteration due to its vicinity to the Appalachian-forming orogenic tectonism. Cool water carbonate deposition of the Trenton in Kentucky provides for a new setting composed of facies assemblages that are significantly different when compared to warm water carbonate hosts of the Trenton in New York, Ohio, and Michigan. Results from outcrop and core analyses indicate that HTD is not facies-selective as the abundance of phosphate and marine hardgrounds in Kentucky’s cool water carbonates are porosity-destructive. Rather than primary facies, controls of dolomitization through central Kentucky consist of a combination of fault and fracture networks, fluid injection pressures, homogenization temperatures, and basement fluid sources and sub-Trenton <b>carrier</b> <b>beds.</b> Dolomitization through the Trenton is characterized by vugular, interparticle, intraparticle, and fracture porosity, which are frequently restricted to near-fault and fracture margins. Investigation of fluid inclusion microthermometric and stable isotope analyses indicate that fluids are sourced from deep Precambrian or Cambrian formations. Fluids generally range from 127 °C to 107 °C indicating that they are in fact hydrothermal (maximum burial temperatures of 80 °C through the Cincinnati arch region; Huff and Turkmenoglu, 1981) and have variable fluid compositions ranging from saline brines to NaCl-H 2 O-CaCl 2. Results {{of this study indicate that}} Kentucky provides for a setting that is highly susceptible to hydrothermal dolomitization and subsequent reservoir development, however cool water carbonates through the Trenton Limestone are not conducive to allow for reservoir-grade porosity and permeability development. The lack of depositional phosphate within warm water carbonates of the underlying Black River Group Carbonates does, however provide for a valid target to explore for HTD reservoir development in central Kentucky. ...|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} up-scaling to {{commercial}} scale of chemical looping combustion (CLC); a next-generation technology for carbon capture and storage. Focus {{lies on the}} bottom bed, which {{is considered to be}} the critical region in up-scaling due to its large solids inventory combined with relatively inefficient gas-solids contact. Two CLC reactors of vastly different size (bench and utility scale) are studied in order to discern the difference in effects related to up-scaling. A 1 -dimensional model is used in order to simulate the units studied. The model considers kinetics dependent on the degree of oxidation of the oxygen carrier and a population distribution of the oxygen carriers, whose mixing accounts for both convective and dispersive transport. The model is validated against bench scale data and applied to evaluate the performance of a 1000 MWth CLC fuel reactor using either syngas or methane as fuel. Using the model, sensitivity analyses are carried out to depict the effect on the fuel conversion of several parameters such as solids circulation, oxygen <b>carrier</b> reactivity, <b>bed</b> height and maximum bubble size allowed. It is shown that mass transfer of gas from bubbles to the emulsion phase represents a strongly limiting factor for fuel conversion in the bottom bed of utility scale fuel reactors...|$|R

5000|$|MeltDose {{works by}} {{incorporating}} a drug substance with low water solubility into a [...] "meltable" [...] vehicle. It is then sprayed on an inert particulate <b>carrier</b> using fluid <b>bed</b> equipment. The melt is solidified when deposed on a particle carrier, and thus captures the active drug in a solid dispersion {{either as a}} solid solution or in a nano-crystalline state. The particle size is then increased by controlling and optimizing the product temperature and feed rate of the melt. The granulate can be directly compressed into tablets without additional processing steps besides blending with a lubricant. In addition, the technology allows for customization of the release profile. Once in tablet form, the dissolution profile and the particle size of drugs manufactured using MeltDose® technology remain stable allowing for a long shelf-life.|$|R
