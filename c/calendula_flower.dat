40|$|Background Currently {{a chronic}} {{inflammation}} {{is considered to}} be the {{one of the most important}} reasons of the atherosclerosis progression. A huge amount of researches over the past few decades are devoted to study the various mechanisms of inflammation in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Purpose To review current capabilities of anti-inflammatory therapy for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations. Methods Appropriate articles on inflammatory cytokines in atherosclerosis and anti-inflammatory prevention of atherosclerosis were searched in PubMed Database from their respective inceptions until October 2015. Sections “The role of inflammatory cytokines in the development of atherosclerotic lesions” describes available data on the possible inflammatory mechanisms of the atherogenesis with a special attention to the role of cytokines. “Modern experience of anti-inflammatory therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis” describes modern anti-inflammatory preparations with anti-atherosclerotic effect including natural preparations. In “the development of anti-inflammatory herbal preparation for atherosclerosis prevention” an algorithm is demonstrated that includes screening of anti-cytokine activity of different natural products, the development of the most effective combination and estimation of its effect in cell culture model, in animal model of the acute aseptic inflammation and in a pilot clinical trial. A natural preparation “Inflaminat” based on black elder berries (Sambucus nigra L.), violet tricolor herb (Viola tricolor L.) and <b>calendula</b> <b>flowers</b> (<b>Calendula</b> officinalis L.) possessing anti-cytokine activity was developed using the designed algorithm. The results of the following 2 -year double blind placebo-controlled clinical study show that “Inflaminat” reduces carotid IMT progression, i. e. has anti-atherosclerotic effect. Conclusion Anti-cytokine therapy may be a promising direction in moderation of atherogenesis, especially when it begins on the early stages of subclinical atherosclerosis. The use of herbal preparations with anti-cytokine mechanism of action is the most perspective for timely prevention of atherosclerosis, as they have no significant side effects and can be prescribed for long-term administration...|$|R

As is widely known that phytopharmaceuticals usually combine the variety of therapeutic activity and softness of pharmacological effects along with the absence of a significant number of side effects and contraindications which is extremely important in the treatment of chronic pathologies. The main purpose was to study diuretic activity of phytopreparations of pot marigold. Materials and methods. Investigations of discovering of diuretic action of pot marigold’s phytopreparations were carried out on white rats of both sexes weighing 200 – 220 g (8 sets of experiments). Each experimental group consisted of ten animals. The effect of pot marigold medicines at a dose of 50 mg/kg was carried out background the administered intragastrically at 3 % aqueous load of 4 and 24 hours of the experiment. There are such drugs as a subjects to examination: calendula tincture (1 : 10) (industrial production), calendula tincture (1 : 5) and calendula liquid extract (1 : 2) of 70 % alcohol, obtained at the Department of Pharmacognosy with Botany and Bases of Phytotherapy, at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Animals were housed in the vivarium on a standard diet with free access to water. The day before the experiment the rats received intragastric water load in the amount of 3 % of body weight. On the day of the experiment the animals of the control group was administered water-alcohol load and experienced – intragastrically drug dose of 50 mg/kg in an identical volume of water. As a control was used 70 % alcohol. Animals were placed in metabolic cages on day. Collected urine of rats were examined. Determined excretion of water. The concentration of sodium and potassium was detected by flame photometry (mark PAG- 1) for 4 and 24 hours of the experiment. The concentration of creatinine was detected by colorimetric method (mark CPHC- 3) for 4 and 24 hours of the experiment. The results of experiments were performed statistical on the Mann-Whitney test. Experiments were carried out with all the necessary ethical requirements. Main results. It was found that among the studied drugs on 4 hours of the experiment the liquid extract indicate diuretic properties. Tincture (1 : 5) showed expressed diuretic activity, saluretic and keratin properties. Tincture (1 : 10) had tendency to increase diuresis. Such effects decreased within the day. Conclusion.

40|$|Background and purpose: <b>Calendula</b> officinalis <b>flowers</b> {{have long}} been {{employed}} time in folk therapy, and more than 35 properties {{have been attributed to}} decoctions and tinctures from the flowers. The main uses are as remedies for burns (including sunburns), bruises and cutaneous and internal inflammatory diseases of several origins. The recommended doses are a function both of the type and severity of the condition to be treated and the individual condition of each patient. Therefore, the present study investigated the potential use of Calendula officinalis extract to prevent UV irradiation-induced oxidative stress in skin. Methods: Firstly, the physico-chemical composition of marigold extract(ME) (hydroalcoholic extract) was assessed and the in vitro antioxidant efficacy was determined using different methodologies. Secondly, the cytotoxicity was evaluated in L 929 and HepG 2 cells with the MTT assay. Finally, the in vivo protective effect of ME against UVB-induced oxidative stress in the skin of hairless mice was evaluated by determining reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and monitoring the secretion/activity of metalloproteinases. Results and conclusions: The polyphenol, flavonoid, rutin and narcissin contents found in ME were 28. 6 mg/g, 18. 8 mg/g, 1. 6 mg/g and 12. 2 mg/g, respectively and evaluation of the in vitro antioxidant activity demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of ME against different radicals. Cytoxicity experiments demonstrated that ME was not cytotoxic for L 929 and HepG 2 cells at concentrations {{less than or equal to}} of 15 mg/mL However, concentrations greater than or equal to 30 mg/mL, toxic effects were observed. Finally, oral treatment of hairless mice with 150 and 300 mg/kg of ME maintained GSH levels close to non-irradiated control mice. In addition, this extract affects the activity/secretion of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP- 2 and - 9) stimulated by exposure to UVB irradiation. However, additional studies are required to have a complete understanding of the protective effects of ME for skin. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Introduction: Marigold <b>flower,</b> <b>Calendula</b> officinalis L, Asteraceae, is {{traditionally}} {{used to treat}} skin diseases. Marigold flowers contain triterpenoid saponins, carotenoids, flavonoids and essential oil. Extracts and essential oil exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. Aim: The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate quality of cultivated Calendulae flos, to compare flavonoids content in inflorescence and ligulate florets and to determine antimicrobial activity of extract and traditional ointment based on marigold. Material and Methods: Plant material was collected from private gardens in Kikinda, Mokrin and Vrnjacka Banja during September and November 2015. Quality investigation included: macroscopic and microscopic analysis and determination of the specific quality according to the monograph of European Pharmacopoeia 7. 0. The identification of flavonoids was carried out by HPLC. Antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts (1 : 20) and traditional ointment based on ligulate florets or whole inflorescences was tested against six standard laboratory strains by agar-diffusion method. Results: Macroscopic and microscopic characteristics and content of flavonoids (2. 0 - 2. 76 %) in the ligulate florets of cultivated marigold corresponded to the requirements of Ph. Eur. 7. 0. Separated ligulate florets (2. 76 ± 0. 01 %) contained a higher concentration of flavonoids than whole inflorescence (1. 68 ± 0. 0 %). Also, in ligulate florets differences were found in the flavonoids content during September (2. 76 ± 0. 01 %) and November (1. 45 ± 0. 01 %), while in whole inflorescences concentration didn't significantly change. In all tested samples 3 -O-heterosides of quercetin and isorhamnetin were identified. The ethanol extracts of ligulate florets, whole inflorescence as well as traditional ointments showed the antimicrobial activity. The traditional ointment based on ligulate florets showed stronger antimicrobial effect than the ointment based on full inflorescences. Conclusion: Quality investigation showed that cultivated marigold flowers meet the requirements of Ph. Eur. 7. 0. Ligulate florets contained more flavonoids than whole inflorescences. Extracts and traditional ointment based on ligulate florets showed antimicrobial activity, which confirmed long-term use of marigold...|$|R
