Methods: The study involved 20 patients divided in two groups: the first group with a <b>catamnesis</b> duration of up to five years; the second group with a <b>catamnesis</b> duration of more than five years. We studied anthropometric parameters and carbohydrate metabolism as well as psychological questioning of patients using SF- 36 questionnaire, the data was considered statistically significant at p< 0. 05.   Results.   severe combined postoperative complications were more frequent in the first group (63. 6 % vs. 22. 2 %, p= 0. 07), due to extend of the performed surgery. Adrenergic symptoms prior to the surgery were detected in 90. 9 % of cases in the first group and in 77. 7 % of cases in the second group. After treatment these numbers decreased to 36. 4 % and 11. 1 % respectively (p= 0. 039 and 0. 026).

Functional imaging demonstrated activation in posterior language areas during reading of familiar words while the attempt to read unfamiliar words activated peri- and contralesional structures of the anterior language areas. It was assumed that despite sufficient neural plasticity, the acquisition of a sublexical reading strategy was prevented by severe working memory deficits. Therefore, a specific treatment intervention was developed, choosing a compensatory strategy for reading remediation. Reading development was monitored over three months before and three months after an intensive training was conducted.

Materials and methods: 30 patients were included in the study divided into two groups. In the 1 st group the patients received standard treatment for herpes and two daily applications of cikloferon liniment for seven days. In the 2 nd group the patients received only standard treatment for herpes. The patients were followed-up for six months. The study was open-label randomized. Results: The results obtained show that general infectious symptoms of herpes subsided considerably faster in the 1 st group of patients treated with cikloferon liniment.

Conclusion: Cikloferon liniment used for {{the treatment}} of patients with herpes exacerbation associated with psoriasis contributes to more dynamic disappearance of infectious syndrome, enhances epithelization of herpetic erosions, and lowers the duration of erosions and local inflammation as well as the number of exacerbations in <b>catamnesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: In 2007, for {{the first}} time, {{psychiatric}} disorders were {{the most common cause}} (29 %) of new cases of disability pension in Austria. Against the backdrop of an expected increase in mental health disorders, inpatient medical- psychiatric rehabilitation is supposed to contribute to a comprehensive mental health care. The aim of this review is a systematic analysis of the sustainability of inpatient psychiatric/psychosomatic rehabilitation covering an observation period of at least 12 months after discharge from rehabilitation. Methods: In August 2013, we conducted a systematic literature search in six databases. In addition, we searched manually for relevant articles. After deduplication we screened a total of 1. 872 references. We ordered 176 full-text articles to verify the fulfillment of the inclusion criteria. Results: We included 1 meta-analysis, 4 RCTs, 2 pre-post studies with, and 14 without a control group. We extracted a total of 180 individual results on changes between admission (T 0), discharge (T 1) and <b>catamnesis</b> (K) 12 months (min.) after discharge from rehabilitation, which had been measured by 38 (in controlled studies) or 49 (in studies without control group) instruments and/or relevant subscales respectively. Overall, results showed similar trends across studies and outcome measures: the improvement between admission and discharge deteriorated to varying degrees during the catamnestic period, although they were still better than at the time of admission. Consequently, effect sizes were larger from admission to discharge than from admission to <b>catamnesis.</b> The reported effect sizes showed substantial differences, even if the same instruments had been applied. Therefore, no general conclusions can be drawn regarding specific domains in which psychiatric/psychosomatic rehabilitation leads to better results than in others. In the most recent studies on specific aftercare, a trend towards an improved stabilisation of treatment effects can be observed. Except for one RCT, the risk of bias of included studies is high due to high drop-out rates. Limited patients' willingness to participate in specific programmes (e. g. integrated vocational rehabilitation or aftercare measures) should be considered as a critical factor for the applicability of the results. Conclusion: The disorder/recovery profiles of patients with psychiatric/psychosomatic rehabilitation are well described on the basis of numerous observational studies. Due to the lack of comparative studies, no conclusions can be drawn on the effectiveness and sustainability of psychiatric/psychosomatic rehabilitation compared to no rehabilitation. In recent years, however, a trend towards (randomised) controlled trials, which at least allow statements about the comparative effectiveness of different interventions, can be observed. Especially specific aftercare programmes (e. g. web-based interventions) and integrated vocational rehabilitation seem to be an important research focus. Instead of querying the overall effectiveness and sustainability of psychiatric/psychosomatic rehabilitation, future research should target critical success factors and differential effects of rehabilitation...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Inguinal hernia — {{the most}} common disease in the {{practice}} of pediatric surgeon and ranged from 70 to 85  % of all hernias in children. The aim of our work is to improve the results of diagnosis and treatment for inguinoscrotal hernias in children. Materials and methods. We have analyzed 186 children with inguinoscrotal hernias in the period from 2010 to 2015. Unilateral inguinal hernia — 68. 4  % of cases, bilateral one — 31. 6  % of cases. In 76 children, inguinal hernia was combined with umbilical hernia, with hydrocele testis — in 20 children. Results and discussion. Analyzing the results, we have found that in 84. 9  % of children hernia diagnosis was based on the complaints of parents and physical examination of children. Surgical treatment of 78 (42  %) children was performed using open access. 108 (58  %) patients underwent laparoscopic correction.

Despite the fact that currently there is insufficient information about the results of remote application keratorefractive laser surgery in children, and there are no indication system and contraindications, modern achievements in medicine should be used in pediatric patients, and our successful track record proves it clearly.  Undoubtedly, the positive experience of the laser surgery use in a child with clouding of the cornea in the outcome of herpetic keratitis, which provided a positive result: high visual acuity, binocular vision and lack of infection relapses for  2 years, requires study, evidence multicenter studies, and possibly expansion of indications for refractive laser surgery. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{studied the}} impact of the mixture of bacteria lysates (IRS 19) on the recurrence of the acute respiratory infections among the weakened and sickly children from TB high risk group, who underwent rehabilitation at the anti TB health center. The researcher studied the tolerance to the physical loads (Shalkov test), secretory Iga concentration in the saliva, recurrence of the acute respiratory infections under supervision in <b>catamnesis</b> within a year. To prevent and treat bacterial nasal and respiratory infections, the authors used the mixture of bacteria lysates (Solvay pharma) along the specific chemical tuberculosis prevention. Performed complex rehabilitation increased the resistance of the children's body infected with TB mycobacteria and conduced to the increase of the normergic reactions to tuber culine. They revealed that the recurrence of the acute respiratory infections among the children, who received the mixture of bacteria lysates, made up 0, 9 ± 0, 2 among the children infected and 1, 1 ± 0, 2 non=infected with tb mycobacteria within the first 6 months of observation. In the test group, these indices came to 2, 2 ± 0, 3 and 2, 3 ± 0, 2, respectively. After they carried on the immunocorrection course, the saliva witnessed the increase of the secretory Iga concentration (among the children both infected and non infected with TB mycobacteria). performed research proves that it is clinically efficient, safe and expedient to introduce the seasonal course of the local immuno corrector — the mixture of bacteria lysates to the set of the rehabilitation actions among the children from TB high risk groups, which allows them to recommend wider application of this medication in children. Key words: mixture of bacteria lysates, tuberculosis, prevention, children. </strong...|$|E
40|$|The {{publication}} {{presents a}} clinical case of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia {{in a woman}} of 75 years. In {{the first part of}} the article, literature data on the incidence and features of Rundu-Osler-Weber disease are presented, modern diagnostic principles based on the Curaçao criteria (1999) are reviewed, which allow to define the diagnosis as “reliable”, with three criteria, “probable” — with Two criteria (most often the family nature of the disease and spontaneous nasal bleeding) and “doubtful”, with one criterion of the above. Methods of treating hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are considered, the authors draw attention to the fact that the choice of the method of therapy depends on the degree of damage to the target organ. Symptomatic methods of treatment suggest slight relief for patients, but hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia remains a progressive, severe and potentially life-threatening pathology. The second part of the article presents a clinical observation with late verification of the patient’s P., 75 years of age. The data of medical history, including anamnesis, <b>catamnesis,</b> photographs of macro- and micro-preparations are given. The presented observation illustrates the severe course of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, manifested by severe hemorrhagic syndrome, due to vascular malformations, the gradual involvement of internal organs in the pathological process with the formation of arteriovenous shunts, aneurysms. The manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in the described clinical case was manifested as abundant nasal, uterine bleeding, skin telangiectasias, followed by involvement in the pathological process of the lungs, organs of the gastrointestinal tract. The authors were able to observe a variant of the course and manifestation of visceral vascular anomalies. This clinical case illustrates the need to take into account the totality of all the symptoms of the disease in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia for early detection of the disease, dynamic observation of the patient and the timely administration of therapy</p...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{research}} the psychometrical parameters and the clinical-dynamic features of patients with schizophrenia in depending on their constitutionally-morphological type. Material and methods. The examination of 86 patients with schizophrenia who are hospitalized at Department of endogenous mental disorders of Mental Health Research Institute was conducted. The study included patients of age from 18 to 65 years old with prescription of <b>catamnesis</b> at least 1 year and whose state at the time of examination corresponded to the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia from the ICD- 10 (International Classification of Diseases 10 th Revision). The examination included filling in a modified version of Basic Card of Standardized Description of the Patient with Schizophrenia and his Relative, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). In addition to that patients were examined using anthropometrical method by V. V. Bunak. Statistical significance of differences in the data was evaluated using the Kruskal – Wallis test by ranks, the Mann – Whitney U-test, and Pearson’s chi-squared test. The correlation analysis was performed by the Spearman’s rank correlation test. The K-Means Cluster Analysis was used to determine of the qualitative interrelation and conjugation between the clinical characteristics of the examined. The results of the study revealed that many parameters of the functioning in these patient groups have statistically significant differences. Use of the K-Means Cluster Analysis was allowed to reveal the internal structure of the data, to group the individual observations according to their degree of similarity. Conclusion s. The obtained data leads to the assumption that the constitutionally-morphological type of patients has an impact on the clinical course of schizophrenia, as well as their adaptation abilities. Asthenic constitutionally-morphological type is a factor of adverse clinical dynamic of schizophrenia and associates with persistent negative disorders and suicidal actions. Overall, this study continues integrative anthropological trend in psychiatry and lays the foundation for further study of the constitutional factors effect on the course of schizophrenia. The obtained results can serve as a model for studying the facade symptoms in general schizophrenia spectrum disorders and be used in the development of individually oriented therapeutic and rehabilitation programs in clinical psychiatry.  </p...|$|E
40|$|In Ruhe krank sein dürfen“. Ausgangspunkt der hier vorliegenden Untersuchung war die Frage nach der Bewältigung von Krankheit und Kranksein durch obdachlose, von illegalen Drogen abhängigen Frauen und Männern in einer KrWo. Die Untersuchung verfolgte auf der Basis einer offenen, explorativen Fragestellung zu ergründen, was, wie und wann hilfreich und nützlich für die Kranken ist. Das Ziel, unter Anwendung der qualitativen, hypothesengenerierenden GTM und qualitativen Feldforschung einen Beitrag zur Theoriebildung zu leisten und Empfehlungen für die Praxis im Umgang mit den Kranken abzuleiten, wurde verfolgt. Anhand von Untersuchungsdaten aus der KrWo konnte eine erste erklärende Beschreibung der Nutzer erarbeitet werden. Die entwickelten theoretischen Konzepte bzw. Hypothesen sind auf den Kontext der untersuchten KrWo begrenzt, die Untersuchung verfolgt keinen Anspruch auf Repräsentativität. Es wurde gegenstandsgegründet so-wohl ein heuristisches Instrument zur Einschätzung von Desaffiliationen in der Lebenslage des Sujets erarbeitet, zudem zwei durch die Kranken und im Vergleich mit der Literatur validierte Straßendrogenkreisläufe erklärend beschrieben. Als zentrales Phänomen evolvierte in der Krankenwohnung das Ergebnis als Endpunkt dieser Arbeit „In Ruhe krank sein dürfen“. Entsprechend der Herangehensweise der GTM wurden einige Ursachen, Bedingungen, Strategien und Konsequenzen sowie prozessbezogenen Aspekte herausgearbeitet und in hypothetischen Modellteilen dargestellt. Aus den Handlungserfahrungen konnten Empfehlungen für die Praxis im Umgang mit kranken, obdachlosen Abhängigen illegaler Drogen abgeleitet werden. “Allowed {{being sick}} in peace”. Needs and {{requirements}} of sick, homeless, drug-addicted {{women and men}} of illegal drugs in a half-way infirmary at Cologne, Germany. Projections of a substantive grounded theory. The background {{of this study is}} a newly established infirmary for sick, homeless, drug-dependent (misery addiction) women and men starting October 2008. The study with data collection lasted all in all 38 months from October 2008 up to December 2011. Subjects of interest (group of inquest) were the users of the infirmary (n = 190) and their surrounding network in the help system (conditional matrix) of Cologne City. Two principles of work of staff were accompanying drug work and the virtue of undesigned encounter (Guardini). The central research question was: How do sick, homeless, drug-dependent (of illegal drugs) women and men cope with sickness and ailment in an infirmary? As a methodological framework, grounded theory methodology in the style of Strauss/Corbin was applied and combined with the field research (study) according to Girtler. Data collection methods consisted of open participative observation (Girtler), ero-epic interviews (Girtler) with the intoxicated users of the infirmary, open participating ob-servation in the infirmary, team and network. Further data collection con-sisted of the demographic and health data as well as the diseases of all the users of the infirmary, a journal of occurrences in the infirmary, which have brought change in rules and regulations on the base of the formal log book of everyday occurrences, special events and general observations. This all has been documented in a research diary. The local help network in Cologne was visited. Additional visits and comparison of 7 similar establishments in Germany were accomplished. Follow-up history profiles, <b>catamnesis</b> of the 18 auditory interviewed persons were done and a glossary of terms of the local drug scene collected. The theoretical sampling for the auditory interview of the users of the infirmary has been done accordingly to the methodology. 17 : 15 hours transcribed interview material has been analysed. The sensitising concepts were sociology of exclusion/inclusion, sociology of deviant human behavior, caritas science, and diaconal sci-ence {{as an integral part of}} theology and addiction research. The coding process was partially as in GTM, sometimes delayed due to the availability of subjects of inquest and the specific life situations of the infirm. The pro-cess of data analysis was done in constant comparison through forming contrasts and drawing up codes and categories. Some results from the descriptive data (n = 190) : main users were advanced drug users, male &# 8805; 36 years 71. 36 % and female &# 8805; 36 years 56. 57 %. All in their different drug use trajectory of mostly opioid 63. 30 % and poly drug use, parallel consumption 15. 84 %. Other activating drugs like cocaine and ampheta-mines were not in base consumption, only sometimes as accompanying drug use. The diseases and ailments according to ICD- 10 diagnosis system, not requiring immediate hospital admission, consisted of: skin diseases (132) 27 %, lung diseases (117) 24 %, diseases of muscle and skeleton (62) 13 % and gastrointestinal diseases (38) 8 %. Psychiatric diseases as comorbidity were approximated with more than 20. 00 %. From the biographic data and in comparison with literature and oral valida-tion with the sick users of the infirmary, a heuristic model has been drawn, with zones from exclusiveness, normalcy, precariousness, marginality up to exclusion as a social death. This to assess the approximate extent of disaffiliation from different life dimensions: person, living space, family, work/leisure, (misery/survival) delinquency, disease/nursing care needs, addiction and values/religion. Through data analysis, a life-world-circuit of street addict/junkie has been drawn up and validated with the users of the infirmary. It consists of a “small (street) drug circuit” with drug purchase including acquisition stress, prosecution stress; drug consumption with prosecution stress; avoiding withdrawal/getting high with prosecution stress; sourcing stress (money and drug), prosecution stress; legal and illegal acquisition of money incl. (misery/survival) prostitution with acquisition stress, prosecution stress and survival stress. And a “grand (street) drug circuit” consisting of homelessness; jobless-ness; reduction of social contacts to drug related contacts; disease (acute/chronic), survival stress; craving; (misery) delinquency, prosecution stress; drug arrest; [small drug circuit under the additional circumstances of incarceration], detoxification, withdrawal, drug addiction rehabilitation (treatment); return into homelessness. Some recommendations in dealing and assisting the users of the infirmary in recovery from their diseases and drug addiction have been drawn up...|$|E
