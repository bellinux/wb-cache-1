Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndrome.</b> There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins. This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndrome,</b> retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E

40|$|A novel gammaretrovirus, xenotropic {{murine leukemia}} virus-related virus (XMRV), has been {{identified}} in patients with prostate cancer and in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Standard Mus musculus labo-ratory mice lack a functional XPR 1 receptor for XMRV and are therefore not a suitable model for the virus. In contrast, Gairdner’s shrew-mice (Mus pahari) do express functional XPR 1. To determine whether Mus pahari {{could serve as a}} model for XMRV, primary Mus pahari fibroblasts and mice were infected with cell-free XMRV. Infection of cells in vitro resulted in XMRV Gag expression and the production of XMRV virions. After intraperitoneal injection of XMRV into Mus pahari mice, XMRV proviral DNA could be detected in spleen, blood, and brain. Intravenous administration of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector pseudotyped with XMRV produced GFP CD 4 T cells and CD 19 B cells. Mice mounted adaptive immune responses against XMRV, as evidenced by the production of neutralizing and Env- and Gag-specific antibodies. Prominent G-to-A hypermutations were also found in viral genomes isolated from the spleen, suggesting intracellular restriction of XMRV infection by APOBEC 3 in vivo. These data demonstrate infection of Mus pahari by XMRV, potential cell tropism of the virus, and immunological and intracellular restriction of virus infection in vivo. These data support the use of Mus pahari as a model for XMRV pathogenesis and as a platform for vaccine and drug development against this potential human pathogen...|$|R

Later it was added that health is the “capacity to lead a socially and economically productive life. ” But, when the general concern is to destroy the balance, whatever that may mean – the balance of the active body or the body “ready to leave the system”, balance of knowledge, individual and collective mental equilibrium, functional balance of economy, balance of the bio-system… - we must not remain indifferent.

40|$|Background : Parkinson&#x 2032;s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, {{neurodegenerative}} {{disorder that}} leads to the classic features of akinesia (encompassing hypokinesia and bradykinesia), tremor, rigidity and postural instability. Other non-motor complications include depression, fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbances. For the management of these complications, non-pharmacological techniques, such as Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be used. This can focus on overt behavior and underlying cognitions and train the patient in coping strategies to obtain better symptom control. Objectives: To review studies on CBT as palliative care in PD patients. Materials and Methods: A survey was conducted for all available English-language studies by means of a MEDLINE search. Keywords in the searches included Parkinson&#x 2032;s disease, palliative care, and cognitive behavior therapy. All articles that reported the cognitive behavior therapy and palliative care in a group of PD patients regardless of the method used by the researchers were identified and analyzed. Result and Conclusion: CBT has a strong evidence base for its use and has proven to be an effective treatment in management of people with <b>chronic</b> pain, <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndrome,</b> depression and sleep disturbances, with efficacy that lasts beyond the duration of treatment. Although PD patients suffer from these complications, {{there are only a few}} studies on administration of CBT on them. Considering its effectiveness, CBT can be used as an option for palliative care for PD patients, directed toward improving the patient&#x 2032;s functional status, clinical disability and quality of life.

This research also analyzes the metaphors used in the scientific and biomedical literature to describe the same symptoms as listed above. A comparison is drawn between this analysis and {{that focused on the}} women’s use of metaphors. It is found that although many of the metaphors are the same, they differ in discursive employment. Environmental metaphors, along with metaphors of fracture, harm and productivity are used by the research participants with a very different intent than how the same metaphors are used in the biomedical literature. The women used the metaphors to reveal the ways in which their symptoms are influenced by the social and cultural forces in their everyday lives. The biomedical and scientific use of metaphors reinforced the highly contested view that the symptoms are influenced more by individual psychological and emotional deficiencies than by broader structural forces...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently, it {{has become}} clear that neuralgic amyotrophy (NA; {{idiopathic}} and hereditary brachial plexus neuropathy) has a less optimistic prognosis than usually assumed. To optimize treatment and management of these patients, one needs to know the residual symptoms and impairments they suffer. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} describe the prevalence of pain, psychologic symptoms, fatigue, functional status, and quality of life in patients with NA. SETTING: Neurology outpatient department of an academic teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: NA patients (N= 89) were studied, and clinical details were recorded. Self-report data were on average collected 2 years after the onset of the last NA episode. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain was assessed with the McGill Pain Questionnaire, fatigue with the Checklist Individual Strength, and psychologic distress with the Symptom Checklist 90. Functional status and handicap were assessed with the modified Rankin Scale and Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey. RESULTS: Pain was usually localized in the right shoulder and upper arm, matching the clinical predilection site for paresis in NA. About a quarter to a third of the patients reported significant long-term pain and fatigue, and half to two thirds still experienced impairments in daily life. Over one third of the individual patients suffered from severe fatigue. The group did not fulfill the criteria of <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> or major psychologic distress. There was no correlation of pain or fatigue with the level of residual paresis on a Medical Research Council scale, but patients with a comorbid condition fared worse than patients without. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of NA patients suffer from persistent pain and fatigue, leading to impairment. Symptoms were not correlated with psychologic distress. This makes it likely that they are caused by residual shoulder or arm dysfunction but not as part of a <b>chronic</b> pain or <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndrome</b> in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{is common}} in old age, the {{association}} between <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> and common affective disorders is largely unknown. Aims: To fill this research gap, the present study aims to determine the relationship between <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> and common psychiatric disorders among older adults aged 65 and older. Method: A national representative sample of 1793 England community-dwelling respondents aged 65 and above was assessed in the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) using the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule to measure <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> and common psychiatric disorders. Demographic characteristics, medical conditions, and four health-related variables based on the Short Form 12 were also measured. Results: The prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> was 18. 6 %. Bivariate analyses revealed that <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> was more common among women and non-white ethnicities. In addition, <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{was significantly related to}} depression, mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder after adjusting for demographic variables, medical conditions, and four other health-related variables. Conclusion: The prevalence rate of <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> in our sample is higher than a previous study.

40|$|Background: Epidemiologic data is {{available}} on <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> for Western, but not for Chinese populations. The aims {{of the present study}} were to determine the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> in the general population of Hong Kong, compare health and lifestyle characteristics of non-chronic <b>fatigue</b> and <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> cases, and identify risk factors for <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Methods: We performed telephone interviews on 5001 randomly selected Chinese adults aged ≥ 18 years administering the Chinese version of <b>Chronic</b> <b>Fatigue</b> Scale (ChCFS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and quality of life (QoL) indexed by Medical Outcomes Study 12 -item Short-Form Health Survey (SF 12). Lifestyle, and sociodemographic data were also collected. <b>Chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> was defined according to Fukuda et al. 's (1994) criteria and case criterion was a ChCFS total scores ≥ 4. Results: The weighted prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> was 10. 7 %, which was equivalent to 0. 6 million adults in Hong Kong. Higher prevalence rates were found in females, older age groups, and low socioeconomic status. Fully adjusted stepwise regression analyses identified older age, retirees, housewife, existing long-term health problems, higher HADS scores, poor QoL, and low self-perceived health to be significantly associated with increased risk of <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue,</b> whereas regular exercise was associated with decreased risk of <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> (all p < 0. 05). Limitations: The cross-sectional design did not allow determination of the time course and causal relationship between <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> and associated factors. Conclusions: Our data evidenced that <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> is common in the general population of Hong Kong, and the prevalence increased with age and was higher in the women and lower socioeconomic population. © 2010 Elsevier B.

Methods and Principal Findings: Pooled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from nPTLS patients, CFS patients, and healthy volunteers were comprehensively analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS), coupled with immunoaffinity depletion methods to reduce protein-masking by abundant proteins. Individual patient and healthy control CSF samples were analyzed directly employing a MS-based label-free quantitative proteomics approach. We found that both groups, and individuals within the groups, could be distinguished from each other and normals based on their specific CSF proteins (p& 0. 01). CFS (n = 43) had 2, 783 non-redundant proteins, nPTLS (n = 25) contained 2, 768 proteins, and healthy normals had 2, 630 proteins. Preliminary pathway analysis demonstrated that the data could be useful for hypothesis generation on the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these two related syndromes. Conclusions: nPTLS and CFS have distinguishing CSF protein complements. Each condition has a number of CSF proteins that can be useful in providing candidates for future validation studies and insights on the respective mechanisms of pathogenesis. Distinguishing nPTLS and CFS permits more focused study of each condition, and can lead to novel diagnostics and therapeutic interventions...|$|R
