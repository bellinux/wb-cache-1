40|$|This paper {{provides}} a new advanced probabilistic approach for reliable {{estimation of the}} fatigue characteristic S-N curves of welded joints both for constant amplitude (CA) and variable amplitude (VA) loading conditions. The presented approach, which {{is referred to as}} the ML-MCS approach, combines Maximum Likelihood method (ML) and Monte-Carlo Simulations (MCS) method to estimate true p-quantiles of <b>CA</b> and <b>VA</b> S-N curves by using complete experimental data-sets. The ML-MCS approach includes a linearization method for use of S-N curves in combination with linear damage accumulation rule as well as for direct comparison with current standards. Application of the ML-MCS approach on two study cases and comparison with current standards shows that the use of the ML-MCS approach may have a significant impact in re-definition of <b>CA</b> and <b>VA</b> S-N curves of current standards and in particular of the CAFL, of the S-N curve second slope and of the critical value of accumulated damage at failure. The last section of the paper {{provides a}}ccurate guidelines for future experimental tests needed for re-definition of current standards. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} analyze {{to what extent}} {{expression}} of four cell cycle regulation markers-minichromosome maintenance protein (MCM 2), Ki- 67, cyclin A, and phosphohistone-H 3 (PHH 3) -predict response to primary systemic therapy in terms of pathological complete remission (pCR). In search of an accurate and reproducible scoring method, we compared computer-assisted (CA) and routine visual assessment (VA) of immunoreactivity. We included 57 patients with breast cancer in the study. The cell cycle markers were detected using immunohistochemistry on pre-therapy core biopsy samples. Parallel CA (validated by manual labeling) and standard VA were performed and compared for diagnostic agreement and predictive value for pCR. <b>CA</b> and <b>VA</b> results were dichotomized based on receiver operating characteristic analysis defined optimal cut-off values. "High" was defined by staining scores above the optimal cut-off, while "low" had staining scores below the optimal cut-off. The CA method resulted in significantly lower values for Ki- 67 and MCM 2 compared to VA (mean difference, - 3. 939 and - 4. 323). Diagnostic agreement was highest for cyclin A and PHH 3 (- 0. 586 and - 0. 666, respectively). Regardless of the method (CA/VA) used, all tested markers were predictive of pCR. Optimal cut-off-based dichotomization improved diagnostic agreement between the <b>CA</b> and <b>VA</b> methods for every marker, in particular for MCM 2 (kappa = 1, p < 0. 000). Cyclin A displayed excellent agreement (kappa = 0. 925; p < 0. 000), while Ki- 67 and PHH 3 showed good agreement (kappa = 0. 789, p < 0. 000 and kappa = 0. 794, p < 0. 000, respectively). We found all cell cycle markers (Ki- 67, MCM 2, cyclin A, and PHH 3) predictive of pCR.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{cerebral}} hemodynamics in patients with cognitive dysfunction associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). Patients and methods. Fifty-six patients aged 40 – 75 years (the mean age was 62. 7 ± 6. 3 years) with nonvalvular AF caused by ischemic heart disease were examined. In 30 (53. 6 %) patients AF was permanent; in 26 (46. 4 %) patients, it was either persistent or paroxysmal. The exclusion criteria were as follows: past transient ischemic attacks, stroke or myocardial infarction, and severe somatic diseases. All patients with AF were evaluated for cognitive functions (using the short scale for assessing the mental status), auditory memory and associative memory (using the Schulte test), and emotional background (using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Ultrasonography of the extracranial and intracranial vessels and registration of the average linear blood flow velocity (LBFV) was performed. Results. Cognitive impairments (CI) were diagnosed in 38 patients who entered the main group; patients with AF without CI comprised the control group. 82. 6 % of patients of the main group were diagnosed with constrictive lesion of the carotid (<b>CA)</b> and vertebral (<b>VA)</b> arteries of various severity; the isolated lesion of the CA was observed in 23. 7 % of patients, the isolated lesion of the VA in 18. 4 %; multiple lesions of the <b>CA</b> and <b>VA</b> in 69. 4 %; and the hemodynamically significant lesion, in 30. 3 %. In patients of the control group, constrictive lesions of the extracranial arteries were observed in 65. 5 % of cases. Condition of the major arteries of the head (MAH) significantly affects the LBFV parameters of the intracranial arteries. In patients with multiple lesions of the <b>CA</b> and <b>VA,</b> the LBFV in the intracranial vessels was much lower than that in patients with isolated lesions of the <b>CA</b> and <b>VA.</b> The relation between the rate and severity of constrictive lesions of the MAH and the presence of AF accompanied with CI was noted in patients. Cerebral hypoperfusion, stenosis of the MAH, and lesions of the small cerebral arteries play an important role in pathogenesis of CI in patients with AF. Changes in the cerebral hemodynamics were stronger pronounced in patients with cognitive dysfunction associated with AF. To prevent the development and progression of vascular dementia, patients with AF need complex treatment by a cardiologist and a neurologist.   </div...|$|R

40|$|Fractographic {{analysis}} of fatigue fracture surfaces is used extensively in aircraft accident investigation to correlate various progression markings, {{associated with the}} crack front position, with the load cycle history which was experienced by the failed component in service. Matching {{the results of this}} analysis to the predicted fatigue crack growth, however, is often complicated by stable tearing crack growth. Bands of stable tearing are often observed on fracture surfaces in a range of structural metals but their growth is not incorporated in fatigue predictive models. Therefore, the key challenge in fracture surface analysis is to relate the multiple tears, of different lengths, to the loads present in the load history. The main objective of this research is to develop improved analytical and prognostic models for predicting the stable tearing jump length [Delta] a in aluminium alloys. This research involved a series of tests which produced stable tearing in 7075 aircraft aluminium alloy under constant amplitude (CA) and variable amplitude (VA) loading. Macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of <b>CA</b> and <b>VA</b> tearing were studied and the main conclusion relates to the notable differences between tearing under <b>CA</b> and <b>VA</b> loading. This study revealed that the stress intensity factor was one of the key controlling parameters in tearing onset and arrest. The loading conditions also have been observed to impose different effects on the size of tearing. This study suggests that for similar K, the CA tearing at initiation has smaller tearing crack jump length [Delta] a, than the VA tearing, but as the crack progresses, the size of [Delta] a under VA conditions is markedly larger than that sustainable under CA conditions. The CA condition seems to confer apparent resistance to tearing, which results in smaller tearing crack jumps, than in VA loading conditions. The static tearing curve is developed based on the standard K R curve test method. This study shows that the K -value at which the static tearing commences is approximately equivalent to the first onset stress intensity factor for VA tearing and the R -curve method can be used to estimate the [Delta] a of both <b>CA</b> and <b>VA</b> tearing during fractographic analysis, but this technique requires the R -curve to be developed for particular configurations. The complex crack front curvatures observed at tearing arrest distort simple estimates of stress intensity factor and hence a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) analysis has been undertaken to estimate the through thickness stress intensity factor K 3 D variation. Based on the parametric finite element {{analysis of}} the stress-intensity factor K 3 D at the mid-thickness of three VA tearing, this study presents a new validated stable tearing model for predicting the crack jump length [Delta] a during stable tearing. The main features of this new model are that the tongue­ shaped region of stable tearing is idealised as a trapezoidal shape and the average of areal ratio of tearing is approximately constant. Comparisons between the model predictions and experimental results indicate that this new model produces satisfactory prediction of stable tearing crack jump length [Delta] a in aluminium alloys of different cross-sectional thickness...|$|R
