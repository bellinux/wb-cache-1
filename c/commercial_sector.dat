5|$|Overall, almost 36,000residences {{were damaged}} {{as a result}} of Catarina's onslaught; of those, 993 {{collapsed}} completely. The <b>commercial</b> <b>sector</b> fared slightly better, as only 2,274buildings were damaged and 472 collapsed. Finally, 397public buildings were damaged and three were destroyed. These account for 26% of the total buildings in the region, and property damage of $25.6million (2004 USD $ USD). Four-fifths of the damaged houses had some sort of roof failure or collapse. Most of the damage was blamed on the low quality of the construction; brick residences typically lacked plaster, beams, or columns, for example. The areas affected the most were those inhabited by low-income families, usually with annual family salaries of less than $400USD.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors,</b> share a {{significant}} portion of energy consumption in Iran; 37 percent of the total per capita consumption. Therefore, identification of the relation between revenue and energy consumption could be a great assistance to policy makers for clarification of policies employed in energy sector. This paper attempts to explore and analyze the relationship between revenue and energy consumption in residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors</b> for the years 1969 to 2009 in Iran by Smooth Transition Regression Models. Smooth transition regression model is a nonlinear time series model which can be considered as a developed form of Switching Regression Model. The obtained results indicate that in the long and short term there is a nonlinear and inverse relationship between energy consumption in residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors</b> and gross domestic production while there is a direct and nonlinear relationship between energy consumption in residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors</b> and value-added of residential sector and population. Ultimately, if a gross domestic production, residential sector value added and population increase, energy consumption in residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors</b> will decrease about 0. 66 and increase about 17. 72 and 1. 15 respectively...|$|R

3000|$|This study {{presents}} {{the application of}} the PSO and GA methods for estimation and prediction of energy demand in residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors</b> in Iran. The socio-economic indicators use in this study are value added of all economic sectors (total value added): the total value added minus that of the oil sector, National Income, Gross fixed capital formation for the constructions, value of made buildings, Population, Total Number of Households, Total Labor, Population minus the Labor, Electrical and Fuel Appliance Price index, Energy Price index adjusted by the General Price Index and Consumer Energy (Fuel) Price Index. The models developed in two forms (exponential and linear) are applied to prediction of energy demand in residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors</b> in Iran. The objective of the study is answering these questions: (1) what is the appropriate scenario to predict energy demand in residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors</b> of Iran? (2) How much will the annual demand for energy in residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors</b> be up to 2032 ? [...]...|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} <b>commercial</b> <b>sector</b> {{of the state}} is that of retail foodstuffs, especially those selling groceries, meat and poultry. This represented over 40% of the <b>commercial</b> <b>sector</b> in 1998. Just over 30% of commerce was dedicated to non-food products such as clothing and pharmaceuticals with the rest mostly dedicated to wholesale foods. From the latter 20th century, tourism has taken up much of the economic slack left behind by the demise of much of the state’s mining industry, with income from this sector surpassing that of the petroleum industry. The state has a variety of historic, cultural and natural attractions. Commerce and tourism employ about 44% of the population.|$|E

30|$|Our {{empirical}} {{analysis revealed}} that the demand for electricity in Japan’s industrial and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors</b> is inelastic to electricity rates. More specifically, the short- and long-run price elasticities of the demand are lower than previous estimates in both sectors. Furthermore, the price elasticity for the industrial and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors</b> is considerably lower than the production elasticity of electricity demand in both the short and long run. Furthermore, our estimation results for the power demand functions support {{the assumption that the}} price elasticity of power demand should be − 0.1 or almost 0. This has key implications for policy makers in Japan, that is, a hike in electricity rates can moderately reduce the demand for electricity in the industrial and <b>commercial</b> <b>sectors</b> in both the short and long run and price is not a major factor influencing the demand for electricity.|$|R
