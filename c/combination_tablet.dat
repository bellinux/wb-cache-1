40|$|Objectives: Combination therapy {{using an}} {{angiotensin}} II receptor blocker {{is expected to}} promote medication adherence and alleviate economic burden among patients by {{reducing the number of}} drugs taken, and thereby to lower associated medical costs. In the present retrospective study, we conducted a survey on the use of angiotensin II receptor blocker–containing <b>combination</b> <b>tablets</b> as anti-hypertensive drugs, in particular angiotensin II receptor blocker/diuretic and angiotensin II receptor blocker/calcium channel blocker combinations, in order to investigate the number of prescribed drugs and drug cost. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients who visited the outpatient clinic of GifuMunicipalHospital and received anti-hypertensive agents between June 2006 and December 2011. Results: No reductions in the number of prescribed drugs or drug cost were seen following a change in prescription to an angiotensin II receptor blocker/diuretic. Patients receiving an angiotensin II receptor blocker/calcium channel blocker had a significant {{reduction in the number of}} prescribed drugs and a slight decrease in drug cost. Conclusion: In this study, a reduction in the number of prescribed drugs and a decrease in economic burden were not observed after prescription of angiotensin II receptor blocker–containing <b>combination</b> <b>tablets.</b> In order to assess the usefulness of angiotensin II receptor blocker <b>combination</b> <b>tablets,</b> further studies are necessary to investigate their hypotensive effects, safety profile, and other factors...|$|R

Patients who receive insufficient doses of antihypertensive agents or who are poorly adherent to multidrug treatment regimens often fail to achieve adequate blood pressure (BP) control. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and calcium channel blocker (CCB) <b>combination</b> <b>tablet</b> containing a regular dose of irbesartan (100 mg) and a high dose of amlodipine (10 mg) with regard to lowering BP and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated data from 68 patients with essential hypertension whose treatment regimen was changed either from combination treatment with an independent ARB and a low-dose or regular-dose CCB or from a <b>combination</b> <b>tablet</b> of ARB and a low-dose or regular-dose CCB to a <b>combination</b> <b>tablet</b> containing amlodipine 10 mg and irbesartan 100 mg, because of incomplete BP control. Previous treatments did not include irbesartan as the ARB. Results: The <b>combination</b> <b>tablet</b> decreased systolic and diastolic BP. In addition, it significantly decreased serum uric acid, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, independent of the BP-lowering effect. Treatment with the <b>combination</b> <b>tablet</b> did not affect serum triglycerides, plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, serum potassium or creatinine levels, or the urinary albumin excretion rate.

25|$|It was {{discussed}} {{at the time that}} people who abuse alcohol and other substances and take combination dextropoxyphene / acetaminophen (paracetamol) may need to take many <b>combination</b> <b>tablets</b> to reach euphoria, because the amount of dextropropoxyphene per tablet is relatively low (30–40mg). The ingested paracetamol—the other component—may then reach liver toxic levels. In the case of alcoholics, who often already have damaged livers, even a relatively small overdose with paracetamol may produce hepatotoxicity, liver failure and necrosis. This toxicity with the combination of overdosed dextroproxyphene (with its CNS/respiratory depression/vomit with risk for aspiration pneumonia, as well as cardiotoxicity) and paracetamol-induced liver damage can result in death.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} nevirapine {{concentrations in}} African HIV-infected children receiving divided Triomune tablets (stavudine+lamivudine+nevirapine). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Steady-state plasma nevirapine concentrations were determined in Malawian and Zambian children aged 8 months to 18 years receiving Triomune in routine outpatient settings. Predictors from height-for-age, {{body mass index}} (BMI) -for-age, age, sex, post-dose sampling time and dose/m 2 /day were investigated using centre-stratified regression with backwards elimination (P or = 300 mg/m 2 /day nevirapine had subtherapeutic concentrations (< 3 mg/l) compared with 22 (23 %) of those prescribed < 300 mg/m 2 /day; most children with subtherapeutic nevirapine concentrations were taking half or quarter Triomune tablets. Lower nevirapine concentrations were independently associated with lower height-for-age (indicating stunting) (0. 37 mg/l per unit higher [95 % confidence interval (CI) : - 0. 003, + 0. 74]; P= 0. 05), lower prescribed dose/m 2 (+ 0. 89 mg/l per 50 mg/m 2 higher [95 % CI: 0. 32, 1. 46]; P= 0. 002) and higher BMI-for-age (indicating lack of wasting) (- 0. 42 mg/l per unit higher [95 % CI: - 0. 80, - 0. 04]; P= 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS: Currently available adult fixed-dose <b>combination</b> <b>tablets</b> are not well suited to children, particularly at younger ages: Triomune 30 is preferable to Triomune 40 because of the higher dose of nevirapine relative to stavudine.
