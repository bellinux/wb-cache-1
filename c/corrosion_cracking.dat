5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracking</b> of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracking</b> caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E

40|$|The stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> {{is one of}} the {{fracture}} phenomena for the major structure components in nuclear power plant. During the operation of a power plant, stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> are initiated and grown especially in dissimilar weldment of primary loop components. In particular, stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> usually occurs when the following three factors exist at the same time: susceptible material, corrosive environment, and tensile stress (residual stress included). Thus, residual stress becomes a critical factor for stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> when it is difficult to improve the material corrosivity of the components and their environment under operating conditions. In this study, stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> were artificially produced on STS 304 pipe itself by control of welding residual stress. We used the instrumented indentation technique and 3 D FEM analysis (using ANSYS 12) to evaluate the residual stress values in the GTAW area. We used the custom-made device for fabricating the stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> in the inner STS 304 pipe wall. As the result of both FEM analysis and experiment, the stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> was quickly generated and could be reproduced, and it could be controlled by welding residual stress...|$|R

25|$|To reduce weight, {{aluminium}} alloy armour - using AA7017 made to Alcan E74S specification (Al + Zn 3.9; Mn 2.6) - was originally selected instead of steel; research revealed that it provided greater protection from artillery shell-splinters {{because of its}} areal density. However, this alloy suffered from stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracking</b> over time, especially around the gun mantlets of the Scimitar, and an improved specification armour (AA1707 made to MVEE-1318B with strict quality control) was fitted from 1978.|$|E

One of the airline's Douglas DC-9s crashed while taking off, bound for Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport. According to NTSB reports, the crash was caused by {{improper}} pilot reaction when the plane's right engine failed due to stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracking.</b> The improper flight control inputs caused an uncommanded roll and accelerated stall. The 31 people on board died.|$|E
25|$|Protective films can {{be applied}} to the inner surface of copper alloy tubes to {{increase}} corrosion resistance. For certain applications, the film is composed of iron. In power plant condensers, duplex tubes consisting of an inner titanium layer with outer copper-nickel alloys are employed. This enables the use of copper’s beneficial mechanical and chemical properties (e.g., stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracking,</b> ammonia attack) along with titanium’s excellent corrosion resistance. A duplex tube with inner aluminium brass or copper-nickel and outer stainless or mild steel can be used for cooling in the oil refining and petrochemical industries.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} factors which {{terminate}} service life of concrete structure in corrosive environment is corrosion attack. Rust expansion of corroded reinforcement in concrete causes <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack.</b> Crack width due to corrosion {{on the surface of}} concrete is influenced by some factors, i. e., prestressed force, size of reinforcement and thickness of concrete cover. Effect of prestressed force and size of reinforcement in <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> width is investigated using numerical simulation based on elastic expansion model which is adopted to discover those influences. Three specimens of prestressed concrete beam and three specimens of reinforced concrete beam are utilized in the investigation. Experimental work is carried out to validate the numerical simulation results. It is found that prestressed force has insignificant influence on <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> width. Meanwhile, size of reinforcement contributes greatly on crack width due to corrosion on the surface of concrete...|$|R

2500|$|Passivation is {{extremely}} useful in mitigating corrosion damage, however even a high-quality alloy will corrode if {{its ability to}} form a passivating film is hindered. [...] Proper selection of the right grade of material for the specific environment {{is important for the}} long-lasting performance of this group of materials. [...] If breakdown occurs in the passive film due to chemical or mechanical factors, the resulting major modes of corrosion may include pitting corrosion, crevice corrosion, and stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracking.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} process technology, there {{continue to be}} recurring corrosion problems that affect the safety and reliability of HFAU.

[...] Carbon steel {{is by far the}} most common material used, although it requires tight controls on composition and hardness. [...] Alternative, more corrosion resistant materials such as such as Monel are sometimes used, but these materials are significantly more expensive and carry their own unique risks, such as stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracking.</b> [...] Proper inspection is critical on HFAUs and typically occurs on a much more frequent basis than most other units in a refinery.|$|E
40|$|The {{branching}} {{and growth}} mechanism of stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> in quenched-and-tempered SNCM 8 steel in 3. 5 % NaCl solution was analysed from a view point of fracture mechanics. The intermittent crack growth behavior was detected. The crack increment in {{each step of}} discontinuous crack growth was smaller than the plastic zone size and larger than the twice of the crack tip opening displacement. The crack branching mode was shown to be strongly dependent upon the tempering temperature. The effect of crack branching on crack growth kinetics was separately discussed based on a mechano-chemical model of stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. It is {{difficult}} to evaluate the <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> growth resistance parameters due to specific morphology of cracks (curvilinear propagation path, branching, corrosion and deformation blunting). In particular, the high-strength steels exhibit a curvilinear path of the cracks propagation and their intergranular branching, caused by the grain-boundary subcritical crack growth. For ductile materials the effect of deformation crack blunting due to active loading of a specimen and its sustained loading as well as corrosion blunting because of interaction of the specimen free surfaces with environment are very important. The experimental procedure for evaluation of peculiarities of the <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> growth is proposed. To {{take into account the}} <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> branching, KIeff was evaluated, which was assumed to equal the maximum KI value achieved at the tip of one of the crack branches. It has been shown that the account of the morphological specific features of the <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> growth are very important for the correct evaluation of service characteristics of materials and determination of the environment influence mechanism. It has been shown that the precision of evaluating the KIscc level decreases and the usage of outer polarization for evaluation of mechanism of corrosion environment effect can lead to the wrong conclusion if the possible variation of the crack morphology is not taken into account. These peculiarities are very important for the correct evaluation of service characteristics of materials and for an examination of the rupture causes of the structure...|$|R

40|$|Eddy current {{testing has}} become a widely used {{nondestructive}} technique for material testing and evaluation. This technique depends on {{the interaction between the}} impedance of the test coil and the material as the probe scans the surface of a material under investigation. By measuring the change in impedance of the test coil, the size of an imperfection in the material can be determined. In this project, the first aim of the research was to investigate and develop the use of the eddy current technique to detect stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> (SCC) in the bore of fastener holes. Specimens were scanned with the probe moving in and out the hole to produce a signal of the eddy current response. In addition, due to the skin depth effect, the operating frequency was also taken into consideration as an important parameter. A calibration standard test piece was prepared to represent SCC around a fastener hole, with the cracks lying in a plane parallel to the surface. Data from eddy current tests on real stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> has been used to develop an eddy current calibration curve for predicting stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> lengths in larger components. The second aim of the project was to use the eddy current technique to study SCC crack growth in high strength aluminium alloy 7075 -W under both tensile and compressive loading conditions. The importance of parameters such as heat treatment, grain shape, grain aspect ratio, component of stress, threshold stress intensity and microstructure were all taken into consideration. The SCC development was found to follow an intergranular path, which strongly depended on the microstructure of the material. Tests were carried out using double cantilever beam specimens to measure the threshold stress intensity, Kiscc, below which SCC would not occur. The specimens showed evidence of exfoliation corrosion at the surface and corrosion product wedging within the stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks,</b> which caused further crack growth at the low applied stresses. Stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> were found to grow in 7075 -W under high compressive loading, whereas control tests without compressive test stress produced only exfoliation <b>corrosion</b> and no <b>crack</b> growth. The mechanism of SCC in both tensile and compressive loading was thought to be anodic dissolution of metal at the crack tip, with protective films being disrupted by dislocation movement with the formation of active slip-steps.
