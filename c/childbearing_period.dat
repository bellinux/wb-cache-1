40|$|Governments and NGOs in many industrialized {{countries}} {{are concerned about}} the long-term demographic impacts of low fertility levels. We discuss how "tempo policies," reforms that shift the timing of <b>childbearing,</b> affect <b>period</b> and possibly cohort fertility levels. One such policy is a school reform that decreases the educational completion age, which could be achieved through an earlier school entrance age and compression of the school duration. Such policies are currently in focus in several low fertility countries, although for reasons not related to family issues. We show that a younger initiation of childbearing would have a rejuvenating effect on the age composition and increase the size of the population. Even if just the timing and not the levels of fertility increase, a younger timing of fertility could soften the trends of shrinking and ageing populations...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether {{unemployment}} and insecure employment periods merely delay fertility or also impact on completed fertility in France. It analyses both {{the timing of}} first childbearing and the fertility reached at age 40. Different indicators of declining employment security are used, i. e. current individual employment characteristics, the accumulation of unstable jobs, and aggregate-level indicators of employment uncertainty. Male unemployment has a negative influence on the timing of first <b>childbearing,</b> while <b>periods</b> of insecure employment delay fertility for women. Completed fertility is impacted by unemployment spells only for men who have faced long-term unemployment. Employment uncertainty thus tends to delay first parenthood but has a relatively weak effect on lifetime fertility in France. Generous state support to families associated with a generous unemployment insurance system, and the strong French two-child family norm may explain why economic uncertainty affects fertility less than elsewhere. birth parity, event history analysis, fertility, gender, labor market, short-term employment, unemployment...|$|R
40|$|Using {{detailed}} data on period and cohort fertility in four European countries, this paper discusses various indicators of period fertility, including indicators adjusted {{for changes in}} fertility timing. Empirical analysis focuses on the comparison of cohort fertility and corresponding indicators of period fertility; particular {{attention is paid to}} the periods of intensive postponement of <b>childbearing.</b> Some <b>period</b> indicators come consistently closer to the completed cohort fertility than the total fertility rates. This pattern of differential period-cohort approximation widely varies by birth order. Quite high level of approximation is provided by the tempo-adjusted birth probabilities of parity 1 and a combined indicator of total fertility. Two examples illustrate the use of indicators discussed in the paper: the first provides an estimation of the tempo (timing) and quantum (level) components in fertility change in the Czech Republic and the second presents projections of cohort fertility in the Czech Republic and Italy. cohort, Czech Republic, fertility, fertility timing, Italy, Netherlands, period fertility, Sweden...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} and interpret women´s experiences of being exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy and of important others in relation to change, and men´s experiences of becoming fathers and of being in change {{in the context of}} pregnancy and early parenthood. Methods: In Studies I and II, a phenomenological method was used to describe women’s experiences of being exposed to IPV during pregnancy and women´s experience of important others in a pregnancy dominated by IPV. In Study III, a phenomenological hermeneutic method was used to illuminate the lived experiences of becoming a father in men who have subjected their partners to violence. In Study IV, a lifeworld hermeneutic method was used to explore men’s experiences of perpetrating IPV and of being in change in the <b>childbearing</b> <b>period.</b> Data were collected from interviews with five (Study I) and seven (Study II) women who were exposed to IPV, and with ten men (Studies III and IV) who had perpetrated IPV in the <b>childbearing</b> <b>period.</b> Findings: Being exposed to violence by one’s partner during pregnancy was characterised by difficult existential choices and ambivalence. The existential choices are related to the women’s whole life, both before and during pregnancy. By ambivalence is meant being uncertain about one’s own feelings, self-esteem and abilities. (Study I). Women’s experiences of important others implied striving for control in an uncontrolled situation, where other people might be experienced as representing both a rescue and a risk (Study II). Becoming and being fathers was experienced as a demanding transition and was affected by the men’s experiences with their own fathers. It forced men to grow up and to take responsibility, and it seemed that the men were struggling hard to keep control. Being a father implied being able to protect the child (Study III). The men’s experiences showed that to be perceived as a multifaceted individual was a prerequisite for finding the motivation to change. Men expressed a need for support in learning how to become good fathers, and their experiences of being in change is about seeing oneself through the eyes of others. The child is crucial as a motivator for change (Study IV). Conclusions: The <b>childbearing</b> <b>period</b> is experienced as a period for change for both the women and the men which involves the past, present time, and the future. Both the men and the women harbour desires to change their life situations with respect to IPV. To be seen by others as multifaceted individuals and not just be associated with the role of victim or perpetrator of violence is important. The child represents a key motivating factor for change, and both the men and women want to be good parents. The <b>childbearing</b> <b>period</b> is a significant time in terms of meeting women who are being exposed to violence. Both men and women need support and help with changing their life situation and in their role as parents...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{describe}} and explore the effect that pregnancy, childbirth and adjustment to a new baby have on the sexual relationship of fathers. Design: a content analysis, using a qualitative approach, was undertaken on the written comments provided by fathers on a 6 -week postpartum postal survey. The survey was undertaken to provide information relating to fathers’ adaptation to fatherhood. The father’s functional status was measured using, the Inventory of Functional Status-fathers (IFS-F) Tool. Setting: a regional location within New South Wales, Australia.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of recent fertility changes in 15 countries of central and eastern Europe and in the former East Germany. It focuses on the period after 1989, which witnessed a profound transformation in childbearing patterns, including a rapid decline in fertility rates, the postponement of childbearing, and an upsurge in the proportion of extramarital births. These shifts went hand in hand with changes in union formation, abortion and contraceptive prevalence. While the intensive decline of the total fertility rates seems to indicate a uniform reaction of former Communist societies to the ongoing social and economic changes, the analysis reveals that there was increasing diversity in fertility patterns across the region. The article pays particular attention to the interplay between postponement of <b>childbearing</b> and <b>period</b> fertility levels. The progression of the postponement-indicated by an increase in the mean age of women at first birth-has varied widely between countries. We hypothesize that the more rapid postponement of parenthood was related {{to the success of the}} transition period, and to the extent it brought new opportunities and choices for young people and shifted the institutional structure of many societies considerably closer to the structure of western European countries...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} in the literature on intrahousehold inequality in low-income economies that the family allocates more resources to male members, who have higher market values than women do. Using recent data collected on about 8, 400 people in eight Chinese provinces, this article finds that, when other factors are controlled for, prime-age women are favored in accessing health care in their <b>childbearing</b> and maternal <b>periods.</b> Women’s curative expenditures are more sensitive to family income, but men’s expenditures are more sensitive to parameters that are related to the time involved in getting treatment. This article interprets these findings as evidence for the family’s division of labor to solve its dynamic consumption-production problem. However, consistent with the literature, this article finds that girls are less likely to get treatment than boys and that their curative expenditures are sensitive to parents’ education, family income and wealth, and village sanitary conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|When {{successive}} birth cohorts {{of women}} get {{their children at}} progressively lower ages, births that would have occurred during a certain period without changes in the timing, are now 2 ̆ 01 csqueezed 2 ̆ 01 d into a shorter period. This pushes period fertility up, and the period Total Fertility Rate (TFR) will be inflated, compared to the TFR that would have occurred without changes in the timing. In general, even {{when the number of}} children per woman is constant over successive birth cohorts, period fertility levels may vary 2 ̆ 013 they are inflated in years in which childbearing is accelerated, and deflated when women postpone <b>childbearing.</b> Thus <b>period</b> fertility cannot be used as a reliable indicator for the level of cohort fertility: period fertility may be 2 ̆ 01 cdistorted 2 ̆ 01 d in times of tempo changes in cohort fertility.

But the detailed interplay between period and cohort fertility, both its quantum (level) and tempo (timing) aspects, can be formalized mathematically.

40|$|This article reviews major {{similarities}} and differences in period and cohort fertility in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. These three countries share {{a long history of}} low fertility and currently belong to countries with the lowest cohort fertility rates globally. The study highlights persistent differences in fertility and family patterns between Eastern and Western Germany, which are often rooted in pre-unification contrasts and can be partly linked to continuing differences in institutional set-up and norms on organised childcare, living arrangements and maternal employment. The remarkable stability in period fertility over the last 30 years (with the exception of Eastern Germany) is illustrated with various indicators and discussed on the backdrop of recent reversals in European fertility trends. This stability in fertility levels contrasts with the long-term shift in childbearing towards less stable living arrangements (especially in Eastern Germany), including a high share of single mothers. The study also discusses a relatively small but persistent negative impact of the ongoing shift towards a late timing of <b>childbearing</b> on <b>period</b> fertility in the region. It highlights the educational gradient in fertility, which can be largely attributed to elevated childlessness rates among women with a higher educational degree. Migrant women have on average higher fertility rates than “native-born” women, but their net positive impact on aggregate fertility rates has diminished over time and has become negligible in Germany. A concluding discussion suggests that Austria, Germany and Switzerland share a common pattern of low fertility that sets these countries apart from other regions in Europe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a method}} that analyses how cohort and <b>period</b> <b>childbearing</b> postponement and recuperation (P&R) are reflected in total period fertility rate (TPFR) trends in low-fertility populations in recent decades. The method {{is rooted in the}} trailblazing ideas developed by Ryder (1951 and 1964), namely that childbearing P&R occurs in the life of individual women and can be summarised in the lifetime experiences of birth cohorts. Cohort childbearing age patterns are then translated into <b>period</b> <b>childbearing</b> age patterns and the effects of the P&R process on the TPFRs are revealed by summarising period ASFRs of young women and of older women and analysing their interaction over time in 36 low-fertility populations. The method is complementary to methods pioneered by Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) which estimate tempo-adjusted TPFRs. These demonstrate the degree to which TPFRs are distorted. The method described in this paper reveals the internal mechanism generating TPFR trends; it exposes the demographic structural causes generating TPFR trends and demonstrates why TPFRs are moving in a certain direction. The following findings stand out: 1. All low-fertility populations have experienced TPFR troughs {{at some point during the}} past four decades. The troughs occurred because low fertility among young women of young cohorts starting to postpone childbearing overlaps with low fertility among older women of older cohorts who had not postponed births. The troughs occurred in Western countries mostly during the early 1980 s and in Central and Eastern Europe around 2000. 2. The structural causes of the increase in TPFRs in the late 1990 s and early in the 21 st century were different in Western countries compared to Central and Eastern Europe. The former were experiencing the concluding phases of the P&R process. In contrast, in Central and Eastern Europe populations were experiencing the initial phases of childbearing P&R. It was a historical coincidence that TPFRs were increasing in most low-fertility populations almost simultaneously around the beginning of the 21 st century. 3. These TPFR increases were predominantly the consequence of changes in cohort childbearing age patterns, i. e. changes in the timing of fertility. They were not generated by fertility quantum increases. During this period in almost all the low-fertility countries TPFRs were rising while corresponding total cohort fertility rates were declining...|$|R

30|$|Freedman (1995), who {{emphasizes}} the importance of cultural factors, argues that low fertility rates are caused by socio-cultural factors, and not economic ones. If people are better off due to economic prosperity, they tend to favor stability and individuality. As the consumption habits of unmarried, young people rapidly increase, affluent individuals postpone marriage and childbirth to a later stage in life, and thereby further low fertility rates. Lee et al. (2005), who urges the significance of marriage patterns, asserts that late marriage and lifelong singlehood are crucial factors for explaining low fertility rates. According to his study, late marriage increases the age at which couples choose to have their first child, which not only reduces the remaining <b>childbearing</b> <b>period,</b> but also decreases the child-rearing capability of parents.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Menopausal {{osteoporosis}} is {{a disease}} of older age, and its development {{is related to the}} cessation of ovarian function together with a number of risk factors. Monthly dosing regimens are welcomed by women because of higher satisfaction and better adherence. This study was aimed at assessing the therapeutic effect of ibandronate given once a month to women with postmenopausal osteoporosis on the basis of biochemical bone markers. Material and Methods. We examined 168 patients of 268 patients in ADHERO study. RocheDiagnostics, Elecsys®ß-CrossLaps and ß-NMID- Osteocalcin were used to measure beta-crosslaps before the therapy and 3 months after the therapy had been introduced as well as osteocalcin, which was measured in 12 patients. Results. The value of beta-crosslaps before treatment was 0. 5264 ± 0. 2926, that being above the upper limit of normal values for women in generative period, indicating an average of slightly increased bone resorption. Betacross-laps decreased and reached normal values for women in generative period 0. 2277 ± 0. 1863 three months after the introduction of monthly ibandronat at a dose of 150 mg orally. This difference was highly statistically significant (t= 13. 648, p ≤ 0. 0001). In 18 patients osteocalcin was measured before and three months after the introduction of the therapy. Osteocalcin was 31. 3056 ± 14. 8209 before the treatment, which is normal for women of <b>childbearing</b> <b>period.</b> Osteocalcin decreased to 22. 1822 ± 6. 9943 after three months, which is also within the normal range for women in the <b>childbearing</b> <b>period</b> of life. This difference was statistically significant (t= 2. 951, p ≤ 0. 001). Conclusion. Monthly ibandronat suppresses bone resorption three months after the introduction of therapy.

40|$|Objectives To examine levels, {{trends and}} {{correlates}} of childbearing in childhood (CiC) in the Rufiji district of Tanzania from 2002 to 2010. Methods Using longitudinal data collected in, and by, the Rufiji health and demographic surveillance system in Tanzania from 2002 to 2010, all women who initiated <b>childbearing</b> in this <b>period</b> (n =  5491) {{were selected for}} analysis. CiC was defined as childbearing initiation before age 18. Data analysis involved one-way tabulations of each variable-most of which were socio-demographic-to obtain frequency distributions, cross-tabulations of CiC {{and each of the}} independent variables with a Chi square test for associations, and multivariate analysis using multilevel logistic regression to examine covariates of CiC. Results CiC was 44  % and remained constant over the 2002 - 2010 period (P =  0. 623). The relative odds of CiC was significantly reduced by 83 percent among women with secondary or higher educational attainment relative to CiC among uneducated women (OR =  0. 17, CI 0. 12 - 0. 23). Moreover, the odds of CiC significantly declines monotonically as relative household wealth increases by quintile (OR =  0. 70, CI 0. 57 - 0. 86). CiC also declines significantly with employment and marital status of the respondent. Conclusions CiC represents a challenging social and health problem. Forty-four percent of first time mothers in Rufiji district of Tanzania are of childhood age, and this has not changed over the past 9  years since 2002. Prioritizing girls' formal education-especially up to secondary level or higher-as well as devising some economic empowerment modalities, may be worthwhile measures towards curbing CiC in the study area...|$|R

The current study examined changes in adolescent depression, conduct problems and substance use (alcohol, tobacco and marijuana) across the peripartum period using risk-set propensity scores derived from a population-based, prospective study that began in childhood (the Pittsburgh Girls Study, PGS). Each of 147 childbearing adolescents (ages 12 - 19) was matched with two same-age, non-childbearing adolescents (n = 294) on pregnancy propensity using 15 time-varying risk variables derived from sociodemographic, psychopathology, substance use, family, peer and neighborhood domains assessed in the PGS wave prior to each pregnancy (T 1). Postpartum depression and problem behaviors were assessed within the first 6 months following delivery (T 2); data gathered from the non-childbearing adolescent controls spanned the same interval. Within the childbearing group, conduct problems and marijuana use reduced from T 1 to T 2, but depression severity and frequency of alcohol or tobacco use showed no change. When change was compared across the matched groups, conduct problems showed a greater reduction among childbearing adolescents. Relative to non-childbearing adolescents who reported more frequent substance use with time, childbearing adolescents reported no change in alcohol use and less frequent use of marijuana across the peripartum period. There were no group differences in patterns of change for depression severity and tobacco use.

Data are also presented on {{a measure of}} infertility among men aged 15 – 44. Methods—Data for this report come primarily from the 2006 – 2010 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), which consisted of 22, 682 interviews with men and women aged 15 – 44, conducted from June 2006 through June 2010. The response rate {{for women in the}} 2006 – 2010 NSFG was 78 %, and for men was 75 %. Selected trends are shown based on prior NSFG years. Results—The percentage of married women aged 15 – 44 who were infertile fell from 8. 5 % in 1982 (2. 4 million women) to 6. 0 % (1. 5 million) in 2006 – 2010. Impaired fecundity among married women aged 15 – 44 increased from 11 % in 1982 to 15 % in 2002, but decreased to 12 % in 2006 – 2010. Among all women, 11 % had impaired fecundity in 2006 – 2010. Both infertility and impaired fecundity remain closely associated with age for nulliparous women. Among married, nulliparous women aged 35 – 44, the percentage infertile declined from 44 % in 1982 to 27 % in 2006 – 2010, reflecting greater delays in <b>childbearing</b> over this <b>period.</b> Among married women in 2006 – 2010, non-Hispanic black women {{were more likely to be}} infertile than non-Hispanic white women.

40|$|Demographers {{have known}} since the 1940 s that {{standard}} measures of period fertility, {{such as the}} widely used total fertility rate, are distorted by changes in the timing of <b>childbearing.</b> <b>Period</b> fertility rates are depressed during years in which women delay childbearing and inflated in years when childbearing is accelerated.

The key assumption of the method is that period effects, rather than cohort effects, are the primary force in fertility change, an assumption supported by past research. An application of the adjustment procedure to fertility trends in United States shows that concern over below-replacement fertility in the past 25 years has been largely misplaced. Without the distortion induced by the rising age at childbearing, the underlying level of fertility was essentially constant at close to two children per woman throughout this period.

40|$|We use age-structured {{models for}} VZV {{transmission}} and reactivation {{to reconstruct the}} natural history of VZV in Norway based on available pre-vaccination serological data, contact matrices, and herpes zoster incidence data. Depending on the hypotheses on contact and transmission patterns, the basic reproduction number of varicella in Norway ranges between 3. 7 and 5. 0, implying a vaccine coverage between 73 and 80 % to effectively interrupt transmission with a 100 % vaccine efficacy against infection. The varicella force of infection peaks during early childhood (3 - 5 yrs) and shows a prolonged phase of higher risk during the <b>childbearing</b> <b>period,</b> though quantitative variations can occur depending on contact patterns. By expressing the magnitude of exogenous boosting as a proportion of the force of infection, it is shown that reactivation is well described by a progressive immunity mechanism sustained by a large, though possibly below 100 %, degree of exogenous boosting, in agreement with findings from other Nordic countries, implying large reproduction numbers of boosting. Moreover, magnitudes of exogenous boosting below 40 % are robustly disconfirmed by data.

These forms of childbearing also bring with them substantial costs to society; the cost of the welfare system is a source of particular concern (Maynard 1996; Moore and Wertheimer 1984). Childbearing by young and unmarried women continues to concern health practitioners, educators, the media, and the public. Indeed, the federal welfare law includes provisions to offer states incentives to discourage teen and nonmarital <b>childbearing.</b> While the <b>period</b> of decline in teen childbearing and the leveling off in nonmarital childbearing rates has coincided with the implementation of welfare waivers and a reformed welfare system, many other factors beside welfare rules may have played a role. They include the following: The vigorous economic expansion, which drew to a close in 2000; The expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit; An emerging consensus that mothers with nonmarital births should work to help support their child; Increased use of new methods of contraception, especially Depo-Provera and Norplant(R); Increased education about HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases; A focus on males as well as females for policies affecting reproductive behavior; Increased focus on child support enforcement; and A rise in conservative attitudes toward premarital sex. Child Trends conducted a survey in 2001 of all 50 states to learn how specific state policies and programs to discourage teen and nonmarital childbearing have changed since the 1999 and 1997 surveys. We summarize our findings after we review the trends in teen and nonmarital childbearing...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of {{fertility}} for the overseas-born {{based on the}} period Total Fertility Rate (TFR) suggest that levels of childbearing are significantly higher among foreign-born women than women born in the UK. However, the inter-relationship between migration and subsequent family formation means that aggregate measures {{of fertility}} based on period TFRs {{may not be a}} useful indicator of the likely completed family size that migrant women will have {{at the end of their}} reproductive lives. The aim of this paper is to quantify levels of <b>childbearing</b> in the <b>period</b> before and after migration and hence to examine the inter-relationship between the migration event and the timing of childbearing, and whether this relationship differs by country of birth. Data from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study, a 1 % sample of the England and Wales population, are used to identify the reported date of arrival in the UK and to estimate childbearing prior to, and subsequent from, arrival in England and Wales. The data show that migrant groups experience low fertility rates prior to arrival (especially those arriving at young ages). Fertility rates peak in the first one to four years subsequent to arrival, especially for migrants from lower income countries. Migrants from high income countries show a delay in fertility after migration to England and Wales, and lower fertility rates, as compared to those from low income countries. We speculate that our finding of differing fertility profiles by country of birth groupings are likely to relate to the reason for migrating. Higher fertility rates for migrants from lower income countries may relate to family-related migration, whereas lower fertility among migrants originating in higher income countries may be due to employment related moves...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is a {{large public}} health problem with far-reaching consequences for those involved. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore fathers’ experiences of change during pregnancy and early parenthood in the context of IPV. Methods: The methodological approach in this interview study was hermeneutics, based on a lifeworld perspective. Ten men, who had subjected their partners to violence during the <b>childbearing</b> <b>period,</b> and had become fathers within the previous 6 years, participated. Results: The analysis revealed four themes: beginning to acknowledge that you are inflicting violence, receiving confirmation that you are more than just a perpetrator of violence, becoming aware of the child, and the desire to receive support in the process of learning how to become a father. Levinas’ concept “the face of the other” is used to interpret the findings. Conclusion: This study contributes to a more nuanced and expanded picture of IPV. It shows that men who inflict violence want to be and learn how to be fathers. We need more knowledge about how to stop violent acts and support these men in the process of fatherhood...|$|E
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Using {{longitudinal}} data this work analyses historical fertility between 1834 and 1914 in an Alpine village situated in north-east Italy, characterised by scarce resources and by an economy which passed from being traditional {{and based on}} closed subsistence to becoming open and integrated. During the initial period studied, this territory {{can be described as}} a natural fertility context, where Malthusian preventive checks were long-run mechanisms adopted to overcome the limitations set by the environment. In later years, seasonal migration started to play a predominant role in the community. These flows involved the best skilled, wealthiest and healthiest males and the countries of destination were more modern and affluent, offered better labour opportunities and salaries and possibilities of qualification. Impacts on fertility were strong, evidencing a smaller number of births for migrants, which partly resulted from a reduced <b>childbearing</b> <b>period,</b> with a later start and an earlier stop. The findings of this work therefore show that due to the positive selectivity of these men and to the exposure to influences during their periods of absence, in this village seasonal migrants were the agents of change and also the vanguard of modern reproductive behaviours...|$|E
40|$|In 2005, I {{commenced}} {{a professional}} doctorate in health research to explore women’s {{relationships with their}} midwives during the <b>childbearing</b> <b>period.</b> I was particularly interested to discover whether women {{felt that they had}} developed partnership relationships with the midwives and also whether they felt that the midwives providing care offered choices regarding the place and type of care and whether they were able to contribute actively to the plan for the birth of their child. This case study focuses on {{the first phase of the}} study during which I used a diary-interview method to collect the data. A purposive sample of pregnant women who attended local National Health Service antenatal clinics and were accessing midwifery-led care were recruited to participate in this study. Criteria for enrollment included the ability to communicate effectively in English, to enable informed consent, and all women were over 18 years of age. Although 22 women were initially recruited to the study, 16 women participated fully in this study. A brief introduction provides the background theory underpinning this data collection method. I then expand on how I used this method, illustrating throughout what I learnt during this research journey...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} descriptive, retrospective and {{cross-sectional study}} was conducted. The {{purpose of the}} study was to identify and describe factors that contributed to high sickness and death rate of babies admitted in the Neonatal Unit at a tertiary institution in Limpopo Province. Data were collected from the patient’s records by administering an auditing tool. The tool included initial assessment on antenatal care, intra-partum and neonatal care. Analysis of data was performed by IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics 22 computer software version. Frequency tables and pie graphs were used to present the data. The findings revealed that 42 % of the mothers whose babies were admitted in the Neonatal Unit were in their <b>childbearing</b> <b>period,</b> 71 % of the mothers started antenatal care at the second trimester and 75 % babies were admitted within the first six hours of life. Respiratory distress, 77 % and prematurity, 43 % were the common conditions for admission in the Neonatal Unit. Spontaneous preterm and immaturity were the common causes of death. Recommendations are that education and training on record keeping to be done on continuous basis, to conduct quality improvement programmes and implement maternal and neonatal guidelines in the clinical area throughout.

40|$|This study applies mixture {{modelling}} {{to examine}} age-specific immunity to {{varicella zoster virus}} (VZV) infection in Norway based on the first large-scale serological study in the general population. We estimated the seropositive proportions at different ages and calculated the underlying force of infection by using a sample of 2103 residual sera obtained from patients seeking primary and hospital care. A rapid increase in the VZV-associated immunity is observed {{in the first years}} of life with 63 % of children being immune by age 5. The increase in the immunity levels slows down thereafter, with a large proportion of adults still susceptible by age 20 (around 14. 5 %), thus at risk of serious sequelae of varicella infection. The corresponding force of infection peaks during the preschool period, subsequently declines to a minimum between ages 10 and 20 years, and afterwards moderately increases to reach a plateau lasting throughout the <b>childbearing</b> <b>period.</b> In comparison with the traditional cut-off approach, mixture modelling used the whole data without producing any inconclusive cases, led to an unbiased classification of individuals between susceptible and immune, and provided a smoother immune profile by age. These findings represent an important step towards any decision about the introduction of varicella vaccination in Norway, as they are a primary input for mathematical transmission models aimed at evaluating potential vaccination scenarios...|$|E

Numerous changes occur in attentional processing and affective reactivity across the <b>childbearing</b> <b>period.</b> This review focuses on the definition and methods of measuring attentional processing and affective reactivity. We discuss research studies that have examined the changes in these two processes during the perinatal phases of pregnancy and postpartum, with and without depression and anxiety. We evaluate the importance of using multiple levels of measurement, including physiological and neuroimaging techniques, to study these processes via implicit and explicit tasks. Research that has identified regions of brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as other physiological assessments is integrated into the discussion. The importance of using sophisticated methodological techniques in future studies, such as multiple mediation models, for the purpose of elucidating mechanisms of change during these processes in pregnancy and postpartum is emphasized. We conclude with a discussion of the effect of these processes on maternal psychological functioning and infant outcomes. These processes support a strategy for individualizing treatment for pregnant and postpartum women suffering from depression and anxiety.

40|$|Weight-change across parities and/or current BMI may {{influence}} maternal and fetal morbidity and requires to be differentiated to better inform weight-management guidance. Direction, pattern {{and magnitude of}} weight-change across three consecutive parities and thereby two inter-pregnancy periods was described in 5079 women. The association between inter-pregnancy weight-change versus current BMI and adverse maternal events, SGA-birth and preterm delivery at second and third pregnancy were investigated by logistic regression. More women gained weight across the defined <b>childbearing</b> <b>period</b> than lost it, with ~ 35 % of normal and overweight women gaining sufficient weight to move up a BMI-category. Nine patterns of weight-change were defined across two inter-pregnancy periods and 50 % of women remained weight-stable throughout (within 2 BMI units/period). Women who were overweight/obese at first pregnancy had higher risk of substantial weight-gain and loss (> 10 kg) during each of two inter-pregnancy periods. Inter-pregnancy weight-gain (> 2 BMI units) between first and second pregnancy increased the risk of maternal morbidity (1 or more event of hypertensive disease, caesarean-section, thromboembolism) at second pregnancy, while weight-loss (> 2 BMI units) increased the risk of SGA-birth. Similarly, increased risk of maternal morbidity at the third pregnancy was influenced by weight-gain during both inter-pregnancy periods but not by current BMI-category. Both weight-gain between first and second pregnancy, and being overweight/obese by third pregnancy protected the fetus against SGA-birth whereas weight-loss between second and third pregnancy doubled the SGA risk. Half the women studied exhibited significant weight-fluctuations. This influenced their risk of maternal morbidity and SGA-birth at second and third pregnancy...|$|E
