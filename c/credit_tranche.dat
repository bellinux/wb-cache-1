40|$|In {{the light}} of the events of the recent {{financial}} crisis and of the increased importance of liquidity for the functionality of firms and financial markets, this thesis studies how a lack of liquidity (illiquidity) can affect the prices of credit derivatives and how illiquidity can propagate across credit and equity markets. The thesis incorporates three self-contained research papers. The first paper (Chapter 2) examines the effect of liquidity on the pricing of senior structured and unstructured <b>credit</b> indices (Senior <b>Tranche</b> of CDX. NA. IG Index and AAA Corporate Bond Index) over the period 2006 - 2009. The paper reveals that for both instruments the credit spreads align over time with the returns and the volatility of the equity market and with interest rates, as suggested by the structural model theory (Merton, 1974). However, it also shows that during the subprime crisis the highly-rated tranche of the CDX. NA. IG Index suffered from a substantial discount {{due to the lack of}} depth in the relevant markets, the scarcity of risk-capital, and the high liquidity preference exhibited by investors. By contrast, market liquidity and funding liquidity are found to be less significant in explaining the increase in the spread of the AAA Bond Index. The second paper (Chapter 3) investigates the existence of illiquidity commonality across equity and credit markets and the potential channels that can explain this phenomenon. Illiquidity appears to co-move across equities and credit default swaps in particular over crisis periods. For most firms, illiquidity is transmitted from one market (CDS) to the other (equity). Higher funding costs, market volatility and firms' systematic risk cause the equity-CDS illiquidity commonality to increase. However, the illiquidity commonality is also strongly related to the debt-to-equity hedge ratio which captures the arbitrage linkage between equity and CDSs. The paper shows that the illiquidity contagion across two fundamentally-linked assets can be generated by higher demand of liquidity for hedging and speculative trading. The third paper (Chapter 4) studies possible explanations for the credit spread puzzle. First, the paper shows that the credit spread puzzle can be partially explained by investors' aversion to a firm's extreme losses. The paper implements a novel calibration of the Merton (1974) model to a measure of sensitivity of CDS premia to equity volatility (which captures changes in the fat left tail of the firm's risk-neutral distribution). The predicted CDS premia are higher than those obtained using more traditional calibration methodologies, but still lower than those observed in the market. Therefore, the paper turns to studying the effects of investors' ambiguity aversion and CDS market illiquidity on CDS premia. The results show that when a market is illiquid and uncertainty is greater, sellers of credit default swaps charge more and CDS premia increase...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to quantify the relationship between the global economic environment and the number of Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs). The results suggest that oil prices, world interest rates, and the global business cycle are the most influential indicators that affect the number of SBAs being requested. In addition, the empirical model seems to have reasonable accuracy when predicting SBAs. Furthermore, when oil prices, interest rates, and the global business cycle are adversely shocked by one standard deviation, the conditional probability of a SBA nearly doubles, implying an increase from about six to 12 SBAs. More critically, the model suggests that even a steady deterioration of the global economic climate would imply increasingly harsher conditions for developing and emerging market countries which may in turn significantly increase the demand for IMF resources.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Republic of Congo’s 2003 Article IV Consultation and a New Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). Performance under IMF-supported programs and recent SMPs was disappointing. Major {{progress has been}} made in consolidating security and peace, and in establishing democratic institutions. The public finances deteriorated in 2002, reflecting a combination of expenditure overruns and a drop in non-oil revenue collection. The drop in non-oil revenue was more pronounced at customs, owing to large-scale fraud and widespread use of ad hoc exemptions. As a result, most targets under the 2002 SMP were missed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{two approaches}} to modeling {{the use of}} IMF resources in order to gauge whether the recent decline in credit outstanding is a temporary or a permanent phenomenon. The two approaches-the time series behavior of credit outstanding and a two-stage program selection and access model-yield the same conclusion: the use of IMF resources is likely to decline sharply. Specifically, credit outstanding is projected to decline {{from an average of}} SDR 50 billion over 2000 ? 05 to SDR 8 billion over 2006 ? 10. Stochastic simulations suggest that it is unlikely to be much higher. These results are based on WEO projections with a correction for historically-observed over-optimistic biases. Alternative scenarios assuming a weaker economic performance or a less benign global environment do not alter these results.

Various economic variables including reserve coverage, current account balance to GDP, real GDP growth, macroeconomic stability, and terms of trade shocks {{are found to be}} significant determinants of Fund financing. Moreover, global conditions, including changes in real oil and non-oil commodity prices and world trade, are also significant. Therefore, the demand for Fund financing by LICs is likely to be cyclical in response to common shocks with its intensity depending on the severity and persistence of adverse shocks.
