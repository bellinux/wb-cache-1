50|$|By {{adjusting}} the ultrasonic {{frequency of the}} device, {{it is possible to}} cut hard tissue while leaving soft tissue untouched by the process. The ultrasonic frequency is modulated from 10, 30, and 60 cycles/s (Hz) to 29 kHz. The low frequency enables cutting of mineralized structures, not soft tissue. Power can be adjusted from 2.8 to 16 W, with preset power settings for various types of bone density. The tip vibrates within a range of 60-200 µm, which allows <b>clean</b> <b>cutting</b> with precise incisions.

30|$|The triterpanes (Fig.  3 b) and steranes (Fig.  3 c) {{fractions}} of oil-based drilling mud show slightly higher retention time compared to regular molecular compounds. The deviated retention times in drilling fluids {{can also be}} used as a proxy to recognize the degree of contamination in <b>cleaned</b> rock <b>cuttings</b> (Brocks et al. 2003; Shang et al. 2006; Reddy et al. 2007). The mixing of residual heavier components (e.g., asphalt/gilsonite, barium sulfate, and artificial additives) can cause higher retention times after each regular homologue, as shown by the triterpanes (Fig.  3 b) and steranes (Fig.  3 c) fractions in oil-based drilling mud. Consequently, the reduction of retention times in <b>cleaned</b> rock <b>cuttings</b> can generally indicate cleansing of contaminants in the triterpanes and steranes fractions.|$|R

30|$|The {{contamination}} {{effect is}} negligible for the triterpanes fractions in <b>cleaned</b> rock <b>cuttings,</b> as discussed above. In addition, oil-based drilling mud could not elute {{in the same}} analytical window of the main C 29, C 30 and C 31 hopane peaks (Fig.  3 b). Specifically, the 22 S/(22 S[*]+[*] 22 R) ratio of the C 31 17 α hopanes can {{be recognized as a}} commonly used biomarker proxy indicating thermal maturity (Farrimond et al. 1998; Pan et al. 2008; Ratnayake and Sampei 2015 a). In this study, analytical results indicate that the maturity-indicating biomarker proxy was not affected in the cleaned rock-cutting samples (Fig.  3 b). However, analytical problems remain in the steranes fraction due to coelution. In particular, the C 28 - 20 R sterane peak of indigenous hydrocarbon can partially overlap remaining drilling mud and oil peaks within a single peak (Fig.  3 c). In addition, it is difficult to isolate the proportion of indigenous and artificial components in the C 28 - 20 R sterane homologue. Consequently, results for sterane biomarkers can create misleading quantitative estimates of biological precursors in the reference C 27 –C 28 –C 29 sterane ternary diagram (e.g., Huang and Meinschein 1979). However, in the solvent <b>cleaned</b> <b>cutting</b> samples, this effect does not influence determination of thermal maturity using the ratio of C 29 sterane 20 S/(20 S[*]+[*] 20 R) (Ratnayake and Sampei 2015 b).|$|R

40|$|Declines in banana (Musa spp.) {{productivity}} in western Kenya since 2006 have been exacerbated by Xanthomonas wilt, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum. This study provided insight of household dynamics influencing efforts {{to eradicate the}} disease from Ugunja, Lunjre, Sidindi and Sigomere. Surveyed households (N = 120) were purposively selected from villages with and without banana-based farmer field schools (FFS).

40|$|Problem statement: Protein {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} nutritional problems in the developing world. The most disastrous consequences occur in children where protein malnutrition manifests itself in forms of two notorious diseases: Marasmus and kwashiorkor. Expansion of present agricultural practices into marginal lands is expected to solve this chronic protein shortage. The process of photosynthesis is the only non depletable protein source and can supply some essential amino acids as well as provide adequate nitrogen in the diet for synthesis of non essential amino acids in addition to vitamins and minerals. Approach: The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional values of common plant leaves and determine the feasibility of using them as a protein supplement. Six plants were cultivated and tested for their nutritional quality: amaranth, cowpea, sugar been, pumpkin, sweet potato and cabbage. Results: Pumpkin leaves recorded the highest protein yield (11. 75 %) followed by amaranth (10. 5 %) The protein contents in the leaves of sweet potato, cowpea, cabbage and sugar been were much lower (7. 85, 6. 95, 5. 60 and 3. 45 %, respectively). Conclusion: Except for sugar bean, all plants had higher extractable protein content than cabbage. Proper use of the growing season can achieve high protein yield. <b>Clean</b> <b>cutting</b> will ensure that the leaves do not deteriorate within a few hours when kept in cool place and freezing leaves can improve protein extractability. The test plants should be given a trial as protein sources for human. Plant leaves have vitamins, minerals and essential amino acids and when consumed in adequate amounts they can supplement protein especially in areas where the environment is very hostile to livestock keeping or where fish protein is lacking. The optimum harvest age, fertilizer requirements and the possibility of combining two or more plants together to improve protein content should be studied.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{consumers}} may not <b>clean</b> <b>cutting</b> boards properly between preparation of raw and cooked meat. Cutting boards may therefore act as sources for contamination of cooked meat or other ready-to-eat foods with pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. The aim of the work was to investigate if cutting boards containing the antimicrobial compound triclosan can reduce the viability of bacteria, thus acting as a hygiene barrier. Survival and growth of food pathogens and spoilage bacteria on two cutting boards without antimicrobials and a commercial cutting board containing triclosan were tested. No difference in bacterial counts on cutting boards without and with triclosan was found after exposure to naturally contaminated chicken filets for one hour. Pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were inoculated on coupons (6. 7 - 7. log per coupon) of cutting boards and incubated at 25 °C at controlled relative humidity for 24 and 72. h. At a relative humidity of 100 %, growth of Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Serrratia spp. was observed and no antibacterial effect of the triclosan-containing board was found except for against Listeria monocytogenes. At lower humidity (70 % RH) less growth was found on the triclosan-containing cutting board than untreated boards after 24. h. After 72. h of incubation, cell counts were reduced on triclosan-containing boards, with the most pronounced antibacterial effects observed against Salmonella, S. aureus and CNS. For S. aureus and Salmonella it was found that when a lower initial cell count was applied (3. 5. log per coupon), the triclosan-containing board had an antibacterial effect under humid conditions, as well as a more pronounced antibacterial effect under dry conditions. An agar overlay assay showed that triclosan migrated out of the coupons. Repeated washing of the triclosan-containing cutting boards reduced the antibacterial effect, thus the amount of triclosan available on the surface seemed to be limited. In conclusion, using triclosan-containing cutting boards as a hygienic barrier may only work under certain conditions (low humidity, long exposure time, and clean conditions) and not against all genera of bacteria. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted {{over two years}} (in 2004 and 2005) at the research station of the National Institute of Agricultural Study and Research (INERA) in Mvuazi, Bas-Congo province to determine the incidence of the cassava mosaic disease (CMD) {{in relation to the}} source of planting material and its impact on cassava yield. In the first year, two treatments were assessed, (1) healthy cuttings obtained from plots managed with phytosanitation through rouging and, (2) cuttings collected at random from a farmer-managed cassava field. Three cassava varieties were used in the study: Boma, a local cultivar susceptible to CMD, RAV, an improved variety moderately resistant, and Mahungu, which has a high level of resistance. A third treatment was added to the trial in the second year and was constituted of cuttings free from CMD symptoms, collected from the plots where healthy cuttings were planted in the first year. The results indicated that the use of healthy cuttings prevents the crop from primary CMD infections, delays the development of the disease and reduces its incidence. Disease incidence reached 100 % of diseased plants at only 4 months after planting (MAP) for the susceptible variety Boma in plots planted with cuttings from farmer –managed plots, and at 7 MAP in plots planted with healthy cuttings from fields managed with phytosanitation. On the moderately resistant variety RAV, the disease reached 100 % of the plants at 5 MAP in plots planted with farmer’s cuttings, while in plots with healthy cuttings, the final incidence was 60. 7 % at 10 MAP. For the resistant variety Mahungu, disease incidence was 78, 1 % and 10 % at 10 MAP, respectively on plants from farmer’s cuttings and on those from healthy cuttings. In the second year, the trend of the results was {{similar to that of the}} first year. The development of the disease and the final incidence were lower on the resistant variety Mahungu in all the treatments in both years of the study, indicating that the resistant variety is the best solution for a sustainable CMD management. The use of <b>clean</b> <b>cuttings</b> also substantially improved the growth of the plants as well as the yield of tuberous roots on all the three varieties used in the experiment.

Consequently, removal of contaminants is an essential task for interpretation of source rock properties using the rock-cutting samples.

30|$|Geochemical {{data from}} {{rock-cutting}} samples can {{give rise to}} faulty interpretations due to contamination from drilling fluids used in modern deepwater petroleum exploration. In this study, oil-based drilling contaminants were removed by solvent extraction with dichloromethane and methanol (9 : 1) solution. Bulk and molecular organic geochemical characteristics were examined for both oil-based drilling mud and cleaned rock-cutting samples. Total organic carbon (TOC) values are notably high in heavy liquid oil-based drilling mud mixtures (TOC[*]=[*] 21.4 – 63.3 %, average[*]=[*] 34.6 % ± 8.6) compared to <b>cleaned</b> rock <b>cuttings</b> (TOC[*]=[*] 0.4 – 1.5 %, average[*]=[*] 0.8 % ± 0.3). In addition, drilling mud mixtures contain higher concentrations of unresolved complex mixtures (UCM) in the n-alkanes fraction. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} distinguish individual homologues in the n-alkanes fraction. The triterpanes also have relatively high UCM contents compared to steranes fractions. However, hydrocarbon homologues can be identified in both the triterpanes and steranes fractions of oil-based drilling mud mixtures. Gas chromatograms indicate that the n-alkanes fractions of rock <b>cuttings</b> initially <b>cleaned</b> with solvent still show considerable contamination from drilling fluids. This remaining contamination was removed by an additional cleaning step using the soxhlet extraction technique. The triterpanes fraction in solvent-cleaned rock cuttings does not contain an overprint of heavy liquid oil-based drilling mud contamination. However, solvent-cleaned rock cuttings may still retain contamination signatures at the sterane C 28 - 20 R homologue due to coelution. The geochemical overprint of contaminants in the <b>cleaned</b> rock <b>cuttings</b> can be interpreted as infiltration of lower molecular weight compounds into micro-cracks of the cuttings. The distribution of these molecules varies in each hydrocarbon fraction. Therefore, close inspection of contamination effects is required before interpretation of traditional organic geochemical proxies such as source rock characteristics and maturity.|$|R
