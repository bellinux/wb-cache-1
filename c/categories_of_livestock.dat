40|$|Livestock {{farms are}} among those {{agricultural}} activities considered more environmentally risky, and on which {{it is possible to}} act at different levels, improving the management in order to lower the environ-mental impact. Therefore, the principles of the Environmental Management Systems, provided for in some binding regulations (Directive CE 96 / 61) and some voluntary standards (ISO 14001, EMAS), have to be applied. For this purpose it is necessary that the livestock farmers perform an analysis of their actual management systems and an evaluation of possible critical points of the production activity. Structural aspects <b>of</b> the <b>livestock</b> farm and, above all, the housing and the manure management systems, represent a focal point of this analysis. However, the adoption of a single technique should be evaluated in the gene-ral context of the farm. In order to give a contribution in this direction, a first tool for an integrated eva-luation of actual situations and possible improvement obtainable by applying BAT has been devised and implemented in a software programme.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of emergency housing of cattle in the emergency planning zone of Temelín Nuclear Power Plant. 20 farmers, each keeping at least 50 bovine animals, were selected in the area of interest. The cattle were chosen as the reference species <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> because it was the largest <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> kept in the stable and pasture. The research was carried out {{in the form of a}} structured questionnaire, which was sent to the individual respondents after this was agreed by phone. It should answer the question whether the emergency housing of cattle in the emergency planning zone of Temelín Nuclear Power Station is sufficiently secured. The results show that emergency housing is not the priority of farmers, because only 55 % of the respondents sent back completed questionnaires. Most of them, i. e. 64 %, bred cattle in stable and grazing, 27 % in stable only and 9 % were exclusively grazing. In addition to grazing, preserved fodder (silage, haylage, hay) are mainly used for feeding and water from underground sources and from a water supply network for watering where all these sources can be protected against radioactive fallout. It was also found that electricity was used for watering. Upon its failure, except for two cases, no emergency power supply were available. Electric fences around the pastures were not equipped with emergency power supply, except for two respondents. Alarm Plan of Veterinary Measures (within the frame of Temelín Nuclear Power Plant's external emergency plan) requires feeding and watering for 3 days during the absence of the cattlemen. This requirement cannot be fulfilled due to the limited capacity of mangers in the stables. The results of the research show that it is not possible to carry out the hermetization of buildings according to the requirement of the above mentioned plan because they cannot be sealed with respect to their open construction. These results can be used to modify the alarm plan of veterinary measures, which should further be provided to the agricultural public...|$|R

And more robust and more dynamic agricultural growth could significantly boost sustainable economic growth and rural development in those countries. An appropriate avenue for improving agricultural growth is to expand agricultural exports in MENA countries with appreciable-to-large agricultural sectors and comparative advantage in cereal grains, agricultural raw materials, fruits and vegetables, and many <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> and dairy products. But high levels of protection in many MENA countries, especially for manufactures and some food products, contribute to overvalued exchange rates and a significant bias against agriculture.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} man and livestock through the examination <b>of</b> the <b>livestock</b> classification system and naming of individual animals among the Turkana, northwestern Kenya. In the Turkana's management system, livestock are treated as classes according to their attributes based on the classification system. The notion of distinct individuality is irrelevant {{to this kind of}} treatment. On the other hand, individual identification <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> is indispensable not only to the livestock management, but also to maintaining the human social relationship, which is mediated by livestock transfer. The former aspect is examined through analyzing livestock classification system. In the Turkana's classification system, a stress is put on the five domains: age-sex, coat color, horn shape, ear shape including ear markings, and brand marks. The management techniques relevant to producing <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> the <b>livestock</b> are described and analyzed. The method is described to check the presence of the members of a herd (195 goats) which are managed together in day-trip herding. The total herd is divided into several small units, and the members of each unit are checked one by one. The Turkana selectively apply several attributes <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> for the unit formation. This division of the herd can be regarded as a livestock classification in a specific situation. After being divided into units, all the individuals are checked one by one. In this checking, livestock are treated as classes by being divided into small units, and also as distinctive individuals be being checked one by one. The aspect <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> individuality is examined through the giving of individual names. The Turkana give proper names to all the parous females which are milked. Etymologies of 350 names are examined. All names refer to certain attributes of the named subjects. While livestock have many attributes, only one attribute is referred to in most names. The significance of individual identification in pastoral societies is discussed. It is important functionally, because people should make the pairs of mother and offspring encounter after the separation during a day-trip herding, for milking the mother and for the offspring's nutrition. Individual identification <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> has close connection also with the social relationships which are created and sustained by livestock transfer. Each transfer can be regarded as distinctive only when each transferred individual is identified as an irreplaceable unique animal. Livestock individuality is discussed also in relation to the identification between man and cattle in East African pastoral societies...|$|R

The total economic value approach was used, and the valuation techniques applied are a combination of stated and revealed preference methods. Since the impacts of P. juliflora are both tangible and intangible, combining revealed and stated preference methods ensures that measurements of prices are drawn from the actual financial setting and welfare measurements are less prone to bias (Adamowicz et al. 1994, 1997; Earnhart 2001). In using stated preference techniques, households were asked to subjectively state the quantities {{and the value of}} environmental goods generated from Prosopis as shown below. In addition, pastoralists were asked to state the number of animals affected in the previous year, number of animals that died or were slaughtered, and to estimate the loss in weight as well as milk production that they attributed to the invasion of P. juliflora. This information was collected for each of six <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock.</b> For products that are traded in the market like milk and meat weights, the revealed preference method was used.|$|E

Therefore, in this paper, shows {{the change in the}} number of livestock by type and category. Fluctuations in the number of cattle in the period 1964 - 2005, primarily the result of economic factors, such as reduced local and regional markets, low purchasing power, transition, privatization, lack of long-term development strategy for livestock, technological and technical unwillingness processing facilities, primary production disorganization, poor farmers and processors association, insufficient and slow recovery racial composition of cattle. Applying the method of alternating splitter Systems 6 / 6 in 1964, we have found in northeastern Montenegro, type with a dominant share of sheep and cattleshare (O 5 G 1), who in 2005 was gradually transformed into a type with equal participation of sheep and cattle(O 3 G 3).

30|$|In Fig.  3, {{the sample}} is divided into four <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> type. Cattle farms (Fig.  3) showed {{generally}} lower values, in particular for meat production. These are often large farms that are not interested {{and do not have}} the necessary conditions to diversify production and to develop systems of short chain and related activities. In the CS_ 2 component (short food supply chain and related activities), they reached an overall score of 19 and 20, respectively, for milk and meat production, while poultry achieved 29.5 out of 50. This is probably because their product types are often sold to only a few large clients. On the contrary, pigs and especially poultry farms achieved the highest average values in almost all components, because of the diversification of production and income and the greater ability to offer sales services and other social functions. Similar results were noticed in the CS_ 3 component (work). This is probably due to the higher level of multifunctionality of these farms, rather than a greater demand for workers with livestock, that leads to a higher contribution to employment. On the other hand, the CS_ 4 (ethical and human development) and the CS_ 5 (society, culture and ecology) components are characterized by higher scores in the cattle, particularly for milk production, and the pig samples. This result is rather interesting and suggests the need for further evaluation. The fact that the high level of knowledge requested for these types of systems could also influence education and culture or that, traditionally, these farmers are more involved in innovation processes are only two of many potential interpretations.|$|E

We report on the response of sheep and pig farmers in England to promotion of these practices. A conceptual framework was established from research on factors influencing adoption of animal health practices, linking knowledge, attitudes, social influences and perceived constraints to the implementation of specific practices. Qualitative data were collected from nine sheep and six pig enterprises in 2011. Thematic analysis explored attitudes and responses to the proposed practices, and factors influencing the likelihood of implementation. Most feel they are doing all they can reasonably do to minimise disease risk and that practices not being implemented are either not relevant or ineffective. There is little awareness and concern about risk from unseen threats. Pig farmers place more emphasis than sheep farmers on controlling wildlife, staff and visitor management and staff training. The main factors that influence livestock farmers’ decision on whether or not to implement a specific disease risk measure are: attitudes to, and perceptions of, disease risk; attitudes towards the specific measure and its efficacy; characteristics of the enterprise which they perceive as making a measure impractical; previous experience of a disease or of the measure; and the credibility of information and advice. Great importance is placed on access to authoritative information with most seeing vets as the prime source to interpret generic advice from national bodies in the local context. Uptake of disease risk measures could be increased by: improved risk communication through the farming press and vets to encourage farmers to recognise hidden threats; dissemination of credible early warning information to sharpen farmers’ assessment of risk; and targeted information through training events, farming press, vets and other advisers, and farmer groups, tailored to the different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> farmer...|$|E

While external knowledge has been instrumental in defining the drivers and effects of ecological changes hitherto, the role of local knowledge is becoming increasingly important in explaining factors that inform user community perceptions and guide their decisions on the use of rangeland resources. Data on community perceptions were collected in four villages, using Participatory Rural Appraisals in each village and household surveys with a total of 104 households. This study showed that user communities in Nkayi district differentiate rangelands among seven <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> feed resources and how these have changed over time. Communities viewed rangelands not as one continuous, designated and specialized land parcel, but differentiated the land by location, productivity, management and uses in different times of the year. Although land use changes affecting these livestock feed resources were considered to be widespread and multi-directional (both negative and positive) they did not cause widespread degradation. Rangelands converted to croplands were not completely lost, but became important dual purpose land parcels fulfilling both household food security needs and dry season livestock feed requirements. The importance of croplands as a feed resource is reflected in the emergence of new institutions governing their use for livestock grazing and to guarantee security of tenure. On the other hand institutions governing the use of common property rangelands decreased or weakened in their application. The study concludes that while this situation presents ecological challenges for the rangelands, it offers opportunities to find innovative ways of utilizing croplands as the new frontier in the provision of dry season feed resources to smallholder farmers in highly variable environments. Implications for livestock water productivity need to be investigated and water saving technologies should be promoted in the land use intensification processes...|$|E

40|$|In India oats can {{be grown}} as fodder crops on all soils, apart from {{alkaline}} or waterlogged conditions, in all regions where wheat and barley are grown. It is mostly grown as winter crop. In addition, oats are quick growing, palatable, succulent and nutritious and acceptable to all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock.</b> It can be fed in many forms such as green forage, straw, silage, and grains. With {{the introduction of new}} management systems (proper amounts of manure and fertilizers, multicut cultivars, better combinations such as oats + vetch and oats + peas) both commercial dairy farmers and resource-poor farmers have greatly reduced the feed shortage problem during the dry winter months as well as achieving a 30 % reduction in the cost of feed. Besides growing fodder oats as sole crop, oats + vetch is the best mixture for high yields and improved soil fertility. For resource-poor farmers, oat cultivars Canadian and Kent are recommended and a combination of oats + vetch. The general nutrient management practice is application of FYM at the rate of 5 ton/ha by broadcast uniformly and another ploughing done. 80 : 60 : 40 kg (N: P 2 O 5 : K 20) is the recommended fertilizer rate, where N was used in three split doses, applied after each cut under irrigated conditions. Otherwise it was applied as one basal dose under rainfed conditions. After sowing, a land leveler was used to ensure good seed contact with soil. To optimize the fertilizer requirement, various trials were conducted under All India Coordinate Fodder Research Project. Application of 120 kg/ha resulted higher green fodder yield of 30 t/ha. To get a maximum possible yield application of 60 kg Sulphur/ ha along with recommended dose of fertilizer can be restored. Fodder oats is also cultivated in cropping sequences like Rice-Cowpea-oats and ricesorghum- oats. Application of 75 % of recommended fertilizer along with FYM (5 t/ha) recorded maximum rice equivalent yield of 40 t/ha in the case of rice-cowpea-oats cropping sequence. So, oats has the potential to serve as an important winter fodder crop in India during winter season. With good nutrient management it can potentially provides more and better fodder from the same unit of land than the traditionally grown winter wheat. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|E
40|$|The {{project was}} {{formulated}} {{as a result}} of a request made by the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) of Azania, a National Liberation Movement recognized by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), to UNDP. It followed the completion of another UNDP-assisted project, Self-Reliance in Food Production (DP/PAC/ 82 / 004) which assisted in the development of agricultural production on 40 hectares (ha) of land that the Government of Tanzania had allocated to the PAC for settlement. The main objective of the project was to assist the PAC to develop self-sufficiency in food production for 4 000 of its members at the Masuguru-Kitonga settlement in Tanzania. The experience so gained was also intended to contribute towards preparing PAC members for agricultural production responsibilities when they ultimately returned to South Africa. The project helped develop some 415 ha of agricultural farmland with cereals, horticultural crops and livestock, and train cadres in various agricultural disciplines. The total intended land area of 415 ha was developed for crop, livestock and poultry production, as well as for human settlement. Funds were provided by UNDP for the purchase of agricultural inputs including farm machinery and equipment, project vehicles, and for the training of PAC members in agricultural institutions in Tanzania. The main constraints to implementation proved to be the scarcity of trained PAC manpower, with those members trained by the project often leaving the project for South Africa and Zimbabwe; persistent droughts which affected crop yields; the incidence of tse-tse fly in the area; the destruction of crops by wild animals; the inadequacy of farm machinery; and the inaccessibility of the project site in the rainy season. The project played a very useful role in providing productive employment for members of the PAC in Tanzania. The skills that were imparted to project staff will be of long-term value, whether they remain abroad, or return to their home country following developments there. Considerable capital investments have been made in the farm-site, where production capacity, particularly for poultry, is now well established. In the event that PAC now leaves the site, it is recommended that steps be taken to maintain the site and structures in working order. Sufficient managerial staff will also need to be assigned. On the basis of results obtained from the project, it is now recommended that emphasis be placed on rice, sorghum and sunflower production, since these crops do very well in the area, with the aim also of increasing productivity levels through the use of improved varieties and good crop husbandry and land use practices. Provision should also be made for irrigation facilities to cover those cropping areas, especially of rice and maize, that are adversely affected by low rainfall levels. The project site is also ideal for poultry production which should be encouraged. Brood housing facilities should be improved, and a cage or battery system, introduced for egg production. Except for the problem of tse-tse fly infestation, livestock production in general is promising; as such, the breeding stock of all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> could be augmented by purchasing more from established farms. Serious consideration should also be given to pasture improvement programmes. The tse-tse fly problem can be controlled relatively easily by using prophylactic drugs like Samorin, and Novidium for treatment purposes...|$|E

Suburban production differs from rural livestock production, in particular by the actors involved, the economic orientation of production {{as well as by the}} availability of resources and production factors (services, inputs, land and capital). This context leads to the search for genetic resources favourable to this environment production, allowing for an optimisation of the activity. This implies a specific management of these resources. However, there is no information on how farmers in the suburban area manage their sheep genetic resources and on the sustainability of this management. Aiming to fill this information gap, this work focuses on (i) the characteristics of sheep farms in Ouagadougou suburbs and in neighbouring rural areas, (ii) the sheep traits, that have an impact on the their price, and finally (iii) the relative importance of some traits in the choice of breeding ram by breeders. In order to characterise sheep farming in the suburban area of Ouagadougou in terms of socio-economic motivations, breeding practices, including genetic resources management, and in order to better understand the dynamics of the sector, a survey was conducted among 80 breeders in the area. The results showed that the sector essentially comprises two <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock,</b> with almost half (42. 5 %) of the breeders who can be described as traditional livestock keepers. The latter breeders are illiterate at 94. 1 % and have no non-agricultural economic activities (88. 2 %). They don’t have sheltered enclosures (70. 6) and their sheep don’t receive systematic deworming (61. 8 %). They keep Mossi sheep (88. 2 %) and their main selection objective is rusticity (64. 7 %). The other category includes 50 % of the livestock keepers. These tend to intensify production through the use of better infrastructures (enclosures, shelters), better feeding and systematic de-worming of animals (87. 5 %). They report keeping animals for generation of additional income and they practice crossbreeding. Their main selection objective is to improve the young growth and adult weight. Reproduction is generally characterised by a lack of mating control, especially during the dry season when the animals are allowed to graze freely. This phenomenon, in the context of the practice of crossbreeding by some breeders, creates negative externalities for breeders preferring the purity of their herd for rusticity motives. This also undermines the sustainability of the systems by an uncontrolled increase in the share of Fulani genetics in herds and the loss of sources of Mossi pure breed. To investigate the possibility for the rural area to constitute a source for purebred Mossi sheep for the suburban area, another survey was conducted among 63 livestock keepers in the region of the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso. This study showed that sheep in this area are kept in sedentary systems and the Mossi sheep is the most encountered. A selective breeding strategy can be found for all breeders through the choice of males. The most cited selection objectives were the improvement of the adult weight (84. 1 %), the young growth (79. 4 %) and the maintenance of the rusticity (73 %). In agreement with their goal of improving the weight and growth of animals, Mossi sheep females are often crossed with Fulani ram. These males are eliminated from the herd after the birth of the first crossbred lambs, while the latter are subsequently used for breeding. By removing the Fulani males after a short period of use, management appears to be better mastered and more sustainable compared to the suburban area, but leads to reconsider the notion of "purebred" in the region, as the management of breeders includes the mixed use of available breeds. However, with regard to the use of this area as a source of replacement females, if farmers appear to be willing to sell females to other farmers, the size of their herds doesn’t allow the sale of large numbers because of their own replacement needs. Added to this is the tendency expressed by some farmers to only sell to farmers they know, in hopes of reciprocity, hence for social rather than commercial motives. Consumer market demand for different phenotypic traits was investigated through a monitoring of market transactions (revealed preference surveys) and surveys among sheep exporters and butchers. A total of 338 transactions were monitored over three different periods (the Muslim Eid al-Adha feast period, Christmas and New Year period and a neutral period). The interviews involved 25 exporters and 15 butchers, who were asked about the characteristics of the animals quested for and their purchase localities. Survey results showed that exporters have preferences for large-framed and good body conditions animals while local butchers mark their preferences for small-framed and low-fitness animals. Markets are categorised into collection, assembly and terminal markets through which animals pass before reaching the final consumer. The revealed preferences have shown that phenotypic traits such as coat colour, weight and height at the withers have a highly significant (p< 0. 001) influence on prices. The weight has shown a non-linear, increasing influence on prices with increasing marginal income per kg of live weight. The purchase period, which is embedded with the purchase motive, also showed a highly significant (p< 0. 001) influence on prices, showing a superiority of the prices during the Eid al-Adha, but no difference between prices during the Christmas and New Year period and the neutral periods. Finally, the purchase period and coat colour showed highly significant interactions with the weight, the white-coloured animals and the Eid al-Adha period having better valorised the increase in weight. This study sheds light on the links between markets and demands for a certain orientation of sheep genetic resources. It is suggested, for example, that an improvement on the basis of higher weight and white colour criteria, which are more valued on the market, would rather favour a niche market linked to feasts periods and exports, and some breeders benefiting improved livestock resources. On the contrary, an improvement towards rusticity for small-framed animals would supply a more ordinary market, contributing to food security of households and an income generation for a wider range of sheep producers. In this market context, a final study aimed at highlighting the trade-off that breeders are willing to make for the improvement of the different traits, whether "productive" or "adaptive". A stated choice experience, taking into account the traits such as weight, colour, susceptibility to diseases and the feed requirement, was carried out with 137 breeders. These farmers mainly use natural grazing (82. 5 % of the farmers involved). Crossbreeding is observed in 23. 4 % of farmers. The highest willingness to pay (WTP) was observed for resistance to diseases with 261 €. However, among the farmer practicing crossbreeding, there was an apparent preference for susceptibility to disease with a WTP of 45 €. A significant WTP was also revealed for the white coat colour (21 €) then preferred to the bicoloured. The preference for large-framed animals compared to medium-framed ones was significant but relatively lower than preferences for white coat colour and resistance to diseases. On the other hand, farmers showed indifference for the transition from the medium body size to the small body size. For all traits, farmers practicing crossbreeding showed a preference for extreme levels compared to intermediate levels. Two trends emerged from this study: on the one hand, farmers willing to take the risk of reducing resistance to diseases in order to increase productivity; on the other hand, those with greater risk aversion, strongly willing to spend to gain resistance to diseases. The case of crossbreeding farmers suggests an interesting double preference, demonstrating a WTP for opposed traits being considered as typical of one breed or the other, then depreciating the intermediate traits indicating the possibility of a crossbred. All the studies indicate that the management of sheep genetic resources in Ouagadougou's suburban area, although it does not really present threats to the different breeds in its present state, nevertheless shows signs, particularly from the market, that could hamper the sustained use of small-framed and environmentally adapted sheep. It is therefore necessary to find a strategy to better organise this management to make it sustainable. The establishment of a terminal crossbreeding scheme involving suburban and rural livestock farmers is a possible strategy. This nevertheless requires truly commercial livestock at the end of the scheme and means to overcome certain constraints raised in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|Background: What are the {{key factors}} that {{contribute}} to household-level food security? What lessons can we learn from food secure households? What agricultural options and management strategies are likely to benefit female-headed households in particular? This paper addresses these questions using a unique dataset of 600 households that allows us to explore a wide range of indicators capturing different aspects of performance and well-being for different types of households-female-headed, male-headed, food secure, food insecure-and assess livelihoods options and strategies and how they influence food security. The analysis is based on a detailed farm household survey carried out in three sites in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Results: Our results suggest that food insecurity may not be more severe for female-headed households than male-headed households. We found that food secure farming households have a wider variety of crops on their farms and are more market oriented than are the food insecure. More domestic assets do not make female-headed households more food secure. For the other <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> assets (<b>livestock,</b> transport, and productive), we did not find evidence of a correlation with food security. Different livelihood portfolios are being pursued by male versus female-headed households, with female-headed households less likely to grow high-value crops and {{more likely to have a}} less diversified crop portfolio. Conclusions: These findings help identify local, national and regional policies and actions for enhancing food security of female-headed as well as male-headed households. These include interventions that improve households' access to information, e. g., though innovative communication and knowledge-sharing efforts and support aimed at enhancing women's and men's agricultural market opportunities...|$|R

40|$|Sri Lanka is a {{tropical}} {{island in the}} Indian Ocean. Due to its geographical location and position, {{most parts of the}} country are hot and humid. Based on the annual rainfall, elevation, soil and on terrain condition, 46 agro-ecological zones could be identified within the island. The farming systems widely vary according to the agro-ecological conditions prevailing in different areas of the country. In order to meet various human needs such as food and draught power, farm animals have been used throughout the country. In Sri Lanka few species of animals are raised as farm animals including four major mammalian species, namely neat cattle, buffaloes, pigs and goats. Chicken is the most common avian species reared. Other than these species several other livestock and avian species such as sheep, rabbit, duck and quails are also raised under different environment and management systems. Agriculture is an important sector in the country where 30 % of the land area is used for agriculture, most of which are smallholdings. In this context however, livestock plays a secondary role where crop cultivation is the dominant sector. The contribution <b>of</b> the <b>livestock</b> sector to the national GDP is 1. 2 % whereas that of total agriculture sector is 5. 6 %. According to the value of representation in GDP livestock plays a minor role though, it provides a source of occupation for a considerable population in the rural sub-sector of the country. The farm animals in Sri Lanka can be categorized into three major groups namely locally adapted and recently introduces and continually imported breeds. Out <b>of</b> the three <b>categories,</b> locally adapted breeds are the most threatened as their populations are gradually decreasing. Among the factors contributing to this diminishing trend, lack of information on the proper evaluation of local breeds is the main factor. Wild relatives of three major farm animal species, namely buffalo, pig and chicken inhabit the wildlife protected areas and the surroundings. Other than those wild species the wild relatives of quails and ducks could also be found in scrub jungles {{in all parts of the}} country. In the case of buffaloes and pigs, there is definite gene flow from the wild relatives to domesticated indigenous varieties in certain localities where there is a direct contact between wild relatives and domestic animals. In the case of jungle fowl, which is endemic to Sri Lanka there are no concrete evidence for such an interaction in breeding. Generally, most of the breeds of farm animals are widely distributed all over the country. However, population density is not even in all the provinces. Pigs are mostly found in the western coast of the country. Buffaloes are distributed in lowland areas and highly dense in central part of the country. The distribution of cattle is very distinct as the European pure breeds and their crossbreds are distributed in central hills and wet area of the country whereas exotic tropical crosses and indigenous varieties are found in dry lowland areas. Comparatively higher number of goats is found in dry lowlands, mostly in remote rural areas. Comparatively higher number of goats is found in dry lowlands, mostly in remote rural areas. The pattern of distribution of poultry is highly influenced by the number of commercial type birds. However, village chickens (the indigenous types) are found throughout the island under backyard system <b>of</b> rearing. Since <b>livestock</b> is an integral component in the agriculture sector of the country several livestock production systems could be identified. In most of these production systems, livestock is represented as a co-component or subcomponent within the system since the whole production system is crop based, mainly paddy. The role <b>of</b> the <b>livestock</b> in these farming systems vary according to the level of input <b>of</b> the <b>livestock</b> for the whole system and nature of service that it provides for the sustainability of the system. When the change of population size of different farm animal species is considered, the records of past few years demonstrate diminishing trends in almost all the major species except poultry. In the case of chicken and ducks the trends is towards slight increase. However, there are no separate statistics available for any of the indigenous species, hence the population trends <b>of</b> this <b>category</b> cannot be assessed or quantified. However, the general perception is that the indigenous categories are shrinking or phasing out gradually. The indigenous livestock categories posses many valuable characteristics such as high adaptability, high resistance to common disease, high fecundity, early maturity, good mothering ability, longivity etc. Ability to produce at low input level is the most unique feature demonstrated by all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> indigenous <b>livestock.</b> However, the preference of the farmer demonstrated by all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> indigenous <b>livestock.</b> However, the preference of the farmer towards indigenous livestock categories depends mainly on two factors, namely availability of resources and availability of marketing opportunities. There are many risks factors operating against the sustainability and the survival <b>of</b> the indigenous <b>livestock</b> <b>categories.</b> These factors include the pressure for high productivity/ high output levels, agricultural development/ settlement schemes, change of farming systems, fluctuation of market values, shrinkage of habitats, and change of systems of farming / farm operations and war and natural disasters. The present status and, trends in population size and utilization pattern <b>of</b> indigenous <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> farm animals reveal that the indigenous animals need a far better attention and consideration at national level development and planning programs than at present...|$|R
