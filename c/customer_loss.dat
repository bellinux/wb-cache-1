30|$|Customer {{win-back}} is {{a cognitive}} process of satisfaction changing {{from a low}} level to a high level with service recovery strategies as the stimulus. Because prior research tends to view service recovery strategies as a static antecedent, {{it is difficult to}} analyze and observe how the recovery strategies affect satisfaction and repurchase intention dynamically. Moreover, not enough attention has been directed to the relationship between reasons of <b>customer</b> <b>loss</b> and recovery strategies. This research conducted a field experiment involving a 2 × 2 between-subjects design (defects of service attitude and unfair price × tangible recovery and intangible recovery strategies). From a longitudinal and dynamic perspective, this study has produced the following key results: First, there are significant differences in satisfaction and purchase intention between the four groups categorized by specific reasons of <b>customer</b> <b>loss.</b> Second, recovery strategies may have non-linear effects on customer’s satisfaction. Lastly, based on the prospect theory and disappointment theory, we discuss important managerial implications of the function curves fitted between customer satisfactory (before <b>customer</b> <b>loss</b> and after implementation of customer winback strategy) and purchase intention.|$|E

40|$|The {{selection}} of optimum process target {{has become one}} of the focused research areas to increase productivity and improve product quality. Although the quality engineering literature contains a vast collection of work related to this issue, a couple of questions still remain unanswered. First, a quality loss function approach using conventional quality loss functions, such as step-loss and Taguchi loss functions, has been extensively used to determine the optimum process target mainly due to mathematical convenience. When historical data concerning a <b>customer</b> <b>loss</b> associated with product performance are available, a quality loss function using a well-established statistical method, such as regression analysis, may be a more practical alternative procedure. Second, many researchers have carried out their studies based on a single quality characteristic. From the customer's viewpoint, however, products are often judged based on more than one characteristic. To address these questions, this paper first develops a multivariate empirical loss function based on historical data associated with product performance and its associated <b>customer</b> <b>loss</b> and then proposes an optimization scheme for the most economical process target...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the open}} {{questions}} {{in the design of}} multimedia storage servers is in what order to serve incoming requests. Given the capability provided by the disk layout and scheduling algorithms to serve multiple streams simultaneously, improved request scheduling algorithms can reduce customer waiting times. This results in better service and/or lower <b>customer</b> <b>loss.</b> In this paper we define a new class of request scheduling algorithms, called Group-Guaranteed Server Capacity (GGSC), that preassign server channel capacity to groups of objects. We also define a particular formal method for computing the assigned capacities to achieve a given performance objective. We observe that the FCFS policy can provide the precise time of service to incoming customer requests. Under this assumption, we compare the performance of one of the new GGSC algorithms, GGSCW-FCFS, against FCFS and against two other recently proposed scheduling algorithms: Maximum Factored Queue length (MFQ), and the FCFS-n algorithm that preassigns capacity only to each of the n most popular objects. The algorithms are compared for both competitive market and captured audience environments. Key findings of the algorithm comparisons are that: (1) FCFS-n has no advantage over FCFS if FCFS gives time of service guarantees to arriving customers, (2) FCFS and GGSCW-FCFS are superior to MFQ for both competitive and captive audience environments, (3) for competitive servers that are configured for <b>customer</b> <b>loss</b> less than 10 %, FCFS is superior to all other algorithms examined in this paper, and (4) for captive audience environments that have objects with variable playback length, GGSCW-FCFS is the most promising of the policies considered in this paper. The conclusions for FCFS-n and MFQ differ from previous work because we focus on competitive environments with <b>customer</b> <b>loss</b> under 10 %, we assume FCFS can provide time of service guarantees to all arriving customers, and we consider the distribution of customer waiting time as well as the average waiting time. ...|$|E
