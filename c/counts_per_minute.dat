40|$|Precision Teaching (PT) {{began when}} Lindsley (1964) first applied the {{principles}} of functional behavior analysis {{and the use of}} <b>count</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> measures to the "direct measurement and prosthesis of retarded behavior.

By the early 1970 's, PT had become a new force in both regular and special education (Lindsley 1968, 1972). Its practitioners had begun to make important discoveries about the use of <b>count</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> fluency standards or "aims " (Haughton, 1972), and about how to move students through curriculum sequences on the basis of fluency standards at each step along the way (Starlin, 1972).

Quince was detonated at 2:15pm on August 6, 1958. Twelve days later, the Fig device was detonated on August 18, 1958 at 4:00pm. Quince and Fig were UCRL devices with co-sponsorship through the DOD and the AEC, though the main focus of these tests was weapons development. One of the main differences between these two tests was that over 130 tons of soil from the Nevada Test Site had been shipped in and was placed at surface zero of the Fig test. The radioactive cloud from the Quince blast rose to 1,500 feet (457 meters). As Runit was to also be the detonation site for Fig, the area had to be decontaminated after the Quince test. Around three to five inches of contaminated topsoil was removed from an area 75 feet by 25 feet upwind of ground zero.

The aim of this thesis is {{to deal with these}} students by using two methods of intervention, The Repeated Oral Reading (RR) strategy and the Whole-Class Choral Reading strategy (WCCR). The study is conducted in a middle socio-economic school in Lebanon on sixty-eight 5 th graders. These students are divided into three groups. The first group received the RR strategy intervention, the second group received the WCCR intervention, and the third group was a control group. Pretests were made to create a baseline to the study. Using texts that are specially made for the Curriculum Based Measurement (CBM) tool, students read for one minute each time. The WCPM, word <b>count</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> was calculated for each student. CBM scores were analyzed and studied. The results show that the students who receive the Repeated Reading strategy scored better than those receiving the Whole Class Choral Reading strategy. Based on these results, a new oral reading fluency strategy was created: “The Repeated Choral Reading Strategy" which was tested on another set of students and showed significant improvement in students' oral reading fluency. This strategy, a combination of two renowned strategies, elicits students' interests toward reading, creates an appetite for oral reading among students, and motivates the struggling readers to read continuously and with enthusiasm.

Methods: The design was cross-sectional. A convenient sample of 869 sixth and seventh grade students (12 – 14 years) was {{invited to participate in}} the study. A total of 568 students fulfilled the inclusion criteria and comprised the final sample for this study. Mathematic performance was assessed by a customized test and inhibitory control was assessed by a modified Eriksen flanker task. Physical activity was assessed with GT 3 X and GT 3 X+ accelerometers presented in sex-specific quartiles of mean <b>counts</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> and mean minutes per day in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Active commuting and sports participation was self-reported. Mixed model regression was applied. Total physical activity level was stratified by bicycling status in order to bypass measurement error subject to the accelerometer. Results: Non-cyclists in the 2 nd quartile of <b>counts</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> displayed a higher mathematic score, so did cyclists in the 2 nd and 3 rd quartile of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity relative to the least active quartile. Non-cyclists in the 3 rd quartile of <b>counts</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> had an improved reaction time and cyclists in the 2 nd quartile of <b>counts</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity displayed an improved accuracy, whereas non-cyclists in the 2 nd quartile of <b>counts</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> showed an inferior accuracy relative to the least active quartile. Bicycling to school and organized sports participation were positively associated with mathematic performance. Conclusions: Sports participation and bicycling were positively associated with mathematic performance. Results regarding objectively measured physical activity were mixed. Although, no linear nor dose-response relationship was observed there was no indication of a higher activity level impairing the scholastic or cognitive performance...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—This study {{examined}} the association between objectively measured sedentary activity and metabolic syndrome among older adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Data were from 1, 367 men and women, aged $ 60 years {{who participated in the}} 2003 – 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Sedentary time during waking hours was measured by an accelerometer (, 100 <b>counts</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute).</b> A sedentary bout was defined as a period of time. 5 min. A sedentary break was defined as an interruption in sedentary time ($ 100 <b>counts</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute).</b> Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria. RESULTS—On average, people spent 9. 5 h (65 % of wear time) as sedentary. Compared with people without metabolic syndrome, people with metabolic syndrome spent a greater percentage of time as sedentary (67. 3 vs. 62. 2 %), had longer average sedentary bouts (17. 7 vs. 16. 7 min), had lower intensity during sedentary time (14. 8 vs. 15. 8 average <b>counts</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute),</b> and had fewer sedentary breaks (82. 3 vs. 86. 7), adjusted for age and sex (all P, 0. 01). A higher percentage of time sedentary and fewer sedentary breaks were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of metabolic syndrome after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, alcoho...|$|E
40|$|Bordetella {{pertussis}} infects {{the respiratory}} tract {{of the human}} host and causes whooping cough in children. The nature of immunity against Bordetella pertussis infection and disease is poorly understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate cell mediated immunity in mice immunized with outer membrane component of cell wall, of B. Pertussis. A group of mice were immunized with outer membrane complex (OMC) and killed whole cell (WCV) of B. pertussis, with an interval of 2 weeks. During a period of 7 weeks following the immunization, lymphocytes were isolated from lymph nodes of immunized mice. The in vitro proliferative response of isolated lymphocyte to stimulation with 20 ^g of 30 and 69 kDa outer membrane protein (OMP) were measured as parameters for cell mediated immunity (CMI). The data were expressed as mean <b>count</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (CPM) xlO 3 after subtraction of the CPM of unstimulated control cultures. Lymphoblastogenic response was observed in immunized mice with WCV and OMC. At 30 days of post immunization a significant increase in response to 30 and 69 kDa OMP was observed, a small decrease in the response was evident against P 30 and P 69 at 60 and 120 days of post immunization, but the response was still higher than what was observed in control mice. Current findings indicate strongly the potential of outer membrane protein component of B. pertussis in proliferating lymphocytes in the mice...|$|R
40|$|The Midac Fourier Transform Infrared air {{monitoring}} system {{was used to}} measure real-time vehicular exhaust emission concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HCs) during the Purdue Vehicle Emission Monitoring and Modeling Project (PVEMP) conducted in spring and summer 1997. The experiments took place on the Borman Expressway, in Gary. Indiana and on 1 - 65, south of Lafayette, Indiana Concurrently, two speed-readings were acquired from the passing vehicles {{in the vicinity of the}} air {{monitoring system}} using a hand-held laser gun. The speeds were integrated to determine the speeds and accelerations of the passing vehicles at the spectrometer. An 8 -mm camcorder was used to videotape the passing vehicles in order to determine the vehicle types. Three vehicle types were determined: type I represented all the automobiles, Type II represented all the medium-duty vehicles including light and medium duty trucks, pick-ups, and vans, and type III represented all the heavy-duty vehicle mainly semi-trailers. Meteorological data were also recorded from the nearest surface weather stations. Overall, 16, 870 vehicles were monitored. 8, 478 were type I vehicles, 4, 829 were type II vehicles, and 3, 563 were type III vehicles. The flow rates in <b>count</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> were 8. 92, for type I. 5. 08 for type II. 3. 75 for type III. and 17. 75 for the combined fleet However, 4, 413 vehicles were retained for data analysis. These included 2, 848 (65...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Women {{of color}} report {{the lowest levels}} of {{physical}} activity and highest rates of overweight and obesity in the US. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop an individualized, ecologically valid, field based method to assess physical activity over seven days for community dwelling women of color using accelerometers. Methods Accelerometer-measured physical activity, Borg perceived exertion, demographics, blood pressure, heart rate, and anthropometric measures were collected from African American and Hispanic or Latina women (N = 209). A threshold for increased physical activity was determined for each participant by calculating the average <b>count</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (plus one standard deviation) for each participant collected during a self-selected pace that corresponded to a 'recreational' walk about their neighborhood. The threshold was then used to calculate the amount of time spent doing increased intensity physical activity during a typical week. Results Women were middle-aged and obese (M BMI = 34. 3 ± 9. 3). The average individual activity <b>counts</b> <b>per</b> day ranged from 482 - 1368 in African American women and 470 - 1302 in Hispanic or Latina women. On average, African American women spent significantly more time doing what was labeled 'increased' physical activity than Hispanic and Latino women. However neither group approached recommended physical activity levels, as African American women, averaged 1. 73 % and Hispanic and Latino women averaged 0. 83 % of their day engaged in increased physical activity (p Conclusions This study presents a simple field-based method for developing accelerometer thresholds that identify personalized thresholds of moderate intensity physical activity that can be used by in community-based settings. Findings highlight a need for physical activity programs whose starting points are based upon the individual's typical baseline physical activity level, which is likely to be well below the minimum recommended published guidelines. </p...|$|R
