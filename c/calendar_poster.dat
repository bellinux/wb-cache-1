40|$|Shanghai's {{story was}} a unique {{experience}} of Chinese modernity. It was a stage for multiple dialogues between modernity and tradition. Because of its ideal geographical location, Shanghai proudly served as a window for the coming of western ideas and materials. People in Shanghai were also proud of its {{leading role in the}} development of different cultural and mass media, including novel, film, and art. Among these, <b>calendar</b> <b>posters</b> were one of the most popular and widespread media and were regarded as an icon of the popular art of Shanghai from the 1910 s to the 1930 s. <b>Calendar</b> <b>posters</b> represented the urban life style and the taste of the age. The beautiful female images portrayed in a large number of <b>calendar</b> <b>posters</b> were undoubtedly the most eye-catching features. By depicting the women's appearance, physical posture, life style and esthetics in a seemingly "modern" and "liberated" style, <b>calendar</b> <b>posters</b> were regarded as a symbol of Shanghai's modernity. By decoding the cultural codes of the different themes, namely modernity, sexuality, family concept, smoking, and outdoor activities, in the <b>calendar</b> <b>posters,</b> we can gain a better understanding of the importance of traditional elements still embedded in the modern images of China in the early 20 th century. As China's most exciting metropolis, Shanghai's charm has already inspired many fruitful scholarly works. This piece is a modest attempt at the study of Shanghai's modern culture. Its academic significance, however, lies in the reading of the cultural and visual language of the <b>calendar</b> <b>posters</b> from a historical perspective. It helps us to understand not only the miracle of Shanghai's modernity but also the path and experience of Chinese modernity in which the seemingly modern features were also heavily blended with elements from Chinese tradition...|$|R

40|$|First {{appeared}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century, calendar posters became a popular form of advertisement in 1920 s China when merchants found it an effective means to sale products. To attract attention from consumers, the painters of <b>calendar</b> <b>poster</b> employed a variety of techniques to create images of 'the modern girl. ' In some of the images, they projected women as objects of consumption in order to evoke a culture of leisure and opulence. In other images, they presented women as insatiable consumers in order to lure more female buyers. Hence, calendar posters often conveyed conflicting messages about women identity. Depending on the situations and the perspectives of the viewers, calendar posters could expand patriarchy by promoting 'the consumption of women,' and they could also boost women liberation by promoting “the consumption by women. ” The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the ambiguity and tension that embedded in the images of “the modern girl. ” Based on a study of 284 calendar posters of tobacco industry, this paper will discuss the process by which the images of “the modern girl” were created and disseminated. It will also explain how these images helped to construct a new woman identity in fast changing China. To draw attention to the complexity of the Chinese consumer market in the 1920 s, this paper will focus on the relationship between “the consumption of women” and “the consumption by women. ” I will argue that although seemingly contradictory, the two types of consumption jointly transformed the social and economic landscape of Republican China. 中國自五四運動以來，社會上普遍出現追求現代化的呼聲。一般人都認為中國的女性應給予更高的地位和在社會上扮演更重要的角色，因而在不同的媒體裏，包括小說、漫畫、報章、雜誌、電影，甚至廣告，都出現以現代女性為主題的討論，而在這些討論之中，都不難見到從不同立場和角度來塑造的女性形象。 月份牌廣告畫起源於十九世紀末，到了 1920 年代大行其道，由於廣告畫可幫助推銷商品，受到中國民族工業和外資企業家的垂青。廣告畫師為了吸引消費者的注意，不惜利用各種技巧，大量繪畫「摩登女」圖像，為廣告畫添加了「性別化」元素的同時，也為出現於 1920 至 30 年代的中國婦女運動推波助瀾。 目前，學界對從媒體所見的女性形象研究甚多，包括從漫畫、畫報、電影，也有從消費文化角度來看女性在社會可扮演的角色。有關月份牌廣告畫的研究不斷，其中以討論中國社會現代性和婦女地位、婦女社會生活問題最多。本文嘗試從目前已刊的各種月份牌廣告畫圖冊中篩選二百八十四種沒有重複的香煙廣告畫，討論「摩登女」的形象是如何被塑造的？而所謂「女性消費」和「消費女性」的效果，在廣告畫設計師筆下又是如何做到的...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Uptake of {{penicillin}} prophylaxis {{to prevent}} recurrent rheumatic fever and its sequela {{rheumatic heart disease}} (RHD) is not optimal in the Northern Territory of Australia. The Full Moon Strategy (the Strategy) {{was introduced in the}} Central Australian region in June 2006 to improve the uptake of prophylactic penicillin: clients and healthcare workers were encouraged to use the full moon as a cue for the timing of the 4 weekly prophylactic penicillin injection. Objective: To determine the impact and effectiveness of the Strategy on knowledge and uptake of benzathine penicillin prophylaxis for clients at risk of RHD, and for primary healthcare workers in Central Australia. Methods: Clients at risk of RHD in four remote Aboriginal communities and the town camps of Alice Springs were identified from the RHD database. Consenting clients or their carers were interviewed about their knowledge of the Strategy and the health promotional tools used. Their healthcare records were then reviewed for prophylaxis uptake 2 years prior to and 2 years following the introduction of the Strategy. Primary healthcare workers in the four remote communities who were available {{at the time of the}} study visit were interviewed about their knowledge and use of the Strategy and the health promotional tools. Results: Fifty RHD clients and 19 healthcare workers were interviewed. Most were aware of the flipchart but less than half knew of the <b>calendar</b> <b>poster,</b> hand-held card or radio advertisement. Prophylaxis uptake increased significantly from 47 % in the 2 years prior to the introduction of the Strategy, to 57 % 2 years after the Strategy was introduced. Conclusion: Introduction of the Strategy coincided with an improvement in uptake of prophylaxis but not around the time of the full moon. Uptake of benzathine penicillin remains inadequate and further innovative measures are needed to control rheumatic fever and its sequela in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people...|$|E

40|$|In {{the waning}} days of the Qing Dynasty and the early Republican period, new {{educational}} reforms dramatically reshaped systems of art education and led to fundamental changes in the purpose, meaning and social function of art. These transformations were particularly visible in Shanghai, where the growth of art schools and societies was facilitated by internationally oriented forms of commercial art and an attendant expansion of the publishing industries. One {{of the largest and most}} influential institutions to emerge from this confluence of cultural factors was the Shanghai Art College (Shanghai meishu zhuanke xuexiao or Shanghai meizhuan) the subject of Jane Zheng’s extensive new study. Providing a comprehensive chronological overview of the first 25 years of the College’s history, she traces its evolution in the 1910 s from a private tutorial school offering training in <b>calendar</b> <b>poster</b> painting techniques to a paragon of Western-style art instruction in the 1920 s, and finally to an accredited institution that sought to fulfil Cai Yuanpei’s mandate on “aesthetic education” in the 1930 s. In the process, she delineates how the College successfully weathered the vicissitudes of Shanghai’s changing socio-economic and cultural climate, navigating both market demands and the city’s burgeoning commercial sphere to emerge as a “pragmatic market player in Shanghai’s free market environment” (p. 327). The book argues that the College not only responded to artistic changes as they percolated into the mainstream of Shanghai’s cosmopolitan culture, but also illustrates how its pedagogical goals and institutional features played an integral part in this modernization process, demonstrating the seminal impact which the college exerted in professionalizing “Western-style” art training, legitimizing the continued practice of literati painting and in establishing art history as a modern discipline. Rich in primary sources, Zheng’s argument is supported by exhaustive research into the College’s archives, preserved in the collection of the Shanghai Municipal Archives, in addition to countless newspaper and periodical reports. Allied with a synthesis of the secondary literature, copious quotations from many seminal figures, including Liu Haisu, Zhang Yuguang and Pan Tianshou, bring to life the incongruous voices and competing agendas of those involved in the College’s operation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Propaganda posters {{have been}} one of many forms of {{political}} media used by modern governments such as the United States, Russia, England, and China, to spread a message across a large area to a wide audience. The popularity of the use of propaganda posters has sparked an interest in the study of posters. China has a long and varied history of the use of posters and propaganda posters. Pre- 1949 propaganda posters, especially during the revolutionary period, used woodblock prints with stark lines and deep bright colors. Woodblock prints often employed yellow and red backgrounds to accent the black figures in the poster. In the early 1950 s bright colors and realistic scenes and figures reminiscent of the previous generation of <b>calendar</b> <b>posters</b> were common. The influence of idealism {{can be seen in the}} larger-than-life industrial production and farming scenes and the healthy and Chinese citizens in the posters. The 1960 s continued many of the same techniques of the 1950 s but displayed a less obvious visual connection with <b>calendar</b> <b>posters.</b> Cultural Revolution (1966 - 1976) posters saw a dramatic artistic shift. Figures became less realistic looking and bright colors and intricate scenes were replaced with simple and clear backgrounds and messages. The Cultural Revolution also saw the return of the woodblock print; this time period produced many visually interesting red and black woodblock print posters...|$|R
