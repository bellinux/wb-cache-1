5|$|The Holliday {{junctions}} in {{homologous recombination}} are between identical or nearly identical sequences, {{leading to a}} symmetric arrangement of sequences around the central junction. This allows a branch migration process to occur where the strands move through the junction point. <b>Cleavage,</b> or resolution, of the Holliday junction can occur in two ways. <b>Cleavage</b> of the original set of strands leads to two molecules that may show gene conversion but not chromosomal crossover, while <b>cleavage</b> of the other set of two strands causes the resulting recombinant molecules to show crossover. All products, regardless of <b>cleavage,</b> are heteroduplexes {{in the region of}} Holliday junction migration.|$|E
5|$|The RNA is {{typically}} cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to RNA polymerase II.

40|$|Studies on Western democracies {{have shown}} that {{deep-seated}} social <b>cleavages</b> stabilize the electoral behavior and thus reduce electoral volatility. But how do social <b>cleavages</b> affect a party system that is undergoing democratic consolidation, such as in Turkey? In this study, investigations were carried out on long- and short-term relationships between social <b>cleavages</b> (religiosity, ethnicity, and sectarism) and electoral volatility in Turkey during the 1961 - 2002 period. Cross-sectional multiple regressions were applied to electoral and demographic data at the provincial level. The results showed that in the long-term, social <b>cleavages</b> on the whole have increased volatility rather than reduced it. The cleavage-volatility relationship, however, has changed over time. Repeated elections have mitigated the volatile effect of social <b>cleavages</b> on the voting behavior, as political parties have become more representative of the existent social <b>cleavages.</b> Turkey, Politics, Electoral systems, Social structure...|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by <b>cleavage</b> of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west <b>cleavage</b> and north-south <b>cleavage.</b> The north-south <b>cleavage</b> nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west <b>cleavage</b> has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E
5|$|The processive {{polyadenylation}} {{complex in}} the nucleus of eukaryotes works on products of RNA polymerase II, such as precursor mRNA. Here, a multi-protein complex (see components on the right) cleaves the 3'-most part of a newly produced RNA and polyadenylates the end produced by this <b>cleavage.</b> The <b>cleavage</b> is catalysed by the enzyme CPSF and occurs 10–30 nucleotides downstream of its binding site. This site often has the polyadenylation signal sequence AAUAAA on the RNA, but variants of it that bind more weakly to CPSF exist. Two other proteins add specificity to the binding to an RNA: CstF and CFI. CstF binds to a GU-rich region further downstream of CPSF's site. CFI recognises a third site on the RNA (a set of UGUAA sequences in mammals) and can recruit CPSF even if the AAUAAA sequence is missing. The polyadenylation signal– the sequence motif recognised by the RNA <b>cleavage</b> complex– varies between groups of eukaryotes. Most human polyadenylation sites contain the AAUAAA sequence, but this sequence is less common in plants and fungi.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral <b>cleavage,</b> {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. <b>Cleavage</b> also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E

5|$|Unlike hardness, which denotes only {{resistance}} to scratching, diamond's toughness or tenacity is only fair to good. Toughness {{relates to the}} ability to resist breakage from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy <b>cleavage,</b> it is vulnerable to breakage. A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m1/2, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its {{resistance to}} breakage.

40|$|Abstract: Trypsin is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used enzyme in mass spectrometry for protein digestion with high substrate specificity. Many peptide identification algorithms incorporate these specificity rules as filtering criteria. A generally accepted “Keil rule ” is that trypsin cleaves next to arginine or lysine, but not before proline. Since this rule was derived two decades ago based on a small number of experimentally confirmed <b>cleavages,</b> we decided to re-examine it using 14. 5 million tandem spectra (2 orders of magnitude {{increase in the number of}} observed tryptic <b>cleavages).</b> Our analysis revealed a surprisingly large number of <b>cleavages</b> before proline. We examine several hypotheses to explain these <b>cleavages</b> and argue that trypsin specificity rules used in peptide identification algorithms should be modified to “legitimatize” <b>cleavages</b> before proline. Our approach can be applied to analyze any protease, and we further argue that specificity rules for other enzymes should also be reevaluated based on statistical evidence derived from large MS/MS data sets...|$|R
