40|$|This article {{reports a}} {{qualitative}} {{analysis of a}} corpus of candidate scripts from three Cambridge ESOL examination levels, but all {{in response to the}} same writing task. The analyses, using both intuitive and computer-assisted approaches, are used to propose key language features distinguishing performance in writing at four pre-assessed proficiency levels, and to suggest how these features might be incorporated in a <b>common</b> <b>scale</b> for writing. The work is part of the Cambridge ESOL <b>Common</b> <b>Scale</b> for Writing (CSW) project, which aims to produce a scale of descriptors of writing proficiency levels to appear alongside the <b>common</b> <b>scale</b> for speaking in the Handbooks for the Main Suite and other Cambridge ESOL international exams. Such a scale would assist test users in interpreting levels of performance across exams and locating the level of one examination in relation to another.

60|$|The {{method of}} {{scientific}} investigation {{is nothing but}} {{the expression of the}} necessary mode of working of the human mind. It is simply the mode at which all phenomena are reasoned about, rendered precise and exact. There is no more difference, but there is just the same kind of difference, between the mental operations of a man of science and those of an ordinary person, as there is between the operations and methods of a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods in <b>common</b> <b>scales,</b> and the operations of a chemist in performing a difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely graduated weights. It is not that the action of the scales in the one case, and the balance in the other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but the beam of one is set on an infinitely finer axis than the other, and of course turns by the addition of a much smaller weight.|$|E
6000|$|Immediately, at any rate, the Albany cousins, or a {{particular}} group of them, began again to be intensely in question for us; coloured in due course with reflections of the War as their lives, not less than our own, were to become--and coloured as well too, {{for all sorts of}} notation and appreciation, from irrepressible private founts. Mrs. Edmund Tweedy, bereft of her own young children, had at the time I speak of opened her existence, with the amplest hospitality, to her four orphaned nieces, who were also our father's and among whom the second in age, Mary Temple the younger, about in her seventeenth year when she thus renewed her appearance to our view, shone with vividest lustre, an essence that preserves her still, {{more than half a century}} from the date of her death, in a memory or two where many a relic once sacred has comparatively yielded to time. Most of those who knew and loved, I was going to say adored, her have also yielded--which is a reason the more why thus much of her, faint echo from too far off though it prove, should be tenderly saved. If I have spoken of the elements and presences round about us that [...] "counted," [...] Mary Temple was to count, and in more lives than can now be named, to an extraordinary degree; count as a young and shining apparition, a creature who owed to the charm of her every aspect (her aspects were so many!) and the originality, vivacity, audacity, generosity, of her spirit, an indescribable grace and weight--if one might impute weight to a being so imponderable in <b>common</b> <b>scales.</b> Whatever other values on our scene might, as I have hinted, appear to fail, she was one of the first order, in the sense of the immediacy of the impression she produced, and produced altogether as by the play of her own light spontaneity and curiosity--not, that is, as through a sense of such a pressure and such a motive, or through a care for them, in others. [...] "Natural" [...] to an effect of perfect felicity that we were never to see surpassed is what I have already praised all the Albany cousinage of those years for being; but in none of the company was the note so clear as in this rarest, though at the same tune symptomatically or ominously palest, flower of the stem; who was natural at more points and about more things, with a greater range of freedom and ease and reach of horizon than any of the others dreamed of. They had that way, delightfully, with the small, after all, and the common matters--while she had it with those too, but with the great and rare ones over and above; so that she was to remain for us the very figure and image of a felt interest in life, an interest as magnanimously far-spread, or as familiarly and exquisitely fixed, as her splendid shifting sensibility, moral, personal, nervous, and having at once such noble flights and such touchingly discouraged drops, such graces of indifference and inconsequence, might at any moment determine. She was really to remain, for our appreciation, the supreme case of a taste for life as life, as personal living; of an endlessly active and yet somehow a careless, an illusionless, a sublimely forewarned curiosity about it: something that made her, slim and fair and quick, all straightness and charming tossed head, with long light and yet almost sliding steps and a large light postponing, renouncing laugh, the very muse or amateur priestess of rash speculation. To express her in the mere terms of her restless young mind, one felt from the first, was to place her, by a perversion of the truth, under the shadow of female [...] "earnestness"--for which she was much too unliteral and too ironic; so that, superlatively personal and yet as independent, as [...] "off" [...] into higher spaces, at a touch, as all the breadth of her sympathy and her courage could send her, she made it impossible to say whether she was just the most moving of maidens or a disengaged and dancing flame of thought. No one to come after her could easily seem to show either a quick inward life or a brave, or even a bright, outward, either a consistent contempt for social squalors or a very marked genius for moral reactions. She had in her brief passage the enthusiasm of humanity--more, assuredly, than any charming girl who ever circled, and would fain have continued to circle, round a ballroom. This kept her indeed for a time more interested in the individual, the immediate human, than in the race or the social order at large; but that, on the other hand, made her ever so restlessly, or quite inappeasably, [...] "psychologic." [...] The psychology of others, in her shadow--I mean their general resort to it--could only for a long time seem weak and flat and dim, above all not at all amusing. She burned herself out; she died at twenty-four.|$|E
