Results were very similar in both samples and across genders. Measures of protection and risk {{in each of the}} 4 contexts uniquely contributed to the account of problem behavior involvement even when individ-ual-level measures of protection and risk were controlled. <b>Context</b> <b>protection</b> was also shown to moderate individual-level risk and protection in 1 context moderated risk within that context and in other contexts. Controls protection—protection provided by rules, regulations, and expected sanctions for transgression from adults and peers— was the most important measure of <b>context</b> <b>protection</b> in all but 1 context.

40|$|With {{reference}} to an embedded system featuring no support for memory management, {{we present a}} model of a protection system based on passwords. At the hardware level, our model takes advantage of a memory protection unit (MPU) interposed between the processor and the complex of the main memory and the input-output devices. The MPU supports both concepts of a <b>protection</b> <b>context</b> and a <b>protection</b> domain. A <b>protection</b> <b>context</b> is a set of access rights for the memory pages; a protection domain is a set of one or more <b>protection</b> <b>contexts.</b> Passwords are associated with protection domains. A process that holds a given password can take advantage of this password to activate the corresponding domain. A small set of protection primitives makes it possible to modify the composition of the domains in a strictly controlled fashion. The proposed protection model is evaluated from a number of important viewpoints, which include password distribution, review and revocation, the memory requirements for storage of the information concerning protection, and the time necessary for password validation...|$|R

A substantial account of variation in health-enhancing behavior—and of its developmental change over time—was provided by the model for boys and girls, and for the 3 grade cohorts, in both samples.

40|$|Although the indispensibility {{of access}} control {{mechanisms}} in data secure systems has been recognized, {{there is a need}} for more subtle protection and refined control mechanisms. This report describes <b>context</b> <b>protection</b> mechanisms which enable the same data unit to be protected differently in different contexts, the differences being determined by the manner in which the fields and records are being accessed. The study shows that the method can be enforced by means of certain built-in relations among the data units involved. Three basic and primary relations are proposed as a starting point for more elaborate control systems. These primary relations allow the necessary and sufficient conditions under which violations will occur to be identified. With these conditions and the security system, it becomes possible to propo:Je a data definition language for specifying data base protection requirements and to develop an access control mechanism for enforcing the requirements.

The knowledge about fault behavior of an Induction Motor drive is extremely important from standpoint of improved system design, protection, and fault tolerant control. Here different problems are dealt such as overvoltage, overcurrent, over speed which are being faced by IM’s during their course of operation. There are various methods for fault detection and protection of Induction Motors. Some of them are On-line fault detection, Stator fault monitoring techniques, Microcontroller based protection system and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) based protection system. In this <b>context,</b> <b>protection</b> for three-phase Induction Motor is enabled using Crouzet Millenium PLC.

40|$|In {{ubiquitous}} computing domain context awareness {{is an important}} issue. So, in {{ubiquitous computing}}, mere protection of message confidentiality is not sufficient {{for most of the}} applications where context-awareness can lead to near deterministic ideas. An adversary might deduce sensitive information by observing the contextual data, which when correlated with prior information about the people and the physical locations that are being monitored by a set of sensors can reveal most of the sensitive information. So, it is obvious that for security and privacy preservation in ubiquitous computing <b>context</b> <b>protection</b> is of equal importance. In this paper, we propose a scheme which provides two layer privacy protection of user's or application's context data.

40|$|Since 1977, the {{popularity}} of the limited liability company (“LLC”) has grown tremendously, overtaking the corporation and the partnership as the preferred business structure in many jurisdictions. Amidst this growth in popularity, a legal debate has sparked concerning the existence, nature, and extent of the fiduciary and contractual duties owed in the LLC context. Drafters of LLC agreements can adjust fiduciary “norms” through limitation or, in certain jurisdictions like Delaware, through complete elimination of fiduciary duties. However, the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing (the “Implied Covenant” or the “Covenant”) remains and cannot be waived by the parties. This delicate balance between waivable duties and an unwaivable covenant begs two key questions: What, if any, is the relationship between fiduciary duties and the Implied Covenant, and where is the boundary between the two? Further, how is the scope of the Implied Covenant affected when an LLC agreement eliminates fiduciary duties? The answers to these questions are critical in separating permissible acts under an LLC agreement from acts giving rise to causes of action for breach of contract. The relationship between fiduciary duties and the Implied Covenant is marked by an inherent tension that the Delaware courts have yet to properly resolve. Rather, these courts have structured an extremely narrow view of the Covenant, and have sometimes conflated the Covenant with fiduciary duties, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the Covenant as an independent means of enforcing behavioral norms arising from contractual relationships. Consequently, parties to LLC agreements have been left to question whether the Implied Covenant has any significance independent of fiduciary duties. This Article attempts to shed light on this dilemma, but cautions that, in this unique <b>context,</b> <b>protection</b> under the Covenant appears to be illusory when fiduciary duties are no longer in play...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{identification}} and economic valuation of ecosystem services (ES) are becoming important components of coral reef management. In many <b>contexts,</b> <b>protection</b> of human assets against coastal floods {{is one of}} the most important ES provided by coral reefs. The methods utilized to characterize this ES should be able to accommodate situations with low data availability, without sacrificing robustness. In this paper, we suggest such an approach that utilizes expert opinion and does not require copious amounts of data. Our primary objective is to find a balance between simple and complex models that can be used in a data scarce environment, to produce an economic valuation of the coral reef ES of protection against coastal floods. The approach has three steps: (i) identify geographic zones and assets at risk, (ii) identify the contributing role of coral reefs in the protection of coasts and, (iii) value the annual repair costs of assets through the avoided damage cost approach. The proposed method seems appropriate for advocacy with policy makers, but appears to be less effective for small scale approaches, such as those required for Payment for ES negotiations or marine spatial planning...|$|R
