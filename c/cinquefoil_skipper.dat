It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the carline skipper (P. carlinae) as the two are known to interbreed where their ranges overlap in the Alps but can usually be recognised by the prominent squarish, rather than c-shaped, white spot near the costa of the forewing and the usually deeper red-brown underwings. The <b>cinquefoil</b> <b>skipper</b> flies in July and August.|$|E
