5000|$|On 24, September 2013, {{more than}} 300 armed Sydney Police {{undertook}} 22 raids that [...] "severely disrupted" [...] the gang. Fifteen suspects were arrested, with four jet skis, a lotus sports car, replica guns and a boat were confiscated by NSW police for the investigation. A high-ranking member and gang coordinator {{was arrested at}} the Rossmore property and charged. The criminals faced 29 <b>charges</b> relating <b>to</b> drug <b>provision</b> and possession and {{being part of a}} gang. 8 kg of cannabis was found in one of the raids, which were close to $25,000 in cash.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 1899 school year, Principal Arthur Burch was granted {{permission}} to open a school lunch room in the building. A basement room 27 by 60 feet was selected for the purpose; a kitchen 10 by 20 feet was partitioned off in one corner; furniture, dishes, etc. were purchased (for $316.65), and Emma Stiles of Chicago was placed in <b>charge,</b> <b>to</b> purchase <b>provisions,</b> plan each day's menu, and to see that all lunches were paid for. The menu was posted on a blackboard in the corridor, with each dish priced at five cents. This was something in the nature of an innovation and other cities made inquiries regarding the success of the scheme. The principal advantage, according to Burch's report to the Superintendent, was derived from serving warm lunches to the students, many of whom came from a distance too great to go home every day for a warm lunch, and who did better work in the afternoons than if they had eaten a cold one.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} impact of a switch from free <b>to</b> <b>charged</b> highway <b>provision</b> on firm numbers and private sector {{employment}} in a cross-section of Portuguese municipalities. It exploits the fact that highway tolls in Portugal were unexpectedly raised in reaction to the financial crisis to establish causality. Results from a difference-in-differences analysis indicate a significantly negative effect of highway tolls on number of firms and employment in treated municipalities vis- 0 -vis the control group. We also find negative effects of tolls in municipalities not directly traversed by the treated highways, with larger firms and manufacturing firms being most strongly affected...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Barriers <b>to</b> the <b>provision</b> of {{psychiatric}} nursing care {{have been reported}} worldwide, although literature on these barriers in Nigeria is limited. The {{purpose of the study}} was to explore and describe the barriers <b>to</b> <b>provision</b> {{of psychiatric}} nursing care, using the case study methodology. A sample of 12 participants was recruited for the study, comprising four key informants and eight study participants. The data collection methods included grand tour interviews with the key informants, in-depth interviews with key informants and other study participants and participant observation of all 12 participants. Content analysis was conducted. It yielded five themes related to barriers, namely: personal barriers <b>to</b> <b>provision</b> of psychiatric nursing care, relationship related barriers <b>to</b> <b>provision</b> of psychiatric nursing care, environmental barriers <b>to</b> <b>provision</b> of psychiatric nursing care, organisational barriers <b>to</b> <b>provision</b> of psychiatric nursing care and “public” related barriers <b>to</b> <b>provision</b> of psychiatric nursing care. The sixth theme: Motivators <b>to</b> <b>provision</b> of psychiatric nursing care despite barriers was discovered serendipitously. These findings are in line with previous findings of studies carried out in other settings. The study findings raise the need for management to value the psychiatric nurses, refrain from the use of derogatory statements and passing comments and place high value on the educational and career progression of the psychiatric nurses and the design of a therapeutic environment...|$|R
