5|$|With the {{exception}} of Tropical Storm Risk's initial season prediction in December2014, all major forecasting agencies called for a below or near-average season, due to the strong El Niño and <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> average sea surface temperatures. Overall, the forecasts were fairly accurate.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures are {{relatively}} cold for its latitude {{due to the}} cold Malvinas Current and the high altitude. For example, in Tierra del Fuego temperatures are <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> at equal latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since they {{are influenced by the}} cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current. A characteristic of the temperature pattern is the NW–SE distribution of isotherms due to the presence of the Andes.|$|E
5|$|Earth has {{undergone}} periodic climate {{shifts in the}} past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include {{the positions of the}} continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of {{thermoregulation}} which enables them to maintain territories during the day. A study by Joseph R. Coelho showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated thorax temperature. Experiments found that the wasp has the ability to shift heat from its thorax to its abdomen and that the abdomen is generally kept <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> the thorax. Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants.|$|E
5|$|The bed of Fishing Creek {{contains}} red {{and brown}} shale in some places. Other {{parts of the}} watershed lie over gray sandstone or conglomerates. There are numerous deposits of iron ore, limestone and marble in the watershed of Fishing Creek. Most of the rock in the watershed, including the Trimmers Rock Formation and Catskill Formation, is from the Devonian Period, {{but some of the}} northernmost tributaries have watersheds on rock from the Mississippian Period, such as the Huntley Mountain Formation and Burgoon sandstone. The creek is a freestone stream although its water is <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> that of most eastern freestone streams.|$|E
5|$|An active trough of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air from behind the trough, about 12°F (7°C) <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> usual for the time of year, extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, this variety {{represented}} 80% of US pear production {{while in}} 2004 it represented 50% of reported pear production, displaced {{primarily by the}} continuing growth of d'Anjou and Bosc pears, both winter pears more tolerant of <b>cold</b> <b>than</b> the Bartlett.|$|R

50|$|Although the melodic {{richness}} remains intact, {{the resulting}} {{sound from the}} Arovane and Phonem collaboration Aer (Valid) is perhaps more robotic and <b>cold</b> <b>than</b> what could be considered typical Arovane and harkens back to some facets of Arovane's early works, such as Icol Diston.|$|R
5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{the first}} comet where the noble gas argon was detected. Noble gases are {{chemically}} inert and highly volatile, and since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures, {{they can be used}} for probing the temperature histories of the cometary ices. Krypton has a sublimation temperature of 16–20K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance, while argon with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to the solar abundance. Together these observations indicate that the interior of Hale–Bopp has always been <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> 35–40K, but has at some point been warmer than 20K. Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed, this suggests that the comet formed beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt region and then migrated outward to the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|On 5 October, an operationally unnamed {{subtropical}} storm {{which had}} gone unnoticed by the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low, which {{was moving to}} the southeast over the Azores. The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after absorbing the subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on 8 October 580miles (930km) southeast of Lajes in the Azores. However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time, because the water temperature was too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24°C (75°F), much <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> the 26.5°C (80°F) usually required for tropical development.|$|E
25|$|Chihuahuas may tremble or shiver when stressed, excited or cold. Chihuahuas, {{especially}} the short coat variety, are less tolerant of <b>cold</b> <b>than</b> larger breeds, and require a sweater and/or boots in cold weather. They will seek warmth in sunshine, under blankets, or on furniture, or human laps.|$|R
50|$|Washingtonia × filibusta is {{a hybrid}} of the species W. filifera and W. robusta. Stores do not sell purebreds, they sell the hybrid only. The hybrid does not look too {{different}} from the purebred, but is more hardy to <b>cold</b> <b>than</b> the robusta, especially wet cold.|$|R
25|$|Eggs {{of species}} of {{mosquitoes}} from the temperate zones are {{more tolerant of}} <b>cold</b> <b>than</b> the eggs of species indigenous to warmer regions. Many even tolerate subzero temperatures. In addition, adults of some species can survive the winter by taking shelter in suitable microhabitats such as buildings or hollow trees.|$|R
5|$|The Doctor and Clara find a {{location}} in the mansion which is noticeably <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> {{the rest of the}} house, and they feel as if they are being watched. Suddenly the house grows cold and Clara feels something holding her hand when there's nothing there. The two race back to where the Professor and Emma are waiting to see Palmer's equipment activating of its own accord. A thin black disc materializes {{in front of them and}} Emma senses something crying out for help as the ghost appears in a dark hallway crying for help. The Doctor quickly takes pictures of them before the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|Distance {{from the}} sea is another {{important}} geographic factor. Owing {{to the shape of}} the country, the close proximity to the ocean means that most of the country, excluding the north is moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The two main currents that impact the climate of Argentina are the Brazil Current from the north and the Malvinas Current from the south (a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current). The Brazil Current transports warm subtropical waters southwards while the Malvinas Current transports cold, subantarctic waters northwards. The Malvinas Current cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the current is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period owing to the cold Malvinas Current. As well, it is the main factor in making Tierra del Fuego <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since it is influenced by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Karl {{was unusual}} in several aspects. It {{developed}} {{late in the}} hurricane season, which runs from June 1 through November 30, over waters <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> the standard limit for tropical cyclone formation. It marked the farthest-north development of a November tropical or subtropical cyclone on record. While the 1991 unnamed hurricane was farther north, it became a subtropical storm late on October 31, and had moved south by November 1. Karl attained Category 1 hurricane status farther north than any other storm (in any month) until the 1991 unnamed hurricane became a hurricane at a higher latitude. The storm's record was also surpassed by Hurricane Noel in 2001. Karl was reported {{at the time to}} be the farthest-east hurricane during the last 10days of the month of November. Additionally, it maintained hurricane intensity until reaching 45.0°N, at which point it became extratropical; only Hurricane Lois in 1966 lasted as a hurricane farther north in the month of November.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the only}} Conan story in which other {{characters}} refer to him as [...] "a southerner". In {{all the rest of}} his wanderings, Conan is invariably [...] "a barbarian from the cold north", but for the Aesir and Vanir, Cimmeria is a southern land, a bit less <b>cold</b> <b>than</b> theirs.|$|R
60|$|Scarce was Alexander's body <b>cold</b> <b>than</b> the duke's enemies {{began to}} lift their heads. Already by the 20th of that month--two {{days after the}} Pope had breathed his last--the Orsini were in arms and had led a rising, in retort to which Michele da Corella fired their palace on Montegiordano.|$|R
60|$|We dress far too heavily. The fact is, that {{we would}} be a much {{healthier}} people if we wore less clothing. Ladies especially wrap themselves up too much, with the result that their blood does not circulate freely. Coats, ulsters, and other wraps, cause far more <b>colds</b> <b>than</b> they prevent.|$|R
5|$|The {{simplest}} classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is {{the most}} widely accepted form of air mass classification. Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for Arctic or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate {{the stability of the}} atmosphere. If the air mass is <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w. While air mass identification was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.|$|E

25|$|Temperatures {{that are}} {{expressed}} as negative {{numbers on the}} familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> the zero points of those scales. Certain systems can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their thermodynamic temperature (expressed in kelvins) can be of a negative quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not <b>colder</b> <b>than</b> absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than any system with a positive temperature, {{in the sense that}} if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.|$|E
