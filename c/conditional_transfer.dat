[...] With these cuts, the federal government essentially “starved the provinces fiscally”. Courchene notes that in an intriguing twist “these CHST cuts compromised virtually every provincial program except Medicare, since gutting medicare would mean certain electoral defeat for provincial governments. Hence, the provinces diverted money from everywhere else to medicare”. [...] Nevertheless, even though healthcare funding remained mostly unchanged “the inevitable result was that the provinces had to starve other policy areas, {{so much so that}} citizens and cities alike welcomed federal funding in these cash-starved areas”. [...] This is what provided the inroad {{for the federal government to}} take a more direct role in funding provincial jurisdictions. Whereas previously the federal government would mostly establish <b>conditional</b> <b>transfer</b> funds for social programs to the provinces to distribute to their citizens and cities, where the federal government could attach conditions the provinces would have to meet to receive the funding, providing a round about way for the federal government to influence provincial jurisdictions. Now under this proposed hourglass federalism model the federal government is taking a more direct route and directly dealing with citizens and cities and transferring the funds for provincial programs directly to them.|$|E

In this paper we investigate reducing the cost of comparisons in <b>conditional</b> <b>transfers</b> of control. We decouple the specification of the values to be compared from the actual comparison itself, which now occurs as part of the branch instruction. The specification of the register or immediate values involved in the comparison is accomplished via a new instruction called a comparison specification, which is loop invariant. Decoupling the specification of the comparison from the actual comparison performed before the branch reduces the number of instructions in the loop, which provides performance benefits not possible when using conventional comparison instructions. Results from applying this technique on the ARM processor show that both the number of instructions executed and execution cycles are reduced...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{originated}} in questions from an audience at Universidad de las Américas, Puebla, at a seminar presentation by Susan Parker. This paper considers the welfare implications of transfers to poor {{families that are}} conditional on school attendance {{and other forms of}} investment on their children’s human capital. Family decisions are as-sumed {{to be the result of}} (generalized) Nash bargaining between the two parents. We show that, as long as bequests are zero, <b>conditional</b> <b>transfers</b> are better for children than unconditional transfers, provided that the total amount transferred to the family is the same under the two transfer programs. The mother’s welfare (or rather, the welfare of the parent that cares relatively more for the children) may also be improved by <b>conditional</b> <b>transfers.</b> Thus, conditioning transfers to bequest-constrained families have potentially important and desirable intergenerational and intra-generational welfare effects. Condition-ing transfers to families leaving positive bequests makes every family member worse off. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{developing}} countries have introduced <b>conditional</b> cash <b>transfer</b> programs that provide money to poor families with certain contingencies attached - such as requiring school attendance or regular immunization and health check-ups. As the popularity of <b>conditional</b> cash <b>transfer</b> programs has grown, experimentation with potential applications {{in other areas of}} health, such as sexual and reproductive health, and HIV prevention, in particular, has also increased. Evaluations of <b>conditional</b> cash <b>transfer</b> programs have focused almost exclusively on uptake of health and educational services, which make relatively low demands of participants compared with more complex interventions, which require the cessation of risky behaviors, such as smoking, obesity, and substance abuse. The literature on contingency management - based on the principle that behavioral change occurs when appropriate behaviors are reinforced and rewarded - provides a richer picture of the complexity of the use of conditionality to encourage healthy behavioral change. This paper examines developing countries'experiences with <b>conditional</b> cash <b>transfer</b> programs and the results of trials in clinical settings on the efficacy of contingency management, and addresses their relevance for designing <b>conditional</b> cash <b>transfer</b> programs to address risky sexual behavior and promote the prevention of sexually transmitted infections and HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa.
