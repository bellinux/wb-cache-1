40|$|Background The {{formation}} of a hard-tissue bridge covering the tooth extraction socket is termed <b>corticalization.</b> In dogs this process takes > 60 d, however, this process has hardly been investigated in humans. Recent reports have indicated increased primary implant stability and reduced bone strain after immediate implant loading {{in the presence of}} a (thick) cortical layer, thus, knowledge of the timeframe between tooth extraction and hard-tissue bridging of the extraction socket appears clinically relevant in some situations. Aim/Hypothesis To determine the timeframe between tooth extraction and radiographically detectable <b>corticalization</b> of the socket in humans and to evaluate the possible impact of various factors on this process, e. g., history of periodontitis, smoking status, systemic disease, medications, etc. Material and Methods Two-hundred-fifty patients with a CT scan μ 8804, 36 months after tooth extraction and without any manipulation at the extraction site were included. Three orthoradial multiplanar reconstruction slices per extraction socket were scored, by a single calibrated examiner, regarding the degree of <b>corticalization</b> as: (a) healed, i. e., complete/continuous <b>corticalization</b> of the socket entrance, or (b) non-healed. Thereafter, each extraction socket was classified as (1) non-corticalized, i. e., all 3 slices classified as non-healed, (2) partially corticalized, i. e., 1 or 2 slices classified as non-healed, or (3) corticalized, i. e., all 3 slices classified as healed (Figure 1). The possible effect of several independent parameters, i. e., age, gender, timeframe between tooth extraction and CT scan, tooth type, periodontal status, gap dimension, smoking status, presence of any systemic disease, and medication intake, on the <b>corticalization</b> status was statistically evaluated. Results Three to 6 months after tooth extraction, 27 % of the sockets were judged as non-corticalized, and 53 % were judged as partially corticalized. After 9 to 12 months, > 80 % of the sockets were corticalized, but some non-corticalized sockets were detected up to 15 months post-extraction (Figure 2). Each additional month after tooth extraction contributed significantly to higher likelihood of a corticalized socket (OR 1. 645, 95 % CIs 1. 471 – 1. 841, P < 0. 001). Periodontal attachment loss of μ 8805, 75 % significantly prolonged <b>corticalization</b> time, i. e., teeth with < 75 % attachment loss were judged more often as corticalized (OR 1. 984, 95 % CIs 1. 011 – 3. 896, P = 0. 047). No other independent variable had a significant effect on <b>corticalization</b> status. Conclusions and Clinical Implications Three to 6 months after tooth extraction one out of 4 sockets was still completely non corticalized, and only 9 to 12 months after tooth extraction complete <b>corticalization</b> was observed in about 80 % of the sockets. The results, indicating a considerably long timeframe until <b>corticalization</b> of extraction sockets, imply that in cases where immediate loading requiring high primary implant stability is considered, waiting μ 8805, 9 months post-extraction appears advisable...|$|E
40|$|The {{neurovascular}} bundle may be vulnerable during surgical procedures involving the mandible, especially when anatomical variations are present. Increased demand of implant surgeries, wider availability of three-dimensional exams, {{and lack of}} clear definitions in the literature indicate that features of anatomical variations should be revisited. The objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate features of anatomical variations related to mandibular canal (MC), such as bifid canals, anterior loop of mental nerve, and <b>corticalization</b> of MC. Additionally, bone trabeculation at the submandibular gland fossa region (SGF) was assessed and related to visibility of MC. Cone beam computed tomography exams from 100 patients (200 hemimandibles) were analyzed and the following parameters were registered: diameter and <b>corticalization</b> of MC; trabeculation in SGF region; presence of bifid MC, position of bifurcations, diameter, and direction of bifid canals; and measurement of anterior loops by two methods. <b>Corticalization</b> of the MC was observed in 59 % of hemimandibles. In 23 %, MC could be identified despite absence of <b>corticalization.</b> Diameter of MC was between 2. 1 and 4  mm for nearly three quarters of the sample. In 80 % of the sample trabeculation at the SGF was either decreased or not visible, and such cases showed correlation with absence of MC <b>corticalization.</b> Bifid MC affected 19 % of the patients, mostly associated with additional mental foramina. Clinically significant anterior loop (> 2  mm of anterior extension) was observed in 22 - 28 %, depending on the method.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{reliability}} of four panoramic radiographic findings, both individually and in association, in predicting the absence of <b>corticalization</b> between the mandibular canal and the third molar on cone beam CT (CBCT) images. Methods: The sample consisted of 72 individuals (142 mandibular third molars) who underwent pre-operative radiographic evaluation before extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. On panoramic radiographs, the most common signs of <b>corticalization</b> (darkening of roots, diversion of mandibular canal, narrowing of mandibular canal and interruption of white line) and the presence or absence of <b>corticalization</b> between the mandibular third molar and the mandibular canal on CBCT images were evaluated. Results: Darkening of roots and interruption of white line associated with the absence of <b>corticalization</b> between the mandibular third molar and the mandibular canal on CBCT images were statistically significant, both as isolated findings (p = 0. 0001 and p = 0. 0006, respectively) and in association (p = 0. 002). No statistically significant association was observed for the other panoramic radiographic findings, either individually or in association (p > 0. 05). Conclusion: Darkening of roots and interruption of white line observed on panoramic radiographs, both as isolated findings and in association, were effective in determining the risk relationship between the tooth roots and the mandibular canal, requiring three-dimensional evaluation of the case.

40|$|Background/purpose: High {{prevalence}} of bifid mandibular canals has been visualized with {{various types of}} computerized tomography (CT). Along the canals, a various ranged <b>corticalization</b> was recently reported. The depiction of the fine anatomic structures on multislice and cone-beam CT images was compared. Material and methods: The {{presence or absence of}} the bifid canal was assessed on 327 images obtained by multislice CT (MSCT; n =  173) or by cone-beam CT (CBCT; n =  154), according to the configuration. The cortex thickness and distribution were also assessed. Results: The {{prevalence of}} bifid canal detected by CBCT was significantly greater than that detected by MSCT (42. 2 % vs. 18. 7 % for hemi-mandibles and 58. 4 % vs. 30. 6 % for patients). Cortical thickness recorded by CBCT was significantly thinner than that recorded by MSCT (0. 48  mm vs. 0. 65  mm, P <  0. 001); however, the distributions of <b>corticalization</b> detected by the two tomography methods were similar. There was a significant association of cortex thickness with CT type and <b>corticalization</b> degree (R 2  =  0. 530, P <  0. 001). Conclusion: Thinner cortices, but greater prevalence of bifid canals recorded by CBCT, compared to MSCT, suggests that clinicians should be cautious when using CT to interpret this fine anatomic structure...|$|E
30|$|Although {{there have}} been no {{detailed}} studies using CBCT, poorer visualization of the superior wall compared with the inferior wall has been reported by some studies using conventional radiographs or medical CT images [19 – 21]. Whether the wall of the mandibular canal is visible or invisible on images largely depends on {{the presence or absence of}} <b>corticalization</b> of the wall surrounding the neurovascular bundle. Bertl et al. [22] performed histomorphological observation of the mandibular canal wall using thin sections of the first molar region of the mandible from 50 cadavers. They identified <b>corticalization</b> of the cranial (superior) and caudal (inferior) wall in 65 % and 81 %, respectively. Although they only observed the first molar area, their results may be considered consistent with ours of poorer visibility of the superior wall on CBCT images. The presence of nerves and vessels rising to the lower teeth from the mandibular canal may partly explain the lower <b>corticalization</b> rate of the superior wall [23, 24]. Further, the presence or absence of <b>corticalization</b> of the canal wall may be correlated with the trabecular bone volume or density [22, 25]. However, quantitative evaluation of the trabecular bone was difficult in our study using CBCT images. On the other hand, concerning the variance in the visibility of the mandibular canal based on anteroposterior location, several studies using CBCT reported that the mandibular canal can be more easily identified in the posterior region compared with the anterior region [3, 5 – 8]. An anatomical study using cadavers has reported similar results [23]. Our study evaluated the superior and inferior walls separately, with similar results, although a significant difference was only found between area 3 and area 1 for the superior wall.|$|E
40|$|During limb {{lengthening}} over an intramedullary nail, {{decisions regarding}} external fixator removal and weightbearing {{depend on the}} amount of callus seen at the lengthening area on radiographs. However, this method is subjective and objective evaluation of the amount of callus likely would minimize nail or interlocking screw breakage and refracture after fixator removal. We asked how many cortices with full <b>corticalization</b> of the newly formed bone at the lengthening area are needed to allow fixator removal and full weightbearing and how to radiographically determine the stage of <b>corticalization.</b> We retrospectively reviewed 17 patients (34 lengthenings) who underwent bilateral tibial lengthenings over an intramedullary nail. The average gain in length was 7. 2  ±  3. 4  cm. We determined the pixel value ratio (ratio of pixel value of regenerate versus the mean pixel value of adjacent bone) of the lengthened area on radiographs. There were no nail or screw breakage and refracture. Partial weightbearing with crutches was permitted when the pixel value ratio was 1 in two cortices and full weightbearing without crutches was permitted when the pixel value ratio was 1 in three cortices. The pixel value ratio on radiographs can be an objective parameter for callus measurement and may provide guidelines for the timing of external fixator removal. We cannot determine from our limited data the minimum pixel value in how many cortices would suggest safe removal, but we can say our criteria were not associated with subsequent refracture...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} cases of {{intramedullary}} nailing with reaming, carried out after complications in regenerated bone and docking site had occurred, is presented here. Nine patients (involving 5 femurs, and 4 tibias) had previously been treated with resection and bone transport after open fractures with loss of bony tissue and infection. Before bone transport, there was Staphylococcus aureus infection in 6 cases and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in 3. The mean length of regenerated bone was 9. 5 cm (min. 6, max. 18). After transport, the fixator remained {{in place for a}} mean period of 12. 8 months (min. 8, max. 24). In 6 cases (4 femurs, 2 tibias), the thickness of the cortical wall was insufficient and, in 2 of these, there was nonunion of the docking site. In 2 tibias, nailing was carried out shortly after the fixator had been removed, after refracture of the regenerated bone due to insufficient cortical thickness. In one femur, nailing was carried out because of nonunion with the docking site. Follow-up involved clinical and X-ray checks. The mean follow-up was 3. 9 years (min. 2, max. 6). In all cases, union and <b>corticalization</b> was complete on average 6 months after nailing (min. 4, max. 11). Infection appeared in only one tibia 4 months after nailing and complete <b>corticalization.</b> The infection was treated with antibiotics and the nail subsequently removed. We conclude that nailing is an excellent solution for regenerated bone and docking site problems, as long as antibiotic therapy is prescribed for at least 10 days after the fixator has been removed. Complications due to infections after nailing are not frequent and can be resolved relatively easily...|$|E

30|$|These reports {{suggest that}} a nail may be {{inserted}} (despite previously infected tissue) if there is interim antibiotic therapy. In our series where bone transport was performed after resection for infection, we inserted the intramedullary nails after an interval of antibiotic therapy. We had one case (case 5) of re-infection after nailing, which we resolved by nail removal after union and antibiotic treatment (Fig.  3). Although some authors [60] believe {{that the risk of}} expanding an infection into the medullary cavity increases with the insertion of an intramedullary nail, it is our belief this risk is reduced if the previous site of infection is thoroughly debrided and some time allowed to pass before nailing. This is in order to clear up pin infections that often occur, particularly along screws. Kirschner wires, having a smaller diameter, create less serious infections than those produced by pins. Once the infection is treated and resolved, the nail can be inserted after reaming, which serves as a biological stimulator for the <b>corticalization</b> of the regenerate area. Intramedullary reaming for chronic osteomyelitis results may assist in removing the laminar endosteal sequestra of the tibial canal as well as diminishing the intraosseous pressure; the bone is revascularized through an improved periosteal circulation [61, 62, 63]. Several authors have also reported their experience with reaming [64, 65, 66, 67, 68] showing that reamed bone has considerable osteoblastic potential, equal to that of the iliac crest [66]. Frölke et al. [66] and Wenisch et al. [67] report that human reaming debris is a source of multipotent stem cells that can grow and proliferate in vitro. In a recent review, Brinker et al. [68] stated that in the cases of nonunion, insertion of a second nail after the first promotes healing as long as the canal is reamed again and a larger nail inserted. These considerations may explain the <b>corticalization</b> effect that we found in our cases.|$|E

30|$|Patients were {{followed}} up at 2 -month intervals until X-rays showed <b>corticalization</b> with bone thickness {{equal to that}} of the bone adjacent to the regenerated bone and/or consolidation of the docking site.

The limb and bone segment was assessed radiologically for axial deformity, union, and for signs of infection after nailing. Fractures after nail removal were noted. The outcome was considered excellent if the patients were fully weight-bearing, pain-free, without knee and ankle stiffness, and had a normal aligned limb without need for further surgery after the intramedullary nailing had been performed; good if the patients required more surgery to achieve union; and poor if major complications occurred according to Paley’s classification [33].

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{delineate}} the pattern of bone regeneration from cortical bone segments during distraction lengthening. The lengthening procedure was applied for various periods through the Ilizarov system on the forearms of mature dogs. Bone was sectioned either by corticotomy, preserving the nutrient artery integrity, or by osteotomy. When an osteotomy was performed, the marrow cavity was in some cases plugged with either resorbable bone wax or nonresorbable material. Under distraction, both periosteal and medullary callus on either side of the gap gave rise to new bone trabeculae. The trabeculae on either side were oriented along the direction of distraction and progressively approached one another. This striated callus emerging from both sides was the most characteristic pattern of bone regeneration subsequent to distraction lengthening. Fusion was achieved approximately four weeks after the end of the lengthening period. Most of the new bone was formed by membranous ossification; some cartilaginous nodules developed. <b>Corticalization</b> of the bone trabeculae that had begun at three months was not fully achieved at five months after the lengthening period.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} bone healing at the bone implant interface in rats with induced osteoporosis. The rats underwent a bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) and were fed a low calcium and phosphate diet. The OVX rats were divided into three groups: one was treated with raloxifene (OVX-RAL), one with alendronate (OVX-ALE), and one received no medication (OVX-NT). The control group rats (SHAM-DN) underwent sham surgery and were fed a normal diet. Each animal received one implant in each tibia: a machined surface implant in the right tibia and an implant with surface etching in the left tibia. All animals were euthanized after 42 days. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey post hoc tests were applied to the biomechanics (reverse torque) and bone implant contact (BIC) data (P < 0. 05). The RAL and ALE groups showed improved pen-implant bone healing. However, the ALE group showed no significant difference from the OVX-NT group.

Para isso foram analisados, bilateralmente, quatro cortes parassagitais de 100 exames de tomografia computadorizada de feixe cônico (TCFC). Foram realizadas mensurações lineares da profundidade da fossa submandibular e da altura e espessura ósseas. A corticalização do canal da mandíbula também foi avaliada e classificada. Os resultados indicaram que a profundidade da fossa submandibular e a espessura óssea implantar apresentaram efeitos significativos na variabilidade da amostra. Correlações entre a profundidade da fossa submandibular e a espessura óssea implantar foram observadas. Altura e espessura ósseas implantares mostraram correlação significativa negativa com a idade do paciente. Pode-se concluir que as principais variáveis responsáveis pela variabilidade da amostra foram a profundidade da fossa submandibular e a espessura óssea implantar, sendo que, quanto maior a espessura óssea, maiores foram os valores encontrados de profundidade da fossa submandibular. Fossas submandibulares pronunciadas aumentam o risco de perfuração da cortical lingual, trazendo prejuízos e riscos na instalação de implantes. Os valores de altura e espessura ósseas se correlacionaram de maneira negativa com a idade do paciente, ou seja, quando maior a idade, menores os valores de altura e espessura. Dessa forma, destacou-se a importância da análise dos cortes parassagitais de TCFC na análise e planejamento para implantes na região posterior mandibular, uma vez que, pelas variáveis estudadas, os pacientes apresentam características diferentes, só visualizadas por exame de imagem acurado. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate and correlate the anatomical features of the posterior mandibular (submandibular fossa depth, height and thickness of the alveolar bone and mandible canal <b>corticalization),</b> aimed at preventing accidents and insurance planning in implantology. Four parasagittal slices of 100 cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) were analyzed bilateraly. Linear measurements of depth of the submandibular fossa and height and thickness of the alveolar bone were performed. The mandible canal <b>corticalization</b> was also evaluated and classified. The results indicated that the depth of the submandibular fossa and thickness alveolar bone showed significant effect on the variability of the sample. Correlations between the depth of the submandibular fossa and thickness bone were observed. Height and thickness of the alveolar bone showed significant negative correlation with patient age. It can be concluded that the main variables responsible for the variability of the sample were submandibular fossa depth and thickness alveolar bone, and the higher the bone thickness, higher values were found deep submandibular fossa. Pronunced submandibular fossa increases the risk of perforation of the lingual cortical, causing losses and risks in implant placement. The values of bony height and thickness negatively correlated with age of the patient, i. e. when increasing age, smaller values for height and thickness.

In six cases (femur 4; tibia 2), the thickness of the cortical wall of the regenerate column was insufficient, and in two of these, there was, in addition, nonunion of the docking site. In the two tibial cases, nailing was carried out shortly after the fixator had been removed and after refracture of the regenerated bone had occurred due to insufficient cortical thickness. In one femur, nailing was carried out for nonunion of the docking site. Follow-up involved clinical and X-ray checks. The mean follow-up was 3.9  years (range 2 – 6  years). In all cases, union and with complete <b>corticalization</b> of the regenerate column was observed at an average 6  months after nailing (range 4 – 11  months). Infection occurred in one tibia 4  months after nailing. The infection was treated with antibiotics, and the nail was subsequently removed. We conclude that nailing is a potential solution for regenerated bone and docking site problems but, if used after prolonged periods of external fixation, may necessitate antibiotic therapy for at least 10  days after the fixator has been removed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{series of}} cases of reamed {{intramedullary}} nailings carried out after complications in regenerated bone and docking site had occurred in bone transport is pre-sented here. Nine patients (femur = 5; tibia = 4) had treatment with resection after open fractures or infection and underwent bone transport. The mean length of regen-erated bone was 9. 5 cm (range 6 – 18 cm). After bone transport, the fixator remained {{in place for a}} mean period of 12. 8 months (range 8 – 24 months). In six cases (femur 4; tibia 2), the thickness of the cortical wall of the regenerate column was insufficient, and in two of these, there was, in addition, nonunion of the docking site. In the two tibial cases, nailing was carried out shortly after the fixator had been removed and after refracture of the regenerated bone had occurred due to insufficient cortical thickness. In one femur, nailing was carried out for nonunion of the docking site. Follow-up involved clinical and X-ray checks. The mean follow-up was 3. 9 years (range 2 – 6 years). In all cases, union and with complete <b>corticalization</b> of the regenerate column was observed at an average 6 months after nailing (range 4 – 11 months). Infection occurred in one tibia 4 months after nailing. The infection was treated with antibiotics, and the nail was subsequently removed. We conclude that nailing is a potential solution for regenerated bone and docking site problems but, if used after prolonged periods of external fixation, may necessi-tate antibiotic therapy for at least 10 days after the fixator has been removed...|$|E
40|$|Movement is {{the essence}} of life. Without {{movement}} one cannotachieve anything. Consequently, during evolution, movement has been optimized to highest levels of precision. Visible sign of the evolution of movement is that more and more brain has been assigned for motor purposes. A carnivore´s motor cortex is just a `dimple' in its brain supported by merely a minimal frontal cortex. In the primate, the dimple evolved into a motor strip and shifted from an anterior to a central position, in order to accommodate more and more frontal brain. Homo sapiens neanderthalensis with his sloping forehead still had less frontal cortex than Homo sapiens sapiens. In the latter, about half the cortex is pre-rolandic, assigned to motor purposes in the broader sense, i. e. including areas that supply to motor such as premotor, prefrontal, etc. areas. These frontal supplier areas to motor are involved in functions such as motivation, preparation, volition, will, planning, foresight, active anticipation, precaution, intent to act, purposefulness, goal-directedness, etc. i. e. all these functions are frontal in location, and the function of the frontal lobes seems to be almost entirely behavour-related including - in man - all the future-related behavioural aspects. A special role may be assigned to the frontomesial cortex including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the cingulate motor area (CMA). The brain apparatus supporting motor is among the most recent and highly organized cerebral structures (neoneocortex), and the <b>corticalization</b> of movement developed in a saltatory way in primate phylogenesis. There are many movements man can perform, but basically there are only two primordial categories of movements: Self-initiated voluntary movements = actions and responsive (externally triggered) movements = re-actions. The first category is preceded by a Bereitschaftspotential, the latter occurs between S 1 and S 2 of a re-action paradigm (Walter et al. 1964). Regarding the BP, recent evidence using multichannel (64) DC-EEG (time constant [tau] = [infinity]) computer-assisted amplification proved that the earliest activity occuring is over the SMA/CMA. Only later comes the primary motor area (MI) into play. This was also shown using current source density techniques (laplacians with spline interpolation), multichannel (143) MEG and FMRI...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study onlay bone {{grafting}} in the adult rat to improve graft incorporation and perservation of graft size. In 167 adult isogeneic lewis rats, the size maintenance and bone formation at the graft-host interface of uni- and bicortical onlays positioned in various environments and treatments were investigated. The findings were assessed after four, 12 and 20 weeks with routine histology and immunohistochemistry, using antibodies against some bone and cartilage matrix proteins and proteoglycans. The immunolabelling aimed to explore the possible occurence and localization of such proteins which are essential to various stages of osteogenesis and bone repair. The main findings were: Bicortical grafts were found to retain volume better than unicortical grafts and the exposed bone-marrow space of the graft was sealed off from the surrounding connective tissue by compact bone, emanating from the cortical margins of the graft. A major improvement in graft incorporation was observed following exposure of the underlying recipient marrow. On the other hand, these grafts were occasionally markedly submerged into the recipient bed, which {{was believed to be}} due to the disappearance of its pressure-resistant outer cortical layer. The effects of limited marrow exposure by cortical perforations of the recipient bed resulted in a migration of the recipient bone marrow into the graft as well as decreased graft size diminution. A combination of cortical perforations of a bicortical graft and the host bed entailed increased graft stability and <b>corticalization</b> of the marrow. When the graft was covered by an osteopromotive expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) membrane, improved graft integration and greater size persistence was observed even after membrane removal. However, full volumetric maintenance of the graft was not accomplished in any of these studies. The combined treatment of the higher concentration (32 µg/ 80 µl) tested recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) and membrane lead to a rapid and complete graft integration and pronounced bone formation resulting in maintained or even enhanced graft size. In contrast, the application of high-dose rhBMP- 2 without a membrane resulted in loss of graft size, extensive bone resorption and only small amounts of new bone formation. Therefore, when a collagen carrier is used for rhBMP- 2 in conjunction with onlay bone grafting, our results indicate the advantage of applying a membrane to obtain graft volume persistence. The immunohistochemical labelling contributed to a more detailed picture of the mechanisms involved in graft incorporation and offered a dynamic indication of the bone repair and remodelling process as compared to routine histology...|$|E
