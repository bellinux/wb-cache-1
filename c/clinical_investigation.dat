He succeeded James Ewing, a noted oncologist. Ewing had written about cancer transplantation in 1931, a subject which Rhoads had referred to in his scandalous letter written in November of that year.

25|$|Diagnosis of food {{intolerance}} can include hydrogen breath testing for lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption, professionally supervised elimination diets, and ELISA testing for IgG-mediated immune responses to specific foods. It {{is important to}} be able to distinguish between food allergy, {{food intolerance}}, and autoimmune disease in the management of these disorders. Non-IgE-mediated intolerance is more chronic, less acute, less obvious in its clinical presentation, and often more difficult to diagnose than allergy, as skin tests and standard immunological studies are not helpful. Elimination diets must remove all poorly tolerated foods, or all foods containing offending compounds. <b>Clinical</b> <b>investigation</b> is generally undertaken only for more serious cases, as for minor complaints which do not significantly limit the person's lifestyle the cure may be more inconvenient than the problem.|$|E
25|$|Since 2011, several medical {{journals}} have declared {{that they would}} cease publishing articles related to organ transplantation operations in China due to concerns about violations of medical ethics. The Journal of <b>Clinical</b> <b>Investigation,</b> a prestigious publication on biomedical research, declared that China’s use of organs from executed prisoners “violates basic human rights. It violates core ethical precepts of transplant medicine and medical ethics. Worse still, {{some of those who}} are killed may be prisoners whose ‘crimes’ involve no more than holding certain political or spiritual beliefs.” The journal decided that it would no longer accept manuscripts on human organ transplantation “unless appropriate non-coerced consent of the donor is provided and substantiated.” A similar decision was taken by the American Journal of Transplantation (AJT).|$|E

500|$|Generally, {{penicillamine}} is {{the first}} treatment used. This binds copper (chelation) and leads to excretion of copper in the urine. Hence, monitoring {{of the amount of}} copper in the urine can be done to ensure a sufficiently high dose is taken. Penicillamine is not without problems: about 20% experience a side effect or complication of penicillamine treatment, such as drug-induced lupus (causing joint pains and a skin rash) or myasthenia (a nerve condition leading to muscle weakness). In those who presented with neurological symptoms, almost half experience a paradoxical worsening in their symptoms. While this phenomenon is observed in other treatments for Wilson's, it is usually taken as an indication for discontinuing penicillamine and commencing second-line treatment. Those intolerant to penicillamine may instead be commenced on trientine hydrochloride, which also has chelating properties. Some recommend trientine as first-line treatment, but experience with penicillamine is more extensive. A further agent, under <b>clinical</b> <b>investigation</b> by Wilson Therapeutics, with known activity in Wilson's disease is tetrathiomolybdate. [...] This is regarded as experimental, though some studies have shown a beneficial effect.|$|E
