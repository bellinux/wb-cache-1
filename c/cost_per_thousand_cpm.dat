50|$|The {{purpose of}} the CPM metric is to compare costs of {{advertising}} campaigns within and across different media. A typical advertising campaign might try to reach potential consumers in multiple locations and through various media. The <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> impressions (<b>CPM)</b> metric enables marketers to make cost comparisons between these media, both {{at the planning stage}} and during reviews of past campaigns.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> (e.g. <b>CPM</b> Group, Advertising.com), {{also known}} as <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> mille (CPM), uses pricing models that charge {{advertisers}} for impressions — i.e. {{the number of times}} people view an advertisement. Display advertising is commonly sold on a CPM pricing model. The problem with CPM advertising is that advertisers are charged even if the target audience does not click on (or even view) the advertisement.|$|R

Their {{personalized}} retargeting solution displays interactive banner advertisements, generated based on the online retail browsing preferences and products for each customer. The solution operates on a pay per click/cost per click (CPC) basis, meaning that advertisers pay only for the consumers that click on the banner and return to their website. Additional retargeting solutions operate on a <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> impressions (<b>CPM)</b> or <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> engagement (CPE) basis.|$|R
50|$|Resulting {{from the}} {{disruption}} {{created by the}} rapid growth of online advertising over the last ten years, marketing organizations have access to significantly more data to track effectiveness and ROI. This change has impacted how marketers measure the effectiveness of advertisements, as well as the development of new metrics such as <b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> click (CPC), <b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> impressions (<b>CPM),</b> <b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> action/acquisition (CPA) and click-through conversion. Additionally, multiple attribution models have evolved over time as the proliferation of digital devices and tremendous growth in data available have pushed the development of attribution technology.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe Colombian {{health care}} system has had a plan with limited benefits, but since 2012, 57 drugs {{have been added to}} this plan. ObjectivesThe {{objective}} of this article was to describe the trends of utilization and costs of medications covered by the Agreement 029 / 2011 and compare them with those that were contained in the benefits plan. MethodsThis descriptive study involved a group of 3. 8 million people affiliated with the Colombian {{health care system}}, in 110 cities from July 2011 until June 2013. The variables were new medications that were included, comparing them with homologous medications that were already in the plan, age, sex, dispensed quantities, and monthly billing. The study established the defined daily dosage <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> inhabitants <b>per</b> day, <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> inhabitants <b>per</b> day, <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> capita, and the rate of adoption or replacement medicines. ResultsThe growth in the consumption of new medications was 830. 0 %. The defined daily dosage <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> inhabitants <b>per</b> day grew from 4. 3 to 42. 9, with an increase of 905. 5 %. Medications with the highest growth were losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (15, 723 %), esomeprazole (4193 %), atorvastatin (1402 %), and sertraline (298 %). There was an increase of US $ 16. 40 in the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> inhabitants <b>per</b> day, which is equivalent to an increase of 61. 7 % and represents a rise of US $ 0. 49 in <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> capita per month. ConclusionsThe consumption behavior of new medications and the economic implications for Colombia can be demonstrated. In particular, the growth in the consumption of medications for chronic diseases can be seen, which would represent an increase of US $ 22. 6 million per month to the entire population of the country...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> {{impression}} (CPI), or [...] "cost <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> impressions" [...] (<b>CPM),</b> is a {{term used}} in traditional advertising media selection, as well as online advertising and marketing related to web traffic. It refers {{to the cost of}} traditional advertising or internet marketing or email advertising campaigns, where advertisers pay each time an ad is displayed. CPI is the cost or expense incurred for each potential customer who views the advertisement(s), while CPM refers to the cost or expense incurred for every thousand potential customers who view the advertisement(s).

5000|$|Price transparency: Let's {{examine a}} scenario. An ad network {{packages}} display inventory to an agency at say $10 CPM (<b>cost</b> <b>per</b> mille - or <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> impressions). The ad network would then buy {{a very small}} portion of the inventory on premium publications at $50 CPM and {{a large portion of the}} long tail inventory at $2 CPM. The real eCPM (effective CPM) of the campaign for the ad network is around $2.50, and is far from the agency’s claim of premium inventory. The marketer is however appeased with screen grabs of his ads appearing in premium positions, oblivious of the masquerade while the ad network walks away with a big margin.|$|R
50|$|Online, {{because of}} its {{real-time}} delivery model, is, in theory, a perfect place to execute remnant inventory deals. With historically low sell-through on a site or ad and page impressions increase dramatically and unexpectedly, having a hopper filled with remnant inventory deals {{is a great way}} to ensure you're maximizing the ad revenue off of your inventory. Often, these deals are managed over a network of sites from one centralized ad server or ad system. Cheaper deals, often CPA (<b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> Action) or CPC (<b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> Click), will often run this way and will compete against one another on a normalized basis of <b>CPM</b> (effective <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> impressions). As these impressions, by definition, are based on remnant inventory, impression levels are not guaranteed and advertisers will only pay for what they get.|$|R
5000|$|Measurement used in {{planning}} a television media buy {{based on the}} cost of a commercial time slot and the rating of the program where the time slot is positioned.

The CPGRP measurement is a way of measuring the efficiency of media cost, as compared to measuring the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> (CPT) and is generally used when making comparisons of the various broadcast vehicles.

To quantify nursery cultural influences on subsequent field performance of cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda Raf.), seedlings were grown in a greenhouse in small, medium, or large containers for three months with or without fertilization. In December 1994, seedlings were planted at a bottomland site near Milledgeville, GA with or without removal of the container soil as a method to reduce transport and planting <b>costs.</b> Estimated <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> seedlings for these practices were about $ 1225, $ 560, and $ 185 for large, medium, and small containers, respectively.

40|$|<b>CPM</b> or <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> {{impressions}} is {{the prevalent}} metric used for selling online display ads. In previous work, {{we have shown}} that the exposure duration of an ad has strong effects on the likelihood of an ad being remembered [Goldstein et al., 2011], with the first seconds of exposure having the greatest impact on memory. Because an ad pricing metric that is based on both time and impressions should be more exact than one based on impressions alone, the industry has good reasons to move towards time-based advertising. We address the following unanswered question: how should time-based ads be scheduled? We test and present one schedule that leads to greater total recollection, which advertisers want, and increased revenue, which publishers want. First, we find that presenting two short, successive ads results in more total recollection than presenting one longer ad of twice the duration. Second, we show that this effect disappears as the duration of these ads increases. Together, these findings suggest a form of timebased ad pricing that should appeal to advertisers and publishers alike. ...|$|R
