5000|$|The penal {{bond with}} {{conditional}} defeasance (hereinafter {{referred to as}} a <b>conditional</b> <b>bond,</b> conditional penal bond, or penal bond) first arose in England during the 1340s/1350’s. The <b>conditional</b> <b>bond</b> has been characterized as the dominant method for “framing substantial contracts in the later medieval and early modern periods.” [...] In fact, during the Tudor Period, actions of debt were the most numerous single class of actions in the Common Pleas rolls (and would continue to be so for the next 300 years).|$|E
5000|$|Joseph Biancalana {{has argued}} {{that there was no}} real {{advantage}} inherent in a conditional penal bond as against its competitors, and that therefore its later dominance was attributable to custom and trade practice. Robert Palmer, on the other hand, {{has argued that}} “the morality that allowed the extension of penal bonds after the Black Death [...] [...] [...] was part of the governmental concern to preserve traditional society by harshly coercing the upper classes to abide by their obligations.” [...] Irrespective of its merits, the <b>conditional</b> <b>bond</b> did overtake other forms of imposing a penalty for nonperformance of an obligation by the fifteenth century.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Conditional</b> <b>bonds</b> were {{somewhat}} easier to contest {{from the perspective}} of the obligor. Courts considered performance of the condition a valid defense to the bond. [...] By the mid-sixteenth century, the common law began to recognize a range of limited circumstances “in which non-performance of the condition was excused or a variant performance was held a sufficient defense against the bond.”; see, for example, Abbot of Cerle’s Case. Before the mid-sixteenth century, however, substantial performance (unless accepted as sufficient by the obligee), partial payment, and late payment were not accepted defenses.|$|R

5000|$|In December 2013, Folkerts-Landau {{advocated}} the ECB engage in [...] "genuine quantitative easing" [...] {{given that he}} predicted growth in the euro zone to be low [...] "pretty much {{as far as the}} eye can see,". The view was controversial as the Germany’s central bank had earlier opposed the ECB's <b>conditional</b> <b>bond</b> purchase plan. In April 2014, he reiterated his view that [...] "the ECB will eventually engage in further easing, starting with the likely purchase of private assets ('private QE') in H2 2014". In an interview with Welt Online also in April 2014, he recognised that as with other ECB programmes such as OMT (Outright Monetary Transactions), which was never used by the ECB, [...] "The decision of the central bank to talk about QE, perhaps even ensures that you never have to use it.". The ECB announced quantitative easing in January 2015.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} biased random {{walks on}} the infinite cluster of a <b>conditional</b> <b>bond</b> percolation model on the infinite ladder graph. Axelsson-Fisk and Häggström established for this model a phase transition for the asymptotic linear speed v of the walk. Namely, there exists some critical value λ_c> 0 such that v> 0 if λ∈ (0,λ_c) and v= 0 if λ>λ_c. We {{show that the}} speed v is continuous in λ on the interval (0,λ_c) and differentiable on (0,λ_c/ 2). Moreover, we characterize the derivative as a covariance. For the proof of the differentiability of v on (0,λ_c/ 2), we require and prove a central limit theorem for the biased random walk. Additionally, we prove that the central limit theorem fails to hold for λ≥λ_c/ 2...|$|E
40|$|In {{construction}} contracts, a 'performance bond' is a bond {{taken out}} by the contractor, usually with a bank or insurance company (in return for payment of a premium), {{for the benefit of}} and {{at the request of the}} employer, in a stipulated maximum sum of liability and enforceable by the employer in the event of the contractor's default, repudiation or insolvency, as stated by Nigel M Robinson et. al. in his book, Construction Law in Singapore and Malaysia. He further added that there are two types of performance bonds: <b>Conditional</b> <b>bond</b> or default bond; and Unconditional bond or on-demand bond. However, in Malaysia, for the past 20 years and since the famous case of Teknik Cekap Sdn Bhd v Public Bank Berhad [1995] 3 MLJ 449 to the recent Suharta Development Sdn Bhd v United Overseas Bank (M) Bhd & Anor [2005] 2 MLJ 762, the question of whether the performance bond in a construction contract is a conditional or an unconditional guarantees is still one of the issues relating to performance bond that has been discussed. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine the phrase(s) in the Performance Bond in a construction contract that determine whether the performance bond is a conditional or unconditional on demand guarantee. In order to achieve this objective, the research was conducted by analyzing relevant court cases. From the findings, it can be concluded that unless an undisputed meaning of the words in the performance bond to make the performance bond to be purely conditional or unconditional 'on-demand' bond, most court interpreted performance bond to be an on-demand performance bond which is only conditional upon the beneficiary asserting the basis of the claim upon the issuer of the bond contending that there has been breach of contract. ...|$|E

MI6 is unsure of Romanova's motive, but the prize of the Spektor is too tempting to ignore; Bond's superior, M, orders {{him to go to}} Turkey. Once there, Bond forms a comradeship with Darko Kerim, head of the British service's station in Turkey. Bond meets Romanova and they plan their route out of Turkey with the Spektor. He and Kerim believe her story and the three board the Orient Express. Kerim quickly discovers three Russian MGB agents on board, travelling incognito. He uses bribes and trickery to have two of them taken off the train, but he is later found dead in his compartment with the body of the third agent.|$|R
40|$|Performance bond {{is one of}} the {{important}} provisions in construction contracts. The provision requires the contractor to give the employer security for the due performance of the contract. There are two types of performance bond. The first type is called <b>conditional</b> <b>bond.</b> It is a contract guarantee whereby the surety becomes liable upon proof of breach of the terms of the main contract by principal and the beneficiary sustaining loss as a result of such a breach. The second type is unconditional or ‘ondemand’ performance bond. It is a covenant whereby the surety becomes liable merely when a demand is made upon him by the beneficiary with no necessity for the beneficiary to prove any default by the principal in performance of the main contract. The main distinction between the two types of bond is with respect to the requirement for making call on the bond. In conditional performance bond, the beneficiary must comply with conditions precedent for calling the bond. In unconditional bond, the only condition precedent is a written notice to the surety. However, the contractor may apply for injunction against the employer to restrain the employer from calling the bond or receiving any payment under the performance bond. When considering the application for injunction, the courts have to determine the presence of fraud or unconscionable conduct by the employer. In most court cases, unconscionability had been interpreted as unfairness. In determining unconscionability, the court will use the test of ‘balance of convenience’ and ‘seriously arguable and realistic inference test’. However, whether there is unconscionability depends on the facts of each case. There is no predetermined categorization. The court has to assess the whole facts of the cases to determine unconscionability. From the court cases, it can be concluded that there are two circumstances that amount to unconscionable conduct. Firstly, breach of contract by the contractor that is induced by employer’s own default such as late payment and secondly, force majeure such as typhoon and flood...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} two country, two good model with nominal rigidities, {{endogenous}} capital accumulation and incomplete markets that i) generates substantial international positions in nominal bonds and equity, ii) produces equity home bias of a realistic size, and iii) matches many important {{features of the}} international business cycle. Agents use both debt and equity to hedge fluctuations in labour income and consumption expenditures. Since bond positions hedge some of this risk, equity positions depend on the correlation with human capital and expenditure risk, <b>conditional</b> on <b>bond</b> returns. The model implies that the unconditional correlation between equity returns and human capital returns is positive, while the conditional one is negative. This {{is in line with}} the data and generates equity home bias. Monetary policy is endogenous in the model and it affects equilibrium portfolios.

Test Statistics suggest that co-movements of stock-bond returns are time-varying over the last 15 years {{in most of the}} countries in our sample. The stock-bond correlations are positively correlated with Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expectations respectively. The results show that during a period of high stock market volatility measured by the respective implied volatilities and conditional variances, there is a divergence between the stock and bond prices movement. We also found that in advanced Asian economies, there is a significant positive correlation between stock-bond returns and bond market risk as measured by the <b>conditional</b> variance of <b>bond</b> returns...|$|R

40|$|Humans {{engage in}} {{cooperative}} childcare, which includes some elements {{not found in}} other animals, such {{as the presence of}} post-reproductive helpers, extensive food sharing among adults and a pervasive sexual division of labour. In animals, cooperative offspring care has typically been studied in two different contexts. The first mainly involves helpers contributing care in cooperatively breeding family groups; the second context is allomaternal care in species usually not categorized as cooperative breeders (e. g. plural and communal breeders, often without male care). Comparative analyses suggest that cooperative breeding and allomaternal care in plural and communal breeders have distinct evolutionary origins, with humans fitting neither pathway entirely. Nevertheless, some critical proximate mechanisms of helping, including hormonal regulators, are likely to be shared across species. Other mechanisms may vary among species, such as social tolerance, proactive prosociality or <b>conditional</b> mother-infant <b>bonding.</b> These are presumably associated with specific details of the care system, such as whether all group members contribute, or whether mothers can potentially raise offspring alone. Thus, cooperative offspring care is seen in different contexts across animal lineages, but may nonetheless share several important psychological characteristics. We end by discussing how work on humans may play a unifying role in studying cooperative offspring care...|$|R
40|$|Following the reduced-form {{models of}} Duffee (1999) and Jarrow, Lando and Yu (2003), this study investigates the risk {{diversification}} issue of corporate bond portfolios. Considering especially long run market behavior, our empirical decomposition of corporate bond yield spreads {{indicates that the}} idiosyncratic component serves as a good vehicle for risk diversification. Moreover, the diosyncratic spread provides significant inferences about observed <b>conditional</b> corporate <b>bond</b> default rate, while full spread does not. Applying an affine model from Duffie and Singleton (1999), {{we find that the}} idiosyncratic credit spreads do not respond empirically to Treasury yields, unlike what is suggested in the structural model of Longstaff and Schwartz (1995) and literatures that follow. Systematic credit spreads are however positively related to Treasury yields in the long-run, but negatively so in the short run, suggesting the validity of both the tax and the option hypotheses. A long-run and optimal decomposition scheme yields an idiosyncratic credit spread measure at a median of 60 b. p. for the Baa index and is specifically compatible with Duffee’s model. It is insensitive to interest rate in the short-run, but would rise slightly with a positive shock in the long run at a rate of one to a hundred. Our findings in the study contribute to the risk practice of bond portfolio diversification. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{an economy}} with {{multiple}} sources of risk, the {{short-term interest rate}} does not capture {{all the information that}} determines the <b>conditional</b> distribution of <b>bond</b> yields. This is also true for path-dependent term structure models. In either case, the current short rate level is not a sufficient statistic for the conditional density of future short rates. This paper studies the empirical relevance of both issues from a time-series nonparametric perspective. The analysis is formulated as a test for the dependence of the short rate drift and diffusion on variables other than the short rate, and exploits Ait-Sahalia, Bickel, and Stocker (2001) dimension reduction method. The paper explores the finite sample performance of the method and applies the test to US interest rate data. Results reject a single-factor Markovian model, although conclusions are sensitive to the choice of additional conditioning variables. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{economic}} gains produced by equity (and <b>bond)</b> <b>conditional</b> strategies when the out-of-sample predictive power, R 2, {{is close to}} zero. To address this issue, we design a model which expresses {{the performance of the}} conditional strategy as a function of any given level of R 2. The relation between R 2 and performance is studied in different settings, including one and multiple assets, as well as short-selling constraints. In all cases, a level of R 2 as small as 0. 5 % is sufficient to greatly outperform the unconditional (passive) strategy. For a given R 2, the profits are much higher if the source of predictability comes from asset-selectivity rather than factor-timing. In addition, we find that under asset-selectivity, a single-asset strategy requires a very high R 2 in order to perform as well as a multi-asset strategy...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary and Incomplete. Do not distribute. Recent {{models of}} {{international}} equity portfolios exhibit two potential weaknesses: 1) {{the structure of}} equilibrium equity portfolios {{is determined by the}} correlation of equity returns with real exchange rates; yet empirically equities don’t appear to be a good hedge against real exchange rate risk; 2) Equity portfolios are highly sensitive to preference parameters. This paper solves both problems. It first shows that in more general and realistic environments, the hedging of real exchange rate risks occurs through international bond holdings since relative bond returns are strongly correlated with real exchange rate fluctuations. Equilibrium equity positions are then optimally determined by the correlation of equity returns with the return on non-financial wealth, <b>conditional</b> on the <b>bond</b> returns. The model delivers equilibrium portfolios that are well-behaved {{as a function of the}} underlying preference parameters. We find reasonable empirical support for the theory for G- 7 countries. We are able to explain short positions in domestic currency bonds for all G- 7 countries, as well as significant levels of home equity bias for the US, Japan and Canada...|$|R
40|$|This article uses {{bond market}} data to empirically test the asset pricing model of Kazemi (1992). According to this model {{the rate of}} return on a long-term, pure-discount, default-free bond will be {{perfectly}} correlated with changes in the marginal utility of the representative investor.

40|$|This article {{develops}} a rich class of discrete-time, nonlinear dynamic term structure models (DTSMs). Under the risk-neutral measure, {{the distribution of}} the state vector X t resides within a family of discrete-time affine processes that nests the exact discrete-time counterparts of the entire class of continuous-time models in Duffie and Kan (1996) and Dai and Singleton (2000). Under the historical distribution, our approach accommodates nonlinear (nonaffine) processes while leading to closed-form expressions for the conditional likelihood functions for zero-coupon bond yields. As motivation for our framework, we show that it encompasses many of the equilibrium models with habit-based preferences or recursive preferences and long-run risks. We illustrate our methods by constructing maximum likelihood estimates of a nonlinear discrete-time DTSM with habit-based preferences in which bond prices are known in closed form. We conclude that habit-based models, as typically parameterized in the literature, do not match key features of the <b>conditional</b> distribution of <b>bond</b> yields. The Author 2010.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} predictable time-variation in {{the real}} return beta of U. S. Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) and in the Sharpe ratios of both indexed and conventional <b>bonds.</b> The <b>conditional</b> mean and volatility of both <b>bonds</b> and their <b>conditional</b> correlation are first estimated from predetermined variables. These estimates are then used to compute conditional real return betas and Sharpe ratios. The time-variation in real return betas and the correlation between TIPS and nominal bonds coincides with major developments in the fixed income market. One implication of this predictability is that portfolio managers can assess more efficiently the risk of investing in TIPS versus conventional <b>bonds.</b> <b>Conditional</b> Sharpe ratios indicate that over the sample period, TIPS had superior volatility-adjusted returns relative to nominal bonds. This finding is striking {{in view of the}} absence of a major inflation scare during the sample period from February 1997 through August 2001, but is loosely consistent with the possibility that TIPS elevated rather than reduced Treasury borrowing costs. On the other hand, mean-variance spanning tests indicate that TIPS did not enhance the mean-variance efficiency of diversified portfolios.

40|$|We {{propose a}} model for the credit markets in which the random default times of bonds are assumed to be given as {{functions}} of one or more independent "market factors". Market participants are assumed to have partial information about each of the market factors, represented by the values of a set of market factor information processes. The market filtration is taken to be generated jointly by the various information processes and by the default indicator processes of the various bonds. The value of a discount bond is obtained by taking the discounted expectation {{of the value of the}} default indicator function at the maturity of the <b>bond,</b> <b>conditional</b> on the information provided by the market filtration. Explicit expressions are derived for the bond price processes and the associated default hazard rates. The latter are not given a priori as part of the model but rather are deduced and shown to be functions of the values of the information processes. Thus the "perceived" hazard rates, based on the available information, determine bond prices, and as perceptions change so do the prices. In conclusion, explicit expressions are derived for options on discount bonds, the values of which also fluctuate in line with the vicissitudes of market sentiment. ...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 2 of {{this thesis}} employs a dynamic general {{equilibrium}} with Taylor wage contracts {{to show that}} the use of strict inflation targeting as a disinflation policy may result in a slump in production and a considerable increase in macroeconomic volatility. Important determinants of the magnitude of the macroeconomic oscillations in the post-disinflation state of the economy {{turn out to be the}} size of the reduction in the inflation rate and the degree of returns to labor in the production function. In the special case of constant returns, the oscillations are large and permanent. Chapter 3 of this thesis extends the above analysis to an open-economy setting demonstrating that the exchange rate can act as a stabilizer by effectively relieving wages from part of the burden of reducing the inflation rate. The more the economy is open, the smaller the magnitude of the macroeconomic oscillations will be after the disinflation policy is applied. The policy is shown to be infeasible for all practical purposes in a closed economy with constant returns to scale when the full nonlinear model is considered. Chapter 4 of this thesis employs a Markov switching framework to allow for an interesting alternative characterization of macroeconomic news effects on the foreign exchange market. The chapter finds strong evidence for the presence of nonlinear regime switching between a high-volatility and a low volatility state driven by monetary policy announcements that come as a surprise to the market. It also uncovers significant market positioning prior to the announcements, indicating a limiting of risk exposure by market participants who are unsure about the precise outcome of the policy decisions. Chapter 5 of this thesis investigates the impact of monetary shocks on the direction and the composition of international capital flows. It identifies monetary policy shocks in a structural VAR via the pure sign restrictions approach. There are two key findings. First, a US monetary easing causes net capital inflows and a worsening of the US trade balance. Second, monetary policy shocks induce a negative conditional correlation between capital flows in bonds and equity securities. Intriguingly, they cause a negative conditional correlation between equity flows and equity returns but a positive <b>conditional</b> correlation between <b>bond</b> flows and bond returns.
