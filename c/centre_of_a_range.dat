40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interconnections}} between literacies learning, self-confidence, {{identity as a}} learner and social capital. It draws from a two-phased study of over 600 literacy and numeracy learners in Scotland that examined various aspects of their learning experiences and {{their perceptions of the}} impact that learning had on their lives. It reports on the changes in social capital and self-confidence experienced by learners between the two phases and explores the complex connections between engagement in learning and the development of self-confidence, an increasingly positive identity as a learner, and enhanced social capital. It argues that the increases in social activity and networking reported by learners had been developed through being at the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of new networks in relation to their tutors, other staff and fellow students that, in turn, have led to more engagement locally.

40|$|This thesis {{elucidates}} some of {{the ways}} in which concerns about the status of ‘the book’ at the end of the nineteenth century both inform and are, in turn, informed by the representation of books in the period’s fiction. Focusing on the work of Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, M. R. James and E. M. Forster, I argue that their fiction places a discursive ‘idea’ of the book at the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of socio-political debates in which literary texts participate and which they also help to shape. In particular, I argue that the fragmentation of dominant nineteenth-century print-cultural institutions forms an important context for these authors’ preoccupation with the ability of the written word to refract ideas and experiences it purports accurately to reflect. In Wilde’s work, for example, books are simultaneously the facilitators of panoptic surveillance and sites upon which, by asserting their right to a wholly subjective interpretation of text, readers can resist such surveillance. Stevenson’s adventure fiction is underscored by similar anxieties about the insidious formative influence of fiction – anxieties that lead him to adopt a range of metafictional strategies, designed to draw the reader’s attention to the book as the product of a specific marketplace. James and Forster’s fiction goes further, using books as the symbol of a wider epistemological crisis that underscores turn-of-the-century reading practices. Ultimately all four writers reject, in different ways, a utilitarian conception of books as repositories for knowledge about the world, to which readers’ own subjectivities must become subordinate in order to ensure a ‘right’ reading. Instead, they foreshadow modern reader response theory, presenting books as sites upon which ‘ideas’ – the product of a dynamic interaction between text and reader – are continually shaped and reshaped as they circulate within the ideologically-charged materiality of a particular historical moment...|$|E

40|$|Questions: How are the {{prevalence}} of sexual reproduction and the phenomenon of geographic parthenogenesis related to resource availability? What is the pattern in space of resource and consumer dynamics? Mathematical methods: A population dynamics model with structured resources in short supply, including <b>a</b> spatial gradient <b>of</b> consumer mortality and resource diversity. Species are modelled using quantitative genetics, combined with random mating for sexuals and clonal reproduction for asexuals. Key assumptions: Resources are limited and re-grow slowly.

Conclusions: The advantage of sexual reproduction {{is due to the}} ability of the sexual population to generate offspring that can use resources that have not been exploited for some time.

40|$|Fast-moving legged animals bounce {{along the}} ground with spring-like legs and agilely {{traverse}} variable terrain. Previous {{research has shown that}} hopping and running humans maintain the same bouncing movement <b>of</b> the body's <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> mass on <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> elastic surfaces by adjusting their spring-like legs to exactly offset changes in surface stiffness. This study investigated human hopping on damped surfaces that dissipated up to 72 % of the hopper's mechanical energy. On these surfaces, the legs did not act like pure springs. Leg muscles performed up to 24 -fold more net work to replace the energy lost by the damped surface. However, considering the leg and surface together, the combination appeared to behave like a constant stiffness spring on all damped surfaces. By conserving the mechanics of the leg-surface combination regardless of surface damping, hoppers also conserved centre-of-mass motions. Thus, the normal bouncing movements <b>of</b> the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> mass in hopping are not always <b>a</b> direct result <b>of</b> spring-like leg behaviour. Conserving the trajectory <b>of</b> the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> mass by maintaining spring-like mechanics of the leg-surface combination may be an important control strategy for fast-legged locomotion on variable terrain...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral populations often {{experience}} more extreme environmental conditions {{than those in}} the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> species' <b>range.</b> Such extreme conditions include habitat loss, defined as a reduction in the amount of suitable habitat, as well as habitat fragmentation, which involves the breaking apart of habitat independent of habitat loss. The 'threshold hypothesis' predicts that organisms will be more affected by habitat fragmentation when the amount of habitat on the landscape is scarce (i. e., less than 30 %) than when habitat is abundant, implying that habitat fragmentation may compound habitat loss through changes in patch size and configuration. Alternatively, the 'flexibility hypothesis' predicts that individuals may respond to increased habitat disturbance by altering their selection patterns and thereby reducing sensitivity to habitat loss and fragmentation. While the range of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) has contracted during recent decades, the relative importance of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation on this phenomenon is poorly understood. We used a habitat suitability model for lynx to identify suitable land cover in Ontario, and contrasted occupancy patterns across landscapes differing in cover, to test the 'threshold hypothesis' and 'flexibility hypothesis'. When suitable land cover was widely available, lynx avoided areas with less than 30 % habitat and were unaffected by habitat fragmentation. However, on landscapes with minimal suitable land cover, lynx occurrence was not related to either habitat loss or habitat fragmentation, indicating support for the 'flexibility hypothesis'. We conclude that lynx are broadly affected by habitat loss, and not specifically by habitat fragmentation, although occurrence patterns are flexible and dependent on landscape condition. We suggest that lynx may alter their habitat selection patterns depending on local conditions, thereby reducing their sensitivity to anthropogenically-driven habitat alteration...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{legislation}} {{during the}} 20 th century {{has led to}} recovering populations of large carnivores in Europe {{and we are now}} facing the challenges of managing the populations to fulfil both national and international conservation goals as well as minimizing the conflicts resulting from depredation on domestic animals on a national level. I investigated the space use by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in relation to their migrating main prey, the semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus). Based on data from radio-collared lynx individuals seasonal activity range use {{did not seem to be}} affected by the seasonal migrations of the reindeer. For example, the mean distance from the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lynx’s activity <b>range</b> one season, to the centre point in the season immediately following, did not differ significantly between seasons. The distances between centre points were about one order of magnitude shorter than the distance of the reindeer migration. Hence, lynx in northern Sweden do not appear to move with the migrating reindeer and likely sustain on stray reindeer and alternative prey during part of the year. Successful management of wildlife populations also requires appropriate monitoring of population size to make new management decisions and evaluate the consequences of previous decisions and management actions. I evaluated the effect of varying accuracy and interval of population estimates on management success. When funding is limited, managers would be better off focusing on surveys with higher precision even if that means that the interval between surveys is longer...|$|R
40|$|When {{participants}} in psychophysical experiments {{are asked to}} estimate or identify stimuli which differ on a single physical dimension, their judgments {{are influenced by the}} local experimental context — the item presented and judgment made on the previous trial. It has been suggested that similar sequential effects occur in more naturalistic, real-world judgments. In three experiments we asked participants to judge the prices <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sequence <b>of</b> items. In Experiment 1, judgments were biased towards the previous response (assimilation) but away from the true value of the previous item (contrast), a pattern which matches that found in psychophysical research. In Experiments 2 A and 2 B, we manipulated the provision of feedback and the expertise of the participants, and found that feedback reduced the effect of the previous judgment and shifted the effect of the previous item’s true price from contrast to assimilation. Finally, in all three experiments we found that judgments were biased towards the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the <b>range,</b> <b>a</b> phenomenon known as the “regression effect” in psychophysics. These results suggest that the most recently-presented item is <b>a</b> point <b>of</b> reference for the current judgment.

Their special features are high average output powers and excellent spectral properties in the 940 -nm spectral region relevant for monitoring very low water vapour contents in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. One system is an injection-seeded pulsed Ti:sapphire ring laser with <b>a</b> spectral bandwidth <b>of</b> 105 MHz and <b>an</b> average power <b>of</b> 1. 1 W.

40|$|Glacial {{environments in}} the Arctic are a much-studied topic {{as well as}} <b>a</b> field <b>of</b> {{research}} with strong influences regarding the current and future global climate of our planet. This report {{is focused on the}} meteorological conditions on Nordenskiöldbreen glacier from 2009 - 2015 and how they correlate with each other, the glacier surface and the surrounding terrain.  With data gathered from an automatic weather station located at the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the glacier, <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> meteorological parameters is examined; wind direction and velocity, snow depth, cloud cover, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation, temperature deficit, albedo and drifting snow.  Seasonal differences were discovered, especially for wind direction and velocity where winds from the northeast occurred more frequently in the winter, indicating katabatic winds, whereas winds from the west and southwest were more pronounced in the summer. The calculated temperature deficit shows that katabatic winds blow down-glacier under stably stratified conditions and are shown to increase in strength with increasing temperature deficit (atmospheric temperature minus surface temperature). The mean albedo at Nordenskiöldbreen during this period is within the expected limits, 0. 8 for snow and 0. 3 for ice and the cloud cover was 0. 58. Additionally, it could be observed that the occurrence of dry, drifting snow is present in the winter season as snow depth shows pronounced drops during high-wind events in winter.  Overall, it is concluded that most of the examined parameters correlate and need each other to function and act as mechanisms within the cryosphere and as such it is crucial for scientists to understand their connected relationships when attempting to study global climate changes...|$|R
40|$|We present HST/COS {{observations}} of highly ionized absorption lines {{associated with a}} radio-loud QSO at z= 1. 1319. The absorption system has multiple velocity components, tracing gas that is largely outflowing from the QSO at velocities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few 100 km s^- 1. There is <b>an</b> unprecedented <b>range</b> in ionization, with detections of HI, NIII, NIV, NV, OIV, OIV*, OV, OVI, NeVIII, MgX, SV and ArVIII. We estimate the total hydrogen number density from the column density ratio N(OIV*) /N(OIV) to be (n_H/cm^ 3) ∼ 3. Assuming photoionization equilibrium, we derive a distance to the absorbing complex of 2. 3 <R< 6. 0 kpc from the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the QSO. <b>A</b> <b>range</b> in ionization parameter, covering ∼ 2 orders of magnitude, suggest absorption path lengths in the range 10 ^- 4. 5 <l_abs< 1 pc. In addition, the absorbing gas only partially covers the background emission from the QSO continuum, which suggests clouds with transverse sizes l_trans< 10 ^- 2. 5 pc. Widely differing absorption path lengths, combined with covering fractions less than unity across all ions pose a challenge to models involving simple cloud geometries. These issues may be mitigated {{by the presence of}} non-equilibrium effects, together with the possibility of multiple gas temperatures. The dynamics and expected lifetimes of the gas clouds suggest that they do not originate from close to the AGN, but are instead formed close to their observed location. Their inferred distance, outflow velocities and gas densities are broadly consistent with scenarios involving gas entrainment or condensations in winds driven by either supernovae, or the supermassive black hole accretion disc. In the case of the latter, the present data most likely does not trace the bulk of the outflow by mass, which could instead manifest itself as an accompanying warm absorber, detectable in X-rays.

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). AimUnderstanding spatial {{variation}} in the demographic and genetic structure of populations is central to explaining causes of species range limits and to species conservation. The Abundant Centre Hypothesis (ACH) predicts that as one {{moves away from the}} <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> species' biogeographical <b>range,</b> populations become less frequent and more isolated, as well as exhibiting decreasing within-population density. This increased isolation may lead to reduced genetic variability in peripheral populations by limiting gene flow. In this study, we asked whether the frequency, within-population density and genetic diversity of Cirsium canescens (Platte thistle) populations decreased from the range centre to the edge, as predicted by the ACH. LocationCentral United States, including portions of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. MethodsFrequency of population occurrence at regional and landscape scales, within-population density, and within-population genetic variation were evaluated along eight centre-edge transects within the species' distribution. Leaf tissue samples were collected from each population to establish genetic variability using six simple sequence repeat loci. ResultsConsistent with the ACH, peripheral regions of C. canescens' range were less likely to contain populations than central regions. In regions where C. canescens did occur, however, frequency <b>of</b> populations at <b>a</b> landscape scale peaked at intermediate distances from centre and within-population density was unrelated to distance. Populations exhibited reduced genetic variability towards range edges. Main conclusionsThe ACH underestimates the complexity of the relationship between variation in abundance and genetic diversity with distance from C. canescens' range centre. Decreases in Platte thistle population frequency combined with no decreases in within-population density near range edges suggest that quality habitat exists in the peripheral range, but these patches are rarer. Although genetic variability was reduced at the distribution edges, this decline was stronger towards the western edge, associated with increased topographic complexity.

The form of verbatim theatre discussed is primarily that deriving from personal interview material and the predominant thesis focus is one of Australasian context and practice. The thesis is in two separate sectons with strongly related aims; the first section aiming to clarify and support the second. The first section answers questions about verbatim theatre evolution, processes and practices through both reviews of literature and interviews with prominent practitioners. It reveals vitality and diversity in VT practice, {{breadth and depth of}} scholarship in both Australia and New Zealand. It illuminates the processes and practices of creating and performing a verbatim play to support those who may consider doing so. The second section describes and evaluates the performance of re-presentations in August 2015 of the VT play We’ll Meet Again. This play had been developed in 1994 from interviews with war veterans to create a theatrical event honouring a generation whose common experience was involvement in the Second World War. The actors in the re-presentation were all students at Toi Whakaari:New Zealand Drama School and the show was performed in nine venues over six days. Audiences were predominantly elderly although those at community <b>centre</b> venues were <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> ages. Tools used to evaluate the performances included audience survey forms with room for written comments, observations of audience responses and verbal feedback and interviews with actors. The remarkably positive survey responses and powerful written and oral testimony support the argument that <b>a</b> re-presentation <b>of</b> verbatim theatre has the potential to reinstate and broaden further the impact, appeal, value and aims of the original work. This argument is further supported with the formation of guidelines to present research findings as well as supporting, in a practical and immediate way, those embarking on re-presentation. <b>A</b> selection <b>of</b> images and performance video, illustrating the context and findings of the research are included in the thesis document...|$|R
40|$|The {{concepts}} of centrality and nodality {{are often used}} interchangeably, though this is incorrect from the theoretical point of view (Nowosielska, 1992; Preston, 1970) and leads to discrepant interpretations. Centrality is only part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more broadly-understood nodality, and would seem to offer a more adequate basis upon which to determine the ranks of towns and cities, since it expresses {{their relationship with the}} baseby way of the formula N=C+L, where N is nodality, C – centrality and L – local consumption. The degree of nodality and centrality has been established via the assumption underpinning economic base theory which holds that employment in each town or city consists of endogenous and exogenous components. Nodality has been defined as the weighted total employment in activities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> central character, as opposed to centrality, which is the exogenous component to that employment. The levels <b>of</b> <b>an</b> urban hierarchy distinguished {{on the basis of these}} indexes are disparate (Figs 1 – 3), proportionally the greatest discrepancies being those found in smaller cities where there is no surplus employment at all, and consequently a zero centrality level and above-zero nodality level. On the basis of differences in centrality, it was possible to distinguish five hierarchy orders for towns and cities (with populations in excess of 20, 000 in 2001) : I. national – the state's capital city, II. regional – <b>centres</b> whose range <b>of</b> influence stretches over an area approximating that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> province or extending wider, III. sub-regional – i. e. less-developed regional <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rank or <b>range</b> <b>of</b> services placing them above county centres (IV) in the functional hierarchy, and V. – mesoregional centres, represented mainly by county centres and characterized by highly-differentiated degrees of development of service functions. The rank <b>of</b> highly-developed mesoregional <b>centres</b> (IV) has mainly been achieved by the provincial capitals downgraded in 1999. <b>A</b> set <b>of</b> determinants has been established on the basis of correlation analysis. The strong dependence of centrality and nodality upon the number <b>of</b> inhabitants in <b>a</b> town or city has been corroborated, that of the latter being much stronger, since the endogenous component of employment has been taken into account. The hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relatively higher level of development of services in administrative centres has been verified, while the existence of certain economic regularities (such as the effect of number of inhabitants of the service area on town centrality) has been corroborated. On the other hand, a hypothesis regarding the effect of the potential level of local consumption (Gross National Product per capita) on centrality and nodality has not in general been sustained. The remaining determinants are difficult to quantify; these including transport availability, locational attractiveness, a historical factor, and a random element...|$|R
