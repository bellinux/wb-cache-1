60|$|She {{opened her}} eyes very wide and <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on one side, looking at him with indescribable archness.|$|E
60|$|Instantly Jenny Wren popped {{her head}} out of her doorway. She <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on one side to listen, then looked down at Peter, and her sharp little eyes snapped.|$|E
6000|$|As a {{confession}} of Zo's first love, this was irresistible. Carmina burst out laughing. Zo indignantly claimed a hearing. [...] "I haven't done yet!" [...] she burst out. [...] "The boy dances. Like this." [...] She <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and slapped her thigh, and imitated the boy. [...] "And sometimes he sings!" [...] she cried with another outburst of admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's this?" [...] cried Mrs. Tuke, <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on one side. [...] "Music! A mandoline! How extraordinary! Do {{you think}} it's a serenade?--" [...] And {{she lifted her}} brows archly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, it's a great secret, but Maura {{told me in}} the cloakroom. It {{is because}} Mr. Frank wants to be her---to be her---her admirer,' said Valetta, <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on one side, and adding to the already crimson colour of her cheeks.|$|R
60|$|He heard lively {{voices from}} the library above. He entered a room to be lived in and be happy in, with a jolly fire on the hearth and {{friendly}} people on a big, brown davenport. Ruth Winslow smiled at him from behind the Colonial silver and thin cups on the tea-table, and as he saw her light-filled eyes, saw <b>her</b> <b>cock</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> gaily in welcome, he was again convinced {{that he had found}} a playmate.|$|R
6000|$|It was not {{the wind}} at her back, it was the thrust of Bjornstam's scorn which carried her through town. She faced Juanita Haydock, <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> at Maud Dyer's brief nod, and came home to Bea radiant. She telephoned Vida Sherwin to [...] "run over this evening." [...] She lustily played Tschaikowsky--the virile chords an echo of the red {{laughing}} philosopher of the tar-paper shack.|$|E
40|$|Dores McCree {{made your}} day {{a little better}} {{whenever}} she walked into a room. When you talked with her, you knew her goal was simply to enjoy your company, not to {{get something out of}} you, and not to show herself off. She was good at talking and good at listening. She 2 ̆ 7 d <b>cock</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slightly and ask questions to which she really cared about the answers. On more than one occasion, I had to jockey with others to be able to sit with her at a dinner...|$|R
6000|$|Jenny Wren <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> pert little <b>head</b> on one side, and her sharp little eyes snapped. [...] "Why don't {{you learn}} to swim, Peter, like your cousin down in the Sunny South?" [...] she demanded. [...] "If {{he had been in}} your place, he would simply have plunged into the Smiling Pool and laughed at Reddy Fox." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{and by the}} Painted Lady {{came along}} the road. She was a little woman, brightly dressed, so fragile that a collie might have knocked her over with his tail, {{and she had a}} {{beautiful}} white-and-pink face, the white ending of a sudden {{in the middle of her}} neck, where it met skin of a duller color. As she tripped along with mincing gait, she was speaking confidentially to herself, but when she saw Dite grinning, she seemed, first, afraid, and then sorry for herself, and then she tried to carry it off with a giggle, <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> impudently at him. Even then she looked childish, and a faded guilelessness, with many pretty airs and graces, still lingered about her, like innocent birds loath to be gone from the spot where their nest has been. When she had passed monotony again reigned, and Dite crossed to the smithy window, though none of the letters could be for him. He could read the addresses on six of them, but the seventh lay on its back, and every time he rose on his tip-toes to squint down at it, the spout pushed his bonnet over his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{wherefore}} {{should not}} I {{go to the}} wars," [...] she cried, [...] "and fight beside the Maid? I am as tall as she, if scantly so strong, and brave--oh, I am very brave Glacidas, I bid you beware!" [...] she said, putting the archer's bonnet gallantly <b>cocked</b> on <b>her</b> beautiful <b>head,</b> and drawing forth the sword from his scabbard, as one in act to fight, but in innocent unwarlike wise.|$|R
60|$|The mare {{had raised}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> ears at the {{rustling}} of a quail in the thicket. Chris {{leaned over and}} rubbed around her ears. Dolly's enjoyment was evident, and she drooped <b>her</b> <b>head</b> over against the shoulder of his own horse.|$|R
60|$|They {{were not}} far away, but too {{taken up with}} each other to see me. She was walking slowly, with the little petulant <b>cock</b> of <b>her</b> dainty <b>head</b> which I knew so well, casting her eyes away from him, and {{shooting}} out a word from time to time. He paced along beside her, looking down at her and bending his head in the eagerness of his talk. Then as he said something, she placed her hand with a caress upon his arm, and he, carried off his feet, plucked her up and kissed her again and again. At the sight I could neither cry out nor move, but stood, with a heart of lead and the face of a dead man, staring down at them. I saw her hand passed over his shoulder, and that his kisses were as welcome to her as ever mine had been.|$|R
60|$|Thus, in an undertone, I {{tell you}} that my little Jenny, as she is zealously and {{systematically}} arranging the fire, and trimly whisking every untidy particle of ashes from the hearth, shows in every movement of her little hands, in the <b>cock</b> of <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> in the knowing, observing glance of her eye, and in all her energetic movements, that her small person is endued and {{made up of the}} very expressed essence of housewifeliness,--she is the very attar, not of roses, but of housekeeping. Care-taking and thrift and neatness are a nature to her; she is as dainty and delicate in her person as a white cat, as everlastingly busy as a bee; and all the most needful faculties of time, weight, measure, and proportion ought to be fully developed in her skull, if there is any truth in phrenology. Besides all this, she has a sort of hard-grained little vein of common sense, against which my fanciful conceptions and poetical notions are apt to hit with just a little sharp grating, if they are not well put. In fact, this kind of woman needs carefully to be idealized in the process of education, or she will stiffen and dry, as she grows old, into a veritable household Pharisee, a sort of domestic tyrant. She needs to be trained in artistic values and artistic weights and measures, to study all the arts and sciences of the beautiful, and then she is charming. Most useful, most needful, these little women: they have the centripetal force which keeps all the domestic planets from gyrating and frisking in unseemly orbits, and, properly trained, they fill a house with the beauty of order, the harmony and consistency of proportion, the melody of things moving in time and tune, without violating the graceful appearance of ease which Art requires.|$|R
60|$|The {{old lady}} rose, <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> black eyebrows and her silver crest at us for an instant.|$|R
6000|$|Jenny Wren <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> tail {{up in that}} saucy way of {{hers and}} winked at Johnny Chuck. [...] "The way he can fly," [...] said she softly.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} of the daughter of the last Navajo chief, Chief Manuelito, ca. 1901. From the waist up. She sits outside in front of an adobe brick wall. A blanket with a stripe and diamond pattern is pulled around her shoulders and over her lap. She is wearing a dark shirt, long beaded necklaces around her neck, and bracelets on both forearms. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> is <b>cocked</b> to <b>her</b> left as she peers straight ahead...|$|R
60|$|I {{hammered}} fresh charges into my pistols after I {{had turned}} this {{over in my}} head. Then I put {{them back in the}} holsters, and I examined my little mare, she jerking <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> ears the while, as if to tell me that an old soldier like herself did not make a fuss about a scratch or two. The first shot had merely grazed her off-shoulder, leaving a skin-mark, as if she had brushed a wall. The second was more serious. It had passed through the muscle of her neck, but already it had ceased to bleed. I reflected that if she weakened I could mount Montluc's grey, and meanwhile I led him along beside us, for he was a fine horse, worth fifteen hundred francs at the least, {{and it seemed to me}} that no one had a better right to him than I.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Minnow <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> head: [...] "Mister Picklepip," [...] she said, [...] "Do {{you ever}} think to wed?" [...] Town of Dae by the sea, [...] No fair lady ever made a [...] Wicked speech like that to me! ...|$|R
60|$|The queer {{gestures}} {{and sounds of}} a hen looking about {{for a place to}} deposit her egg; her self-important gait; the sideway turn of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and <b>cock</b> of <b>her</b> eye, as she pries into one and another nook, croaking all the while,--evidently with the idea that the egg in question {{is the most important thing}} that has been brought to pass since the world began. A speckled black and white and tufted hen of ours does it to most ludicrous perfection; and there is something laughably womanish in it too.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Mrs. Paul de Longpre, Hollywood, ca. 1908. Mrs. de Longpre is pictured in bust facing straight ahead. Diaphanous edging is visible at {{the collar of}} her dress. She wears her dark hair up, while her lips appear slightly parted {{as if to say}} something. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> is <b>cocked</b> back from <b>her</b> shoulders as though she is shying away from something. She appears no older than middle age...|$|R
40|$|In the Bag,” One Time, One Place, p.   59, {{with the}} gracious {{permission}} of the Eudora Welty FoundationA heavy set, middle-aged black woman clutches a paper bag in her right hand; her left hand is slightly <b>cocked</b> by <b>her</b> side, {{as if she has}} just gestured with it. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> is tilted to the left as well, her right eye hidden by her straw hat, which is also cocked to the side. She wears a broad smile and her Sunday best, a pleated, cotton shirt waist. A sense of mystery pervades the photo. What has [...] ...|$|R
60|$|So another donkey was procured, {{this time}} with a man's saddle, and putting her foot in the stirrup, she <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> leg over and took her seat triumphantly. Neither modesty nor bashfulness was to be {{reckoned}} among Liza's faults, and in this position she felt quite at ease.|$|R
60|$|The queer things my aunt {{said were}} {{nothing to the}} queer things she didn't say. I {{remember}} her in our drawing-room one day, and how she <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> eye--it's the only expression--at the India-rubber plant in a Doulton-ware pot which Marion had placed {{on the corner of}} the piano.|$|R
60|$|They {{had just}} passed {{the door when}} I emerged, and they receded, at a slow pace and {{with a kind of}} {{confidential}} nearness, down the long avenue of the lobby. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> was always high and her husband's always low, so that I couldn't be sure--it might have been only my fancy--that the contrast of this habit was more marked in them than usual. If I had known nothing about them I should have just unimaginatively said that talk was all on one side and attention all on the other. I, of course, for that matter, did know nothing about them; yet I recall how it came to me, as my extemporised shrewdness hung in their rear, that I mustn't think anything too grossly simple of what might be taking place between them. My position was, in spite of myself, that of my having mastered enough possibilities to choose from. If one of these might be--for her face, in spite of the backward <b>cock</b> of <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> was turned to him--that she was looking her time of life straight at him and yet making love to him with it as hard as ever she could, so another was that he had been already so thoroughly got back into hand that she had no need of asking favours, that she was more splendid than ever, and that, the same poor Briss as before his brief adventure, he was only feeling afresh in his soul, as a response to her, the gush of the sacred fount. Presumptous choice as to these alternatives failed, on my part, in time, let me say, to flower; it rose before me in time that, whatever might be, for the exposed instant, the deep note of their encounter, only one thing concerned me in it: its being wholly their own business. So for that I liberally let it go, passing into the corridor, but proceeding in the opposite sense and aiming at an issue which I judged I should reach before they would turn in their walk. I had not, however, reached it before I caught the closing of the door furthest from me; at the sound of which I looked about to find the Brissendens gone. They had not remained for another turn, but had taken their course, evidently, back to the principal drawing-room, where, no less presumably, the procession of the ladies bedward was even then forming. Mrs. Briss would fall straight into it, and I had accordingly lost her. I hated to appear to pursue her, late in the day as it may appear to affirm that I put my dignity before my curiosity.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the black}} furrow {{of a field}} [...] I saw an old witch-hare this night; [...] And she <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> lissome ear, [...] And she eyed the moon so bright, [...] And she nibbled o' the green; [...] And I whispered 'Whsst! witch-hare,' [...] Away like a ghostie o'er the field [...] She fled, and left the {{moonlight}} there.|$|R
40|$|Before long Sally Senior will <b>cock</b> <b>her</b> {{mortar board}} over her newly waved tresses, trip nonchalantly across the platform, receive a diploma with almost eager hands, and {{walk back to}} her seat as Sarah Alum. Graduation gifts she really likes will do much toward making the jump from Sally to Sarah seem the momentous and joyous {{occasion}} it really should be...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes--but I don't keer for that." [...] She <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> hat {{a little}} audaciously, but Brice noticed that her arms {{afterwards}} dropped {{at her side}} with the same weary gesture he had observed before. [...] "Whenever I go into shops it's always 'Yes, miss,' and 'No, miss,' and 'Certainly, Miss Dimwood.' Oh, they're mighty respectful. I reckon they allow that Snapshot Harry's rifle carries far." ...|$|R
60|$|Altiora {{compressed}} {{her lips}} and shook <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> She always did shake <b>her</b> <b>head</b> when you asked that of anyone.|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{over the}} car. Little was hanging {{at the end}} of a long rope. She put <b>her</b> <b>head</b> back again.|$|R
60|$|MITCHENER (groaning). Clouted <b>her</b> <b>head!</b> These {{women are}} making the army as lawless as themselves. Clouted <b>her</b> <b>head</b> indeed! A purely civil procedure.|$|R
60|$|Miss Maud waltzed playfully {{around the}} room, her hands above <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> She put <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{out of the}} door and called into the bar.|$|R
60|$|Mrs General made {{a slight}} {{inclination}} of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to Fanny, {{who made a}} very low inclination of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to Mrs General, and came loftily upright again.|$|R

40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Santa Margaret", by Correggio, ca. 1900. The saint is shown from her upper torso to <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and is turned to the right towards an open book that she is holding. She has long dark hair that is tied behind <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and is wearing a long-sleeved dark robe. She has a halo around <b>her</b> <b>head...</b>|$|R
