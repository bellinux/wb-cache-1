5|$|Millet cultivation: The {{discovery}} in northern China of domesticated varieties of broomcorn and foxtail millet from 8500 BC, or earlier, suggests that millet cultivation might have predated that of rice {{in parts of}} Asia. Clear evidence of millet began to cultivate by 6500 BC at sites of Cishan, Peiligang and Jiahu. Archaeological remains from Cishan sum up to over 300 storage pits, 80 with millet remains, with a total millet storage capacity estimated for the site of about 100,000kg of grain. By 4000 BC, most Yangshao areas were using an intensive form of foxtail millet cultivation, complete with storage pits and finely prepared tools for digging and harvesting the crop. The success of the early <b>Chinese</b> <b>millet</b> farmers is still reflected today in the DNA of many modern East Asian populations, such {{studies have shown that}} the ancestors of those farmers probably arrived in the area between 30,000 and 20,000 BP, and their bacterial haplotypes are still found in today populations throughout East Asia.|$|E
5000|$|Setaria faberi, the Japanese bristlegrass, nodding bristle-grass, Chinese foxtail, <b>Chinese</b> <b>millet,</b> giant bristlegrass, giant foxtail or nodding foxtail, is an Asian grass. It is {{a summer}} annual, with plants {{emerging}} from {{seeds in the}} spring, and setting seeds {{in the late summer}} or fall.|$|E
50|$|Early {{evidence}} for <b>Chinese</b> <b>millet</b> agriculture is dated to around 7000 BC, with the earliest evidence of cultivated rice found at Chengtoushan near the Yangtze River, dated to 6500 BC. Chengtoushan {{may also be}} the site of the first walled city in China. This Neolithic Revolution gave rise to the Jiahu culture (7000 to 5800 BC). Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (6600 BC) are the earliest form of proto-writing in China. However, it is likely that they should not be understood as writing itself, but as features of a lengthy period of sign-use which led eventually to a fully-fledged system of writing. Excavation of a Peiligang culture site in Xinzheng county, Henan, found a community that flourished in 5500 to 4900 BC, with evidence of agriculture, constructed buildings, pottery, and burial of the dead. With agriculture came increased population, the ability to store and redistribute crops, and the potential to support specialist craftsmen and administrators. In late Neolithic times, the Yellow River valley began to establish itself as a center of Yangshao culture (5000 to 3000 BC), and the first villages were founded. Later, Yangshao culture was superseded by the Longshan culture, which was also centered on the Yellow River from about 3000 to 2000 BC. The earliest bronze artifacts have been found in the Majiayao culture site (3100 to 2700 BC).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Chinese</b> <b>millets</b> (Panicum miliaceum, and Setaria italica), rice, as well {{as other}} crops {{travelled}} the opposite way through the Corridor, and reached western Asia and Europe from the fifth millennium to the second millennium BC.|$|R
30|$|This {{has already}} been {{reviewed}} more extensively above (Fig.  4). This clearly {{took place in the}} context of growing central Asian trade, including most proximally to South Asia the Batria–Margiana Archaeological Complex of fortified cities, and a broader Middle Asian Interaction sphere (Fig.  7), by which <b>Chinese</b> Panicum <b>millet</b> was to reach Yemen and Sudan by 2000 – 1700 BC (Boivin and Fuller 2009). Even if, genetically, the Panicum millets of South Asia prove on the whole to have a larger genetic input from a distinct west/central Asian Panicum domestication, there was still some genetic input from <b>Chinese</b> <b>millets</b> (see Hunt et al. 2011), and the spread of crops into northwestern South Asia was clearly important just after 4, 000  years ago. This period was also one of transportation revolutions on the margins of South and Central Asia, including the first clear evidence for the use of Bactrian camels and horses in the Indus region (Meadow 1996). These processes of trade and improved means of transport probably facilitated some of the waves of Indo-Aryans who came into South Asia. This was also an era of drier climate (Madella and Fuller 2006) that may have pushed people from the deserts of central Asia towards the wetter valleys like the Indus and into the monsoon zone. Although they are symptomatic of the same processes, {{there is no reason to}} postulate a direct connection between Indo-Aryan arrival and japonica rice arrival in South Asia.|$|R
40|$|We report {{directly}} dated {{evidence from}} circa 1400 calibrated years (cal) B. C. {{for the early}} use of wheat, barley, and flax as staple crops on {{the borders of the}} Tibetan Plateau. During recent years, an increasing amount of data from the Tibetan Plateau and its margins shows that a transition from millets to wheat and barley agriculture took place during the second millennium B. C. Using thermal niche modeling, we refute previous assertions that the ecological characteristics of wheat and barley delayed their spread into East Asia. Rather, we demonstrate that the ability of these crops to tolerate frost and their low growing degree-day requirements facilitated their spread into the high-altitude margins of western China. Following their introduction to this region, these crops rapidly replaced <b>Chinese</b> <b>millets</b> and became the staple crops that still characterize agriculture in this area today.

40|$|Multiproxies of past {{environmental}} conditions, comprising 53 sediment samples {{analysed for}} their lithostratigraphic properties (mainly their charcoal, phytoliths and pollen contents) from an AMS C- 14 -dated sequence of sediments accumulating at Guangfulin, Yangtze delta, are presented. The oldest sediments recovered {{date to the}} Lateglacial when a mosaic of mixed (conifer-deciduous) temperate forest and wetland vegetation characterized the Study area. The Lateglacial-Holocene transition {{and much of the}} early Holocene record to c. 7400 yr BP appears to be missing from the sequence. The earliest evidence possibly representing human activities in the study area (the remains of cereals and indicators of forest) date to c. 7000 yr BP. A large increase in macrocharcoal remains c. 4700 yr BP is a more certain indication of human activities close to the study site, and may indicate the first occupation of what is now the location of a major archaeological excavation at Guangfulin. Technological changes during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 - 221 Bc) may be responsible for an increased abundance of rice (Oryza sp.), and possibly also foxtail or <b>Chinese</b> <b>millet</b> (Setaria italica), detected in the Guangfulin record after c. 2400 yr BP. An abrupt sedimentary change at c. 4000 yr BP may represent a short-lived episode of catchment instability. Aside front this, the sediment record from Guangfulin contains no evidence of dramatic environmental changes that could have led to a major decline in agricultural productivity c. 4000 yr BP, as has been suggested for the lower Yangtze by some researchers, who associate this with the cultural transition from Liangzhu to Maqiao. The findings do, however, add weight to the argument that developments in rice-based agriculture on the Yangtze delta varied both spatially and temporally. © 2007, SAGE Publication...|$|E
25|$|Although {{the bulk}} of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also {{purchased}} New World crops from the Spanish Empire. This included sweet potatoes, maize, and peanuts, foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional <b>Chinese</b> staple crops—wheat, <b>millet,</b> and rice—couldn't grow, hence facilitating {{a rise in the}} population of China.

30|$|There are few archaeological {{projects}} incorporating archaeobotanical {{sampling and}} even fewer published archaeobotanical studies in Thailand. Available data show that rice was the ubiquitous cereal in prehistory and particularly during the Metal/Iron Age. This either signifies the importance of rice as a crop or signals a preservation bias; both topics are considered in this paper. The site Khao Sam Kaeo in Peninsular Thailand (ca. 400 – 100 BCE) is strategically located between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea providing evidence of Indian, Han Chinese and locally produced cultural material. The archaeobotanical assemblage attests to South Asian and East Asian influence as well: the mungbean and horsegram of Indian origin and the northern <b>Chinese</b> cereal foxtail <b>millet.</b> But the site has also yielded {{the greatest amount of}} rice from Thai archaeology and provides information on the domestication of rice and the cultivation practices during this Late Prehistoric period.|$|R
50|$|Foxtail Millet {{is known}} to have been the first domesticated <b>millet.</b> <b>Chinese</b> legends {{attribute}} the domestication of millet to Shennong, the legendary Emperor of China. Similarly, millets have been mentioned in some of the oldest extant Yajurveda texts, identifying foxtail millet (priyangava), Barnyard millet (aanava) and black finger millet (shyaamaka), indicating that millet consumption was very common, pre-dating to 4500 BC, during the Indian Bronze Age. Specialized archaeologists called palaeoethnobotanists, relying on data such as the relative abundance of charred grains found in archaeological sites, hypothesize that the cultivation of millets was of greater prevalence in prehistory than rice, especially in northern China and Korea. Millets also formed important parts of the prehistoric diet in Indian, Chinese Neolithic and Korean Mumun societies. Broomcorn (Panicum miliaceum) and foxtail millet were important crops beginning in the Early Neolithic of China. For example, some of the earliest evidence of millet cultivation in China was found at Cishan (north). Cishan dates for common millet husk phytoliths and biomolecular components have been identified around 8300-6700 BC in storage pits along with remains of pit-houses, pottery, and stone tools related to millet cultivation. Evidence at Cishan for foxtail millet dates back to around 6500 BC. A 4,000-year-old well-preserved bowl containing well-preserved noodles made from foxtail millet and broomcorn millet was found at the Lajia archaeological site in China.|$|R
40|$|China is {{a leading}} country in the {{production}} of several minor cereals such as foxtail millet, Job's tears, naked oat, and naked barley. Sorghum and proso millet have also contributed greatly to <b>Chinese</b> agriculture. Foxtail <b>millet,</b> sorghum, barley, and proso millet were widely grown as major crops 60  years ago, and the reduction in their cultivation area reflects historical changes in Chinese agriculture over the past decades. Systematic germplasm collections from the 1950 s to the 1990 s gathered more than 66, 690 accessions of these minor cereals, and for some of them, the Chinese germplasm collections are the largest in the world; for example, the 27, 700 accessions of foxtail millet. Germplasm evaluations of each cereal species have focused mainly on drought tolerance, nutritional quality, and resistance to their main diseases. Comparisons among lines and selection of those with desirable traits were the main breeding methods for minor cereals in the 1950 s and 1960 s, but these methods were replaced by crossbreeding in the 1970 s. Newly developed cultivars have greatly changed the production situation, and many super cultivars have become milestones in crop breeding history. In this review, we describe the distribution and ecoregions, origin and domestication, and landmark varieties of several minor cereals in China. Nearly all of the minor cereals are drought-tolerant and fertilizer-efficient. The requirements for environmentally friendly crops and a more diverse food supply for humans and animals provide new opportunities to cultivate minor cereals in the drier and warmer environmental conditions that are predicted in the future...|$|R
