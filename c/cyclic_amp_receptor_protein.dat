50|$|The genes {{regulated}} by CRP are mostly involved in energy metabolism, such as galactose, citrate, or the PEP group translocation system. In Escherichia coli, <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CRP) can regulate the transcription {{of more than}} 100 genes.|$|E
5000|$|PBAD [...] (systematically araBp) is a {{promoter}} {{found in}} bacteria and especially {{as part of}} plasmids used in laboratory studies. The promoter {{is a part of}} the arabinose operon whose name derives from the genes it regulates transcription of: araB, araA, and araD. In E. coli, the PBAD promoter is adjacent to the PC promoter (systematically araCp), which transcribes the araC gene in the opposite direction. araC encodes the AraC protein, which regulates activity of both the PBAD and PC promoters. The <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> CAP binds between the PBAD and PC promoters, stimulating transcription of both when bound by cAMP.|$|E
40|$|Two acid-inducible genes, aniC and aciK, {{that require}} {{anaerobiosis}} and tyrosine for expression {{were identified as}} orf 326 a encoding a potential amino acid/polyamine antiporter and hyaB encoding hydrogenase I, respectively. <b>Cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>protein,</b> cAMP, and TyrR, regulator of aromatic amino acid metabolism, were strong positive regulators of both genes...|$|R
40|$|CooA is a heme-containing {{transcriptional}} activator {{that enables}} Rhodospirillum rubrum to sense and grow on CO as a sole energy source. We {{have identified a}} number of CooA homologs through database searches, expressed these heterologously in Escherichia coli, and monitored their ability to respond to CO in vivo. Further in vitro analysis of two CooA homologs from Azotobacter vinelandii and Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans corroborated the in vivo data by revealing the ability of CO to bind to these hemoproteins and stimulate their binding at specific DNA sequences. These data, as well as the patterns of conserved residues in the homologs, are compared to what is already known about functionally important residues in the CooA protein of R. rubrum. The results identify critical regions of CooA and indicate features that distinguish CooAs from the general family of <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of the gene encoding colicin E 1, cea, was studied in Escherichia coli by using cea-lacZ gene fusions. Expression of the fusions showed the same characteristics {{as those of the}} wild-type cea gene: induction by treatments that damage DNA and regulation by the SOS response, sensitivity to catabolite repression, and a low basal level of expression, despite the presence of the fusion in a multicopy plasmid. Induction of expression by DNA-damaging treatments was found to differ from other genes involved in the SOS response (exemplified by recA), in that higher levels of DNA damage were required and expression occurred only after a pronounced delay. The delay in expression following an inducing treatment was more pronounced under conditions of catabolite repression, indicating that the <b>cyclic</b> AMP-cyclic <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> complex {{may play a role in}} induction. These observations also suggest a biological rationale for the control of cea expression by the SOS response and the <b>cyclic</b> AMP-cyclic <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> catabolite repression system...|$|R
50|$|The CyaR RNA (formerly {{known as}} RyeE RNA) non-coding RNA was {{identified}} {{in a large}} scale screen of Escherichia coli and was called candidate 14. The exact 5' and 3' ends of this RNA are uncertain. This gene lies between yegQ and orgK in E. coli. This small RNA was shown to be bound by the Hfq protein. This RNA has been renamed as CyaR for (cyclic AMP-activatedRNA). It has been shown that the CyaR RNA acts as a repressor of the porin OmpX. It has also been shown that cyaR expression is tightly controlled by the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein,</b> CRP.|$|E
5000|$|Pastan {{pioneered the}} field of {{receptor}} biology in animal cells and identified a major receptor mediated pathway of gene regulation in bacteria. With Robert L. Perlman he established the first general mechanism of positive gene regulation in bacteria, showing that cyclic AMP and its receptor protein CRP (<b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein)</b> positively regulated the activity of many genes. These studies serve as a paradigm for the mechanism of action of cyclic AMP and steroid hormones on gene expression in animal cells. His current research is focused on developing Recombinant Immunotoxins (RITs) as a new treatment for cancer. Gene splicing techniques are used to make chimeric proteins in which the Fv of an antibody, preferentially binding to a cancer cell, {{is attached to a}} potent bacterial toxin. Pastan, with his colleague Jesse Roth, was the first to clearly demonstrate the presence of specific protein receptors on the surface of animal cells. To explain the biochemical basis of hyperthyroidism, Pastan showed that antibodies from the serum of patients with hyperthyroidism specifically activated thyroid gland adenylate cyclase, providing an immunological mechanism for hyperthyroidism. He then proceeded to study hormone interactions with living cells using fluorescence photo-bleaching to visualize polypeptide hormone-receptor complexes bound to the membrane of living cells. He showed these complexes were highly mobile and clustered before entry into cells, and measured their lateral diffusion coefficients. In collaboration with Mark Willingham, he developed and used video intensified microscopy to visualize fluorescently labeled insulin and EGF forming clusters on the surface of living cells prior to entry through the endocytic pathway. These studies identified the pathway by which growth factors enter cells and established a mechanism that helped explain down-regulation of receptors and the loss of growth factor responsiveness.|$|E

40|$|Open {{reading frame}} SCO 3571 of Streptomyces coelicolor encodes a protein of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CRP) {{superfamily}} of regulatory proteins. A mutant revealed a dramatic defect in germination, followed by growth delay and earlier sporulation. This phenotype correlates {{with those of}} an adenylate cyclase (cya) mutant that cannot synthesize cAMP. This finding suggests that S. coelicolor may use a Cya-cAMP-CRP system to trigger complex physiological processes such as morphogenesis. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Vibrio cholerae hemagglutinin/protease (Hap) was induced upon {{nutrient}} limitation {{and strongly}} repressed by glucose. Hap was not produced in a mutant defective in the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>protein,</b> suggesting that intracellular cAMP levels mediate Hap expression. No {{difference was found}} in Hap production between an rpoS deletion mutant and its isogenic wild-type precursor, indicating that the alternate ςs factor is not essential for Hap expression. Based on these and previous results, we discuss the role of Hap in the pathogenesis of cholera...|$|R
40|$|SecB, {{a protein}} export-specific chaperone, enhances {{the export of}} a subset of {{proteins}} across cytoplasmic membranes of Escherichia coli. Previous studies showed that the synthesis of SecB is repressed {{by the presence of}} glucose in the medium. The derepression of SecB requires the products of both the cya and crp genes, indicating that secB expression is under the control of catabolic repression. In this study, two secB-specific promoters were identified. In addition, 5 * transcription initiation sites from these two promoters were deter-mined by means of secB-lacZ fusions and primer extension. The distal P 1 promoter appeared to be independent of carbon sources, whereas the proximal P 2 promoter was shown to be subject to control by the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CRP) -cAMP complexes. Gel-mobility shift studies showed that this regulation results from direct interaction between the secB P 2 promoter region and the CRP-cAMP complex. Moreover, the CRP binding site on the secB gene was determined by DNase I footprinting and further substantiated by mutational analysis. The identified secB CRP binding region is centered at the 261. 5 region of the secB gene and differed from the putative binding sites predicted by computer analysis. An Escherichia coli global regulatory <b>protein,</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CRP), is involved in the regulation of transcription, either positively or negatively, in many gene...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> {{activates}} transcription in Escherichia coli, {{only when}} complexed with cyclic AMP. The cyclic AMP receptor protein-cyclic AMP complex formed at low concentrations of cyclic AMP {{has a different}} conformation from either <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> alone or its complex with cyclic AMP formed at high cyclic AMP concentrations. Various biophysical {{data suggest that the}} latter complex resembles free <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein.</b> We have examined the conformational and biological properties of <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> as a function of cyclic AMP concentrations, using the gal operon of E. coli. A biphasic behavior is observed. It is shown that only the complex formed at lower concentrations of cyclic AMP is the transcriptionally active form. This difference between the complexes at different levels of cyclic AMP arises from a decreased ability of the cyclic AMP receptor protein-cyclic AMP complex at high cyclic AMP concentrations to bind to DNA at specific sites...|$|E
40|$|Mutants of Vibrio fischeri MJ- 1 (wild type) {{apparently}} {{deficient in}} adenylate cyclase (cya-like) or <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (crp-like) were isolated and characterized. Compared with MJ- 1, the mutants produced {{low levels of}} luminescence and luciferase. Addition of cyclic AMP restored wild-type levels of luminescence and luciferase in the cya-like mutant {{but not in the}} crp-like mutant. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that in V. fischeri cyclic AMP and <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> are required for induction of the luminescence system...|$|E
40|$|Pleiotropic carbohydrate-positive pseudorevertants {{have been}} {{isolated}} from a specific class of rho-crp double mutants of Escherichia coli carrying both defective transcription termination protein, rho, and <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein.</b> The modulation of catabolite repression of beta-galactosidase, amylomaltase, and tryptophanase {{has been studied}} in the pseudorevertants. It {{has been found that}} these mutants exhibit catabolite repression. Because catabolite-sensitive operons can be expressed in the absence of functional <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein,</b> this would suggest on the one hand that the cyclic AMP-receptor protein complex is not the exclusive mediator of catabolite repression {{and on the other hand}} that rho might be involved in the regulation of catabolite-sensitive operons...|$|E
40|$|Control of crp {{expression}} in vivo was studied {{by using the}} cloned crp gene. The synthesis of the product of this gene, <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CRP), was strongly reduced by exogenous cAMP. This regulation was completely abolished by the inactivation of a divergent promoter located within the crp promoter region. These data are consistent with our in vitro studies (Okamoto and Freundlich, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83 : 5000 - 5004, 1986), which showed that crp autoregulation {{is due to the}} inhibition of crp transcription by divergent (antisense) RNA produced by cAMP-CRP activation of the divergent promoter...|$|R
40|$|Biofilm {{formation}} was repressed by glucose {{in several}} species of Enterobacteriaceae. In Escherichia coli, this effect was mediated {{at least in part}} by <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) -cAMP <b>receptor</b> <b>protein.</b> A temporal role for cAMP in biofilm development was indicated by the finding that glucose addition after ∼ 24 h failed to repress and generally activated biofilm formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{model of the}} Escherichia coli <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CRP) shows that several amino acids are involved as chemical contacts for binding cAMP. We have constructed and characterized mutants at four of these positions, E 72, R 82, S 83, and R 123. The mutations were made in wild-type crp {{as well as a}} cAMP-independent crp, crp*. The activities of the mutant proteins were characterized in vivo for their ability to activate the lac operon. These results provide genetic evidence to support that E 72 and R 82 are essential and S 83 and R 123 are important in the activation of CRP by cAMP...|$|R
40|$|The {{locations}} of DNA binding by the proteins involved with {{positive and negative}} regulation of transcription initiation of the L-arabinose operon in Escherichia coli have been determined by the DNase I protection method. Two <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> sites were found, at positions - 78 to - 107 and - 121 to - 146, an araC protein [...] arabinose binding site was found at position - 40 to - 78, and an araC protein-fucose binding site was found at position - 106 to - 144. These locations, combined with in vivo data on induction of the two divergently oriented arabinose promoters, suggest the following regulatory mechanism: induction of the araBAD operon occurs when <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein,</b> araC protein, and RNA polymerase are all present and able to bind to DNA. Negative regulation is accomplished by the repressing form of araC protein binding to a site in the regulatory region such that it stimultaneously blocks access of <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> to two sites on the DNA, one site of which serves {{each of the two}} promoters. Thus, from a single operator site, the negative regulator represses the two outwardly oriented ara promoters. This regulatory mechanism explains the known positive and negative regulatory properties of the ara promoters...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CRP) stimulates {{transcription}} of the lactose operon by binding to the lac promoter. I {{have identified}} those 5 -positions of thymines in the promoter that lie close to bound CRP. Although ultraviolet irradiation of DNA with 5 -bromouracil substituted {{in place of}} thymine normally cleaves the DNA at the bromouracils, a protein bound to the DNA can perturb these cleavages at those locations at which the protein lies close to the bromine. The contacts inferred from this photochemical probe {{and the results of}} nucleolytic attack of this complex by exonuclease III support a model where the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> binds to the promoter making symmetrical contacts with one face of the double helix and then stimulates transcription through contacts with RNA polymerase...|$|E
40|$|The protein Clp from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri regulates {{pathogenesis}} and is {{a member}} of the CRP (<b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein)</b> superfamily. We show that unlike the DNA-binding activity of other members of this family, the DNA-binding activity of Clp is allosterically inhibited by its effector and that cyclic di-GMP serves as that effector at physiological concentrations...|$|E
40|$|A {{genetic locus}} {{designated}} fruR, previously mapped to min 3 on the Salmonella typhimurium chromosome, {{gave rise to}} constitutive expression of the fructose (fru) regulon and pleiotropically prevented growth on all Krebs cycle intermediates. Regulatory effects of fruR were independent of <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> and its <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> and did not prevent uptake of Krebs cycle intermediates. Instead, the phosphotransferase system appeared to regulate gluconeogenesis by controlling the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogen}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis {{produces a}} burst of cAMP upon infection of macrophages. Bacterial <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>proteins</b> (CRP) are transcription factors that respond to cAMP by binding at target promoters when cAMP concentrations increase. Rv 3676 (CRPMt) is a CRP family protein that regulates expression of genes (rpfA and whiB 1) that are potentially involved in M. tuberculosis persistence and/or emergence from the dormant state. Here, the CRPMt homodimer is shown to bind two molecules of cAMP (one per protomer) at noninteracting sites. Furthermore, cAMP binding by CRPMt was relatively weak, entropy driven, and resulted in a relatively small enhancement in DNA binding. Tandem CRPMt-binding sites (CRP 1 at − 58. 5 and CRP 2 at − 37. 5) were identified at the whiB 1 promoter (PwhiB 1). In vitro transcription reactions showed that CRP 1 is an activating site and that CRP 2, which was only occupied {{in the presence of}} cAMP or at high CRPMt concentrations in the absence of cAMP, is a repressing site. Binding of CRPMt to CRP 1 was not essential for open complex formation but was required for transcription activation. Thus, these data suggest that binding of CRPMt to the PwhiB 1 CRP 1 site activates transcription at a step after open complex formation. In contrast, high cAMP concentrations allowed occupation of both CRP 1 and CRP 2 sites, resulting in inhibition of open complex formation. Thus, M. tuberculosis CRP has evolved several distinct characteristics, compared with the Escherichia coli CRP paradigm, to allow it to regulate gene expression against a background of high concentrations of cAMP...|$|R
40|$|We {{isolated}} and characterized crp mutations in Escherichia coli that allow <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> to function without cAMP. These mutants defined a region {{involved in the}} cAMP-induced allosteric change of cAMP <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> that is necessary for activation of the protein. Currently, we have isolated intragenic suppressors of the crp mutations. These crp (Sup) mutants require cAMP for activity. The crp (Sup) mutations map in regions which define new sites of changes involved in cAMP <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> activation. From these results, we suggest that to activate cAMP <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> cAMP brings about (i) a hinge reorientation to eject the DNA-binding F alpha-helices, (ii) proper alignment between the two subunits, and (iii) an adjustment between {{the position of the}} two domains. Cyclic GMP fails to effect the last step...|$|R
40|$|The L-arabinose operon in Escherichia coli is a {{model system}} {{for the study of}} the control of gene {{expression}}. Maximal expression of the araBAD operon requires two positive control components: the araC protein-L-arabinose complex and the cyclic AMP receptor protein-cyclic AMP complex. Both araC protein and <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> are required for the initiation of transcription of araBAD mRNA. We have used the plasmid pBR 322 as a vector for cloning DNA fragments that contain the araBAD promoter. The cloned ara fragments were identified by both physical and genetic tests. A restriction map was constructed and the DNA sequence of the promoter was determined. The promoter contains a site that is similar to the RNA polymerase recognition sites in the galactose and lactose operons. It also contains a region similar to the known <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> binding sites in the galactose and lactose operons...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:Polymerase chain {{reaction}} (PCR) {{was employed to}} detect the presence of <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CPR) {{in a number of}} diverse organisms. In PCR, two primers specific to the crp gene of Escherichia coli were used. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Corynebacterium verasus all showed the same size of PCR fragments (708 bp) and same restriction fragment length polymorphizm (RFLP) ...|$|E
40|$|Cyclic AMP is the {{effector}} molecule for {{both positive and}} negative control of synthesis of several Escherichia coli proteins. Among the latter is the major outer membrane protein III. The control mechanism occurs at the level of transcription and involves the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein.</b> The repressing system is saturated at lower concentrations of cyclic AMP than is the positive control system...|$|E
40|$|We {{have found}} that the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CRP) -cAMP {{regulatory}} complex in Escherichia coli is subject to osmoregulation at the level of crp gene expression. This osmoregulation was lost in a cya mutant strain but could be restored by external addition of cAMP, suggesting that the intracellular level of cAMP is a key factor in the osmoregulation of CRP. The ability of the cell to maintain optimal CRP activity was essential for the growth and survival of the bacteria under low-osmolarity conditions as shown by studies with different crp mutant alleles. A suppressor mutant with a novel amino acid substitution (L 124 R) in CRP showed restored growth at low osmolarity. CRP(L 124 R) was not activated by cAMP and was shown to be dominant negative over the wild type. Our findings suggest that the fine-tuning of the CRP activity may be critical for bacterial viability and adaptability to changing osmotic conditions...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the regulation of the Escherichia coli deoCp 2 promoter by the CytR repressor and the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CRP) complexed to cAMP. Promoter regions controlled by these two proteins characteristically contain tandem cAMP-CRP binding sites. Here we show that (i) CytR selectively regulated cAMP-CRP-dependent initiations, although transcription started from the same site in deoCp 2 in the absence or presence of cAMP-CRP; (ii) deletion of the uppermost cAMP-CRP target (CRP- 2) resulted in loss of CytR regulation, but had only a minor effect on positive control by the cAMP-CRP complex; (iii) introduction of point mutations in either CRP target resulted in loss of CytR regulation; and (iv) regulation by CytR of deletion mutants lacking CRP- 2 could be specifically reestablished by increasing the intracellular concentration of CytR. These findings indicate that both CRP targets are required for efficient CytR repression of deoCp 2. Models for the action of CytR are discussed {{in light of these}} findings...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{transcriptional}} fusion to the lacZ gene, we have analyzed the anaerobic {{regulation of the}} hydrogenase 1 (hya) operon in response to different anaerobic growth conditions and to mutations in regulatory genes. We found that the transcription of the hya operon was induced when the growth condition was changed from aerobic to anaerobic and that this induction was independent of Fnr but dependent on regulators AppY and ArcA. Furthermore, {{we found that the}} transcription of the hya operon was not regulated by the <b>cyclic</b> AMP-cyclic <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> complex. Investigation of the effects of different anaerobic growth conditions on the expression of the hya operon showed that expression was induced by formate and repressed by nitrate. Formate induction was not mediated by the fhlA gene product, and nitrate repression was not mediated by the narL gene product. We found a high level of anaerobic expression of the hya operon in glucose medium supplemented with formate and in glycerol medium supplemented with fumarate, suggesting that hydrogenase isoenzyme 1 has a function during both fermentative growth and anaerobic respiration...|$|R
40|$|The Escherichia coli aer {{regulatory}} region {{contains a}} single promoter that is recognized by RNA polymerase containing the flagellar sigma factor, σ 28. Expression from this promoter {{is dependent on}} direct activation by the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein,</b> which binds to a target centred 49. 5 base pairs upstream from the transcript start. Activator-dependent transcription from the aer promoter was reconstituted in vitro, and a tethered inorganic nuclease was used to find {{the position of the}} C-terminal domains of the RNA polymerase α subunits in transcriptionally competent open complexes. We report that the ternary activator-RNA polymerase-aer promoter open complex is organized differently from complexes at previously characterized promoters. Among other E. coli promoters recognized by RNA polymerase containing σ 28, only the trg promoter is activated directly by the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein.</b> The organization of the different promoter elements and the activator binding site at the trg promoter is the same as at the aer promoter, suggesting a common activation mechanism...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{expression}} of the fumarate reductase system of Escherichia coli is completely dependent {{on the presence of}} adenylate cyclase or cyclic AMP, but the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CRP) is not required. This suggests that cyclic AMP may function as an effector for a second gene activator protein, possibly Fnr, and thus form part of a redox-sensitive regulatory mechanism controlling the {{expression of}} anaerobic respiratory functions...|$|E
40|$|Haemophilus influenzae Rd becomes {{competent}} for transformation by nutritional downshift or transient anaerobic growth {{through a}} process that requires <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> and adenylate cyclase. Insertion mutations in crr or ptsI of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system lowered transformation frequencies, and the effect was reversed {{by the addition of}} cyclic AMP. However, insertions into H. influenzae homologs of two-component signal transduction genes had no effect on competence...|$|E
40|$|Insertion {{mutations}} {{were isolated}} in cya and crp of Yersinia enterocolitica, which encode adenylate cyclase and the <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (CRP). The cya and crp mutants were affected {{for the production}} of proteins exported by the Ysc, Ysa, and flagellar type III secretion systems (TTSS). Protein production by each TTSS was restored when the respective mutation was complemented by a plasmid-encoded copy of the wild-type gene. Both cya and crp mutants exhibited reduced virulence for orally infected BALB/c mice in a 50 % lethal dose analysis. Examination of bacterial survival in host tissues showed that cya and crp mutants colonized Peyer's patches and, to a lesser extent, mesenteric lymph nodes. However, the mutants did not appear to disseminate to the liver and spleen of infected mice. An initial examination of the effectiveness of Y. enterocolitica cya and crp mutants to stimulate protective immunity against subsequent challenge with virulent bacteria in mice was promising. The results indicate that the cAMP-CRP regulatory system is required for Y. enterocolitica virulence...|$|R
40|$|Growth of Salmonella typhimurium on acetate as a sole carbon source {{requires}} {{expression of}} the glyoxylate shunt; however, the genes for the glyoxylate shunt enzymes have not been previously identified in S. typhimurium. In this study, we isolated transposon insertions in the genes for the two unique enzymes of this pathway, aceA (isocitrate lyase) and aceB (malate synthase). The aceA and aceB genes were located at 89. 5 min on the S. typhimurium genetic map. Genetic linkage to nearby loci indicated that the relative gene order is purDJ metA aceB aceA. Transposon insertions in aceB were polar on aceA, suggesting that the genes form an operon transcribed from aceB to aceA. Transcriptional regulation of the aceBA operon was studied by constructing mini-Mu d(lac Kan) operon fusions. Analysis of these fusions indicated that {{expression of the}} aceBA operon is regulated {{at the level of}} transcription; the aceBA genes were induced when acetate was present and repressing carbon sources were absent. Although glucose represses expression of the aceBA operon, repression {{does not seem to be}} mediated solely by <b>cyclic</b> AMP-cyclic <b>AMP</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> complex. Mutants with altered regulation of the aceBA operon were isolated...|$|R
40|$|Corynebacterium glutamicum GlxR is a <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> protein-type regulator. Although over 200 GlxR-binding {{sites in}} the C. glutamicum genome are {{predicted}} in silico, studies on the physiological function of GlxR have been hindered by the severe growth defects of a glxR mutant. This study identified the GlxR regulon by chromatin immunoprecipitation in conjunction with microarray (ChIP-chip) analyses. In total, 209 regions were detected as in vivo GlxR-binding sites. In vitro binding assays and promoter-reporter assays demonstrated that GlxR directly activates expression of genes for aerobic respiration, ATP synthesis, and glycolysis {{and that it is}} required for expression of genes for cell separation and mechanosensitive channels. GlxR also directly represses a citrate uptake gene in the presence of citrate. Moreover, ChIP-chip analyses showed that GlxR was still able to interact with its target sites in a mutant with a deletion of cyaB, the sole adenylate cyclase gene in the genome, even though binding affinity was markedly decreased. Thus, GlxR is physiologically functional at the relatively low cAMP levels in the cyaB mutant, allowing the cyaB mutant to grow much better than the glxR mutant. <b>Cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> (cAMP) <b>receptor</b> <b>proteins</b> (CRPs) are global transcriptional regulators that are broadly distributed in bac-teria (44).
