25|$|This type of brake pre-dates the direct-pull brake. It is a centre-pull {{cantilever}} {{design with}} an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side, a cable {{stop on the}} frame or fork to terminate the <b>cable</b> <b>housing,</b> and a straddle cable between the arms similar to centre-pull caliper brakes. The cable from the brake lever pulls upwards on the straddle cable, causing the brake arms to rotate up and inward thus squeezing the rim between the brake pads.|$|E

2500|$|... "Single-pivot side-pull caliper brakes" [...] {{consist of}} two curved arms that cross at a pivot above {{the wheel and}} hold the brake pads on {{opposite}} sides of the rim.

2500|$|This type of brake has {{symmetrical}} {{arms and}} therefore centre more effectively. [...] The <b>cable</b> <b>housing</b> attaches to a fixed cable stop {{attached to the}} frame, and the inner cable bolts to a sliding piece (called a [...] "braking delta", [...] "braking triangle", or [...] "yoke") or a small pulley, over which runs a straddle cable connecting the two brake arms.

2500|$|... "Linear-pull brakes" [...] or [...] "direct-pull brakes", {{commonly}} referred to by Shimano's trademark [...] "V-brakes", are a side-pull version of cantilever brakes and mount on the same frame bosses. However, the arms are longer, with the <b>cable</b> <b>housing</b> attached to one arm and the cable to the other. [...] As the cable pulls against the housing the arms are drawn together. [...] Because the housing enters from vertically above one arm yet force must be transmitted laterally between arms, the flexible housing is extended by a rigid tube with a 90° bend known as the [...] "noodle".

50|$|In {{the valley}} of the Severn the river was {{diverted}} to drive a water-ram which pumped water to a huge stone faced tankon Moel-y-Mab, a spur of the Long Mountain. Feedstuffs were brought up to the adjacent Cowsheds by a funicular railway, where liquid manure was stored in the tank. The slurry was then distributed round the farm's fields in copper pipes. An Upper and Lower <b>Cable</b> <b>House</b> were built. The lower one is of brick, the upper of Cefn stone from Minera. Its upper stage is of decorative timber-framing with a steeply-hipped roof. The last functioned as a summer-house. The Lower <b>Cable</b> <b>house</b> also housed a water turbine. The Lower <b>Cable</b> <b>house</b> is brick on stone foundations. It has stone rustication quoining, which is typical of Poundleys architectural style. The railway was built in the 1850s and dismantled by 1902.|$|R
5000|$|The Marblehead and Nashville both {{opened fire}} on the <b>cable</b> <b>house</b> at 6:45 a.m. on May 11, 1898. Rather quickly, the <b>cable</b> <b>house</b> {{collapsed}} from the fire from the two warships. Ten minutes later, at 6:55 a.m. the warships dispatched their work boats, each carrying a minimal crew of sixteen, {{in order to minimize}} the risk of casualty. The element of surprise was quickly lost, as a Spanish Cavalryman spotted the ships en route to the beach.|$|R

5000|$|A Bowden cable ( [...] )is {{a type of}} {{flexible}} cable used to transmit mechanical force or energy by the movement of an inner cable relative to a hollow outer <b>cable</b> <b>housing.</b> The housing is generally of composite construction, consisting of an inner lining, a longitudinally incompressible layer such as a helical winding or a sheaf of steel wire, and a protective outer covering.|$|E

50|$|The original, {{standard}} Bowden <b>cable</b> <b>housing</b> {{consists of}} a close-wound helix of round or square steel wire. This makes a flexible housing but causes the length to change as the housing flexes. Because {{on the inside of}} the bend the turns of a close-wound helix can't get any closer together, the bending causes the turns to separate on the outside of the bend, and so at the centerline of the housing, there must also be an increase of length with increasing bend.|$|E

5000|$|The {{system was}} chronically plagued with damage to its cables and pulleys due to flooding.

50|$|QBP {{purchased}} Salsa Cycles in 1997, a California-based mountain-bike manufacturer. The following year, QBP {{entered the}} emerging single-speed bike market with its in-house designed Singleator chain tensioner. Later in 1998, this product {{and the new}} Rat Ride single-speed frame (soon renamed the 1X1) helped launch the company’s new start-up, Surly Bikes. After that, the company continued developing brands for under-served markets, adding specialty parts with Problem Solvers, value parts and accessories with Dimension, and high-end components with Winwood. QBP also became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Jagwire, a Taiwan-based manufacturer of bicycle brake and derailleur components including pads, cables and <b>cable</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The linear {{movement}} of the inner cable is most often used to transmit a pulling force, although push/pull cables have gained popularity in recent years e.g. as gear shift cables. Many light aircraft use a push/pull bowden cable for the throttle control, {{and here it is}} normal for the inner element to be solid wire, rather than a multi-strand cable. Usually provision is made for adjusting the cable tension using an inline hollow bolt (often called a [...] "barrel adjuster"), which lengthens or shortens the <b>cable</b> <b>housing</b> relative to a fixed anchor point. Lengthening the housing (turning the barrel adjuster out) tightens the cable; shortening the housing (turning the barrel adjuster in) loosens the cable.|$|E

A latch mechanism having a latch housing is received in the connector body flange and a crank connected to a manually rotatable cap actuates a spring-loaded latch element that is engageable with a connector body flange to secure or to release the cover assembly with the simple twisting motion of the cap, thereby simplifying the task of effecting coupling and decoupling of the cable ends...|$|E
