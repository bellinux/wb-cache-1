At equilibrium three interfacial tensions corresponding to solid/gas (γSG), solid/liquid (γSL), and liquid/gas (γLG) interfaces are counterbalanced. The consequence of the contact angle's magnitudes is known as wetting phenomena, which is important to characterize the <b>capillary</b> (<b>pore)</b> intrusion behavior. Degree of membrane surface wetting {{is determined by}} the contact angle. The surface with smaller contact angle has better wetting properties (θ=0°-perfect wetting). In some cases low surface tension liquids such as alcohols or surfactant solutions are used to enhance wetting of non-wetting membrane surfaces. [...] The membrane surface free energy (and related hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity) influences membrane particle adsorption or fouling phenomena. In most membrane separation processes (especially bioseparations), higher surface hydrophilicity corresponds to the lower fouling. Synthetic membrane fouling impairs membrane performance. As a consequence, a wide variety of membrane cleaning techniques have been developed. Sometimes fouling is irreversible, and the membrane needs to be replaced. Another feature of membrane surface chemistry is surface charge. The presence of the charge changes the properties of the membrane-liquid interface. The membrane surface may develop an electrokinetic potential and induce the formation of layers of solution particles which tend to neutralize the charge.|$|E
50|$|Novel drug {{delivery}} systems are being researched {{in order to}} improve the lives of those who struggle with brain disorders that might not be treated with stem cells, modulation, or rehabilitation. Pharmaceuticals play a very important role in society, and the brain has a very selective barrier that prevents some drugs from going from the blood to the brain. There are some diseases of the brain such as meningitis that require doctors to directly inject medicine into the spinal cord because the drug cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Research is being conducted to investigate new methods of targeting the brain using the blood supply, as it is much easier to inject into the blood than the spine. New technologies such as nanotechnology are being researched for selective {{drug delivery}}, but these technologies have problems as with any other. One of the major setbacks is that when a particle is too large, the patient's liver will take up the particle and degrade it for excretion, but if the particle is too small there will not be enough drug in the particle to take effect. In addition, the size of the <b>capillary</b> <b>pore</b> is important because too large a particle might not fit or even plug up the hole, preventing adequate supply of the drug to the brain. Other research is involved in integrating a protein device between the layers to create a free-flowing gate that is unimpeded by the limitations of the body. Another direction is receptor-mediated transport, where receptors in the brain used to transport nutrients are manipulated to transport drugs across the blood-brain barrier. Some have even suggested that focused ultrasound opens the blood-brain barrier momentarily and allows free passage of chemicals into the brain. Ultimately the goal for drug delivery is to develop a method that maximizes the amount of drug in the loci with as little degraded in the blood stream as possible.|$|E

40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{classical}} problem of flow of electrolyte solutions through charged capillary nanopores or nanotubes {{as described by}} the <b>capillary</b> <b>pore</b> model (also called "space charge" theory). This theory assumes very long and thin pores and uses a one-dimensional flux-force formalism which relates fluxes (electrical current, salt flux, and fluid velocity) and driving forces (difference in electric potential, salt concentration, and pressure). We analyze the general case with overlapping electric double layers in the pore and a nonzero axial salt concentration gradient. The 3 × 3 matrix relating these quantities exhibits Onsager symmetry and we report a significant new simplification for the diagonal element relating axial salt flux to the gradient in chemical potential. We prove that Onsager symmetry is preserved under changes of variables, which we illustrate by transformation to a different flux-force matrix given by Gross and Osterle [J. Chem. Phys. 49, 228 (1968) JCPSA 60021 - 960610. 1063 / 1. 1669814].

The model {{is based on the}} general effective media theory and considers the contributions of both the low-resistivity phase (capillary pores) and the high-resistivity phase (gels and solids) in cement-pastes.

40|$|Concerning water transport, {{concrete}} shows {{a behaviour}} deviating from most other mineral building materials.

But at present, no measurement method is sufficiently exact for the direct measurement of the water contents in these pores. Measurement methods based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provide extremely low relaxation times due to the strong physical bond of water molecules.
