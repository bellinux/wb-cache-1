40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the award {{of the degree of}} Bachelor of Laws (LL. B) at Strathmore UniversityThe World Heritage Committee in their Thirty First Session in New Zealand on July 2007, included a "Fifth C" to their World Heritage Convention strategic objectives, which is Community participation. The idea of community participation is the involvement of indigenous, traditional or local people presented as community groups, tribes, nongovernmental organizations, private enterprise or local authorities in the identification, management and <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> cultural heritage. Community participation is considered necessary Since firstly, heritage protection without community involvement and commitment is an invitation to failure, secondly, coupling community to the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> heritage is consistent with international best practice, thirdly, conservation, capacity building, credibility, and communication are all intrinsically linked to the idea of community and fourthly, that heritage protection, should, wherever possible, reconcile the needs of the human communities, as humanity needs to be at the heart <b>of</b> <b>conservation.</b> In Kenya, community participation in respect to <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>monuments</b> is sidelined or subsumed in the roles of the heritage authorities both in law and practice. Additionally, monuments are viewed as mere property lacking any cultural significance hence there is no community engagement in their conservation. This study seeks to investigate the effects <b>of</b> defining <b>monuments</b> as mere property without any cultural significance. This research further seeks to delineate the role <b>of</b> communities in <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>monuments</b> and recommends ways that we can understand <b>monuments</b> as part <b>of</b> our cultural heritage, involve communities in <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>monuments</b> in a bid to ensure that the monuments are protected for and by the people not from the people. This research begins by setting out the definition <b>of</b> <b>monuments</b> as either cultural property or cultural' heritage. It establishes that monuments are better described as cultural heritage since such a definition incorporates the cultural significance and values <b>of</b> <b>monuments.</b> Further, the study seeks to distinguish the various methods <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> monuments: a material based approach, a value based approach and a living heritage approach. The study indicates that the approach in the current legislation is a material based approach that focuses on the fabric or form <b>of</b> the <b>monuments.</b> In as much as the values <b>of</b> the <b>monuments</b> are addressed, when community participation is minimal and the heritage authorities take charge <b>of</b> <b>monuments</b> <b>conservation</b> this results to a material based approach. In a bid to ensure that <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>monuments</b> involves communities, the recommendation is that we need an amendment in the current legal framework to mirror the proviso under National Policy on Culture and Heritage (2009) that the government should involve the community in immovable heritage conservation. The National Heritage and Museums Act Cap 216 (2006) does not incorporate community participation in the monuments Conservation despite this principle being a national value under Article 10 (2) (a) of the Constitution of Kenya, (2010). Therefore, this research proposes inclusion of community participation in the heritage legal framewor...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an alternative paradigm for the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> non-secular <b>monuments</b> in South and Southeast Asia. The proposed paradigm and supporting conceptual framework are based on the synergies between Buddhism and the systems theory. The purpose of the adoption of Buddhism is based on the need to find a culturally sensitive holistic and organic approach as opposed to the rationalist materialist approach of the current Euro-centric approaches. The differences in approaches to the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>monuments</b> between the East and the West have been discussed widely amongst conservationists, with the development of a number of guidelines to deal with the issue. The use of systems theory, while being based on established synergies with Buddhism, provides a structured foundation to build the conceptual framework. The proposed alternative paradigm and conceptual framework are based on three Buddhist principles of interconnectedness, interdependence and mutual conditioning...|$|R
