25|$|A plasma is {{electrically}} conductive, and {{is subject}} to electric and magnetic fields. In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei orbit the magnetic field lines, confining them to the area defined by the field. A simple <b>confinement</b> <b>system</b> is a plasma-filled tube placed inside the open core of a solenoid. The plasma naturally tends to expand outwards to {{the walls of the}} tube, as well as move along it, towards the ends. The solenoid creates a magnetic field running down the centre of the tube, and prevents the plasma particles moving towards the sides. Unfortunately, this arrangement would not confine the plasma {{along the length of the}} tube, and the plasma would be free to flow out the ends.|$|E
25|$|Geocells (also {{known as}} Cellular Confinement Systems) are {{three-dimensional}} honeycombed cellular structures that form a <b>confinement</b> <b>system</b> when infilled with compacted soil. Extruded from polymeric materials into strips welded together ultrasonically in series, the strips are expanded {{to form the}} stiff (and typically textured and perforated) walls of a flexible 3D cellular mattress. Infilled with soil, a new composite entity is created from the cell-soil interactions. The cellular confinement reduces the lateral movement of soil particles, thereby maintaining compaction and forms a stiffened mattress that distributes loads over a wider area. Traditionally used in slope protection and earth retention applications, geocells made from advanced polymers are being increasingly adopted for long-term road and rail load support. Much larger geocells are also made from stiff geotextiles sewn into similar, but larger, unit cells that are used for protection bunkers and walls.|$|E
50|$|Cellular <b>confinement</b> <b>systems</b> (CCS)—also {{known as}} geocells—are {{widely used in}} {{construction}} for erosion control, soil stabilization on flat ground and steep slopes, channel protection, and structural reinforcement for load support and earth retention. Typical cellular <b>confinement</b> <b>systems</b> are made with ultrasonically welded high-density polyethylene (HDPE) strips or novel polymeric alloy (NPA)—and expanded on-site to form a honeycomb-like structure—and filled with sand, soil, rock, gravel or concrete.|$|R
5000|$|Research and {{development}} of cellular <b>confinement</b> <b>systems</b> (CCS) began with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1975 to devise a method for building tactical roads over soft ground. [...] Engineers found that sand-confinement systems performed better than conventional crushed stone sections and they could provide an expedient construction technique for access roads over soft ground, without being adversely affected by wet weather conditions. The US Army Corps of Engineers in Vicksburg, Mississippi (1981) experimented {{with a number of}} confining systems, from plastic pipe mats, to slotted aluminum sheets to prefabricated polymeric systems called sand grids and then, cellular <b>confinement</b> <b>systems.</b> Today cellular <b>confinement</b> <b>systems</b> are typically made from strips 50-200 mm wide, ultrasonically welded at intervals along their width. The CCS is folded and shipped to the job site in a collapsed configuration (see picture above).|$|R

500|$|Following {{a meeting}} between the Commanding Officer of the Light Dragoons (Lt Col Fair) and Commanding Officer of 28 Engineer Regiment (Lt Col MTG Bazeley) {{it was decided that}} a new and easier to protect road would be {{constructed}} by the Royal Engineers. [...] 28 Engineer Regiment had used a new road construction material called NeoWeb geosynthetic cellular <b>confinement</b> <b>system</b> on an exercise in the UK prior to deployment and this was considered to be a practical option to reduce cost aggregate and provide a barrier to the implanting of lethal IEDS. [...] Lt Col Bazeley contacted the Sales Director of PRS (who was at that time on holiday) and talked him into providing a small amount of Neoweb to trial in Afghan conditions which PRS agreed to do free of charge. [...] The trial proved successful and Bazeley undertook to use funds originally designated to buy aggregate to purchase in excess of £2m of NeoWeb material. [...] The NeoWeb was shipped to Cyprus by PRS and Bazeley convinced the RAF to re-route a flight via Cyprus to pick it up. [...] Construction began in December 2009 and was completed in March 2010, during which time the construction teams and security forces came under frequent attack. This was the first road to be built under fire since British operations in the Dhofar Rebellion in the early 1970s, the completed road allowed resupply convoys to travel its length in about 30minutes, compared to 36hours along the old road. [...] The success of the project led to the approval of plans for an extension to connect the provincial capital Lashkar Gah with the economic capital of Gereshk. [...] Construction of the extension began in July 2010 and was completed in April 2011.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009 the Naval Air Warfare Center pre-solicited another {{contract}} for [...] "modification {{and testing of}} plasma wiffleball 7" [...] {{that appeared to be}} funding to install the instrumentation developed in a prior contract, install a new design for the connector (joint) between coils, and operate the modified device. The modified unit was called WB-7.1. This pre-solicitation started as a $200k contract but the final award was for $300k. In April 2009, DoD published a plan to provide EMC2 a further $2 million as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The citation in the legislation was labelled as Plasma Fusion (Polywell) – Demonstrate fusion plasma <b>confinement</b> <b>system</b> for shore and shipboard applications; Joint OSD/USN project. The Recovery Act funded the Navy for $7.86M to construct and test a WB-8. The Navy contract had an option for an additional $4.46M.

The observed soil mass losses for the confined soil systems are much smaller. As a result, the size of confinement, rainfall intensity, and slope angle have a direct effect on the soil mass loss results.

The experiment was conducted in a commercial farm in Monte Mor city, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The physiological evaluation was performed by recording physiological variables, such as respiratory frequency and skin temperature.

In each treatment six animals were evaluated. The experimental design was completely randomized in a split-plot version whose averages were compared by the Tukey test.

40|$|Farm {{animal welfare}} is {{becoming}} an important concern for governments, producers, and consumers worldwide. In particular, intensive <b>confinement</b> <b>systems,</b> such as battery cages and gestation crates, have been acknowledged as severely impairing to the physical comfort and expression of natural behaviors of animals. The European Union and select states in the United States have already passed bills eliminating these housing systems {{over the next several}} years.
