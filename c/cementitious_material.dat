40|$|<b>Cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> have {{physical}} and chemical properties that are well suited for the requirements of radioactive waste management. Namely, the materials have low permeability and durability that is consistent with the time frame required for short-lived radionuclides to decay. Furthermore, <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> can provide a long-term chemical environment that substantially reduces the mobility of some long-lived radionuclides of concern for decommissioning (e. g., C- 14, Ni- 63, Ni- 59). Because of these properties, <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> are common in low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities throughout the world and are an attractive option for entombment of nuclear facilities. This paper describes design considerations for cementitious barriers in the context of performance over time frames of a few hundreds of years (directed toward short-lived radionuclides) and time frames of thousands of years (directed towards longer-lived radionuclides). The emphasis is on providing a n overview of concepts for entombment that take advantage of the properties of <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> and experience from the design of low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities.

40|$|Modeling of the {{time-dependent}} {{behavior of}} cement paste {{has always been}} a difficulty. In the past, viscoelastic behavior of <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> has been primarily attributed to the viscoelastic properties of C-S-H components. Recent experimental results show that C-S-H may not exhibit as much creep and relaxation as previously thought. This requires new consideration of different mechanisms leading to the viscoelastic behavior of cement paste. Thus the objective of this thesis is to build a computational model using finite element method to predict the viscoelastic behavior of cement paste, and using this model, virtual tests can be carried out to improve understanding of the mechanisms of viscoelastic behavior. The primary finding from this thesis is that the apparent viscoelastic behavior due to dissolution of load bearing phases is substantial. The dissolution process occurring during the hydration reaction can change the stress distribution inside <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials,</b> resulting in an apparent viscoelastic behavior of the whole <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials.</b> This finding requires new consideration of mechanisms of time-dependent behavior of <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> regarding the dissolution process of cement paste...|$|R

40|$|Physical sulfate salt {{attack is}} one of the most rapid and severe {{deterioration}} mechanisms in concrete structures.

40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{postulated}} for many years that it is excess water rather than whole water that lubricates the <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> and governs flowability of paste (excess water is water in excess of that needed to fill up voids), {{there has been no}} detailed investigations to study the actual effects of excess water.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new bonded particle model that accurately predicts the wideranging behaviour of <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials.</b> There {{is an increasing}} use of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to study the behaviour of <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> such as concrete and rock; the chief advantage of the DEM over continuum-based techniques {{is that it does}} not predetermine where cracking and fragmentation initiate and propagate, since the system is naturally discontinuous. The DEM’s ability to produce realistic representations of <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> depends largely on the implementation of an inter-particle bonded-contact model. A new bonded-contact model is proposed, based on the Timoshenko beam theory which considers axial, shear and bending behaviour of inter-particle bonds. The developed model was implemented in the commercial EDEM code, in which a thorough verification procedure was conducted.

Superabsorbent polymers are able to absorb multiple times their weight in water and can be applied as an internal water reservoir to induce internal curing and mitigation of self-desiccation. Their purposefulness has been demonstrated in Portland cement pastes with and without silica fume. Nowadays, fly ash and blast-furnace slag containing binders are also frequently used in the construction industry. The results on autogenous shrinkage in materials blended with fly ash or blast-furnace slag remain scarce, especially after one week of age.

Without superabsorbent polymers, autogenous shrinkage was reduced in cement pastes with the supplementary <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> versus Portland cement pastes.
