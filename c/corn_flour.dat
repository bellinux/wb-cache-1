40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the application of}} the laser photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) for quantification of total carotenoids (TC) in <b>corn</b> <b>flours</b> and sweetpotato flours. Overall, thirty-three different <b>corn</b> <b>flours</b> and nine sweetpotato flours were investigated. All PAS measurements were performed at room temperature using 488 -nm argon laser radiation for excitation and mechanical modulation of 9 and 30  Hz. The measurements were repeated within a run and within several days or months. The UV–Vis spectrophotometry was used as the reference method. The concentration range that allows for the reliable analysis of TC spans a region from 1 to 40  mg kg− 1 for <b>corn</b> <b>flours</b> and from 9 to 40  mg kg− 1 for sweetpotato flours. In the case of sweetpotato flours, the quantification may extend even to 240  mg kg− 1 TC. The estimated detection limit values for TC in <b>corn</b> and sweetpotato <b>flours</b> were 0. 1 and 0. 3  mg kg− 1, respectively. The computed repeatability (n[*]=[*] 3 – 12) and intermediate precision (n[*]=[*] 6 – 28) RSD values at 9 and 30  Hz are comparable: 0. 1 – 17. 1 % and 5. 3 – 14. 7 % for <b>corn</b> <b>flours</b> as compared with 1. 4 – 9. 1 % and 4. 2 – 23. 0 % for sweetpotato flours.

40|$|This {{report shows}} {{the effect of}} {{temperature}} (72, 82, and 92 degrees C) during the cooking stage and steeping time (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 hr) on calcium and phosphorus contents in nixtamalized <b>corn</b> <b>flours</b> obtained by the traditional nixtamalization process (NCF). In addition, calcium and phosphorus contents in industrial nixtamalized <b>corn</b> <b>flours</b> were analyzed for comparative purposes. Atomic absorption spectroscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy methods were used to study the calcium and phosphorus contents {{as well as the}} Ca 2 +/P ratio in NCF and industrial nixtamalized <b>corn</b> <b>flours.</b> Additionally, deposition and identification of calcium compounds in the nixtamalized corn pericarp were analyzed by low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction techniques. Dry matter loss in NCF is also reported. As the temperature increased, Ca 2 + content was enhanced, while the phosphorus content decreased with statistical differences (P <= 0. 05) between thermal treatments. Ca 2 + content in industrial nixtamalized <b>corn</b> <b>flours</b> was significantly lower (P: 0. 05) than that of NCF. On the other hand, no statistical differences (P : 0. 05) were found between phosphorus content in commercial nixtamalized <b>corn</b> <b>flours</b> and NCF. Calcium compounds, identified as calcite, were detected in corn pericarp. Statistical differences (P : 0. 05) were observed in phosphorous content in NCF obtained at different cooking temperatures. In addition, a decrease in phosphorus levels significantly correlated with the steeping time at 92 degrees C (r = - 0. 91). At 72, 82, and 92 degrees C, the average Ca 2 +/P ratio in NCF was 0. 45 +/- 0. 03, 0. 61 +/- 0. 05, and 0. 82 +/- 0. 05, respectively, indicating a correlation between this parameter and the cooking temperature. However, no correlation was found between the Ca 2 +/P ratio and the steeping time. This behavior is attributed to calcium attached to corn kernel. In commercial nixtamalized <b>corn</b> <b>flours,</b> the Ca 2 +/P ratio was significantly lower (P <= 0. 05) than that of NCF. There was a significant correlation (P <= 0. 01) between dry matter loss and steeping time (r = 0. 99) in NCF, this fact influenced the Ca 2 +/P ratio due to the calcium attached to pericarp. At 82 and 92 degrees C, maximum values of Ca 2 +/P ratio were detected in NCF at 7 hr of steeping time and at 9 hr at 72 degrees C. These results can be used with industrial purposes to assess a maximum calcium-to-phosphorus ratio, and at the same time, to avoid the loss of pericarp to increase the functional properties of NCF...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Institute of Medicine set a {{tolerable}} upper intake level (UL) for usual {{daily total}} folic acid intake (1, 000 &#x 00 B 5;g). Less than 3 % of US adults currently exceed the UL. Objective: The {{objective of this}} study was to determine if folic acid fortification of <b>corn</b> masa <b>flour</b> would increase the percentage of the US population who exceed the UL. Design: We used dietary intake data from NHANES 2001 &#x 2013; 2008 to estimate the percentage of adults and children who would exceed the UL if <b>corn</b> masa <b>flour</b> were fortified at 140 &#x 00 B 5;g of folic acid/ 100 g. Results: In 2001 &#x 2013; 2008, 2. 5 % of the US adult population (aged&#x 2265; 19 years) exceeded the UL, which could increase to 2. 6 % if fortification of <b>corn</b> masa <b>flour</b> occurred. With <b>corn</b> masa <b>flour</b> fortification, percentage point increases were small and not statistically significant for US adults exceeding the UL regardless of supplement use, sex, race/ethnicity, or age. Children aged 1 &#x 2013; 8 years, specifically supplement users, were the most likely to exceed their age-specific UL. With fortification of <b>corn</b> masa <b>flour,</b> there were no statistically significant increases in the percentage of US children who were exceeding their age-specific UL, and the percentage point increases were small. Conclusions: Our results suggest that fortification of <b>corn</b> masa <b>flour</b> would not significantly increase the percentage of individuals who would exceed the UL. Supplement use was the main factor related to exceeding the UL with or without fortification of <b>corn</b> masa <b>flour</b> and within all strata of sex, race/ethnicity, and age group...|$|R

Corn or rice semolina supplemented by field bean semolina in ratio of 2 / 1 (w/w) were used for obtaining protein enriched gluten free breads, where improvers functionality was tested. Two central composite designs involving water hydration levels (X 1, X′ 1) and the level of hydrothermally treated rice or <b>corn</b> <b>flours</b> (X 2, X′ 2) were used. Instrumental analyses of breads (specific volume, moisture content, crumb texture and height/width ratio) were carried out {{to assess the impact of}} experimental factors. Results showed that hydrothermal treatment of rice or <b>corn</b> <b>flours</b> affected in different extent the bread properties, increasing the specific volume of breads and H/W ratio, and decreasing the hardness and chewiness of both types of breads. The optimum formulation for rice/field bean bread contained 7. 59 g/ 100 g treated rice flour and 96. 66 g/ 100 g water, and for corn/field bean bread the optimum included 4. 73 g/ 100 g treated corn and 78. 81 g/ 100 g water.
