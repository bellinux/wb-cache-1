This means continuous home and nursing care with medical oversight including a guaranteed care for patients with special needs, such as those suffering from dementia, Alzheimer's disease or those with psychiatric issues in a stabilized stage. The proposed capacity of the home for the Aged consists of 142 beds in three above-ground floors, which also contain lounges that double as canteens. The underground floor houses the kitchen whit <b>catering</b> <b>equipments,</b> which will only be used for this object, the main lounge, exercise and creative areas, as well as staff rooms including those of the management. This type of a facility is currently in great demand in the Czech Republic due to the insufficient capacity of similar social and health facilities...|$|R

40|$|Hospitals {{represent}} a busy environment when considering energy {{consumption in the}} building sector. Electricity represents a crucial powering source in hospitals including, but not limited to, lighting, <b>catering</b> and medical <b>equipment.</b> Hence, {{it is important to}} conserve it to ensure high quality of services that would enhance the patients’ health. This would also contribute to the reduction of the hospitals’ carbon footprint as well as the harmful impacts on the environment. The studies carried out in hospitals considered the use of renewable energy or the use of more power efficient equipment to tackle the energy problem. The challenge remains open in how to tackle the energy problem in a hospital by influencing pro-environmental behaviour. This study represents a step into reducing electricity costs of Medway NHS Foundation Trust (MNFT) in the UK. The proposed idea is to use technology to persuade MNFT staff to monitor their behaviour and with the right motive, from selected and appointed energy delegates, sustain a pro-environmental behaviour. Through combining technology, in the form of feedback on energy consumption and monitoring occupancy rates, and behavioural factors, represented in motivation from energy delegates and spreading awareness; it is possible to develop and sustain a proenvironmental behaviour among MNFT staff. This paper aims at describing the methodology proposed to reduce energy costs in MNFT by inducing pro-environmental behaviour with the aid of technology. This involves a smart electricity sub-metering system to collect and communicate energy data to a centralised server that pushes the data onto a dedicated web interface. Furthermore, addressing the psychological factors by appointing energy delegates to monitor the consumption, in selected areas, as well as motivate the staff members. In addition, monitoring human dynamics and analysing it against energy data. The study will include a baseline data collection period, for reference, followed by an experimental period to test and evaluate the system...|$|R
40|$|It is {{importance}} that business organisations focus on providing the best service to their customers. The {{survival of the}} organisation depends ultimately on the service provided. This study explores the elements which affect the provision of service excellence to passengers by flight attendants at South African Airways. The study is adequately supported by a proper and detailed literature study which, in turn is founded on an empirical study on the relevant topic. A field study {{was conducted on the}} various stakeholders of the supply chain pertaining to in-flight catering to determine what specific viewpoints, suggestions and limitations there were, with regard to existing packaging, catering utensils and galley equipment used by flight attendants personal service on board the aircraft. Alternatives were considered that could result in the improvement of service provided by flight attendants. The literature review within the scope and limitations of the study therefore concentrated on the specific nature and impact that packaging, catering utensils and galley equipment have on the quality service which flight attendants provide to passengers. The study included a detailed investigation into this part of the supply chain. The reality is that flight attendants are the front-line employees not only for the airline they are employed at, but also for all the stakeholders involved in the supply chain of in-flight catering. By not supporting them and providing them with the right tools to execute their duties affects more than one stakeholder in the supply chain. The empirical part of the study was conducted by interviewing flight attendants employed at South African Airways. The objective was to determine the impact that current packaging, <b>catering</b> utensils and <b>equipment</b> had on the execution of service by the flight attendants. A further survey was conducted to determine passenger perception towards packaging, catering utensils and galley equipment. The research findings clearly indicate the problems passengers and flight attendants are experiencing. The findings indicate the impact of passengers and flight attendants and makes suggests (makes recommendations) improvements to reach the objectives of improved service delivery.
