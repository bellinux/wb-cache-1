50|$|In {{petroleum}} production, the <b>casing</b> <b>hanger</b> is {{that portion}} of a wellhead assembly which provides support for the casing string when it is lowered into the wellbore. It serves {{to ensure that the}} casing is properly located. When the casing string has been run into the wellbore it is hung off, or suspended, by a <b>casing</b> <b>hanger,</b> which rests on a landing shoulder inside the casing spool. Casing hangers must be designed to take the full weight of the casing, and provide a seal between the <b>casing</b> <b>hanger</b> and the spool.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} size of <b>casing</b> <b>hanger</b> is 13-3/8" [...] with over 155,000 such units {{installed}} worldwide in 2014 alone.|$|E
50|$|In oil {{drilling}} and borehole mining, a casing shoe or guide shoe is a bull-nose shaped device which {{is attached to}} the bottom of the casing string. A <b>casing</b> <b>hanger,</b> which allows the casing to be suspended from the wellhead, {{is attached to the}} top of the casing.|$|E
50|$|Casing strings are {{supported}} by <b>casing</b> <b>hangers</b> that are set in the wellhead, which later will be topped with the Christmas tree. The wellhead usually is installed {{on top of the}} first casing string after it has been cemented in place.|$|R
25|$|During construction, many {{problems}} were encountered in scaling up the WAGR design. Problems {{with the construction}} of the pressure vessel liner had distorted it, so that the boilers, which were to fit in an annular space between the reactor and the pressure vessel, could not be installed, and the liner had to be partially dismantled and rebuilt. This work only cost about £200,000, but there was a huge cost of financing for an extra 18 unproductive months a power station costing around £100 million, of which some 60% was already on the ground. Serious problems were also discovered with the design of the boilers, which had to withstand the pounding of hot carbon dioxide (CO2), pressurised to 600 pounds per square inch (4.1 megapascals) and pumped around the reactor coolant circuit by massive gas circulators, and the <b>casings,</b> <b>hangers</b> and tube supports all had to be redesigned. The cost of these modifications, and financing during the delays, caused severe financial pressures for the consortium and its backers, and in 1969 APC collapsed into administration.|$|R
50|$|In 1929, Cicero C. Brown {{organized}} Brown Oil Tools in Houston, and patented {{the first}} liner hanger in 1937. Liner hangers enable drillers to lengthen their casing strings {{without having the}} liner pipe extend {{all the way to}} the surface. This saves capital cost and reduces weight borne by offshore platforms. Hughes Tool Company acquired Brown Oil Tools in 1978. In 1970, Baker Oil Tools acquired Lynes, Inc., which produced liner hangers and other completion equipment. In 1978, Baker Oil Tools introduced the Bakerline <b>casing</b> liner <b>hanger.</b> In 1985, the FlexLock Liner Hanger was introduced, extending the performance range and functionality of liner hanger systems. In 1987, the Brown liner hanger technology was merged into Baker Oil Tools. In 1992, BOT introduced the ZXP Liner Hanger Packer, with expandable metal seals, which set the stage for development of expandable screens, casing systems and liner hangers.|$|R

In this paper, {{calculating the}} {{deformation}} and the static {{strength of the}} fluid channel {{during the process of}} <b>casing</b> <b>hanger</b> running, well cementation and oil production with ANSYS. Researching the effect of the fluid channel deformation on drain and decompression, and the effect of the fluid channel stress concentration position and its existence on <b>casing</b> <b>hanger</b> structure strength. On the basis of those research, ascertaining the optimum range of the fluid channel aperture...|$|E
