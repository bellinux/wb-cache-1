500|$|Slow lorises {{range in}} weight from the Bornean slow loris at [...] {{to as much}} as [...] for the Bengal slow loris. Slow lorises have stout bodies, and their tails are only stubs and hidden beneath the dense fur. Their <b>combined</b> <b>head</b> and body lengths vary by species, but range from [...] between all species. The trunk is longer than in other living strepsirrhines because they have 15–16 {{thoracic}} vertebrae, compared to 12–14 in other living strepsirrhines. This gives them greater mobility when twisting and extending towards nearby branches. Their other vertebrae include seven cervical vertebrae, six or seven lumbar vertebrae, six or seven sacral vertebrae, and seven to eleven caudal vertebrae.|$|E

2500|$|Solifugae is {{an order}} of animals in the class Arachnida known {{variously}} as camel spiders, wind scorpions, sun spiders, or solifuges. The order includes more than 1,000 described species in about 153 genera. Despite the common names, they are neither true scorpions (order Scorpiones) nor true spiders (order Araneae) – though they are {{more closely related to}} scorpions than to spiders. Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two tagmata: an opisthosoma (abdomen) behind the prosoma (that is, in effect, a <b>combined</b> <b>head</b> and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two chelicerae that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for stridulation. Unlike scorpions, solifugids do not have a third tagma that forms a [...] "tail". Most species of Solifugae live in dry climates and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling arthropods and other small animals. The largest species grow to a length of , including legs. A number of urban legends exaggerate the size and speed of the Solifugae, and their potential danger to humans, which is negligible.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, however, {{experiments}} using animals whose heads {{were free to}} move showed clearly that the SC actually produces gaze shifts, usually composed of <b>combined</b> <b>head</b> and eye movements, rather than eye movements per se.

Nevertheless, the role of the SC in controlling eye movements is understood in much greater depth than any other function.|$|E

Upperparts are a thick, lustrous and short fur of pale yellow brown or greyish fawn, with a pencilling of darker hairs, and small white patches behind the ears.

There were only 2 known mouse lemur species by 1992. It was estimated that the 24 mouse lemur species evolved from a common ancestor 10 million years ago. Evolution of mouse lemurs is an example for adaptive radiation.|$|E
