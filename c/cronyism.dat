5|$|Youngs {{was elected}} to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972 by the Veterans Committee. His {{election}} was not without controversy, however, as the Veterans Committee consisted of his former teammates, and charges of <b>cronyism</b> were leveled against the committee.|$|E
5|$|An {{economic}} crisis took {{effect in the}} mid-1980s to late 1990s {{as a result of}} international economic conditions, drought, falling petroleum prices, and years of corruption, mismanagement, and <b>cronyism.</b> Cameroon turned to foreign aid, cut government spending, and privatised industries. With the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, the former British Southern Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy, and the Southern Cameroons National Council advocated complete secession as the Republic of Ambazonia.|$|E
5|$|Bancroft {{was part}} of the Giants' World Series {{championship}} teams in 1921 and 1922. He was also a part of the National League pennant-winning teams of 1915 and 1923. Considered an excellent defensive shortstop and a smart ball player, Bancroft was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971. However, his election was not without controversy, as the Veterans Committee included former teammates of Bancroft, resulting in charges of <b>cronyism</b> against the Veterans Committee.|$|E
5|$|Corruption is rife at all levels; Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2005 named Chad (tied with Bangladesh) as {{the most}} corrupt country in the world. Chad's ranking on the index has {{improved}} only marginally in recent years. Since its first inclusion on the index in 2004, Chad's best score has been 2/10 for 2011. Critics of President Déby have accused him of <b>cronyism</b> and tribalism.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta was a {{divisive}} figure; prior to Kenyan independence, {{many of its}} white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, {{he was given the}} honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation. His rulership was criticised as dictatorial and authoritarian, of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of overseeing a growth in corruption and <b>cronyism</b> which have generated long-term problems for Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Romano and Senior {{argue that}} Antara's {{relationship}} with the government puts the agency at risk of engaging in self-censorship in recent years. Internal reforms immediately after 1998 did not completely eliminate the culture of <b>cronyism</b> {{that had come to}} characterize the relationship {{between the government and the}} press. The two note, however, that Antara journalists were given greater rights to affiliate and organize into unions than their peers in other news organizations.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his term, Zardari {{recorded}} abysmally low approval ratings, {{ranging from}} 11 to 14%. After the PPP was heavily defeated in the 2013 general election, Zardari became the country's first elected president to complete his constitutional term on 8 September 2013. His legacy remains divisive, with political observers accusing his administration of corruption and <b>cronyism.</b> The Zardari-led PPP continues to form the provincial government in Sindh.|$|E
5|$|Sleaze-busting package: Following {{the cash}} for honours scandal, Brown {{said he would}} reduce sleaze, {{which led to the}} belief that Brown would {{introduce}} a new Ministerial Code that would set out clear standards of behaviour for ministers. Brown said that he intended to strip the Prime Minister of some the powers conferred on it by royal prerogativeincluding the ability to declare war. This would give Parliament more powers and rights to vet and veto appointments to senior public positions, in a bid to eliminate <b>cronyism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{observers}} consider Millennium Park {{to be the}} city's {{most important}} project since the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. It far exceeded its originally proposed budget of $150million. The final cost of $475million was borne by Chicago taxpayers and private donors. The city paid $270million; private donors paid the rest, and assumed roughly half of the financial responsibility for the cost overruns. The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many design changes, and <b>cronyism.</b> Many critics have praised the completed park.|$|E
5|$|Before Romney took over, {{the event}} was $379million short of its revenue goals. Officials had made plans to scale back the Games to {{compensate}} for the fiscal crisis, and there were fears it might be moved away entirely. In addition, the image of the Games had been damaged by allegations of bribery against top officials including prior committee president and CEO Frank Joklik. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee forced Joklik and committee vice president Dave Johnson to resign. Utah power brokers, including Governor Mike Leavitt, searched for someone with a scandal-free reputation to take charge of the Olympics. They chose Romney based on his business and legal expertise as well as his connections to both the LDS Church and the state. The appointment faced some initial criticism from both non-Mormons and Mormons that it represented <b>cronyism</b> and made the Games seem too Mormon-dominated.|$|E
5|$|The US Ambassador Elbridge Durbrow, who {{had been}} in the post since 1957, had a long record of trying to {{pressure}} Diệm into political reforms. He felt that South Vietnam's political problems were due to Diệm's illiberalism and thought the communist insurgency would be more easily defeated if Diệm reached out to a broader cross-section of society, cracked down on corruption, <b>cronyism,</b> abusive public servants, and implemented land reform. However, the South Vietnamese president saw authoritarianism as the solution to political problems and opposition, and the US military hierarchy in Vietnam agreed, leading to frequent disputes between Durbrow and the Military Assistance Advisory Group. Durbrow frequently reported to Washington that Diệm's strong-arm tactics against opposition only created more dissent and opportunities for the communists.|$|E
5|$|The {{elections}} {{took place}} on 23 October. She was re-elected with 54% of the vote, followed by socialist Hermes Binner, 37 points behind her. The opposition was divided between several candidates, and the perceived economic prosperity prevailed over voter's concerns about corruption and <b>cronyism.</b> It was the largest victory percentage in national elections since 1983. The Peronist party also won eight of the nine elections for governor held that day, increased their number of senators, and obtained {{the majority in the}} chamber of deputies, including the number of legislators needed for quorum. The Kirchners had lost that majority in the 2009 elections. She invited children on stage during the celebrations, and Vice President Amado Boudou played an electric guitar. As she had in 2007, she gave a conciliatory speech.|$|E
5|$|The story also {{highlights}} {{examples of}} political <b>cronyism</b> (a plane to evacuate Dr. Mears from Minneapolis is instead diverted to evacuate a Congressman), platitudes and rigid thinking (public health officials consider postponing {{the closing of}} shopping malls until after the Thanksgiving shopping season), federal responders trying to navigate 50 separate state-level public health policies, and the heroism of Federal bureaucrats. Soderbergh does not use type-cast pharmaceutical executives or politicians as villains, but instead portrays bloggers such as Krumwiede in a negative light. Social media {{plays a role in}} Krumwiede's accusations against Dr. Cheever and in Emhoff's daughter's attempts to carry on a relationship with her boyfriend through text messaging. Other responses in the movie, such as Emhoff's appropriating a shotgun from a friend's abandoned house to protect his home from looters, imposition of federal quarantines and curfews, the allocation of vaccines by lottery, inadequate federal preparation and responses, and use of bar-coded wristbands to identify the inoculated highlight the complex tensions between freedom and order in responding to a pandemic. Soderbergh uses Emhoff to illustrate the micro-effects of macro-level decisions.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{frustration}} {{was building}} in Kyrgyzstan over the perceived corruption and <b>cronyism</b> in the Bakiyev administration, {{as well as}} the country's poor economic situation and a recent rise in utility rates.|$|E
25|$|A second Christmas {{special on}} RTÉ One Television {{followed}} in December 2014. Callan Kicks the Year featured Dobbo and other characters parodying {{events of the}} year like the Irish Water, Rehab and <b>Cronyism</b> scandals; President Michael D. Higgins' state visit to the United Kingdom and also debuted new characters, Bono and the Gleesons.|$|E
25|$|The Legionnaires, however, {{had no more}} {{experience}} in the principles of republics than other Paraguayans. The 1870 constitution quickly became irrelevant. Politics degenerated into factionalism, and <b>cronyism</b> and intrigue prevailed. Presidents still acted like dictators, elections did not stay free, and the Legionnaires were out of power {{in less than a}} decade.|$|E
25|$|That her {{nomination}} {{was the result}} of political <b>cronyism.</b> Because her legal career did not compare to those of other possible conservative female candidates (like federal appellate judges Edith Jones, Karen J. Williams, Priscilla Owen, and Janice Rogers Brown), many thought that President Bush probably nominated Miers for her personal loyalty to him rather than for her qualifications.|$|E
25|$|However, further {{work done}} in 2015 by Sutirtha Bagchia and Jan Svejnar {{suggests}} that it is only inequality caused by corruption and <b>cronyism</b> that harms growth. When they control for the fact that some inequality is caused by billionaires using their political connections, then inequality caused by market forces {{does not seem to have}} an effect on growth.|$|E
25|$|Johnson is a {{controversial}} figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised {{him as an}} entertaining, humorous, and popular figure with appeal beyond traditional Conservative voters. Conversely, he has been criticised by figures on {{both the left and}} right, accused of elitism, <b>cronyism,</b> dishonesty, laziness, and using racist language. Johnson is the subject of several biographies and a number of fictionalised portrayals.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Halonen {{nominated}} SDP-affiliated Ritva Viljanen for {{a second}} term in the Interior Ministry. The Council of State had nominated Ilkka Laitinen, who was unambiguously seen as the most competent candidate. Over {{the course of the past}} 50 years, the President had previously only once chosen to not obey the Council of State consensus, leading to Halonen thusly being accused of outright <b>cronyism.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{was clear}} that the <b>cronyism</b> and {{corruption}} of Indonesia was winning over IMF reforms. The rupiah fell from 4,085 to 5,650 per dollar {{in the space of a}} single week. By the middle of the month, 154 banks, comprising half of the banking system, had suffered bank runs. By Christmas Eve the rupiah stood at 5,915 per dollar: a fall of 60% since July.|$|E
25|$|Koons {{acted as}} curator of an Ed Paschke {{exhibition}} at Gagosian Gallery, New York, in 2009. In 2010 he curated {{an exhibition of}} works from the private collection of Greek billionaire Dakis Joannou at the New Museum in New York City. The exhibition, , generated debate concerning <b>cronyism</b> within the art world as Koons is heavily collected by Joannou and had previously designed the exterior of Joannou's yacht Guilty.|$|E
25|$|When Phibulsonggram succeeded Phraya Phahon as Prime Minister of Thailand on the 11 September 1938, {{there were}} many {{resistance}} to his premiership based on his dictatorial style and <b>cronyism.</b> The military, now led by Major General Phibun as Defence Minister, and the civilian liberals led by Pridi as Foreign Minister, worked together harmoniously for several years, but when Phibun became prime minister in December 1938 this co-operation broke down, and military domination became more overt.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, it was {{alleged that}} under Abdullah Badawi's administration, {{there had been}} a {{significant}} increase in cases of <b>cronyism</b> regarding the distribution of import permits for foreign-manufactured vehicles. Then Prime Minister Mahathir had called for an investigation of the issue. Later, Mahathir Mohamad criticised Abdullah for cancelling a number of development projects that the former had started, such as the construction of a bridge to replace the causeway linking Malaysia and Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} and funeral of Tywin Lannister, Cersei's reign is marked by rampant <b>cronyism,</b> and her councils staffed with incompetent loyalists. She also disregards {{accurate}} advice by her uncle Kevan Lannister and her brother Jaime, alienating them both. Making matters worse is Cersei's increasing distrust of the Tyrells, particularly Margaery, whom Cersei implicates in a prophecy that Cersei herself will see her children crowned {{but all of them}} will die before her.|$|E
25|$|Income {{inequality}} grew {{during the}} era of martial law, as the poorest 60 {{percent of the nation}} were able to contribute only 22.5 percent of the income at 1980, down from 25.0 percent in 1970. The richest 10 percent, meanwhile, took a larger share of the income at 41.7 percent at 1980, up from 37.1 percent at 1970. These trends coincided with accusations of <b>cronyism</b> in the Marcos administration, as the administration faced questions of favoring certain companies that were close to the ruling family.|$|E
25|$|The major {{national}} programs receive 15-20% of government R spending. They fund research, after a stated competitive proposal procedure, in universities, institutes, and enterprise. Important project may receive funding from several programs. The programs are argued {{to have had}} a large effect but have also been involved in scandals, corruption, fraud, accused of producing derivative works with few innovations, and claimed to ignore merit in selecting projects in favor of <b>cronyism.</b> China is trying to improve the efficiency by measures such as more peer-review and evaluations.|$|E
25|$|First, the Yongying system {{signaled}} {{the end of}} Manchu dominance in Qing military establishment. Although the Banners and Green Standard armies lingered on as a drain on resources, henceforth the Yongying corps became the Qing government's de facto first-line troops. Second, the Yongying corps were financed through provincial coffers and were led by regional commanders, weakening central government's grip on the whole country. Finally, the nature of Yongying command structure fostered nepotism and <b>cronyism</b> amongst its commanders, who laid the seeds of regional warlordism {{in the first half}} of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|A {{government}} may subsidize {{production of a}} public good in the private sector. Unlike government provision, subsidies may result {{in some form of}} a competitive market. The potential for <b>cronyism</b> (for example, an alliance between political insiders and the businesses receiving subsidies) can be limited with secret bidding for the subsidies or application of the subsidies following clear general principles. Depending on the nature of a public good and a related subsidy, principal–agent problems can arise between the citizens and the government or {{between the government and the}} subsidized producers; this effect and counter-measures taken to address it can diminish the benefits of the subsidy.|$|E
25|$|With his {{activity}} in academia, Rainer reacted against <b>cronyism,</b> taking a public stand against arbitrary appointments in teaching, and ruining {{his relationship with}} the establishment. At a time when the Romanian school of anthropology was being divided between centrists and supporters of the fascist Iron Guard, he was again confronted by the far-right. Rainer was opposed to the fascist youth, whose members instigated in favor of academic censorship in his university curriculum. At one such incident in early 1938, Rainer stood unmoved at his desk as some of his fascist students, including the son of painter Nicolae Tonitza, lit firecrackers and threw eggs in his direction. However, he refused to ask for sanctions against them, and eventually received their letter of apology.|$|E
25|$|Springfield {{underwent}} a protracted decline {{during the second}} half of the 20th century, due largely to the decommissioning of the Springfield Armory in 1969; poor city planning decisions, such as the location of the elevated I-91 along the city's Connecticut River front; and overall decline of industry throughout the northeastern United States. During the 1980s and 1990s, Springfield developed a national reputation for crime, political corruption and <b>cronyism,</b> which stands in stark contrast to the reputation it enjoyed throughout much of U.S. history. During the early 21st century, Springfield sought to overcome its downgrade in reputation via long-term revitalization projects and undertook several large but unfinished projects, including a $1billion high-speed rail line (New Haven-Hartford-Springfield high-speed rail;) a proposed $1billion MGM casino; and various other construction and revitalization projects.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 another {{action of}} the {{territorial}} legislature created the Museum of New Mexico. Hewett was a logical choice to be its first director, and was installed in the position. The enabling legislation mandated that the Museum be managed by the SAR, helping to solidify Hewett's grasp on both positions. Hewett staffed the Museum's administrative functions with several {{of his friends and}} supporters from the Normal School days, and persuaded Alice Fletcher to take a key advisory role as well. This of course exposed him to complaints from his critics about <b>cronyism,</b> but ensured that he at least had a stable power base within the institution. The Museum was empowered by the legislature to acquire land containing some key archaeological sites in the state that were not yet protected by the Antiquities Act, and under Hewett, it did so.|$|E
25|$|The {{peace that}} had prevailed under Irala ended in 1542 when Charles V {{appointed}} Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, {{one of the}} most renowned conquistadors of his age, as governor of the province. Cabeza de Vaca arrived in Asunción after having lived for eight years among the natives of Spanish Florida. Almost immediately the Rio de la Plata Province – now consisting of 800 Europeans – split into two warring factions. Cabeza de Vaca's enemies accused him of <b>cronyism</b> and opposed his efforts to protect the interests of native tribes. Cabeza de Vaca tried to placate his enemies by launching an expedition into the Chaco in search of a route to Peru. This antagonized Chaco tribes so much that they started a two-year war against the colony, which threatened its survival. In the colony's first of many revolts against the crown, the settlers seized Cabaza de Vaca, sent him back to Spain in fetters, and returned the governorship to Irala.|$|E
25|$|During {{his first}} administration, Johnson was embroiled in several {{personal}} scandals. After {{moving to a}} new house in Islington, he built a shed on his balcony without obtaining planning permission; after neighbours complained, he dismantled the shed. The press also accused him of {{having an affair with}} Helen Macintyre and of fathering her child, allegations that he did not deny. Controversy was generated when Johnson was accused of warning the MP Damian Green that police were planning to arrest him; Johnson denied the claims and did not face criminal charges under the Criminal Justice Act. He was accused of <b>cronyism,</b> in particular for appointing Veronica Wadley, a former Evening Standard editor who had supported him, as the chair of London's Arts Council when she was widely regarded as not being the best candidate for the position. He was caught up in the parliamentary expenses scandal and accused of excessive personal spending on taxi journeys, with his deputy mayor Ian Clement having been found to have misused a City Hall credit card, resulting in his resignation.|$|E
25|$|René {{has been}} viewed as {{a prime example of}} a benevolent dictator, leading his country {{to the point of being}} the most {{developed}} country in Africa— as measured by the Human Development Index— and helping build one of the continent's highest gross domestic products per capita. His supporters believe that he had solid social priorities, including his government's extensive funding of education, health care and the environment. Critical indicators, such as infant mortality, literacy rate, and economic well-being, are among the best in the continent. During his rule, the Seychelles avoided the volatile political climate and underdevelopment in neighbouring island countries such as the Comoros and Madagascar. His critics believe that he and his party are responsible for torture and other human rights abuses involving opponents of the government, allegedly including the death of a prominent dissident in London, Gérard Hoarau. After the 1977 coup, a significant portion of the population, including the deposed President Mancham, fled to the UK and South Africa due to political persecution and fear of the new government's alignment with the Soviet Union, Tanzania and North Korea. René also faced international pressure regarding his government's former requirement that all applicants to the country's secondary education system graduate a compulsory National Youth Service, which included traditional curricula, political education and, according to some critics, ideological indoctrination and paramilitary training. This requirement was abandoned after the transition to multiparty rule and the organisation was eventually abolished entirely. Critics of the René regime also call out perceived corruption and <b>cronyism</b> in his term.|$|E
500|$|Characterised as [...] "the only truly {{successful}} left-wing British politician {{of modern}} times", Livingstone {{is a highly}} controversial figure in British politics. Supporters lauded his efforts to improve rights for women, LGBT people, and ethnic minorities in London, but critics accused him of <b>cronyism</b> and antisemitism and lambasted his connections to Islamists, Marxists, and Irish republicans.|$|E
