The cutting assembly utilizes two parallel extension beams which are shorter than the diameter of a central bore of an annular solid propellant grain and can be loaded into the central bore. The assembly is equipped with retaining heads at its respective ends and an adjustment mechanism to position and wedge the assembly within the central bore. One end of the assembly {{is equipped with a}} <b>cutting</b> blade <b>apparatus</b> which can be extended beyond the end of the extension beams to cut into the solid propellant...|$|R

40|$|The {{one-dimensional}} cutting stock problem (1 D-CSP) and the twodimensional two-stage guillotine constrained cutting problem (2 D- 2 CP) {{are considered}} in this paper. The Gilmore-Gomory model {{of these problems}} {{has a very strong}} continuous relaxation which provides a good bound in an LP-based solution approach. In recent years, there have been several efforts to attack the one-dimensional problem by LP-based branch-and-bound with column generation (called branch-and-price) and by general-purpose CHV ATAL-GOMORY cutting planes. When cutting planes are added to the LP relaxation, the pricing problem becomes very complex and often cannot be solved optimally in an acceptable time. Moreover, the modeling and implementation of its solution method {{as well as of the}} <b>cutting</b> plane <b>apparatus</b> for the chosen kind of cuts requires much effort. We develop a new upper bound for this pricing problem. We improve the numerical stability of the cutting plane algorithm and integrate mixed-integer GOMORY cuts. For 2 D 2 CP we propose a pricing procedure which enables the search for strips of different widths without repetitions. Various branching strategies and tools such as pseudo-costs and reduced cost bounding are investigated. Tests show that, for 1 D-CSP, general-purpose cuts are useful only in exceptional cases. However, fo...|$|R

Stryker developed the Turning Frame, a mobile hospital bed that allowed for repositioning of injured patients while providing necessary body immobility; the cast cutter, a cast <b>cutting</b> <b>apparatus</b> that removed cast material without damaging underlying tissues; and the walking heel, among others. In 1964, {{the company name}} was officially changed to Stryker Corporation.|$|E

5000|$|This first reaper-harvester cut {{the grain}} with a {{scalloped}} edge sickle, {{and by a}} double series of toothed bands; one series running on a level with the <b>cutting</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and the other series, running up an inclined plane, carried the cut grain up the inclined plane {{by way of a}} revolving apron and deposited it into a rotating receptacle where the [...] was collected, and thrown upon the ground in circular condition for binding. This was an improvement of earlier reapers where the operator did not have to rake or collect the grain into a sheaf.Ten of these machines were produced and sold in 1849. An improved machine was entered in the 1953 Indiana State Fair held at LaFayette. It won first premium in competition with the popular machines of that day. By the 1870s, around 2,000 reaper machines with the name [...] "J.J.Mann and Sons" [...] were being used.|$|E
50|$|The farm proved {{difficult}} for the family to manage. In 1857, William Wallace Marsh began to expierment with grain bundling methods. Marsh discovered he could bind grain while another was being cut if the <b>cutting</b> <b>apparatus</b> could move. His brother, Charles W., joined the effort the next day. For the next few years, the brothers worked together to perfect their harvester. In 1859, the Marsh brothers unveiled the completed product during a reaping contest north of DeKalb. The success of the Marsh's design was owed {{to the fact that}} anyone could use the implement—during demonstration, the Marshes had young girls and hoboes operate the machine with ease. The Marsh design was deemed the most effective reaper, and the brothers set to manufacture the product.Marsh Brothers was founded in 1858. William Marsh was the inventor of the company while his brother Charles handled the financial aspects. Marsh's inventions were responsible for thirty-five approved patents, expanding the company line with products such as corn huskers, wire stretchers, and plows. The first company factory was opened in Plano, where they met prominent settler Lewis Steward, who invested in the company. Oringially capable of producing 100 harvesters in a year, Steward's capital allowed the company to expand to 10,000 per year. The produced their goods essentially unrivaled until 1871. Marsh married M. J. Smith on January 8, 1871. Marsh, Steward & Company moved to Sycamore in 1873. Marsh was elected alderman of Sycamore that year, a position he held for decades. Two years later, William Deering purchased the company and moved most of its operations to North Chicago. It merged with the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company in 1902 to form International Harvester.|$|E
