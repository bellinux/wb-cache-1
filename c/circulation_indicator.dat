40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the variations of persistent haze days in boreal winter in Beijing and　demonstrates a significant increasing trend with increasing probability of the persistent haze　events (PHEs) during 1980 – 2016. The atmospheric conditions favorable for the increasing　PHEs include reduced surface meridional winds and weakened East Asian Trough in the mid-troposphere. These conditions indicate a weakening East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) 　system, {{which is then}} {{found to be associated}} with an anomalous warm and high-pressure system　in the mid-lower troposphere over the northwestern Pacific. We proposed a practical <b>circulation</b>　<b>indicator</b> using the anomalous southerly winds at 850  hPa over North China. The increasing　occurrence of the persistent haze days in Beijing is closely related with increasing frequencies　of unusual persistent southerly episodes in recent decades. Over the past centennial period 1900 – 2009, the anomalous meridional winds at 850  hPa in North China were positively　correlated with the sea surface temperature anomalies over the northwestern Pacific. Based on the present results, we outline an observation-based mechanism highlighting the role of large　scale climate warming on the increasing trend of PHEs in Beijing...|$|E
40|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) has significant {{influence in the}} hydrological cycle and affects the discharge in the stream. SST is an atmospheric <b>circulation</b> <b>indicator</b> which provides the predictive information about the hydrologic variability in the region around the world. Use of right location of SST for a given location of stream gage can capture the effect of oceanic-atmospheric interaction, improving the predictive ability of the model. This study aims on identifying the best locations of SST at the selected stream gage {{in the state of}} Utah that spatially covers the state from south to north, and use them for next six-month streamflow volume predictions. The data-driven model derived from the statistical learning theory was used in this study. Using an appropriate location of SST together with local climatic conditions and state of basin, an accurate and reliable stream-flow was predicted for next six months. Influence of Pacific Ocean SST was observed to be stronger than that of Atlantic Ocean SST in the state of Utah. The SST of North Pacific developed the best model in most of the selected stream gages. Each model was ensured to be robust by the bootstrap analysis. The long-term streamflow prediction is important for water resource planning an...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{lead-time}} {{stream flow}} forecast {{is one of}} the key aspects of successful water resources management in arid regions. In this research we present new data-driven models known as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that were used to forecast seasonal stream flow volumes. The SVM methodology is based on Statistical Learning Theory (SLT), which was developed to solve linear and non-linear inverse problems. SLT theory starts from stabilizing the solution of inverse problems by introducing a penalty function to account for the complexity of a solution. As a result, the generalized risk function has two components, one related to the goodness-of-fit, and the other to the mapping function complexity. The methodology makes use of uniquely solvable quadratic optimization problem that minimizes the bound on generalized risk, rather than just the mean square error of differences between measured and “predicted” values. Empirical results from these models showed a promising performance in solving site-specific, “real-time” water resources management problems. Stream flow was forecasted using local-climatological data and requiring far less input than physical models. In addition, predictions were improved by incorporating atmospheric <b>circulation</b> <b>indicators.</b> Specifically, use of the North-Pacific Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies (SSTA) improved flow volume predictions...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{lead-time}} {{stream flow}} forecast {{is one of}} the key aspects of successful water resources management in arid regions. In this research, we present new data-driven models based on Statistical Learning Theory that were used to forecast flows at two time scales: seasonal flow volumes and hourly stream flows. The models, known as Support Vector Machines, are learning systems that use a hypothesis space of linear functions in a Kernel induced higher dimensional feature space, and are trained with a learning algorithm from optimization theory. They are based on a principle that aims at minimizing the generalized model error (risk), rather than just the mean square error over a training set. Due to Mercer 2 ̆ 7 s condition on the kernels the corresponding optimization problems are convex and hence have no local minima. Empirical results from these models showed a promising performance in solving site-specific, real-time water resources management problems.

40|$|General {{features}} of rainy season with excess or deficits are analyzed using {{standardized precipitation index}} (SPI) in Limay and Neuquen River basins. Results indicate that most of dry and wet periods persist {{less than three months}} in both basins. Furthermore, an increase of rainfall variability over time is observed in the Limay river basin but it is not detected in the Neuquen river basin. There is a tendency for wet (dry) periods to take place in El Niño (La Niña) years in both basins. Rainfall in both basins, have an important annual cycle with its maximum in winter. In addition, possible causes of extreme rainy seasons over the Limay River Basin are detailed. The main result is that the behavior of low level precipitation systems displacing over the Pacific Ocean in April influences the general hydric situation during the whole rainy season. In order to establish the existence of previous circulation patterns associated with interannual SPI variability, the composite fields of wet and dry years are compared. The result is that rainfall is related to El Niño- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and circulation over the Pacific Ocean. The prediction scheme, using multiple linear regressions, showed that 46 % of the SPI variance can be explained by this model. The scheme was validated by using a cross-validation method, and significant correlations are detected between observed and forecast SPI. A polynomial model is used and it little improved the linear one, explaining the 49 % of the SPI variance. The analysis shows that <b>circulation</b> <b>indicators</b> are useful to predict winter rainfall behavior...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSea surface {{salinity}} (SSS) {{is a major}} ocean <b>circulation</b> component and <b>indicator</b> of the hydrological cycle. Here {{we investigate}} an unprecedented Atlantic SSS compilation from 1896 to 2013 and analyze the main modes of SSS decadal variability. Using principal component analysis, {{we find that the}} low-latitude (tropical and subtropical) Atlantic and the subpolar Atlantic have distinct variability. Subpolar and low-latitude SSS are negatively correlated, with subpolar anomalies leading low-latitude anomalies by about a decade. Subpolar SSS varies in phase with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), whereas low-latitude SSS varies in phase with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Additionally, northern tropical SSS is anticorrelated with Sahel rainfall, suggesting that SSS reflects the Intertropical Convergence Zone latitude. The 1896 – 2013 SSS trend shows amplification of the mean SSS field, with subpolar freshening and low-latitude salinification. The AMO and NAO have little effect on the long-term trend but contribute to the trend since 1970...|$|R
40|$|Indicator {{dilution}} curves {{obtained from}} various systemic arterial sampling sites {{are commonly used}} for analysis of blood flow, cardiac shunts and valvular regurgitation, and for study of segments of the blood volume. It is generally assumed that the contour of such curves is largely determined by the passage and dilution of the indicator in the central circulation and that changes occurring during arterial passage are minor and predictable {{on the basis of}} the expected velocity of arterial blood flow and the distances of the commonly used sampling sites from the aortic root. Although it is accepted that quantification of blood flow is unaffected by changes in curve contour so long as the first <b>circulation</b> of <b>indicator</b> can be identified, the estimation of other parameters available from curve analysis may be significantly influenced by the validity of the above assumption. Beard, Wood and Clagett (1) and Fox, Sutterer and Wood (2) have demonstrated considerable differences in contour as well as appearance time of curves obtained from the femoral (FA), radial (RA) and dorsalis pedis arteries. The first study showed delay in the FA components in coarctation of the aorta as compared with the RA curve, whereas the latter study noted delay and skewing of the RA or pedal curve as compared with the FA curve. The FA curves were similar in contour to the abdominal aortic curves in normal subjects. During preliminary studies of an investigation which attempted to quantitate valvular regurgitation by comparison of indicator dilution curves recorded simultaneously from the pulmonary artery (PA) and a systemic artery, we noted that in normal subjects only FA curves consistently resembled the PA curve while those recorded from th...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{to study}} the aspects of organism’s cardio-hemo-dynamic and blood {{erythrocytes}} reaction of female volleyball players to standard physical load. Material: with functional methods we studied cardio-hemo-dynamic {{and with the help}} of scanning electronic microscopy - erythrocytes’ structure in 18 female volleyball players of different qualification (age - 22. 0 ± 0. 60 years). Results: it was found that maximal physical load causes substantial changes in cardio-hemo-dynamic, which depend on female volleyball players’ qualification. These changes have intrinsic to them type of blood circulation system reacting, which is manifested in the following: appropriate changes of some indicators; natural changes of periphery blood erythrocytes. In the article possible mechanisms of realization of female volleyball players’ organism’s typological features, depending on blood circulation type and erythrocytes’ conformation, are discussed. Conclusions: In relaxed state all female volleyball players have non-uniform cardio-hemo-dynamic of blood circulation. With hyper-dynamic blood <b>circulation</b> type, higher <b>indicators</b> of strike and minute blood volume were observed. With hypo-kinetic blood circulation type the opposite picture was observed: indicators of strike and minute blood volume, heart index, load on cardio-vascular system in different periods of day were low...|$|R
40|$|The Northern Gulf of California (NGC) is {{characterized}} by seasonal hydrography and circulation (cyclonic in summer and anticyclonic in winter), by intense tidal mixing in the midriff archipelago region (MAR), and by coastal upwelling {{on the eastern side}} from autumn to spring. We examined changes in larval fish assemblages (LFAs) in relation with hydrography and circulation during both phases of the seasonal <b>circulation,</b> as <b>indicators</b> of changes in the pelagic ecosystem. A canonical correspondence analysis defined LFAs (r > 0. 70), which were related with: (i) the coastal current on the mainland shelf, (ii) the central eddy, and (iii) the MAR. In the early cyclonic phase, when the temperature and stratification were increasing and the coastal current was beginning, demersal (Gobulus crescentalis, Lythrypnus dalli) and mesopelagic species (Benthosema panamense) dominated the NGC. The highest larval abundance was in the Current LFA area and the lowest in the MAR LFA area. In the mature cyclonic phase, the larval abundance increased in the NGC and species characteristic of eastern boundary current systems such as Opisthonema libertate and Engraulis mordax displaced the demersal species and became dominant, together with B. panamense in the Current LFA area; the latter species dominated in the Eddy LFA area. In the early anticyclonic phase, the direction of the coastal current reversed and the temperature and larval abundance decreased. E. mordax and B. panamense larvae continued dominating the NGC, with higher abundance in the MAR than in the Current and Eddy LFA areas. In the mature anticyclonic phase, E. mordax larvae dominated in the Current and the Eddy LFA areas with the highest abundance in the former, while M. productus larvae (an eastern boundary current species) dominated in the Eddy LFA area. Results showed that in the NGC, the dramatically seasonal and predictable hydrographic and circulation features trigger the seasonal spawning of the dominant species. The biological richness of the coastal current area, in both circulation phases, suggested that this area has {{an important role in the}} pelagic ecosystem functionality of the NGC...|$|R
40|$|Administration Versus Global Warming. " We do not {{normally}} take this space to reply to such polemics; but as their opinion piece was so riddled with untruths and highly debatable implications, {{we felt it}} important to provide another {{point of view that}} is more in line with current scientific understanding. With respect to climate model predictions of CO 2 -induced global warming, Barnett and Somerville begin by saying that high-quality scientific studies "already have detected the predicted warming signals in the world's oceans, atmosphere and ice {{with a high degree of}} statistical confidence. " Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. In the case of the world's oceans, Bryden et al. (2003) note that "with so few repeat observations, there has been a tendency to treat any observed change in water mass properties or <b>circulation</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of ocean climate change. " In a compelling exercise that demonstrates the great danger of this tendency, they compare five Indian Ocean hydrographic sections across 32 °S that were made between 1936 and 2002. Their results indicate "there has been an oscillation in the water mass properties of the upper thermocline waters with … the properties observed in 2002 close to those observed in 1936 and 1965.

40|$|Many {{lines of}} {{clinical}} and experimental evidence indicate a viral role in carcinogenesis (1 - 6). Our access to patient plasma, serum, and tissue samples from invasive breast cancer (N= 19), ductal {{carcinoma in situ}} (N= 13), malignant ovarian cancer (N= 12), and benign ovarian tumors (N= 9), via IRB-approved and informed consent protocols through M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, as well as normal donor plasmas purchased from Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center (N= 6), has allowed us to survey primary patient blood and tissue samples, healthy donor blood from the general population, as well as commercially available human cell lines {{for the presence of}} human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) Env viral RNA (vRNA), protein, and viral particles. We hypothesize that HERV-K proteins are tumor-associated antigens and as such can be profiled and targeted in patients for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. To test this hypothesis, we employed isopycnic ultracentrifugation, a microplate-based reverse transcriptase enzyme activity assay, reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), cDNA sequencing, SDS-PAGE and western blotting, immunofluorescent staining, confocal microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to evaluate v HERV-K activation in cancer. Data from large numbers of patients tested by reverse transcriptase activity assay were analyzed statistically by t-test to determine the potential use of this assay as a diagnostic tool for cancer. Significant reverse transcriptase enzyme activity was detected in 75 % of ovarian cancer patients, 53. 8 % of ductal carcinoma in situ patient, and 42. 1 % of invasive breast cancer patient samples. Only 11. 1 % of benign ovarian patient and 16. 7 % of normal donor samples tested positive. HERV-K Env vRNA, or Env SU were detected in the majority of cancer types screened, as demonstrated by the results shown herein, and were largely absent in normal controls. These findings support our hypothesis that the presence of HERV-K in patient blood <b>circulation</b> is an <b>indicator</b> of cancer or pre-malignancy in vivo, that the presence of HERV-K Env on tumor cell surfaces is indicative of malignant phenotype, and that HERV-K Env is a tumor-associated antigen useful not only as a diagnostic screening tool to predict patient disease status, but also as an exploitable therapeutic target for various novel antibody-based immunotherapies...|$|R
40|$|Deviations of climatic {{elements}} from average levels, like those caused {{by changes in}} the atmosphe- ric circulation, modify {{the conditions in which}} the river runoff forms. The river regime is controlled by both, precipitation and air temperature, whose magnitudes show a significant dependence on the intensity of zonal <b>circulation.</b> A simple <b>indicator</b> characterising the atmospheric circulation over the north Atlantic is the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (henceforth, NAO). The North Atlantic Oscillation is considered a very important climate-forming factor in Poland. The analysis embraced monthly, seasonal and annual runoff of Polish rivers taking into consideration Hurrell’s winter NAO index from the years 1951 – 2000. The analysed flow series came from 141 profiles loca- ted on 86 Polish rivers. The selected rivers are distributed evenly throughout Poland and represent a diversity of environmental conditions (Fig. 1). The aim of the present research was to examine {{the extent to which the}} North Atlantic Oscillation affects the runoff of Polish rivers: its seasonal structure and spatial variability. Differences were calculated between the monthly, seasonal and annual runoff observed in the years with exceptionally high (NAODJFM > 2) and low (NAODJFM < – 2) values of the winter NAO index and their statistical significance was determined. Also calculated were monthly, seasonal and annual deviations of runoff in the years with high NAODJFM indices from that in the years with their low values (assuming the runoff in the years with low NAODJFM indices to be 100 %). The research results have confirmed a strong effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation on the runoff volume of the Polish rivers. In the winter months – January, February and March, the most statistically significant positive relations can be observed on rivers in the north-east and north of the country. The river runoff in those regions in a positive NAO stage is then more than 200 % higher than in a negative stage. In the spring months, in April hold for the runoff of rivers in north-eastern Poland and the middle parts of the Oder and Warta basins, and in May, rivers of almost the entire country with the exception of the east and south-east. In those areas stre- amflow in a negative NAO stage is more than 50 % higher in a positive NAO stage. The obtained results show that the North Atlantic Oscillation has the greatest effect on streamflow in the winter-spring months, i. e. in the period when the most abundant water resources are being formed in Poland. Hence, in a positive NAO stage, one might expect a considerable buildup of the water resources in the winter months, mostly in the north-east, and their marked dwindling almost throughout the entire country in spring.
