50|$|The bib apron (also {{known as}} the “French chefs apron” or a “barbecue apron”) has been worn for centuries. The bib apron's humble {{beginnings}} began when people used scraps of fabric to make a bib-like <b>covering</b> that <b>slipped</b> over the neck and tied at the back. The bib apron’s intuitive design and full coverage have made it a popular apron for tradesmen and people in low-economic classes since the 1880s—and maybe even earlier. In the 1960s—when women no longer wanted an apron that symbolized domestic ideals—the bib apron became the most-used apron and is now offered in a multitude of variations, colors, detailing and fabrications.|$|R

40|$|Micro flow {{has become}} a popular field of {{interest}} due to the advent of micro electromechanical systems (MEMS). In this work, the lattice Boltzmann method, a particle-based approach, is applied to simulate the two-dimensional micro channel fluid flow. We simulated fluid flow and heat transfer inside microchannel, the prototype application {{of this study is}} micro-heat exchangers. The main incentive to look at fluidic behaviour at micron scale is that micro devices tend to behave much differently from the objects we are used to handling in daily life. The choice of using LBM for micro flow simulation is a good one owing {{to the fact that it}} is based on the Boltzmann equation which is valid for the whole range of the Knudsen number. Slip velocity and temperature jump boundary conditions are used for the microchannel simulations with Knudsen number values <b>covering</b> the <b>slip</b> flow. The lattice Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook single relaxation time approximation was used.

50|$|Some pots may be {{carefully}} prepared for saggar firing. One method creates a smooth surface covered with clay slip, terra sigillata, which responds particularly {{well to the}} saggar technique. This <b>slip</b> <b>covering</b> may be burnished to achieve a gloss. Prepared pots are nestled into saggars filled with beds of combustible materials, such as sawdust, less combustible organic materials, salts and metals. These materials ignite or fume during firing, leaving the pot buried in layers of fine ash. Ware produced in filled saggars may display dramatic markings, with colours ranging from distinctive black and white markings to flashes of golds, greens and red tones. Porcelain and stoneware are ideal for displaying the surface patterns obtained through saggar firing. In addition {{to the use of}} saggars, some studio potters bundle pots and burnable materials within a heavy wrapping of metal foil.|$|R

25|$|The Cleveland Browns of the NFL {{selected}} Martin in {{the second}} round of the 1950 draft. Led by an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, Cleveland had won four championships in the All-America Football Conference leading up to the 1950 season, the team's first in the NFL. With Martin playing at defensive end, the Browns finished the 1950 season with a 10–2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the NFL championship. In a divisional playoff game against the New York Giants before the championship, Martin sacked Giants quarterback Charlie Conerly in his own end zone for a safety that helped secure a narrow 8–3 victory. The Rams scored a touchdown on their first play from scrimmage in the championship game, an 82-yard pass from Bob Waterfield to Glenn Davis. Martin was <b>covering</b> Davis and <b>slipped</b> on the play, although the Browns came back to win in the final seconds of the game.|$|R

50|$|In {{common with}} other railway companies, the GWR {{experienced}} accidents throughout its history, {{one of the}} most serious being the Sonning Cutting accident in December 1842. Nine workmen were killed when their train hit a landslip. The accident occurred in the early hours of 24 December 1841 in the Sonning Cutting, near Reading, in Berkshire, as a luggage train travelling from London to Bristol entered the cutting. The train comprised the broad-gauge locomotive Hecla and its tender, three third-class passenger waggons and some heavily laden goods waggons. The passenger waggons were between the tender and the goods waggons. Recent heavy rain had saturated the soil in the cutting causing it to <b>slip,</b> <b>covering</b> the line on which the train was travelling. On running into the slipped soil the engine was derailed, and the passenger waggons were crushed between the goods waggons and the tender. Eight passengers died at the scene and sixteen were seriously injured, one of whom died later in hospital.|$|R
5000|$|The clay of Pontic vases is yellowy-red. The shiny <b>slip</b> <b>covering</b> them {{is black}} to brownish-red, of high quality, with a {{metallic}} sheen. Red and white paint is used copiously for figures and ornaments. Animals are usually {{decorated with a}} white stripe on the belly. Ornamentation is often executed quite carelessly. Scholars have so far recognised six workshops. The earliest and best {{is that of the}} Paris Painter. They depict mythological motifs such as a beardless Hermes, centaurs, Theseus and the Minotaur, Achilles and Troilos, satyrs, maenads and a beardless Herakles, similar to depcitions common in East Greece. Scenes from the Trojan War are also common. Occasionally, mythological scenes from outside the corpus of Greek myth occur, such as Herakles fighting Juno Sospita by the Paris Painter, or a wolf-like daemon by the Titios Painter. Non-mythological scenes include komasts and horsemen. The vases are dated between 550 and 500 BC. None bear inscriptions. About 200 pieces are known as yet.|$|R
60|$|Your letter <b>covering</b> the {{newspaper}} <b>slips</b> was received last night. The subject of that letter is exceedingly painful to me, and I cannot but {{think there is}} some mistake in your impression of the motives of the old men. I suppose I am now one of the old men; and I declare on my veracity, which I think is good with you, that nothing could afford me more satisfaction than to learn that you and others of my young friends at home were doing battle in the contest and endearing themselves to the people and taking a stand far above any I have ever been able to reach in their admiration. I cannot conceive that other men feel differently. Of course I cannot demonstrate what I say; but I was young once, and I am sure I was never ungenerously thrust back. I hardly know what to say. The way for a young man to rise is to improve himself every way he can, never suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him. Allow me to assure you that suspicion and jealousy never did help any man in any situation. There may sometimes be ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down; and they will succeed, too, if he allows his mind to be diverted from its true channel to brood over the attempted injury. Cast about and see if this feeling has not injured every person you have ever known to fall into it.|$|R
25|$|The Pontic vases {{are also}} closely related stylistically to Ionian pottery painting. Also {{in this case}} it is assumed that they were {{produced}} in Etruscan workshops by craftsmen who emigrated from Ionia. The vases got their misleading name from the depiction on a vase of archers thought to be Scythians, who lived at the Black Sea (Pontus). Most of the vases were found in graves in Vulci, a significant number also in Cerveteri. The index form was a neck amphora with a particularly slender shape, closely resembling Tyrrhenian amphoras. Other shapes were oenochoes with spiral handles, dinos, kyathos, plates, beakers with high bases, and, less often, kantharos and other forms. The adornment of Pontic vases is always similar. In general there is an ornamental decoration on the neck, then figures on the shoulder, followed by another band of ornaments, an animal frieze, and finally a ring of rays. Foot, neck and handles are black. The importance of ornaments is noticeable, although they are often rather carelessly formed; some vases are decorated only with ornaments. The clay of these vases is yellowish-red; the <b>slip</b> <b>covering</b> the vases is black or brownish-red, of high quality, and with a metallic sheen. Red and white opaque colors are generously used for figures and ornaments. Animals are usually decorated with a white stripe on their bellies. Scholars have identified six workshops to date. The earliest and best is considered to be that of the Paris Painter. He shows mythological figures, included a beardless Heracles, as was customary in eastern Greece. Occasionally there are scenes which are not a part of Greek mythology, such as Heracles fighting Juno Sospita ("the Savior") by the Paris Painter, or a wolf demon by the Tityos Painter. There are also scenes of daily life, komos scenes, and riders. The vases are dated to a time between 550 and 500 BC, and about 200 are known.|$|R
40|$|The {{frictional}} {{behavior of}} a fault and the physical and mechanical properties of the fault rocks {{have important implications for}} earthquake nucleation, propagation and arrest. To further understand the mechanical behavior of carbonate-bearing faults, low- to high-velocity experiments on calcite gouge have been conducted using three rotary-shear apparatus: ROSA, located at the Department of Geosciences of the University of Padua, Italy; SHIVA, at the Istituto Nazionale die Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) in Rome, Italy, and the Phv-apparatus of the Physical Property Research Group of the Kochi Institute for Core Sample Research, Kochi, Japan. Three main topics were addressed with the experimental approach: 1) The formation of clast-cortex aggregates in natural and experimental calcite-bearing fault zones (Chapter I); 2) Localization of strain in gouge layers (Chapter II); and 3) The effect of fluids on the frictional behavior of calcite gouge (Chapter III). Clast-cortex aggregates (CCAs) are composite grains found in the slipping zones of faults hosted in calcite- and clay-rich rocks that were previously suggested to be textural evidence of seismic slip on a fault. Experimental investigation of the dependence of CCA formation in calcite gouge layers on the applied slip rate, normal stress, total displacement and ambient humidity showed that CCAs formed at all investigated slip rates (100 µm/s to 1 m/s) but only at relatively low normal stresses (≤ 5 MPa). The aggregates were better developed with increasing displacement (up to 5 m) and did not form in experiments with water-dampened gouges. In the experiments, aggregates formed in low-strain regions within the gouge layers, adjacent to the highest-strain slip zones. We propose that CCAs in calcite-bearing slip zones form in the shallow portions of faults during shearing in relatively dry conditions, but our experiments suggest that they cannot be used as indicators of seismic slip. Formation involves clast rotation due to granular flow accompanied by accretion of fine matrix material possibly facilitated by electrostatic forces. To further understand strain localization during seismic slip, which is a fundamental mechanical process that has implications for frictional heating and the earthquake energy budget, we performed intermediate- to high-velocity rotary-shear experiments on calcite gouge containing strain markers made of dolomite gouge. Sheared markers should provide microstructural information of the strain distribution in the gouge layer and its dependence on the applied total strain, normal stress, slip rate, and ambient conditions. Microstructural analysis revealed that in both dry and water-dampened gouges strain localization at 1 m/s occurs progressively and rapidly. The strain accommodated in the bulk of the gouge layer does not change significantly with increasing total displacement, suggesting that, once formed, the high-strain slipping zone and principal slip surface accommodate most of the ongoing displacement. This is supported by the presence of sintered and recrystallized grains and zones of calcite decarbonation adjacent to the principal slip surface, indicating localized frictional heating. Faster localization in water-dampened conditions, although suggested by the faster dynamic weakening, was not reflected in the investigated microstructures. Instead, weakening in water-dampened gouges may be enhanced by faster subcritical crack growth in the presence of fluids. When extrapolated to natural conditions, our results suggest that calcite-bearing gouge slip zones are more prone to slip in the presence of water than in relatively dry conditions. The effect of fluids on the frictional behavior of calcite gouge was further investigated by conducting intermediate- to high-velocity experiments with controlled fluid pressure. Consistent with our results from experiments with strain-markers, slip appears to be localized on one or more slip surfaces adjacent to which zones of recrystallization are found. Grey or black material <b>covering</b> the <b>slip</b> surface of several samples was identified as disordered carbon by Raman spectroscopy indicating decarbonation of the calcite. In low-velocity (1 mm/s) experiments, a lower shear stress of water-saturated gouges as compared to room-dry conditions is attributed to intergranular lubrication and to the lower calcite fracture surface energy accelerating subcritical crack growth, consistent {{with a high degree of}} compaction. At the initiation of sliding at high velocity, weakening in saturated gouges occurs abruptly, while the room-dry gouges show a pronounced strengthening phase before the onset of weakening. For a given effective normal stress, the peak stress is lower, and the strengthening phase is longer, for higher pore-fluid factors. The weakening in room-dry and water-saturated gouges sheared at high velocity likely occurs by flash heating, which is accelerated in the presence of fluids by subcritical crack growth. Consistent with flash heating, the presence of carbon on the slipping surface of our calcite samples indicated that decarbonation has occurred even though the bulk temperature of the gouge layer was lower than the decarbonation temperature. At high velocity, intense frictional heating leads to thermal pressurization and subsequent decrease of the shear stress in the experiments performed in undrained conditions. Zones of recrystallized grains adjacent to the principal slip surfaces are possibly featuring microstructures characteristic for grain boundary sliding aided by diffusion creep which suggests that strain was not only accommodated by frictional processes, but possibly by superplasticity. The experimental results suggest that the presence of water in carbonate-bearing faults facilitates earthquake nucleation and even more so if the fluids present are pressurized. This might explain the long-lasting earthquake sequences e. g. of Umbria-Marche and L’Aquila hosted on carbonate-bearing faults. Additionally, some of the slip distribution complexity during earthquakes occurring in carbonate sequences might be due to a difference in the degree of fluid saturation in different fault patches...|$|R
