25|$|During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson {{asked the}} Intercontinental Rubber Company—owned by Bernard Baruch, J. P. Morgan and Kennedy—to grow guayule. Guayule is {{a plant that}} {{produces}} latex {{that can be used}} to make rubber. Many feared the German navy might blockade rubber shipments from Asia. As a result, Intercontinental established the <b>Continental</b> <b>Farm</b> and the little town of Continental in southeastern Arizona in 1916. The guayule growing operations didn't last and in 1922 the <b>Continental</b> <b>Farm</b> was sold to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who rented the fields to cotton farmers for several years.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Continental</b> <b>Farm</b> of Sahuarita plays {{a central}} role in town history. In 1915, worried about the {{possibility}} of a German blockade of rubber imports, Bernard Baruch, Joseph Kennedy and J.P. Morgan founded the farm along the Santa Cruz River with hopes of growing guayule: plants that provide rubber. The project was abandoned after the end of World War I, and in 1922, was sold to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. The Queen rented the land to cotton farmers, in what would be the primary crop for the following four decades. In 1948, R. Keith Walden relocated the Farmers Investment Co. (FICO) from California to Arizona, buying the <b>Continental</b> <b>Farm</b> lands from the Queen. In 1965, over fears of a fall in demand for cotton resulting from the advent of synthetic fibers, Walden switched his crop to pecans. Today, the FICO pecan orchard is the largest in the world, with over 6000 acre and 106,000 trees.|$|E

In the 1950s, Keith grew concerned that competition from synthetic fibers would threaten the cotton market and in 1965 he transitioned his farming operation to pecans as an alternative crop. Keith chose pecans because of their compatibility with the climate of the Sonoran Desert. FICO is still owned by the Walden family and their orchards combine to form the largest pecan grove in the world.|$|E

He moved to the United States in 1978 to work for <b>Continental</b> <b>Farms</b> Stable, then returned to Sweden where he married Christina, his childhood sweetheart. The two permanently moved to the United States in December 1982 and have four children, Nancy, Jenny, Tiffany and Jimmy, Jr. Takter became a U.S. citizen in 2000.

40|$|With a {{push toward}} {{renewable}} electricity generation, wind power has grown substantially in recent U. S. history and technologies continue to improve. However, the intermittency associated with wind-generated electricity without storage has limited the amounts {{sold on the}} grid. Furthermore, <b>continental</b> wind <b>farms</b> have a diurnal and seasonal variability that is mismatched with demand. To increase the broader use of wind power technologies, the development of systems that can operate intermittently during off-peak hours must be considered. Utilization of wind-generated electricity for desalination of brackish groundwater presents opportunities to increase use of a low-carbon energy source and supply alternative drinking water that is much needed in some areas...|$|R
50|$|In 1916, Intercontinental {{established}} the <b>Continental</b> <b>Farm</b> seven {{miles south of}} Sahuarita and immediately east of the present-day Green Valley, along the eastern banks of the Santa Cruz River and the Southern Pacific Railroad. Over the next few years, a small town was built to accommodate the workers at the farm. In addition to several large adobe homes that were built for the farmers around 1918, and the fields and the processing facility built for the guayule, the town of Continental had a post office that opened in 1917, a schoolhouse that was built in 1918, a church, a general store, and its own cemetery. The guayule project was abandoned {{after the end of}} World War I. In 1922, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands bought the farm and rented the fields to cotton farmers until 1949.|$|E
40|$|Eco-efficiency is {{a useful}} guide to dairy farm {{sustainability}} analysis aimed at increasing output (physical or value added) and minimizing environmental impacts (EIs). Widely used partial eco-efficiency ratios (EIs per some functional unit, e. g. kg milk) can be problematic because (i) substitution possibilities between EIs are ignored, (ii) multiple ratios can complicate decision making and (iii) EIs are not usually associated with just the functional unit in the ratio's denominator. The objective {{of this study was}} to demonstrate a 'global' eco-efficiency modelling framework dealing with issues (i) to (iii) by combining Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) data and the multiple-input, multiple-output production efficiency method Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). With DEA each dairy farm's outputs and LCA-derived EIs are aggregated into a single, relative, bounded, dimensionless eco-efficiency score, thus overcoming issues (i) to (iii). A novelty of this study is that a model providing a number of additional desirable properties was employed, known as the Range Adjusted Measure (RAM) of inefficiency. These properties altogether make RAM advantageous over other DEA models and are as follows. First, RAM is able to simultaneously minimize EIs and maximize outputs. Second, it indicates which EIs and/or outputs contribute the most to a farm's eco-inefficiency. Third it can be used to rank farms in terms of eco-efficiency scores. Thus, non-parametric rank tests can be employed to test for significant differences in terms of eco-efficiency score ranks between different farm groups. An additional DEA methodology was employed to 'correct' the farms' eco-efficiency scores for inefficiencies attributed to managerial factors. By removing managerial inefficiencies it was possible to detect differences in eco-efficiency between farms solely attributed to uncontrollable factors such as region. Such analysis is lacking in previous dairy studies combining LCA with DEA. RAM and the 'corrective' methodology were demonstrated with LCA data from French specialized dairy farms grouped by region (West France, Continental France) and feeding strategy (regardless of region). Mean eco-efficiency score ranks were significantly higher for farms with 30 % maize in the total forage area before correcting for managerial inefficiencies. Mean eco-efficiency score ranks were higher for West than <b>Continental</b> <b>farms,</b> but significantly higher only after correcting for managerial inefficiencies. These results helped identify the eco-efficiency potential of each region and feeding strategy and could therefore aid advisors and policy makers at farm or region/sector level. The proposed framework helped better measure and understand (dairy) farm eco-efficiency, both within and between different farm groups...|$|R

This study aims at {{identifying}} {{the current state}} of fish farming in the area of Gontougo. It was carried out from May to September 2013 using a questionnaire and individual interview with fish farmers. The results showed that all producers practiced artisanal fish farming and this activity played an important socio-economic role. Fish farming is exclusively carried out by local people belonging mainly to the Abron ethnic group (77. 8 %). This activity is mainly practiced by people aged 45 years and over (77. 8 %). It was observed that 41. 7 % of the ponds are in derivation while 58. 3 % are barrage ponds. Oreochromis niloticus Linné, 1758 and Heterobranchus longifilis Valenciennes, 1840 are the most reared fish species. The total fish production in 2012 was estimated to 3, 552. 5 kg in 68 ponds. The produced quantities vary from a fish farmer to another, with an average production of 592. 1 ± 635. 9 kg/fish farmer/year. All fish farmers (100 %) feed the fish with agricultural by-products. They have difficulties to feed them properly. They didn't receive funding, coaching and training. Some fish farmers (33. 3 %) faced water problem. All these factors are an obstacle to sustainable management of fish farming in this area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Continental {{margins are}} diverse and {{important}} sedimentary landforms {{that serve as}} a substrate {{for a variety of}} purposes: benthic habitats for fisheries, ship navigation and national defense operations, and engineering activities (i. e. oil and gas platforms, pipelines, cables, wind <b>farms).</b> <b>Continental</b> shelf margins also contain hard mineral resources such as aggregate sand and gravel. Because margins are increasingly important, comprehensive and integrated databases are needed for scientists to produce base maps displaying thematic information such as seafloor geology, sediment character and texture, roughness, and critical shear stress. The new usSEABED software system provides a mechanism for compiling diverse seabed datasets of U. S. margins from across the marine science community. The USGS is using usSEABED to map benthic habitats and conduct national assessments of offshore aggregates for use as potential sand sources for beach nourishment purposes. The new geologic maps used for these assessments are providing fresh scientific insights into the character and development of U. S. continental margins and into the availability of sand and gravel aggregate resources...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of livestock production is to reduce its environmental burden while meeting the increased demand for animal products in a changing climate. A wide range of management practices and technologies are available to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from European livestock farms. The variability in environmental, financial and management conditions of the farms inevitably leads to differences in the applicability, mitigation potential and costs of these options. Economic assessments of GHG mitigation usually consider an ‘average’ farm in a region or country, without the detailed implementation of the options on individual farms. This paper is presenting an economic assessment of mitigation options as implemented on two modelled livestock farms: a <b>continental</b> dairy mixed <b>farm</b> (France) and a maritime grassland based dairy farm (Ireland). The mitigation options include cover crops, legumes, nitrification inhibitors, fat and nitrate feeding, and genetic improvement of livestock. The biophysical aspects of the farms were modelled in FarmAC, a deterministic farm model, in a related work. This provided data on production, GHG and ammonia emissions and nitrogen leaching for the baseline and the mitigation scenarios. The corresponding net technical costs were calculated to reflect the management changes required for implementing the mitigation options, and included changes in resource costs, labour and income. The net technical costs of the options were compared to the greenhouse gas emission changes to calculate the cost-effectiveness of the mitigation options. Results rank the mitigation options {{in terms of their}} cost-effectiveness and highlight {{the differences between the two}} farms. The divergent practical implementation of the mitigation options is discussed, focusing on the variability in cost elements and abatement potential, and emphasising the need for individually tailored mitigation advice for farmers...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} irregular {{waves in the}} Norwegian <b>continental</b> shelf wind <b>farm</b> (HAVSUL-II) was conducted using 3 rd generation spectral wave models. The study was composed of two parts: {{the study of the}} effect of a single windmill monopile in the local incoming wave field using an empirical JONSWAP spectrum, and a wave hindcast study in the wind farm area using realistic incoming wave spectra obtained from large scale simulations for the 1991 - 1992 winter period. In the single windmill monopile study the SWAN wave model was used, while the hindcast study was conducted by successively nesting from a coarse grid using the WAM model up to a high-resolution (56 m) grid covering 26. 2 km 2 of the HAVSUL-II windmill farm using the SWAN model. The effect of a single monopile on incident waves with realistic spectra was also studied. In the single windmill study the monopile was represented as a closed circular obstacle and in the hindcast study it was represented as a dry grid point. The results showed that the single windmill monopile creates a shadow zone in the down wave region with lower significant wave height (Hs) values and a slight increase of Hs in the up wave region. The effects of the windmill monopile on the wave field were found to be dependent on the directional distribution of the incoming wave spectrum and also on the wave diffraction and reflection. The hindcast study showed that the group of windmill monopiles may contribute to the reduction of the wave energy inside the offshore wind farm and that once the waves enter into the offshore wind farm they experience modifications due to the presence of the windmill monopiles, which cause a blocking of the wave energy propagation resulting in an altered distribution of the Hs field. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
