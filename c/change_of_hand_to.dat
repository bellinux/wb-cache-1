50|$|According to late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari, Parmigianino {{was working}} to this {{painting}} during the Sack of Rome, {{and he had}} to stop when the city was ravaged by the imperial troops. He was able to escape paying a ransom, while his uncle remained in Rome, being able to hide the painting in the refectory of Santa Maria della Pace.In 1558 the Bufalini family decided to move it in their chapel in Sant'Agostino at Città di Castello, from where it was acquired in 1790 by the English painter James Durno. In England, it was sold to the Marquess of Albercon for 1,500 guineas, then, after a series <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>to</b> the National Gallery, in 1826.|$|R

5000|$|The colossus (height: 5.05 m) was {{originally}} given to Michelangelo and meant {{to complement the}} David but later appropriated by the Medici family {{as a symbol of}} their renewed power after their return from exile in 1512, and again in 1530. Although descriptions of its unveiling in 1534 provided verbal and written criticisms of the marble, most were instead aimed at the Medici family for dissolving the Republic and were not aesthetic.A few of the writers of these hypercritical verses were imprisoned by Alessandro de'Medici, further suggesting a political commentary. The two harshest critics were Giorgio Vasari and Benvenuto Cellini, both of whom were champions of Michelangelo and rivals of Bandinelli for Medici patronage. Vasari lamented the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> from Michelangelo <b>to</b> Bandinelli, and the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> design. Cellini referred to the emphatic musculature as [...] "a sack full of melons", forgetting that Michelangelo had received similar deprecation previously by Leonardo da Vinci. Neither Vasari, nor Cellini can be viewed as unbiased resources due to their rivalries. The patrons (Medici family) were quite satisfied and rewarded Bandinelli greatly for his efforts with land, money, and he was later placed in charge of all sculptural and architectural programs for the Medici under Cosimo I.|$|R
40|$|The Tallahasseean (FL) [LCCN sn 95047414] began {{publication}} on June 1, 1885 in Florida's capital city, Tallahassee. Sometime {{not long}} thereafter, the newspaper merged with another Tallahassee newspaper, the Land of Flowers [LCCN: sn 95047413]. This merged newspaper, edited {{and published by}} R. Don McLeod and known as the Weekly Tallahasseean and Land of Flowers [LCCN: sn 95047415], {{is known to have}} existed by 1886. Sometime between 1888 and 1891, exact dates are not known, the newspaper's title changed to the Weekly Tallahasseean (FL) [LCCN: sn 95047416]. A <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> seems <b>to</b> have occasioned the name change. The Weekly Tallahasseean was published, first, by John G. Collins and, then, by John C. Trice. Some accounts suggest that the Weekly Tallahasseean was continued by the Tallahassee (FL) Weekly Capital [LCCN sn 95026134] in 1905. The Tallahassee Weekly Capital, however, had been publishing as early as 1903. In any case the Weekly Tallahasseean appears to have ceased publication in 1905. Because there are several runs of the Weekly Tallahasseean available in Florida libraries is not because Tallahassee was the seat of Florida's state government, it has been quoted copiously in many journal articles and theses. Of particular note is its usefulness in tracking Jim Crow behaviors in the early 20 th century. During this period the Black population in Leon County was about 80 % and the white supremacists felt threatened. Three works lend themselves to such analyses: Ortiz, Paul.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe authors present an evolutionary approach to evaluating the counterspace threat {{in support of}} Department of Defense (DoD) decision-makers. The goal is to present a process that decision-makers can readily utilize to accurately assess {{the level of the}} counterspace threat originating within their Area of Responsibility (AOR). It is particularly useful as the state <b>of</b> affairs <b>change</b> within the AOR. The authors examine the necessity to utilize space to achieve information dominance, strengths and weaknesses of present Counterspace Threat Models, DoD's increasing dependence on space assets, DoD's reliance on commercial space systems to meet future requirements, and potential adversaries' awareness of the dependence of U. S. forces on space systems. Conclusions stress that the threat is comprised of two essential elements an opponent's willingness to employ a counterspace tactic (their intent) and the opponent's ability to develop the necessary tools to employ a counterspace tactic (their capability). The authors believe that the "intent" component <b>of</b> the threat <b>changes</b> more rapidly than the present models can easily accommodate. Therefore, a process, such as the one presented in this thesis, will enable DoD decision-makers that experience many <b>of</b> the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> 'intent' first <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> rapidly and accurately assess the threat as the condition changes within the AOR[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
5|$|He was a Test {{selector}} for the Australian {{team from}} 1970 to 1981, filling the vacancy {{left by the}} retirement of former Test captain Ryder. Loxton's tenure on the selection panel coincided with a period of great upheaval in Australian cricket, {{on and off the}} field. Up until 1965, Australia had never lost a Test series to any country other than England, and their bilateral contests were regarded as the de facto world championship. However, in the next five years, Australia lost away to the West Indies 2–1, and to South Africa twice, 3–1 and 4–0 respectively. The former all-rounder became a selector after the whitewash in South Africa, joining Bradman and Harvey on the panel. During the 1970–71 home series against England, which Australia lost 2–1, the trio made a raft <b>of</b> <b>changes,</b> <b>handing</b> debuts <b>to</b> nine players, the largest number in a season since 1945–46 when competition resumed after World War II. One of the new players that Harvey and Loxton recommended to Bradman was Dennis Lillee, who went on to become one of Australia's greatest fast bowlers and the world’s leading wicket-taker. However, the season ended acrimoniously when captain Bill Lawry was sacked before the final Test without being informed of his fate; he only learned of his omission second hand.|$|R
