40|$|The {{introduction}} of smart electricity meters with cellular radio interface puts an additional {{load on the}} wireless cellular networks. Currently, these meters are designed for low duty <b>cycle</b> <b>billing</b> and occasional system check, which generates a low-rate sporadic traffic. As the number of distributed energy resources increases, the household power will become more variable and thus unpredictable {{from the viewpoint of}} the Distribution System Operator (DSO). It is therefore expected, in the near future, to have an increased number of Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) devices with Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) -like capabilities in the distribution grid, thus allowing the utilities to monitor the low voltage grid quality while providing information required for tighter grid control. From a communication standpoint, the traffic profile will change drastically towards higher data volumes and higher rates per device. In this paper, we characterize the current traffic generated by smart electricity meters and supplement it with the potential traffic requirements brought by introducing enhanced Smart Meters, i. e., meters with PMU-like capabilities. Our study shows how GSM/GPRS and LTE cellular system performance behaves with the current and next generation smart meters traffic, where it is clearly seen that the PMU data will seriously challenge these wireless systems. We conclude by highlighting the possible solutions for upgrading the cellular standards, in order to cope with the upcoming smart metering traffic.

30|$|Figure 5 {{shows how}} the optimal design of the <b>billing</b> <b>cycle</b> varies {{depending}} on consumers’ valuation of future utilities (reflected by the discount factor δ). On one hand, a longer <b>billing</b> <b>cycle</b> improves the monitoring accuracy, and therefore, the system has a smaller probability {{to go into the}} punishment phase. Hence, the efficiency is increasing in the <b>billing</b> <b>cycle.</b> On the other hand, a too long <b>billing</b> <b>cycle</b> reduces the consumers’ valuation of future utilities and, beyond some point, it violates the consumers’ incentives to comply. Moreover, the optimal <b>billing</b> <b>cycle</b> depends on how much the consumers value the future utilities which is parameterized by the discount factor δ. When δ is large, consumers value more their future utilities, and hence, a longer <b>billing</b> <b>cycle</b> can be used.|$|R

However, a very long <b>billing</b> <b>cycle</b> also reduces the consumers’ valuation of utilities in the future <b>billing</b> <b>cycles,</b> and hence, the punishment may not {{be strong enough to}} induce consumers’ compliance. Therefore, the optimal <b>billing</b> <b>cycle</b> as well as the punishment length should be carefully designed to induce the optimal performance of the smart grid system.|$|R

Using the pricing information, the consumers are able to infer the aggregate daily usage pattern in the last L days. However, since the price does not perfectly reflect the aggregate usage pattern due to the noise term, the consumers’ knowledge of the aggregate usage pattern is imperfect.|$|R

On May 30, 2017 a class action lawsuit was filed against Altice USA claiming that the company illegally changed the terms and conditions of its cancellation policy and didn't provide adequate notice to customers. The lawsuit also claims the company broke New York's General Business Law for deceptive practices and unjust enrichment.

40|$|In cloud computing, users scale their {{resources}} (computational) {{based on their}} need. There is massive literature dealing with such resource scaling algorithms. These works ignore a fundamental constrain imposed by all Cloud Service Providers (CSP), i. e. one {{has to pay for}} a fixed minimum duration irrespective of their usage. Such quantization in <b>billing</b> <b>cycles</b> poses problem for users with sporadic workload. In recent literature, Cloud Broker (CB) has been introduced for the benefit of such users. A CB rents resources from CSP and in turn provides service to users to generate profit. Contract between CB and user is that of pay-what-you-use/pay-per-use. However CB faces the challenge of Quantized <b>Billing</b> <b>Cycles</b> as it negotiates with CSP. We design two algorithms, one fully online and the other partially online, which maximizes the profit of the CB. The key idea is to regulate users demand using dynamic pricing. Our algorithm is inspired by the Ski-Rental problem. We derive competitive ratio of these algorithms and also conduct simulations using real world traces to prove the efficiency of our algorithm.
