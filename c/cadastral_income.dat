40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this diploma thesis is to analyse {{the changes in the}} <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> in the period 1990 to 2012 in Slovenia, which is {{illustrated}} for the case of savinjska statistical region. The theoretical part presents the legislation which deals with determining the <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> in the years 1990 - 2012. Using the regulations that determine the methodology to calculate the <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> in the given period, we compared the values of <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> just for the selected cadastral culture in the first cadastral class from the analysed cadastral districts belonging to the savinjska statistical region. In the practical part of diploma thesis, we compared the <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> for the following cadastral cultures: fields, gardens, meadow orchards, extensive orchards, vineyards, hop gardens, meadows, pasture lands and forests, in the chosen cadastral classes from 1990 to 2012 in the savinjska statistical region. We studied further land bonita points appointed to the previously listed cadastral cultures. In the future, land bonita points {{are going to be the}} basic criteria for determining the <b>cadastral</b> <b>income.</b> We come at the conclusion that within one cadastral district there are major dissimilarities in <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> (for a factor 10 or more) based on the cadastral culture and class. ...|$|E
40|$|As far as {{the common}} problem of {{countries}} fiscal equalisation is concerned, the specific topic of equalisation of real estate tax is of considerable importance, especially if the real property tax base {{is a function of}} the <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> and, at the same time, in cases the <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> does not express the real market value of the asset. Such a circumstance - pending a cadastral reform which aligns the cadastral value of assets with the corresponding market values - political and economic instruments, as well as adequate estimation algorithms, should be arranged in order to correlate the tax on real estate with the relative market value of the asset. In this regard, it is proposed a model able to consider the effect of the prevalent intrinsic features of the asset on its market value. Among the variables considered, is taken into account the energy class of the asset, which is increasingly important for the legislator in matter of politics of energy saving of a country. The effectiveness of the model, which requires the definition of a value function according to the evaluation logic of typical values procedure, is tested through an application to an urban area on municipal scale...|$|E

The current fiscal crisis revived interest towards this form of taxation. The paper investigates the fiscal and distributional consequences of including homeowners' imputed rent, net of mortgage interest and maintenance costs, in taxable income as any cash income source that extends consumption opportunities. Three scenarios are analysed in six European countries: in the first imputed rent {{is included in the}} taxable income of homeowners, {{while at the same time}} existing mortgage interest tax relief schemes and taxation of <b>cadastral</b> <b>incomes</b> are abolished. In two further revenue-neutral scenarios, the additional tax revenue raised through the taxation of imputed rent is redistributed to taxpayers, either through a proportional rebate or a lump-sum tax credit. Results show how including net imputed rent in the tax base might affect inequality in each of the countries considered. Housing taxation appears to be a promising avenue for raising additional revenues, or lightening taxation of labour, with no inequality-increasing side-effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{equalization}} criterion {{is important}} {{in relation to the}} real estate tax. The amount that the taxpayer must pay to the government should be commensurate with the current market value of the asset. In several European Countries, including Italy, the real estate tax is based on <b>cadastral</b> <b>incomes,</b> which often do not express the assets real market value. The evaluation model proposed in this study, developed following the evaluation logic of typical values procedure, aims to get to tax equalization by revising tax rates according to market information properly collected from datasets provided by private or public agencies. The model is set-up following these stages: analysis of the price formation mechanisms for urban properties and choice of evaluation process; selection of real estate features needed to achieve the tax equalization aims; data collection; definition of value function; calculus of the Municipal Property Tax; model calibration. The validity of the model is demonstrated by a case study application carried out on a wide urban area in which are situated about 500 real estate units...|$|R
40|$|Real estate {{taxation}} {{has been}} intensely debated lately. The main issue concerns {{the formation of}} taxable values based on the current <b>cadastral</b> <b>incomes.</b> More specifically, the point is made against the iniquity that the current surveyed values generate in the fiscal system, thus the necessity of overcoming it. It is known that the iniquity depends on the failed revision of valuation fees (related to the two-year period 1988 - 1989) and on the classification (sometimes still related to the urban cadastral) {{as well as on}} the modalities used to calculate the taxable basis through the multipliers (the IMU ones, particularly). These are the expression of a conventional (and certainly distorting) rate of return procedure which have become tools for the income variation. During the last twenty years, the Government and the Parliament have found the solution to the problem of iniquity in the revision of the current <b>cadastral</b> <b>incomes.</b> Nevertheless, they never managed to start a veritable reform process. In fact, during these years, they have just managed to introduce temporary measures as for instance paragraph 335 e 336 of article 1 of Law 311 of December 30 th for the revision of the classification of some territorial backgrounds or of some real estate units, thus managing to control the most evident iniquities. Some other norms were approved in order to conduct remote surveys to identify properties which were never listed in the cadastre office. More than once, other possible suitable solutions have been discussed which could have been, with a fast implementation and low use of resources, a first step towards the recovery of an equity of real estate taxation. Unfortunately, these came out to be temporary measures all the same. Last in order and worth of mention is the Ministry of Economic and Finance document by the Finance and Economy Department (hereinafter MEF) named “Ipotesi di revisione del prelievo sugli immobili” (Revision of real estate taxation proposal, August 2013) in which there is a list of all the different kind of interventions on real estate taxation, together with quantitative and qualitative valuations among which the use of the databases of the Observatory of real estate market to update the taxable basis of the Imposta municipale unica (IMU, Municipal one-tax). The solution eventually adopted by the Parliament is an overall revision capable of reforming the entire current cadastral valuation system without resorting to intermediate solutions. In fact, it has recently approved the Enabling Law 23, of 11 th March, containing «Dispositions for a more equal, transparent and growth-oriented fiscal system» in which, in the article 2, a reform of the cadastral valuation system is taken into account. It is important to notice how any contrary vote has been expressed against the Enabling Law’s text while its first reading prior to the vote in the Chamber of Deputies on September 25 th 2013, as well as in the final vote which took place on February 27 th 2014. Only during the first reading and vote in the Senate (February 4 th 2014), 12 contrary votes were registered. These elements show how the awareness of the urgency to restore an equal real estate taxation system is largely spread and accepted. What emerges from the Parliamentary debate is that different political forces are fully aware of the necessity to restore an equal real estate taxation system as well as of the complexity of the reform and its long implementation process. The auspice is to have this system implemented as soon as possible, possibly before a five-year period. About this delicate issue, also the experts in the field and the scientific world of reference have participated in the debate about the necessity of a cadastral reform through several studies. On the one hand, they want to provide empirical proof of the taxation iniquity caused by the current system; on the other hand, they want to propose possible solutions to correct this situation. Among these studies, there is the recent paper by Rocco Curto, Elena Fregonara, Patrizia Semeraro (2014) “Come rendere più eque le rendite catastali in attesa della revisione degli estimi?”(How can land registry values be made fairer pending a review of valuations?) in which a rapid and simple methodology to vary the current real estate rent through corrective coefficients of location is proposed. In this way, the taxable basis on real estate fees is re-defined in order to reduce the current fiscal iniquity caused by the obsolescence of the incomes based on the current cadastre office. However, a temporary correction to implement while waiting for the reform of the entire cadastral system. In particular, in their paper, Curto et al. (2014) propose to multiply the value of the current income by a coefficient obtained as a ratio between the average prices of a given census microzone and a reference index that “the ratio between an index price which most accurately sums up property values in individual municipalities or aggregations of municipalities in the case of the smallest municipalities (determined on the basis of market observations constituting the entire statistical sample) and the corresponding price indices of the values of each Microzone, defined on the basis of market observations (sub-samples) ” (p. 62). In the remainder of the paper, the methodology underlying the hypothesis contained in the MEF’s “Revision of real estate taxation proposal”(August 2013) is explained. Secondly, the methodological differences of corrections of real estate incomes proposed in the cited document by the MEF and in Curto et al. (2014) ’s article are then compared. Subsequently, some empirical proof is supplied relating to the two taxable-basis equity recovery methods. Lastly, further consideration on the effective and generalized implementation of the proposed methods will be made...|$|R

We use as input data those {{provided by the}} Bank of Italy from its Survey on Households Income and Wealth, and discuss specific problems arising {{in the evaluation of}} <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> and of the Property Tax base. Our estimates of the distribution of taxpayers are very close to the Ministry of Finance official statistics; hence, our model {{can be seen as a}} reliable tool to evaluate the current distribution of housing taxation and the impact of potential tax reforms. Our simulations suggest that both Property Tax and Waste Management Tax show a moderate regressive impact with respect to household gross income, whilst the Personal Income Tax on dwellings other than the main residence is progressive. We then provide an application of our model, to study the Property Tax reform in 2008. Our findings show that all households owning the main residence gain from the 2008 reform, but tax cuts are mostly concentrated on the top three deciles of household equivalent gross income, so that the richest benefit most.

40|$|Fra i temi affrontati dalla legge 11 marzo 2011, n. 23, recante delega al governo per un sistema fiscale più equo, spiccano le questioni fondamentali della riforma catastale e della fiscalità energetico-ambientale, di cui si tratta nel presente studio. La nuova riforma del catasto dei fabbricati aspira a realizzare un sistema fiscale più perequato at-traverso la rimozione della disparità fra redditi (e valori) catastali e redditi (e valori) osservabili nei mercati immobiliari. Il tema catastale è rilevante per i molteplici effetti fiscali che ne derivano, e il divario esistente fra i valori di mercato e quelli catastali, hanno suscitato un grande interesse degli studiosi di estimo, stimolando la produzione di una mole di interventi di natura teorica, sulle finalità ed obiettivi del catasto, ed operativa, con sperimentazioni e proposte di procedimenti estimativi immobiliari professionali o appositamente concepiti per le applicazioni ca-tastali. Questi studi affrontato le tematiche suddette principalmente in rapporto agli immobili a destinazione ordinaria e ai fondi agricoli. Le problematiche di equità fiscale che la legge delega intende affrontare mediante la riforma del catasto dei fabbricati emergono, tuttavia, non soltanto nell’ambito delle {{categorie}} di immobili a destinazione ordinaria, ma altresì per gli immobili a destinazione speciale. Questo contributo approfondisce il tema in rapporto agli impianti per la produzione energetica da fonti alternative diffuse sul territorio (irraggiamento solare e vento). Il diverso “potenziale energetico locale” dei vari siti geografici, consente di rilevare una “rendita solare” differenziale che si concretizza in una variegata redditività di analoghi impianti a fonti rinnovabili diffuse installati su territori con localizzazione geografica differente. Alla luce di tale osservazione, si evidenziano i li-miti del procedimento adottato dal sistema normativo italiano e dalla prassi catastale per la stima della rendita catastale degli impianti a fonti rinnovabili e si proporre un rimedio coerente con gli obiettivi di incentivazione delle produzioni energetiche a più elevata qualità ambientale, da perseguire anche mediante un’adeguata fiscalità energetica, come prescrive l’art. 15 della legge delega in oggetto. Among {{the topics}} {{addressed by the}} Law of 11 March 2014 n. 23, delegating to the government for a fairer tax system, there are two fundamental issues which {{are the subject of}} this study, the cadastral reform and the energy and environmental taxation. The new reform of the cadastre of buildings aspires to achieve a more equalized tax system by removing the disparity between cadastral incomes (and assessable values) and incomes (and property values) observable in real estate markets. The Law n. 23 / 2014 also introduces the necessity of defining an energy-environmental taxation in order to promote the growth of green economy. The definition of an energy and environmental taxation is very broad issue. It includes many aspects related to the activities of production and consumption. However, with regard {{to the development of the}} electric energy market from renewable sources, it is referable to the theme of greater correspondence between cadastral incomes and values and respective incomes and values in actual market. The disparity in the definition of cadastral incomes and values affects the whole system of taxation that comes from them. It is the whole system of real estate taxation, including on property taxes or taxes on other real rights on real estate, the taxes due in the sale and transfer by gift or inheritance of properties and also the income tax of individuals. For the resulting consequences on the tax system, the gap between real estate market values and cadastral values have aroused great interest of appraisal scholars, that agree on the need for similarity of assessed values registered in the cadastre and values detectable on actual market. This condition must be satisfied in order to allow the cadastre to perform properly its own fiscal function. The cadastral estimation applied to buildings in ordinary destination generates inequalities arising in part from the macroscopic analysis of the built environment - which set aside an accurate segmentation of the housing market - and in part by the application of the estimation procedure "for classes and rates", in which the linking scales of real estate earnings and the linking scale of municipalities allow us to attribute to individual real estate units the relative rates of cadastral estimation. These apply to consistencies of the surface obtained, in their turn, with automatic coefficients for the conversion of the cadastral rooms. Issues of tax equity similar to those that the delegating law wants to address through the reform of the cadastre of buildings belonging to ordinary cadastral categories (A, B and C) emerge also in relation to real estate immovable for special purposes and for lands. For what concerns power plants using renewable energy sources, the theme of the lack of fairness in taxation for real estate properties for special purpose is of great importance for supporting the development of green economy in Italy. The present contribution deals with the theme of equity in attribution of cadastral incomes to installations for the production of electric energy using alternative sources scattered on the land (solar irradiation and wind power). A remedy for reducing inequality of incomes attributed according to current cadastral praxis is proposed. In Italy, the electricity production market from renewable sources was still negligible at the end of the nineties. Following the impetus provided by incentive policies adopted since 2001, the program "Photovoltaic roofs" and the five subsequent versions of the so-called "Energy Account", it has developed rapidly in the fields of photovoltaic and wind power. With the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (PAN) and the recent National Energy Strategy (SEN), developed in the context of energy and environmental policies promoted by the Euro-pean Union, Italy has made specific commitments on development of use of renewable energy sources and on the reduction of the production of greenhouse gases. These commitments require, among other things, a new increase in the produc-tion of electric energy by technologies free from production of greenhouse gases. Therefore, the issue of fairness in the attribution of <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> to installations producing electric energy by renewable sources, already involving a large number of plants, will affect in the short to medium term a growing number of installations, and most importantly, a significantly higher in-stalled power, with considerable effects on tax revenues resulting from the tax base of cadastral nature. In general, the photovoltaic and wind power plants belong to the cadastral category "D/ 1 - factories", unless they have a modest power and are in-tended for self-consumption or are classifiable in the category "D/ 10 " of "factory buildings for the production functions related to agricultural activities". Operational difficulties related to the lack of active markets for lease and sale of property units intended for special and particular use are found more so in the still latent market for solar and wind power installations. This circumstance makes it inapplicable, in cadastral praxis, the direct estimation procedure of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> for derivation from the gross average annual lease fee. A similar difficulty arises in the application of the indirect estimating method of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>income</b> derived from the capital value. Therefore, the cadastral praxis commonly resorts to the indirect process deriving income from the capital value expressed by the value of the reconstruction cost. Therefore, the annual income of wind and photovoltaic power plants surveyed in the cadastral category D/ 1 is determined by multiplying the reconstruction cost of the installation by an appropriate fruitfulness rate. Based on the in-dications of the prevailing case law, the latter is assumed to be equal to 2...|$|E
