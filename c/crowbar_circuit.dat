The converter is a direct topology operating with a high frequency (resonant) link. Losses are minimised by switching at zero current. High operating frequency reduces the filter and transformer size. The transformer uses the latest nano-crystalline materials to further reduce losses. Where possible, circuit elements are incorporated into the transformer to reduce the physical size of the converter. Design of this transformer to accommodate the insulation, VA rating and circuit elements is non-trivial. The Radio Frequency power generated is stable and predictable, whilst the reduced energy storage in filter components removes the need for <b>crowbar</b> <b>circuits.</b> Potential benefits of this converter when compared to conventional approaches are discussed.

Thyratrons are also used in high-power UHF television transmitters, to protect inductive output tubes from internal shorts, by grounding the incoming high-voltage supply during {{the time it takes}} for a circuit breaker to open and reactive components to drain their stored charges.

2500|$|Feedback voltage {{regulators}} operate {{by comparing the}} actual output voltage to some fixed reference voltage. Any difference is amplified and used to control the regulation element {{in such a way}} as to reduce the voltage error. This forms a negative feedback control loop; increasing the open-loop gain tends to increase regulation accuracy but reduce stability. (Stability is avoidance of oscillation, or ringing, during step changes.) There will also be a trade-off between stability and the speed of the response to changes. [...] If the output voltage is too low (perhaps due to input voltage reducing or load current increasing), the regulation element is commanded, up to a point, to produce a higher output voltage–by dropping less of the input voltage (for linear series regulators and buck switching regulators), or to draw input current for longer periods (boost-type switching regulators); if the output voltage is too high, the regulation element will normally be commanded to produce a lower voltage. However, many regulators have over-current protection, so that they will entirely stop sourcing current (or limit the current in some way) if the output current is too high, and some regulators may also shut down if the input voltage is outside a given range (see also: <b>crowbar</b> <b>circuits).</b>|$|R

30|$|With the {{vigorous}} exploitation of wind power generation, stability {{problems associated with}} wind farms have increased [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], among which sub-synchronous oscillation (SSO) is a prominent example. SSO was initially defined as an electric power system condition where the electric network exchanges significant energy with a turbine generator at {{one or more of}} the natural frequencies of the combined system below the synchronous frequency of the system [6]. With deepening research, the concept of SSO has expanded to systems with wind generators. In October 2009, a series of offline wind generators and cracked <b>crowbar</b> <b>circuits</b> were found in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas event [3]. In December 2012, a wind farm in North China reported that a part of their generators were shut down and that a sub-synchronous current was sent out to the main grid during the accident [4, 5]. In July 2015, several thermal generators were tripped off by shaft torsional vibration relay in a thermal power plant in Hami, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. This event led to the emergent power reduction of a nearby high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission line and caused sharp fluctuation in the frequency of the grid. Analysis of the records of the phasor measurement units after the accident revealed that the sub-synchronous current that aroused the torsional vibration came from wind farms north of the region [7].|$|R
50|$|A <b>crowbar</b> <b>circuit</b> is an {{electrical}} circuit {{used to prevent}} an overvoltage condition of a power supply unit from damaging the circuits attached to the power supply. It operates by putting a short circuit or low resistance path across the voltage output (Vo), much as {{if one were to}} drop a crowbar across the output terminals of the power supply. Crowbar circuits are frequently implemented using a thyristor, TRIAC, trisil or thyratron as the shorting device. Once triggered, they depend on the current-limiting circuitry of the power supply or, if that fails, the blowing of the line fuse or tripping the circuit breaker.|$|E
50|$|When {{a circuit}} must be {{protected}} from overvoltage and there are failure modes in the power supply that can produce such overvoltages, the circuit may be protected by a device commonly called a <b>crowbar</b> <b>circuit.</b> When this device detects an overvoltage it causes a short circuit between the power supply and its return. This will cause both an immediate drop in voltage (protecting the device) and an instantaneous high current {{which is expected to}} open a current sensitive device (such as a fuse or circuit breaker). This device is called a crowbar as it is likened to dropping an actual crowbar across a set of bus bars (exposed electrical conductors).|$|E
50|$|An example <b>crowbar</b> <b>circuit</b> {{is shown}} to the right. This {{particular}} circuit uses an LM431 adjustable zener regulator to control {{the gate of the}} TRIAC. The resistor divider of R1 and R2 provide the reference voltage for the LM431. The divider is set so that during normal operating conditions, the voltage across R2 is slightly lower than VREF of the LM431. Since this voltage is below the minimum reference voltage of the LM431, it remains off and very little current is conducted through the zener and cathode resistor. If the cathode resistor is sized accordingly, very little voltage will be dropped across it and the TRIAC gate terminal will be essentially at the same potential as MT1, keeping the TRIAC off. If the supply voltage increases, the voltage across R2 will exceed VREF and the zener will begin to regulate voltage, drawing more current through it. The voltage at the gate terminal will be pulled down to VZ (the zener voltage), exceeding the gate trigger voltage of the TRIAC and latching it on.|$|E

Many researches investigate the transient response characteristics and explore FRT control strategies of wind turbines. Power converter controller with transient voltage support capability and pitch angle control are adopted to ensure the FRT capability of DFIGs based wind turbines and to improve the transient voltage stability of grid-connected wind farm [3]. Promising methods based on <b>crowbar</b> protection <b>circuit</b> [9, 10, 11] or rotor excitation control have been developed [12, 13].

30|$|An active <b>crowbar</b> {{protective}} <b>circuit</b> is {{an effective}} and common approach for {{low voltage ride through}} (LVRT) of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The crowbar resistance value and its switching scheme both have crucial effects on safety recovery. The effects encountered are correlative dependence and interplay so that analyzing them from a single factor, as most existing LVRT control methods would do, obtains a partial optimal solution. This paper connects these two factors to analyze their coordination effects on the LVRT control, and to also investigate whether the global optimal performance of these factors can be achieved. The principles for resistance selection and the schemes for crowbar switching are discussed first. Next the coupling relationship is analyzed based on statistical sampling simulation data with different resistance values and various switching schemes. The results demonstrate that their coordination has critical influence on rotor peak current, DC-link voltage and reactive power. The optimal coordination will be different according to specific requirements. Hence the global optimal combination could be achieved when all requirements are taken into consideration.|$|R

40|$|Modeling of {{wind farms}} to {{determine}} their short circuit contribution in response to faults is {{a crucial part of}} system impact studies performed by power utilities. Short circuit calculations are necessary to determine protective relay settings, equipment ratings and to provide data for protection coordination. The plethora of different factors that influence the response of wind farms to short circuits makes short circuit modeling of wind farms an interesting, complex, and challenging task. Low voltage ride through (LVRT) requirements make it necessary for the latest generation of wind generators to be capable of providing reactive power support without disconnecting from the grid during and after voltage sags. If the wind generator must stay connected to the grid, a facility has to be provided to by-pass the high rotor current that occurs during voltage sags and prevent damage of the rotor side power electronic circuits. This is done through <b>crowbar</b> <b>circuits</b> which are of two types, namely active and passive crowbars, based on the power electronic device used in the <b>crowbar</b> triggering <b>circuit.</b> Power electronics-based converters and controls have {{become an integral part of}} wind generator systems like the Type 3 doubly fed induction generator based wind generators. The proprietary nature of the design of these power electronics makes it difficult to obtain the necessary information from the manufacturer to model them accurately. Also, the use of power electronic controllers has led to phenomena such as sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) in series compensated Type 3 wind farms which are characterized by non-fundamental frequency oscillations. SSCI affects fault current magnitude significantly and is a crucial factor that cannot be ignored while modeling series compensated Type 3 wind farms. These factors have led to disagreement and inconsistencies about which techniques are appropriate for short circuit modeling of wind farms. Fundamental frequency models like voltage behind transient reactance model are incapable of representing the majority of critical wind generator fault characteristics such as sub-synchronous interactions. The Detailed time domain models, though accurate, demand high levels of computation and modeling expertise. Voltage dependent current source modeling based on look up tables are not stand-alone models and provide only a black-box type of solution. The short circuit modeling methodology developed in this research work for representing a series compensated Type 3 wind farm is based on the generalized averaging theory, where the system variables are represented as time varying Fourier coefficients known as dynamic phasors. The modeling technique is also known as dynamic phasor modeling. The Type 3 wind generator has become the most popular type of wind generator, making it an ideal candidate for such a modeling method to be developed. The dynamic phasor model provides a generic model and achieves a middle ground between the conventional electromechanical models and the cumbersome electromagnetic time domain models. The essence of this scheme to model a periodically driven system, such as power converter circuits, is to retain only particular Fourier coefficients based on the behavior of interest of the system under study making it computationally efficient and inclusive of the required frequency components, even if non-fundamental in nature. The capability to model non-fundamental frequency components is critical for representing sub-synchronous interactions. A 450 MW Type 3 wind farm consisting of 150 generator units was modeled using the proposed approach. The method is shown to be highly accurate for representing faults at the point of interconnection of the wind farm to the grid for balanced and unbalanced faults as well as for non-fundamental frequency components present in fault currents during sub-synchronous interactions. Further, the model is shown to be accurate also for different degrees of transmission line compensation and different transformer configurations used in the test system...|$|R
30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of wind generation {{technology and the}} increasing growth of wind power capacity in power systems, large-scale wind farms have {{a great impact on}} relay protection [1, 2]. As the electricity collecting element, the outgoing transmission line is quite important for normal operation of a wind farm, especially in a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm, which is a widely applied type [3, 4]. Thus it is necessary to find a reliable protection scheme for such transmission lines. The directional relay {{is one of the most}} important protection elements. A traditional fault component-based directional relay is extensively used in practice because of its simple structure, fast response, and good adaptability to load, fault type and transition resistance. However, the fault characteristics of a wind farm are different from those of conventional power systems [5, 6]. Because of the input of a <b>crowbar</b> protection <b>circuit,</b> the main frequency of the short circuit current fed by a doubly-fed wind farm with a capacity of low voltage ride through (LVRT) will be the rotating frequency of the wind turbine before the fault, and it may no longer maintain the power frequency (50 Hz). This may considerably impact on the performance of the traditional directional relay which compares the phase angles of current and voltage.|$|R

Several promising methods for FRT based on <b>crowbar</b> protection <b>circuit</b> have been provided in [9, 10, 11].

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Owing to {{the global}} {{concerns}} on climate change and world-wide carbon pricing policies, the use of conventional fossil fuels has been descending these years. Instead, renewable energy is getting increasing popularity in the power industry. Specifically, wind power occupies a large proportion in the current energy context due to the relatively mature generation and operation techniques. With the increasing penetration of wind power into the grid, new challenges are emerging {{in front of the}} grid administrators. A series of requirement, such as power quality, frequency support, and voltage criterion, are needed to be defined so that the penetration level of wind power can be improved. To achieve these requirements, one way is to raise the reserve capacity of wind farms. Under this circumstance, the instalment of battery storage systems and reactive power compensation devices are needed, therefore bringing a heavy economic burden. Another way is to improve the performance of each wind turbine to meet the requirement by control strategies. Hence, the focus of this research is to enhance wind turbines capability of meeting grid code requirements by advanced control methods. Particularly, the high controllability of variable speed wind turbines (VSWT) enables them so adaptive to the modern power system that their control methodologies for grid connection are studied in this thesis. This research focuses on the advanced control methodologies for VSWT to improve its grid connection capability. Specifically, advanced methods are developed for three essential objectives: 1) improve wind turbines performance to ride through the low voltage condition during the fault period; 2) develop active power control strategies in a VSWT under the normal operational condition; 3) find a smart control scheme for a large scale wind farm to generate active power as the system operator desired. In the area of low voltage ride through (LVRT), an advanced control method for VSWT being able to ride through the voltage dip event is proposed. Firstly, a review of conventional LVRT methods with auxiliary devices engaged is presented. Such auxiliary devices as <b>crowbar</b> <b>circuits</b> and DC chopper are not energy efficient and may exert thermal stress in the circuit, bringing the energy storage system being more promising. A new method considering the Abstract capability of variable speed WT itself to enhance LVRT capability is presented. In fact, the excessive generation during the fault condition can be stored in the rotor inertia, and released later when the fault is cleared. Therefore, a modified method, which coordinates the control of battery device and kinetic energy, is delivered to improve LVRT performance. Meanwhile, the switch strategy for battery device is also discussed through the dynamic simulations in Matlab/SimpowerSystem. In the area of active power control strategies in a VSWT under the normal operational condition, active power control for VSWT is significant for wind power being more dispatchable and generating power as required. The active power control is achieved by making VSWT operate under the deloading mode, i. e. compromising acquired wind power through tip speed ratio adjustment from original MPPT point. How much the compromised power is should be discussed regarding to different objectives. In this research, the smoothing power output during a certain time horizon is the control objective and obtained with the optimization approach. In the area of active power control in a large-scale wind farm, a cooperation-driven distributed control is proposed in this project. It is far more important to enhance the integrating performance of a wind farm compared with a single wind turbine. For a dispatchable wind farm, system operators assign an estimated generation command to wind farm central module. In this case, finding a proper method to distribute the generation task among the widely spread WTs is increasingly urgent with wind farm scale growing. In this research, a distributed control scheme is proposed to meet with system request. Compared with the conventional centralized method, the distributed one can ease the computation burden to a large extend, and is more robust and feasible to the topology change. Moreover, the kinetic energy storage potential in a wind turbine is tapped to provide a buffer for power dispatch. The proposed control schemes have been numerically verified on a number of benchmark test systems. Their effectiveness and feasibility are verified by simulation results, showing satisfactory performances...|$|R
40|$|The {{usage of}} MW-size variable-speed wind {{turbines}} {{as sources of}} energy has increased significantly during the last decade. Advantages over fixed-speed wind turbines include more efficient wind power extraction, reduced grid power fluctuation, and improved grid reactive power support. Two types of typical generation systems for large-size variable-speed wind turbines exist. One is the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) with a partial-scale power electronic converter. The other is the permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) with a full-scale power electronic converter. This research is to develop the model of these two wind turbine systems for real-time simulation, including the complete aerodynamic and mechanical and electrical components. The special focus of this dissertation addresses the mechanical sensorless control of wind generators and grid fault ride-through strategies. In the electrical controller of a DFIG, A mechanical speed sensor is normally required to provide accurate information of the machine speed and rotor position. However, sensorless operation is desirable because {{the use of a}} mechanical speed sensor coupled with the machine shaft has several drawbacks in terms of degraded robustness, extra cost and cabling, and difficult maintenance. In this dissertation, design and analysis of a novel sensorless vector controller using a reduced-order state observer is addressed in detail. Results have revealed that the proposed sensorless observer is more robust against parameter variations than other speed estimation schemes. Nowadays, almost all the grid code specifications over the world have included fault ride-through requirements for grid-connected wind turbines. In US, as mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 661 -A, wind farms are required to remain online in the presence of severe voltage disturbances as low as 0. 0 pu, as measured at the high voltage side of the wind generator step-up transformer, for up to 9 cycles (150 ms). These strict requirements present a significant challenge to the existing wind turbine technologies. In this dissertation, an improved technique combining the traditional <b>crowbar</b> protection <b>circuit</b> and the demagnetizing current injection to ride-through symmetrical grid voltage dips is analyzed and verified for a DFIG-based wind turbine. Also, an improved fault ride-through control strategy without using any extra protection hardware for a PMSG-based wind turbine to mitigate the dc-link overvoltage is developed. In this dissertation, a new real-time simulation platform is developed based on industry standard simulation tools, RTDS and dSPACE. The aforementioned wind turbine models and proposed sensorless controller as well as fault ride-through strategies are all implemented in real-time on this 2 ̆ 2 hardware-in-the-loop 2 ̆ 2 type of simulation platform.

The fundamental assumption for presenting this concept is related to the flexibility of WIS to increase and decrease the load demand depending on the available power. Some of challenges identified are the frequency and power balance, wind intermittency and impacts on the system stability and the effective load control. This work addressed these challenges by a mathematical modelling of the system components and by testing the assembled configurations in different wind scenarios, exploring the systems response on the mentioned variables of interest. The first part of the thesis works with two models. The hybrid WIS model and the stand-alone WIS model. The hybrid WIS configuration is a representation of a dual system that uses a gas turbine and a wind turbine. In other words, the hybrid model is a representation of an O&G platform that integrates wind power. The use of wind power for WIS in O&G platforms is an alternative used proposed here for reducing CO_ 2 emissions, increasing installed capacity and wind penetration without compromising the system functioning. The ordinary approach has been to assume an inflexible load and a predominance of gas units. The gas turbines must be able to provide for the demand at each instant in case of wind power deficit, leading to large dependency and frequent on and off cycles on the generators. The new approach developed here, is to incorporate load control on the existing system and to understand the advantages of load management, when dealing with wind power fluctuations. The load control is applied to specific equipment as for example injection pumps or non-priority loads. The hybrid model is composed of four subsystems. The wind turbine, the gas turbine, the fixed and flexible loads and the dump load subsystem. The wind turbine subsystem is composed of a wind turbine, made of a direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), a rectifier, a <b>crowbar</b> protection <b>circuit,</b> an inverter and a filtering inductance. The gas turbine subsystem drives a synchronous generator with an excitation circuit. The fixed load is a three-phase balance load defined in terms of active and reactive power and a flexible load controlled by an external power balance loop. Finally, the dump load subsystem is represented by a regulating resistor bank. The second dynamic model is composed of five subsystems, it is called here stand-alone WIS configuration. The wind turbine, the synchronous flywheel, the fixed load, the dump load and a variable speed drive connected to an induction motor. This configuration is a double back-to-back system proposed in a previous specialization project. The new component is the synchronous flywheel that sets the system frequency, and is also responsible for providing active and reactive power to balance the network. Another project contribution is the full implementation of the VSD with pump torque profile as mechanical load. The generalized VSC control framework is used for developing control of the different IGBTs. Firstly, a simplified control of rotor speed and maximum power extraction from the wind turbine on the rectifier is implemented. Secondly, the inverter control objective is on the DC voltage and to be compliant with the grid requirements. Thirdly, the dump load control was based on frequency measurement and varying conductance changes in the ballast load. Finally, the second back-to-back converter (VSD) implements an improved field-oriented control strategy with respect to the specialization project. The improvement consists of the installation of front-end rectifier that allows a bidirectional power flow. In other words, instead of burning energy every time the motor should break, the power is fed back to the grid, which is known as regenerative breaking. The second part of the thesis implements an energy model in HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) Energy. This model was developed as a validation for long-term assessment in a different time scale, wind resource evaluation in a specific region near to Trondheim, and as a feasibility test of load management for WIS. This software is specialized in microgrids and energy studies. The study uses real wind profile downloaded from NASA surface meteorology database. The wind speed was measured at 50 m above the earth surface, and it was corrected to the hub height. The measurements were monthly average values in a 10 -year period. The system simulated consists of a wind turbine, a flexible load and a battery bank. The wind turbine is a 6 MW turbine, with a load of 3. 5 MW of peak demand and a 500 kW battery bank. The load profile was synthetized following the generation curve of the wind turbine, representing an adaptable load. The dynamic simulations confirmed that it is possible for the load to follow the wind generation within its permissible operating range. Two cases were run on HOMER, one for high wind (12 m/s) and another for low wind condition (8. 66 m/s). The simulations consisted in sensitivity and optimization analyzes. Under the user-specified constraints, the program optimized at the lowest total net present cost, varying fuel cost, number of batteries, number of wind turbines, etc. and then selects the best configuration. Besides obtaining useful technical information, long-term energy assessment studies are required for determining the economics of a particular project. However, due to lack of investment costs, economic analyses are out of scope in this report...|$|R
40|$|Abstract__Low Voltage Ride Through is an {{important}} feature for wind turbine systems to fulfill grid code requirements. In case of wind turbine technologies using doubly fed induction generators the reaction to grid voltage disturbances is sensible. Hardware or software protection must be implemented to protect the converter from tripping during severe grid voltage faults. In this paper the Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) solution for LVRT of DFIG wind turbines is investigated by simulation results using a detailed converter model considering the switching and appropriate 2 MW wind turbine system parameter.

The characteristics of DFIG WTGs under voltage sags and swells were studied focusing on the DFIG WTG stator flux and rotor voltages during the transient periods of grid voltage changes. The protection schemes of the rotor <b>crowbar</b> <b>circuit</b> and the DC chopper circuit were proposed considering the characteristics of the DFIG WTGs during voltage changes. The fast coordinated control of RSC and GSC were developed based on the characteristic analysis in order to realize efficient LVRT and HVRT of the DFIG WTGs.
