25|$|Because of {{its high}} cost saffron was often {{replaced}} by or diluted with safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) or turmeric (<b>Curcuma</b> longa) in cuisine. Both mimic saffron's colour well, but have distinctive flavours. Saffron {{is used in the}} confectionery and liquor industries; this is its most common use in Italy. Chartreuse, izarra, and strega are types of alcoholic beverages that rely on saffron to provide a flourish of colour and flavour. The savvy often crumble and pre-soak saffron threads for several minutes prior to adding them to their dishes. They may toss threads into water or sherry and leave them to soak for approximately ten minutes. This process extracts the threads' colour and flavour into the liquid phase; powdered saffron does not require this step. The soaking solution is then added to the hot cooking dish, allowing even colour and flavour distribution, which is critical in preparing baked goods or thick sauces.|$|E

40|$|As a {{classical}} herb pair in clinics of traditional Chinese medicine, <b>Curcumae</b> Rhizoma–Sparganii Rhizoma (HP CR–SR) {{is used for}} activating blood circulation to remove blood stasis. The essential components in HP CR–SR and its single herbs were comparatively analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry data. 66, 22, and 54 components in volatile oils of <b>Curcumae</b> Rhizoma, Sparganii Rhizoma, and HP CR–SR were identified, and total contents accounted for 75. 416 %, 91. 857 %, and 79. 553 % respectively. The thirty-eight components were found in HP CR–SR, and not detected in single herbs <b>Curcumae</b> Rhizoma and Sparganii Rhizoma. The highest radical trapping action was seen by an essential oil of HP CR–SR (IC 50 = 0. 59 ± 0. 04 mg/mL). Furthermore, the HP CR–SR essential oil showed more remarkable cytotoxicity on tumor cell lines {{than that of the}} single herbs <b>Curcumae</b> Rhizoma and Sparganii Rhizoma in a dose-dependent manner: IC 50 values showing 32. 32 ± 5. 31 μg/mL (HeLa), 34. 76 ± 1. 82 μg/mL (BGC 823), 74. 84 ± 1. 66 μg/mL (MCF- 7), 66. 12 ± 11. 23 μg/mL (SKOV 3), and 708. 24 ± 943. 91 μg/mL (A 549), respectively. In summary, the essential oil of HP CR–SR is different from any one of <b>Curcumae</b> Rhizoma and Sparganii Rhizoma, nor simply their superposition, and HP CR–SR oil presented more remarkable anticancer and antioxidant activities compared with <b>Curcumae</b> Rhizoma and Sparganii Rhizoma oils...|$|R

60|$|Siligoree {{stands on}} the verge of the Terai, that low malarious belt which skirts the base of the Himalaya, from the Sutlej to Brahma-koond in Upper Assam. Every feature, botanical, geological, and zoological, is new on {{entering}} this district. The change is sudden and immediate: sea and shore are hardly more conspicuously different, nor {{from the edge of the}} Terai to the limit of perpetual snow is any botanical region more clearly marked than this, which is the commencement of Himalayan vegetation. A sudden descent leads to the Mahanuddee river, flowing in a shallow valley, over a pebbly bottom: it is a rapid river, even at this season; its banks are fringed with bushes, and it is as clear and sparkling as a trout stream in Scotland. Beyond it the road winds through a thick brushwood, choked with long grasses, and with but few trees, chiefly of Acacia, Dalbergia Sissoo, and a scarlet fruited Sterculia. The soil is a red, friable clay and gravel. At this season only a few spring plants were in flower, amongst which a very sweet-scented Crinum, Asphodel, and a small <b>Curcuma,</b> were in the greatest profusion. Leaves of terrestrial Orchids appeared, with ferns and weeds of hot damp regions. I crossed the beds of many small streams: some were dry, and all very tortuous; their banks were richly clothed with brushwood and climbers of Convolvulus, Vines, Hiraea, Leea, Menispermeae, Cucurbitaceae, and Bignoniaceae. Their pent-up waters, percolating the gravel beds, and partly carried off by evaporation through the stratum of ever-increasing vegetable mould, must be one main agent in the production of the malarious vapours of this pestilential region. Add to this, the detention of the same amongst the jungly herbage, the amount of vapour in the humid atmosphere above, checking the upward passage of that from the soil, the sheltered nature of the locality at the immediate base of lofty mountains; and there appear to me to be here all necessary elements, which, combined, will produce stagnation and deterioration in an atmosphere loaded with vapour. Fatal as this district is, and especially to Europeans, a race inhabit it with impunity, who, if not numerous, do not owe their paucity to any climatic causes. These are the Mechis, often described as a squalid, unhealthy people, typical of the region they frequent; but who are, in reality, more robust than the Europeans in India, and whose disagreeably sallow complexion is deceptive as indicating a sickly constitution. They are a mild, inoffensive people, industrious for Orientals, living by annually burning the Terai jungle and cultivating the cleared spots; and, though so sequestered and isolated, they rather court than avoid intercourse with those whites whom they know to be kindly disposed.|$|E

The Strain Eri 12 was isolated from the rhizosphere of Rhizoma <b>Curcumae</b> Longae which was collected from Ya'an city of Sichuan province, southwest of China. The strain Eri 12 was subjected to molecular identification which included DNA extraction, amplification of 16 S rDNA, 16 S rDNA gene sequencing, BLASTN search and construction of 16 S rDNA phylogenetic tree using MEGA 4. 1. Simultaneously, the mycelia extract using ethyl acetate was tested for its antioxidant activity using ABTS (2, 2 -Azinobis- 3 -ethyl benzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) radicals scavenging test and DPPH [1, 1 -Diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 -(2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl] radicals scavenging test.

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} inhibitory glycine recep-tors (GlyRs) are an important molecular target {{in the treatment of}} numerous neurological disorders.

In this study, we showed that curcumol, a major bioactive component of R. <b>curcumae,</b> reversibly and concentration-dependently inhibited the glycine-activated current (IGly) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The inhibitory effect was neither voltage- nor agonist concentration-dependent. Moreover, curcumol selectively in-hibited homomeric 2 -containing, but not 1 - or 3 -containing, GlyRs. The addition of subunit conferred the curcumol sen-sitivity of 3 -containing, but not 1 -containing, GlyRs. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed that a threonine at po-sition 59 of the 2 subunit is critical for the susceptibility of GlyRs to curcumol-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, parallel-ing a decline of 2 subunit expression during spinal cord de-velopment, the degree of IGly inhibition by curcumol decreased with prolonged culture of rat spinal dorsal horn neurons. Taken together, our results suggest that the GlyRs are novel molecular targets of curcumol, which may underlie its pharmaceutical effects in the central nervous system...|$|R

Results of the study showed that sheep fed with Ca-saponified lemuru oil coated by herbs was not significantly different on heart rate, respiration rate and rectal temperature among treatments.
