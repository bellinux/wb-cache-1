To better operate and manage mobile {{broadcast service}}s, mobile broadcast business management system (MBBMS) should be designed and developed. Such a system, with its distributed nature, complicated XML data and security mechanism, faces many challenges in testing technology. In this paper, we study the <b>conformance</b> <b>testing</b> methodology of MBBMS, and design and implement a MBBMS protocol <b>conformance</b> <b>testing</b> <b>tool</b> based on TTCN- 3, a standardized test description language {{that can be used in}} blackbox testing of reactive and distributed system. In this methodology and <b>testing</b> <b>tool,</b> we present a semi-automatic XML test data generation method of TTCN- 3 test suite and use HMSC model to help the design of test suite. In addition, we also propose an integrated testing method for hierarchical MBBMS security architecture. This <b>testing</b> <b>tool</b> has been used in industrial level’s testing. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>conformance</b> <b>testing</b> {{problem for}} {{dynamical}} systems asks, given two dynamical models (e. g., as Simulink diagrams), whether their behaviors are "close" to each other. In the semi-formal approach to <b>conformance</b> <b>testing,</b> {{the two systems}} are simulated on a large set of tests, and a metric, defined on pairs of real-valued, real-timed trajectories, is used to determine a lower bound on the distance. We show how the Skorkhod metric on continuous dynamical systems {{can be used as}} the foundation for <b>conformance</b> <b>testing</b> of complex dynamical models. The Skorokhod metric allows for both state value mismatches and timing distortions, and is thus well suited for checking conformance between idealized models of dynamical systems and their implementations. We demonstrate the robustness of the system conformance quantification by proving a transference theorem: trajectories close under the Skorokhod metric satisfy "close" logical properties. Specifically, we show the result for the timed linear time logic augmented with a rich class of temporal and spatial constraint predicates. We provide a window-based streaming algorithm to compute the Skorokhod metric, {{and use it as a}} basis for a <b>conformance</b> <b>testing</b> <b>tool</b> for Simulink. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool in finding discrepant behaviors on a set of control system benchmarks, including an industrial challenge problem.

40|$|Protocol <b>conformance</b> <b>testing</b> {{provides}} a extremely valuable mechanism {{in order to}} reduce incompatibility risks when interconnecting equipment from different manufacturers. This is achieved by defining a common set of test cases that an implementation must pass to be considered compliant with a particular standard. The benefits of the <b>conformance</b> <b>testing</b> methodology have led major Standardization Organizations to its application to an increasing number of communication protocols (e. g. Asynchronous Transfer mode, Integrated Services Digital Network, Signaling System No. 7, etc.) Thus, nowadays it is common practice to find the definition of Abstract Test Suites (ATSs) along with the technical specifications of a protocol. Unfortunately, things are not that easy when it turns to apply an ATS to a real system. On the one hand, an ATS may consist of a considerable number of test cases. On the other hand, simple they may seem, their preparation and execution may require a long time for the test operator. Typical tasks involved in passing a test case are configuring the test equipment, building and sending the adequate protocol data units, monitoring the responses from the system under test, interpreting the results, etc. Furthermore, the possibility of introducing human errors in this process must not be neglected. This paper describes a generic <b>conformance</b> <b>testing</b> <b>tool</b> aimed to solve the above problems. The tool {{provides a}} general platform that allows the operator to select an ATS and execute {{all or part of the}} test cases without requiring manual intervention. The tool has been designed so that new ATSs can be easily added as needed. As an application, the ATM Forum ATS for ATM End Systems has been implemented within the tool. ∗ This work has been partially supported by the Spanish CICYT project CEPAT (Certificación d...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{implementation}} of the INSPIRE directive requires to check the conformity {{of a large number}} of network services with the implementing rules of INSPIRE. The evaluation whether a service is fully conformant with INSPIRE is complex and requires the use of specialized <b>testing</b> <b>tools</b> that should report how verification has been made and should identify non-conformances. The use of the-se tools requires a high degree of technical knowledge. This fact makes very diffi-cult for non-technical stakeholders (end users, managers, domain experts, etc.) to participate effectively in <b>conformance</b> <b>testing,</b> hinders stakeholders understanding of the causes and consequences of non-conformant results and may cause in some stakeholders disinterest in <b>conformance</b> <b>testing.</b> This work explores the suitability of a behaviour-driven development (BDD) approach to the <b>conformance</b> <b>testing</b> of OGC Web services in the context of the INSPIRE directive. BDD emphasizes the participation of non-technical parties in the design of acceptance tests by means of automatable abstract tests expressed in a human readable format.
