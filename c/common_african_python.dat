5000|$|The <b>African</b> rock <b>python</b> {{is one of}} {{the five}} largest snake species in the world (along with the green anaconda, {{reticulated}} python, Burmese python and amethystine python).

40|$|International audiencePythons are {{harvested}} {{for the international}} leather industry and pet trade. We analyzed the CITES export records (1999 - 2008) of the most intensively commercialized wild pythons (Python regius,Python sebae,Python reticulatus,Python molurus,Python curtus species complex) from African and Asian countries where reliable data on trade rates and ecology are available. Mean declared annual numbers of exported pythons were 30, 000 in five African countries and 164, 000 in Indonesia. Trade intensity tripled in Indonesia over the last decade, but declined in Africa. African international trade is exclusively associated with the pet market (mainly United States and Europe), whereas Asian pythons are sold mostly for luxury leather, albeit more recently also for the pet trade. A negative correlation between the annual numbers of pythons traded in Africa vs. Asia suggests a rapid and recent shift of the pressure exerted on wild populations in the two main exporting continents. We also found a strong effect of the currency exchange rate (i. e., U. S. $/€, the currencies used by the major importing countries) on <b>African</b> <b>python</b> exports: when the cost per <b>African</b> <b>python</b> increased, importers relied increasingly on Asian providers for pet trade. Overall, our data indicate that Asian pythons (especially P. reticulatus) might be threatened due to the rapidly increasing pressure, whereas the decreasing international trade in <b>African</b> <b>pythons</b> is likely more sustainable...|$|R

2500|$|The <b>African</b> rock <b>python</b> is [...] in {{the genus}} Python, large {{constricting}} snakes {{found in the}} moist tropics of Asia and Africa. The species P. sebae {{is divided into two}} subspecies, P. s. sebae (the nominate subspecies) and P. s. natalensis (the Southern <b>African</b> rock <b>python).</b> Some consider the more southerly population of this snake to be a separate species, Python natalensis, while others consider this population to be a subspecies.|$|R
40|$|Environmental DNA (eDNA) {{methods are}} used to detect DNA that is shed into the aquatic {{environment}} by cryptic or low density species. Applied in eDNA studies, occupancy models {{can be used to}} estimate occurrence and detection probabilities and thereby account for im-perfect detection. However, occupancy terminology has been applied inconsistently in eDNA studies, and many have calculated occurrence probabilities while not considering the effects of imperfect detection. Low detection of invasive giant constrictors using visual sur-veys and traps has hampered the estimation of occupancy and detection estimates needed for population management in southern Florida, USA. Giant constrictor snakes pose a threat to native species and the ecological restoration of the Florida Everglades. To assist with detection, we developed species-specific eDNA assays using quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus), Northern <b>African</b> <b>python</b> (P. sebae), boa constrictor (Boa constrictor), and the green (Eunectes murinus) and yellow an-aconda (E. notaeus).

50|$|Burmese pythons are dark-colored snakes {{with many}} brown blotches bordered in black down the back. The {{perceived}} attractiveness {{of their skin}} pattern contributes to their popularity with both reptile keepers and the leather industry. The pattern is similar in colour, but different in actual pattern from the <b>African</b> rock <b>python</b> (Python sebae), sometimes resulting in confusion of the two species outside of their natural habitats. The <b>African</b> rock <b>python</b> can generally be distinguished by its tighter pattern of markings, compared to the Burmese python, which has bolder patterns, similar to those seen on a giraffe.|$|R

2500|$|The ball python (Python regius), {{also known}} as the royal python, is a python species found in sub-Saharan Africa. Like all other pythons, it is a non-venomous constrictor.

2500|$|Like all <b>pythons,</b> the <b>African</b> rock <b>python</b> is nonvenomous {{and kills}} its prey by constriction. After {{gripping}} the prey, the snake coils around it, tightening its coils {{every time the}} victim breathes out.

The <b>African</b> rock <b>python</b> feeds on a variety of large rodents, monkeys, warthogs, antelopes, fruit bats, monitor lizards, and even crocodiles in forest areas, and on rats, poultry, dogs, and goats in suburban areas. Occasionally, it may eat the cubs of big cats such as leopards, lions, and cheetahs, cubs of hyenas, and puppies of wild dogs such as jackals and Cape hunting dogs.. However, these encounters are very rare, as the adult cats can easily kill pythons or fend them off.

40|$|Summary: The {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the nature of the cholinoceptors at the sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle junction of the <b>common</b> <b>African</b> toad (Bufo regularis). Using myographic technique, the twitch properties of the sciatic-gastrocnemius muscle preparation of the <b>common</b> <b>African</b> toad was studied. Both the twitch height and peak tetanic height were measured as a percentage of control. Hexamethonium at a concentratration of 0. 1 mM significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced the mean twitch height from 2. 62 cm to 1. 0 cm and mean peak tetanic height from 5. 38 cm to 4. 32 cm. Hexamethonium, however does not produce tetanic fade at the same concentration. We hypothesized that the cholinoceptors of the neuromuscular junction of the <b>common</b> <b>African</b> toad (Bufo regularis) resemble the developing synapse of African clawed toad (Xenopus laevis) and may contain muscarinic M 1 autoreceptors at the pre juntional membrane...|$|R
