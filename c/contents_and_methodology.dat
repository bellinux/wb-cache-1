40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the trend}} of entrepreneurship and venture management research based on the content analysis of two selected journals; Journal of Business Venturing (JBV) and The Korean Venture Management Review (VMR). JBV has published 213 articles to accommodate the requests from the field with many researchers' efforts for the recent past seven years (1998 - 2004), while VMR has published 104 articles {{for the same period}} since it started in 1998. These two journals can be regarded as representative in the world and in Korea respectively, in the division of entrepreneurship. The content analysis on 317 articles can bring good comparisons between different entrepreneurial cultures (developed vs. developing countries; established vs. emerging academic societies) in terms of industrial needs, emerging issues, and preferred research methods. This study addresses the following four research questions: First, what is the recent trend of entrepreneurship research in terms of <b>contents</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodologies?</b> Second, what are the differences in patterns between international and local journals in terms of <b>contents</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodologies?</b> Third, how does the venture bubble burst influence the research trend?

Upon this basis the {{development of}} the education and recruitment of men and women teachers was considered in detail. Special stress has been laid upon organisation <b>and</b> control, <b>content</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodology,</b> <b>and</b> the social status of teachers. Against the social background of the seclusion of women, the difficulties and inducements of their recruitment are brought out. This is followed by an examination of the provision for in-service education for teachers and of its programmes.

Finally, proposals for future development have been suggested. These are broad outlines of the basic requirements, leaving room for modification according to changing needs and circumstances. In particular, suggestions are made regarding the establishment of central bodies to bring about more systematic development in the fields of curriculum, educational research and teacher education, the development of <b>content</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodology,</b> <b>and</b> the reorganisation of the provision of primary teacher education.
