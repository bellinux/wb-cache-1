50|$|The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) {{issued the}} FIPS 140 Publication Series to {{coordinate}} the requirements and standards for cryptography modules that include both hardware and software components.

This standard specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>module.</b> The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of security intended to cover {{a wide range of}} potential applications and environments.

40|$|Abstract:- <b>Cryptographic</b> <b>modules</b> can be {{implemented}} in both hardware and software. Although software cryptographic implementations are cost-effective and more flexible, they seem to provide a much lower level of security {{in relation to their}} hardware equivalents. The uncontrolled memory access, the vulnerabilities imposed by the OS and the facility of modifying software implementations are some of the security barriers of software <b>cryptographic</b> <b>modules.</b> This works deals with the exploitation of security architectures via software and hardware implementations. Especially it is centers in the advantages and the trade-offs of each one of the two alternatives integration approaches.
