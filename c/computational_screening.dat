5000|$|Two {{complementary}} <b>computational</b> <b>screens,</b> eQRNA and RNAz, {{were used}} to search for novel sRNA-encoding genes in the intergenic regions [...] IGRs of S. meliloti.

These new genomic loci were referred to as smr, for S. meliloti RNA. Seven of the Smr transcripts, which conservation is restricted to phylogenetically related α-proteobacteria, accumulated differentially in free-living and endosymbiotic bacteria.
