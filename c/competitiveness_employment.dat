40|$|Investment in {{research}} and development (R&D) plays a vital role in economic growth. Therefore, the crucial role of government is to encourage companies to develop new knowledge, skills, and innovations in order to achieve greater <b>competitiveness,</b> <b>employment</b> creation, and economic development. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine whether R&D subsidies contribute to corporate performance and ascertain whether the relationship between the amount of R&D subsidies and corporate performance is moderated by Slovenian cohesion (NUTS 2 level) and statistical (NUTS 3 level) regions. This paper ultimately tries to classify statistical regions within meaningful groups. Using an OLS regression, a unique dataset of 407 Slovenian companies is analysed for 2014. The empirical results reveal that R&D subsidies have a positive impact on corporate performance and confirm that cohesion and statistical regions can moderate the effect of R&D subsidy on corporate performance. Moreover, the paper provides for the classification of Slovenian statistical regions into four groups...|$|E
40|$|While the European Union (EU) {{is facing}} a further {{aggravation}} of the recession, accompanied by {{the consequences of the}} 2008 global financial crisis, the support for economic activities is proving to be more than necessary. Primary concerns of member states must be based on increased efforts in <b>competitiveness,</b> <b>employment,</b> innovation, and assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), to boost economic growth on a short-term basis or on a longer-term horizon. In this regard, this article firstly suggests that the temporary support for economic activities is absolutely necessary and the possible arrangements are examined in detail. In addition, more emphasis must be put on innovation, as it plays a crucial role for economic growth. Particular attention is also drawn to SMEs, their potential impact on the productive fabric and their financial constraints.

40|$|In {{a global}} economy, foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) represents the main form of international business activities. More than the mere cross-border movement of capital, FDI includes transfer of technology and know-how, thus contributing to <b>competitiveness,</b> <b>employment</b> and trade, and consequently, economic growth {{and the development of}} the local economy. The recent drop in international capital flows resulting from global financial and economic crisis has caused concerns regarding growth prospects for the world economy in general and that of less advanced transition countries in particular. By hypothesizing that Croatia, as the next member of the EU, has realized sub-optimal effects in attracting FDI, and that international competition in this field is expected to grow further, the aim of the paper is to find out determining factors behind inward FDI to transition countries, in order to detect the capacities of Croatia in hosting new foreign investment. Statistical analysis, focusing on bilateral FDI-flows and country-specific characteristics, proved the importance of typical ‟gravity”-type variables, as well as those based on increasing returns to scale, while showing that at present Croatia has exhausted its potentials in hosting new FDI...|$|E

40|$|Employment is {{currently}} the 'big issue' in the European Union. Against a background of consistently high unemployment rates, governments and social partners have undertaken numerous efforts t o create jobs and get the unemployed onto the labour market. Since the early 1990 s, collective bargaining in many European countries has adopted a partnership approach t o improve employment and competitiveness. This report describes the recent initiatives known as 'pacts for employment and competitiveness' (PECs) which are a combination of three main elements: <b>competitiveness,</b> <b>employment</b> and partnership.

40|$|Should the Swiss adopt a new {{economic}} policy aimed at lowering {{the value of the}} Swiss franc in order to boost domestic <b>competitiveness,</b> <b>employment</b> and real income? Despite the past record of strong gains in the relative income of the Swiss that accompanied successful efforts to pursue price stability or a strong currency, policy critics invariably have responded to each bout of currency appreciation by arguing that it will result in losses in the international competitiveness of domestic industries and to reductions in output and real income, especially in the traded goods sector. Critics have been most outspoken recently because the Swiss exchange rate appreciation from mid- 1992 through 1995 was {{one of the largest and}} longest recorded since the franc began to float in the early 1970 s. Over this 14 quarter period, the franc rose 28. 5 percent against the U. S. dollar and 13. 2 percent against the German mark, resulting in a 23. 8 percent rise on a nominal, export weighted, effective basis and 22. 2 percent on a real effective basis. The experience has seemed to give some credibility to the critic's view, as the real economy appeared to grow weakly at best. Opponents of exchange rate appreciations adhere to the conventional wisdom, which suggests that domestic output, employment and rea...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyWithin {{the context}} of the {{globalization}} of the economy, communication and culture and the transition towards societies based on information and knowledge, the sustained development of the cultural industry stands out as a priority means for the articulation of society. For at least the last three decades, culture has been increasingly linked with the growth of the social communication media. Indeed, the cultural industry is becoming a strategic sector for <b>competitiveness,</b> <b>employment,</b> consensus-building, the style of politics and the circulation of information and knowledge. This growing weight of the cultural industry is closely linked with its own diversification. Technological innovations have given rise to great leaps forward in the cultural industry which make it necessary to redefine its limits year by year. A market for messages which forms part of the circuit of global interchange and constant acceleration in terms of time is transforming the limits of "heavy" and "light" culture, highbrow and lowbrow culture, sophisticated cultural products and those appealing to a popular audience, and national and foreign cultural manifestations. In the following pages, an analysis will be made of the changes which these developments have brought about in the image of modernity and modernization in Latin America. The coexistence of various past times in a single present and the current tension between the high levels of symbolic integration through the cultural industry and the low levels of social integration form the central concerns of this article in its efforts to set forth the potential and risks of the cultural industry in the region...|$|E

40|$|Stimulating {{the economy}} is a {{dominant}} policy objective, but on what basis are decisions being taken around transport and growth? We describe how transport studies and political geography offer two related, but poorly connected, theoretical approaches purporting to explain the relationship between transport and the economy. Yet in what ways does it matter that two different world views exist? We test these questions through an empirical case study of how city and regional officials use transport in attempting to realise economic objectives. Echoing theoretical approaches based in political geography, we find officials' own reasoning places emphasis on supply side improvements, especially connectivity within regions and on a high quality urban environment hoped to attract high GVA jobs. The decision-support tools are not well aligned to this reasoning, focussing on time savings and the justification of the value for money of proposed schemes relative to other investments {{in the region and}} nationally. In contrast to much theoretical work on <b>competitiveness,</b> <b>employment</b> growth is treated as exogenous with less emphasis given to which areas win and lose in the region. It is competition between weaker regional towns and cities that is prominent in officials' discourse. Such a gap between the thinking by officials, and the types of available transport investment decision-support tools, is of international significance. Given the centrality of the economy to where and what we invest in, the paper suggests a need for better knowledge about the efficacy of urban realm and other supply side improvements on job creation and on the influence of local autonomy in decision-making on investment selection and outcomes...|$|E
40|$|For several European states, {{including}} Romania, the European {{integration process}} has overlapped {{with the effects}} of the economic and financial crisis. The consequences of such a situation are apparently contradictory. On one hand, the crisis lowers the European integration process in view of achieving the performance imposed by the Single Market, the economic and administrative convergence etc. On the other hand, the possibility of accessing the European structural funds becomes a welcome financial resource for diminishing or stopping the effects of the crisis. The second alternative establishes new balances or imbalances at the local community level, with effect on the employment policies. The European structural instruments – Structural Funds, Cohesion Fund, EC initiatives – are associated with the effects induced in view to achieve the EU objectives such as: economic, social and territorial cohesion, economic growth, <b>competitiveness,</b> <b>employment,</b> sustainable development etc. The current paper aims to emphasise in a theoretic and empiric manner, the influences of these structural instruments on the employment policies at local level. At the same time, those influences will be correlated statistically {{with the effects of}} the financial crisis, obtaining a more comprehensive image concerning the consequences of the mix of national and EC policies for the economic integration and fight against the effects of the financial crisis for some EU states. The authors propose a model of local development based on the theory of the general balance, integrating the resources provided by the structural instruments and emphasizing their compensatory effects related to the financial crisis. The proposed model is empirically exemplified for some development regions in Romania, suggestive for general conclusions, of comparative nature, at European and international level...|$|E
40|$|Skills {{development}} and training {{is becoming an}} increasingly important concern in developing countries. Not only can it impact local economic platforms, {{but it can also}} increase international <b>competitiveness,</b> <b>employment</b> and prosperity. Disarticulations of public policy can however undermine public sector delivery of skills development initiatives and opens up opportunities for private provision to be, under certain circumstances, more responsive to the challenges of skills shortages. The purpose of this research is firstly to substantiate the need for a more active engagement by the private sector in the {{development and}} training of technical skills. Subsequently, it aims to identify the impacting factors that either promote or inhibit such engagement, specifically within the construction and mining industries of Sub-Saharan Africa. In identifying the most significant factors, a conceptual framework can be compiled and recommended to facilitate a more sustainable approach to the implementation of in-house initiatives, specifically within the private sector of these industries. A descriptive quantitative research approach was implemented for this study. This was facilitated through an online survey questionnaire distributed to a population comprising of top, middle and junior management, as well as general employees, permanently employed within the construction and mining industries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The research results revealed a definite lack of confidence in the public sector’s ability to adequately provide technical skills within these industries, and thus within Sub-Saharan Africa. This stresses the need for a more active participation by the private sector in developing such technical skills. Further analysis also identified the critical inhibitors and benefits associated with current private sector initiatives. It suggests that effective in-house skills development and training initiatives within these industries can not only beneficially impact companies, but also the socio-economic environment in which they operate. Finally, the research concludes with the introduction of a conceptual framework targeting three core areas as a base to implement skills on a sustainable platform within the private sector. These include the concepts of benefits realisation, risk management and government intervention.

30|$|We {{find that}} {{measures}} decreasing the policy-induced outside option of workers, {{such as a}} cut in unemployment benefits or public wages, {{seems to be the}} most effective way to increase output, <b>employment</b> and international <b>competitiveness</b> while, at the same time, improving fiscal balances. The reason is that the effect on the reservation wage feeds through to private-sector wage bargaining almost immediately, while, at the same time, fiscal balances are also directly affected. The same argument holds for cuts in public-sector employment, albeit at a lower level, because the increase in private labor demand cannot compensate for the loss in public-sector employment. Cuts in the unions’ bargaining power also achieve the goal of improving <b>competitiveness,</b> output and <b>employment,</b> however, at a lower level. A cut in employment protection does not seem to be an adequate measure to regain international <b>competitiveness.</b> Lower <b>employment</b> protection yields less job security, which may induce workers to demand even higher wages, thereby deteriorating international competitiveness rather than improving it.|$|R
