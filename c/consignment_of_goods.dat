60|$|Accordingly, {{as soon as}} {{they landed}} in Calcutta, Stanley was put in orders for absence on leave, for three months. He learned, from his uncle's agent, that they had heard from him only a few days before, at Chittagong; and that he was then on the point of leaving for Aracan, whither he had ordered a large <b>consignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> to be {{forwarded}} to him, by the next ship.|$|E
60|$|Three days later, Stanley {{started to}} join him, leaving his address at Aracan with Sir Archibald Campbell, {{in case there}} should be need to recall him before the three months' leave expired. The vessel {{in which he was}} sailing carried the <b>consignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> to his uncle; and he had, therefore, no fear of finding that the latter had left Aracan before his arrival. Meinik was still with him. He had left the army after the last battle had been fought, and had {{travelled}} to the spot where he had buried his money before embarking with Stanley in the canoe and, after an absence of three days, rejoined the force. On the way down to Rangoon, Stanley had a long talk with him as to his future plans.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} days of the colony at Sydney Cove in Australia, the {{merchant}} Robert Campbell was one of the first merchants to attempt to trade, but lacked sufficient currency.

5000|$|A waybill (UIC) is a {{document}} issued by a carrier giving details and instructions {{relating to the}} shipment of a <b>consignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> Typically it will show {{the names of the}} consignor and consignee, the point of origin of the consignment, its destination, and route.

Lists with descriptions and measurements that allow some surviving pieces to be identified also survive from 1406, 1407, 1433 and 1434. These confirm that carved red lacquer was already [...] "the favored type of lacquer for court use" [...] by this point.|$|R
40|$|Border inspection, and the {{challenge}} of deciding which of the tens <b>of</b> millions <b>of</b> <b>consignments</b> that arrive should be inspected, is a perennial problem for regulatory authorities. The objective of these inspections is to minimise the risk of contraband entering the country. As an example, for regulatory authorities in charge <b>of</b> biosecurity material, <b>consignments</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> are classified before arrival according to their economic tariff number (Department of Immigration and Border Protection, 2016). This classification, perhaps along with other information, is used as a screening step to determine whether further biosecurity intervention, such as inspection, is necessary. Other information associated with consignments includes details such as the country of origin, supplier, and importer, for example. The choice <b>of</b> which <b>consignments</b> to inspect has typically been informed by historical records of intercepted material. Fortunately for regulators, interception is a rare event, however this sparsity undermines the utility of historical records for deciding which containers to inspect. In this paper we report on an analysis that uses more detailed information to inform inspection. Using quarantine biosecurity as a case study, we create statistical profiles using generalised linear mixed models and compare different model specifications with historical information alone, demonstrating the utility of a statistical modelling approach. We also demonstrate some graphical model summaries that provide managers with insight into pathway governance. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
25|$|Seals {{were used}} in the {{earliest}} civilizations and are of considerable importance in archaeology and art history. In ancient Mesopotamia carved or engraved cylinder seals in stone or other materials were used. These could be rolled along to create an impression on clay (which could be repeated indefinitely), and used as labels on <b>consignments</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>goods,</b> or for other purposes. They are normally hollow and it is presumed that they were worn on a string or chain round the neck. Many have only images, often very finely carved, with no writing, while others have both. From ancient Egypt seals in the form of signet-rings (see below), including some with the names of kings, have been found; these tend to show only names in hieroglyphics.|$|R

She {{imported goods}} {{on such a}} large scale that {{it was said that}} hardly a ship docked in New York City without a <b>consignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> for her. She sold these goods in her own store and, during the French and Indian Wars, supplied William Shirleyâ€™s Fort Niagara expedition with food, tools, cannon, and boats.

5000|$|Buckley & Nunn was co-founded by Mars Buckley (1825?- 9 October 1905) and his partner, Crumpton John Nunn (1828-1891). Buckley {{was born}} at Mallow, County Cork, Ireland and emigrated to Victoria in 1851 with his wife, Elizabeth Maroon, nÃ©e Neville, and their child. Buckley came with goods to sell at the Ballarat and Forest Creek goldfields, which proved profitable. On the arrival of another <b>consignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> in 1852 he began {{business}} in partnership with English-born Nunn as Buckley & Nunn. Nunn soon returned to England to manage that end of the business.|$|E
50|$|On 19 February 1720, a Havildar {{had stopped}} a <b>consignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> {{belonging}} to the British East India Company from passing through the village of Egmore and arrested the transporters.

But when the Chief peon approached the Havildar, a struggle broke out between the peons and 50 of the Havildar's supporters in which the Chief peon shot dead the Havildar and 2 of his supporters. The chief peon was commended for his act by the President. However, these incidents and other misgivings were thoroughly investigated by Hastings' successor James Macrae.|$|E
50|$|In practice. {{goods are}} not often shipped without a written {{contract}} or acknowledgment of terms. For each separate <b>consignment</b> or parcel <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> shipped, {{a bill of}} lading is almost invariably given. When a whole cargo is carried, the terms are set out in a document called a charter-party, signed by or {{on behalf of the}} shipowner on the one part, and the shipper, who is called the charterer, on the other.|$|R
50|$|The cargo {{found on}} the {{excavated}} Bertrand provides a unique glimpse into the material life of Virginia City, Montana Territory. The steamboat was full of clothing, tools, food and various consumer items on their way upriver. The shipâ€™s cargo amounted to roughly 283 cubic meters. The collection includes: dried and salted beef, mutton and pork; oysters; pepper sauce; strawberries, peaches and peanuts; mustard from France; many bottles of whiskey including bourbon; brandy and brandied cherries; and medicine bottles. There were over 3,000 textiles and clothing items, including gloves, hats, trousers and 137 menâ€™s coats in seven different styles. Household goods included mirrors, clocks and silverware; and there were various building supplies for the growing town. The largest <b>consignment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> was bound for the Vivian and Simpson retailer in Virginia City. They would have also been sold from log cabin stores in the surrounding towns, including that of Frank Worden, the founder of Missoula.|$|R
2500|$|Very {{little is}} known about the early life of Eugene Sharrer, except that he was by origin a German from Hamburg and claimed to be a British subject by naturalisation. He was {{described}} as of Jewish appearance, if not of Jewish origin, by a colonial official and became an archetypal colonial outsider, financially successful but disliked by officials because of his national and ethnic origins. He arrived in what is today Malawi in 1888, before the country had become a British protectorate, with a <b>consignment</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>goods</b> and he initially joined forces with John Buchanan who had been trading there since 1881, but soon started trading on his own account. Sharrer was involved in the trade in ivory, until 1893 the main export product of the area, and from this trading venture there developed the wholesale and retail Kubula Stores Ltd. When the ivory trade declined as the elephants were killed off, he diversified, acquiring considerable landholdings and building up a successful transport and agricultural concern. Kubula Stores Ltd failed to compete with the rural network of [...] "Mandala" [...] village stores of the African Lakes Company and was sold to this rival in the 1920s.|$|R
5000|$|Birdsville {{was known}} as Diamantina Crossing from 1881. [...] There {{are a number of}} {{different}} theories as to the origin of the name. One is that the name derives from the prolific bird life in the district. The other is that a store was established by Percy Bird and George Field and they called it Birdfield. However, in 1882, G. and R. Wills, of Adelaide, misaddressed a <b>consignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> as going to Birdsville and that name stuck. Another is that a man named Burt established a store and called it Burtsville which corrupted to Birdsville. Whatever its origin, by 1882, the name Birdsville was in common use and was formalised at the proclamation of town in 1887.|$|E
5000|$|The Guardian {{referred}} to Mair as [...] "an extremely low burner" [...] who [...] "appears to have fantasised about killing a 'collaborator' {{for more than}} 17 years, drawing inspiration from" [...] David Copeland. Copeland, a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic and admirer of William Luther Pierce (head of the National Alliance) {{was a source of}} great inspiration to Mair when he bombed Black British, South Asian and LGBT populations on a 13-day campaign in 1999 in the hope of triggering a race war within the United Kingdom. Three died and more than 140 were injured, many losing limbs. Copeland was arrested shortly after this final bombing of the Admiral Duncan. Ten days after Copeland's first court appearance, a <b>consignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> from the National Alliance headquarters in the United States were sent to Mair's home. According to a packing slip obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mair had bought numerous items from the organisation, including: manuals on the manufacturing of bombs and homemade pistols; 6 copies of Free Speech, a publication of the National Alliance; and a copy of Ich KÃ¤mpfe. Over the course of four years, he began to subscribe to Free Speech as well as Secret of the Runes and We Get Confessions. The SPLC released receipts showing that Mair had spent more than $620 buying publications from National Vanguard Books in the years 1993-2003, including works on how to make improvised weapons.|$|E

His round began at half-past six in the morning, when he would descend unwashed and shirtless, in old clothes and a scarf, and dust boxes and yawn, and take down wrappers and clean the windows until eight. Then {{in half an hour}} he would complete his toilet and take an austere breakfast of bread and margarine and what only an Imperial Englishman would admit to be coffee, after which refreshment he ascended to the shop for the labours of the day. Commonly these began with a mighty running to and fro with planks and boxes and goods for Carshot, the window-dresser, who, whether he worked well or ill, nagged persistently by reason of a chronic indigestion, until the window was done. Sometimes the costume window had to be dressed, and then Kipps staggered down the whole length of the shop from the costume room with one after another of those ladylike shapes grasped firmly, but shamefully, each about her single ankle of wood. Such days as there was no window-dressing, there was a mighty carrying and lifting of blocks and bales <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> into piles and stacks. After this there were terrible exercises, at first almost despairfully difficult: certain sorts <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> that came in folded had to be rolled upon rollers, {{and for the most part}} refused absolutely to be rolled, at any rate by Kipps; and certain other sorts <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> that came from the wholesalers rolled had to be measured and folded, which folding makes young apprentices wish they were dead. All of it, too, quite avoidable trouble, you know, that is not avoided because of the cheapness of the genteeler sorts of labour and the dearness of forethought in the world. And then <b>consignments</b> <b>of</b> new <b>goods</b> had to be marked off and packed into proper parcels; and Carshot packed like conjuring tricks, and Kipps packed like a boy with tastes in some other direction--not ascertained.
