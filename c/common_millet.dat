40|$|To achieve {{better results}} in the no-tillage system (NTS), it is {{important}} to properly manage the cover crop prior to planting by using herbicides, usually glyphosate. The effect of glyphosate on plant coverage is slow, and plants take a few days to die completely. Thus, when applying the herbicide on the same day of planting soybean or corn, cover crops are still alive and standing, causing initial shading on seedlings of the crop and delaying its establishment. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of distinct cover crops and their timing of desiccation prior to planting soybean or corn, on crop yield and yield components. Two experiments were installed, one for soybean and another for corn. Each experiment consisted in combining three cover crops (Brachiaria brizantha, <b>common</b> bean or <b>millet)</b> chemically desiccated at two timings before planting the crop (15 or 0 days before planting) under no-tillage system (NTS). Experiments were installed in a completely randomized block design with five replications.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of soil management systems in no - tillage system (NTS) and crop rotations and on soil chemical properties. The experiment was conducted for six con- secutive years, during which were made 12 crops (summer and winter). The experimental design was com- pletely randomized in a split plot scheme. Treatments included four soil management (plots) : P 1 = NTS fol- lowed annually for a plowing in the winter; P 2 = NTS followed biennially for a plowing in the winter; P 3 = NTS followed every three years for a plowing and P 4 = continuous NTS. Subplots were crop rotation with crops in the summer and winter: R 1 = <b>millet</b> - <b>common</b> bean - <b>millet</b> - <b>common</b> bean - rice - <b>common</b> bean - <b>millet</b> - <b>common</b> bean - <b>millet</b> - <b>common</b> bean - rice - common bean; R 2 = Soybean - common bean - soybean - wheat - rice - soybean - common bean - soybean - wheat - rice - common bean; R 3 = corn - common bean - corn - tomato - rice - common bean - corn - common bean - corn - tomato - rice - common bean; R 4 = millet - soybean - common bean - rice - <b>common</b> bean - <b>millet</b> - soybean - common bean - rice - common bean; R 5 = <b>millet</b> - <b>common</b> bean - corn - common bean - rice - <b>common</b> bean - <b>millet</b> - <b>common</b> bean - corn - common bean - rice - common bean; R 6 = Soybean - common bean - corn – common bean - rice - soybean - corn - common bean - rice - common bean. Each rotation cycle of three years crop season was repeated twice. Systems of soil management and crop rotations significantly affected soil chemical properties. The chemical attributes Ca, Mg, organic matter, P, K, Mn and Zn concentrated in the top- soil regardless of the crop rotation used in the managements of less soil disturbance. The pH values were simi- lar during the 12 seasons in six years.

A considerable amount of literature is dedicated to the adoption of improved cropping practices among smallholder farmers in developing countries.

The present study aims to assess the factors that are influencing adoption decisions among finger millet farmers in Western Kenya. Based on cross-sectional household data from 270 farmers, we estimate a multivariate probit model to compare the adoption decisions in finger millet and maize production. While improved practices such as the use of a modern variety or chemical fertilizer are well known in maize production, they are less <b>common</b> in finger <b>millet</b> production. Results show that social networks as well as access to extension services play a crucial role in the adoption of improved finger millet practices, while the same variables are of minor importance for the adoption of improved maize practices.

50|$|Foxtail Millet {{is known}} to have been the first domesticated millet. Chinese legends {{attribute}} the domestication of millet to Shennong, the legendary Emperor of China. Similarly, millets have been mentioned in some of the oldest extant Yajurveda texts, identifying foxtail millet (priyangava), Barnyard millet (aanava) and black finger millet (shyaamaka), indicating that millet consumption was very common, pre-dating to 4500 BC, during the Indian Bronze Age. Specialized archaeologists called palaeoethnobotanists, relying on data such as the relative abundance of charred grains found in archaeological sites, hypothesize that the cultivation of millets was of greater prevalence in prehistory than rice, especially in northern China and Korea. Millets also formed important parts of the prehistoric diet in Indian, Chinese Neolithic and Korean Mumun societies. Broomcorn (Panicum miliaceum) and foxtail millet were important crops beginning in the Early Neolithic of China. For example, some of the earliest evidence of millet cultivation in China was found at Cishan (north). Cishan dates for <b>common</b> <b>millet</b> husk phytoliths and biomolecular components have been identified around 8300-6700 BC in storage pits along with remains of pit-houses, pottery, and stone tools related to millet cultivation. Evidence at Cishan for foxtail millet dates back to around 6500 BC. A 4,000-year-old well-preserved bowl containing well-preserved noodles made from foxtail millet and broomcorn millet was found at the Lajia archaeological site in China.|$|E

We also investigated effects at the scale of the root mycorrhizal community by determining root colonization patterns (frequency, intensity) and taxonomic diversity (18 S rDNA sequencing). Pronounced compositional shifts in root mycorrhizal communities were almost systematically observed between Glomeraceae and Gigasporaceae, or in some cases within Glomeraceae. Biomass and N-P shoot contents were often higher in J. curcas-grown soils. In conclusion, the altered composition of the soil mycorrhizal communities in response to the development off. curcas did not have detrimental effects on local staple crops.

40|$|Polyploidy poses {{challenges}} for phylogenetic reconstruction {{because of the}} need to identify and distinguish between homoeologous loci. This can be addressed by use of low copy nuclear markers. Panicum s. s. is a genus of about 100 species in the grass tribe Paniceae, subfamily Panicoideae, and is divided into five sections. Many of the species are known to be polyploids. The most well-known of the Panicum polyploids are switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and <b>common</b> or Proso <b>millet</b> (P. miliaceum). Switchgrass is in section Virgata, along with P. tricholaenoides, P. amarum, and P. amarulum, whereas P. miliaceum is in sect. Panicum. We have generated sequence data from five low copy nuclear loci and two chloroplast loci and have clarified the origin of P. virgatum. We find that all members of sects. Virgata and Urvilleana are the result of diversification after a single allopolyploidy event. The closest diploid relatives of switchgrass are in sect. Rudgeana, native to Central and South America. Within sections Virgata and Urvilleana, P. tricholaenoides is sister to the remaining species. Panicum racemosum and P. urvilleanum form a clade, which may be sister to P. chloroleucum. Panicum amarum, P. amarulum, and the lowland and upland ecotypes of P. virgatum together form a clade, within which relationships are complex. Hexaploid and octoploid plants are likely allopolyploids, with P. amarum and P. amarulum sharing genomes with P. virgatum. Octoploid P. virgatum plants are formed via hybridization between disparate tetraploids.

Simultaneously, six roosters were kept fasting to make corrections to the metabolic and endogenous losses of amino acids. At the end of collections, the excreta obtained were weighed, freeze-dried and subsequently processed, so laboratory analyses were carried out and the coefficients of true digestibility of amino acids were determined.

Within {{the frame of the}} Pygmalion project (ANR Blanc, France) we improved the previous miliaci...|$|E
