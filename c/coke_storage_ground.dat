30|$|In {{the above}} example [14], as the channel diameters of H-ZSM- 5 {{are small and}} {{relatively}} uniform, {{there is not much}} internal space for the coke building up, whereas the larger inner cavity space allows the H-SAPO- 34 to accumulate more coke species inside. It {{should be noted that the}} volume of <b>coke</b> <b>storage</b> here is not directly correlated with the coke capacity of zeolite. In contrast, due to the uniformly distributed channel size, H-ZSM- 5 would possess a much higher coke tolerance capacity, this is because in principle, chemicals with larger than the channel diameter size are hardly formed inside [12, 13, 22, 25]. For H-SAPO- 34, the smaller pore opening and much larger inner cavity make it difficult to move those internally formed large coke species to outside space, thus eventually leadint to an inreversible catalyst deactivation [10, 12, 13, 34, 35, 36].|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the seismic}} {{responses}} of base-isolated broad and slender cylindrical liquid <b>storage</b> <b>ground</b> tanks are investigated. Three types of isolation systems are considered. The seismic responses are {{compared with the}} corresponding responses of non-isolated tanks. Moreover, a parametric {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of tank aspect ratio, isolation period, and friction coefficient of the FPS system on key responses of the tank. It was found that, base isolation is quite effective in reducing the earthquake response of <b>ground</b> liquid <b>storage</b> tanks. Generally speaking, 50 – 90 % reductions in both base shear and impulsive displacement responses were observed. The convective displacement was observed to be 20 – 70 % higher than that associated with fixed base tanks leading to an essential need of increasing the clear height above the liquid surface. Base isolation was found to be more effective for slender tanks in comparison with broad tanks...|$|R

40|$|Physical properties, such as depth, {{bulk density}} and {{humification}} are {{closely linked to}} many of the ecosystem services provided by peatlands. Beneath the surface these properties can be highly spatially variable. This variation can be difficult to map using traditional manual measurements, often leading to unreliable estimates of ecosystem services such as carbon <b>storage.</b> <b>Ground</b> Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a geophysical technique which can map the peatland subsurface (Holden et al, 2002; Sass et al, 2010 and Comas et al, 2005 a). This project investigates how GPR can be used to map properties such as bulk density, humification and depth at landscape scales. The GPR is towed using a low ground pressure tracked vehicle, allowing for surveys to be carried out in otherwise inaccessible areas. Ultimately these data will be used to generate carbon inventories and maps of peatland condition which can be used to inform peatland wind farm developments and restoration projects...|$|R
