The winch or grapple holds the trees while the skidder drags them to a landing area. Cable skidders are less popular than in the past. They are more labor intensive than grapple skidders because someone (the operator or a second person) must drag the winch line out to the logs and hook them up. This is helpful where {{it is not possible}} to drive the machine close to the log (such as in steep hills).|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the influence of working conditions on the duration of cutters participation in group work skidding. Two main theoretical assumptions were considered. First, working conditions that decrease the skidding efficiency increase the time of cutters assistance, because {{the group as a}} whole strives to improve efficiency, and second, the duration of assistance to the working group is specific regardless of working conditions. The research included 5 places of research (compartments) in Slovenian state forests, with 3 working groups consisting of two cutters and a <b>cable</b> <b>skidder</b> driver. All working groups used the <b>cable</b> <b>skidder</b> IWAFUJI–T 41. The model included 100 cycles of downhill timber skidding. We have established that the duration of cutters assistance is reciprocal to the skidding distance, average bunching distance and number of logs in the load. The model accounts for 40. 7 % of the whole variability. After excluding the influence of working conditions between the groups, there are no typical differences in the duration of cutters assistance. Results imply that the number of working group members should be adjusted to working conditions. On the other hand, insignificant differences of cutters assistance duration between the groups show that the mere group daily standard is a motivational factor big enough for the rationalization of group work of workers who are not additionally educated and qualified for group work...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the ergonomic performance of 13 harvesting machine models was assessed from an ergonomic viewpoint. The main objective {{of the study was}} to compare ergonomic performance to harvesting machine operators’ work and propose viable solutions to improve the work environment. The principal assessed ergonomic requirements were operators’ workspace, operators’ seats, visibility, work postures, whole-body vibration and noise in the cab, all as related to the tasks involved in typical harvesting cycles. Altogether, more than 120 different parameters that impact ergonomics and work conditions were measured directly at workplaces in the actual working conditions. The results were then compared to the effective norms and the degree of compliance with the stipulated values was determined. The obtained estimates for the degree of compliance were integrated. This permits a direct {{comparison of}} the work-load on operators with a single integrated indicator (severity). In many respects the ergonomic standard is now good, except for skidders. Visibility and work postures were considered to be the most critical features influencing the operator’s performance. Even in highly mechanized harvesting work, problems still exist despite extensive development of cabs. The best working conditions in terms of harvesting systems were provided by »harvester + forwarder« in cut-to-length harvesting and »feller buncher + grapple skidder« in full-tree harvesting. The traditional Russian tree-length harvesting done with <b>cable</b> <b>skidders</b> showed the worst results in terms of ergonomics. When a partially mechanized harvesting system is employed, use of <b>cable</b> <b>skidders</b> should be as limited as possible, because, as a whole, they do not comply with the present ergonomic requirements...|$|R

The trial was prepared on a test track of concave shape in the forest and with pre-designed loads of different sizes. The loads were skidded uphill once withbutt-end and then with top-end forward, until the tractor stopped because of the slope. The results show that butt-end forward skidding is more efficient. The difference between maximum loads at specific maximum slopes is almost constant (0. 53 t). Proper load formation (butt-end forward if possible) is more important when skidding on steeper slopes...|$|E

The paper shows the results of some working characteristics of {{the research}}ed skidder, such as: travelling speed of unloaded and loaded skidder, time consumptions of felling site work (loading) and roadside landing work (unloading), allowance time, realized load volume, fuel consumption, dependence of possible productivity and costs per unit on timber skidding distance...|$|E
30|$|Tree length {{harvesting}} {{systems are}} used in clearfall radiata pine plantations. Trees are felled with a feller-buncher, extracted to roadside landings with grapple or <b>cable</b> <b>skidders,</b> delimbed and processed into logs with a dangle-head processor on an excavator base. Logs are then sorted and stacked with a loading grapple on an excavator base, and loaded onto a truck with a truck mounted hydraulic crane. The size of the equipment used depends {{on the size of}} tree within the stands in which harvesting is taking place. Forestal Mininco classifies pine stands into four average tree size classes labelled A through D, with A having the biggest trees and D the smallest; over 0.9 m 3, 0.65 to 0.89 m 3, 0.4 to 0.64 m 3, and under 0.4 m 3. Waratah 620 processors working over Komatsu PC 200 excavators are typically used in Forest Classes C and D. Waratah 622 processors working over Komatsu PC 200 excavators or Waratah 622 B processors working over Komatsu PC 220 excavators are typically used in Forest Classes A and B. The forest class also determines the number of products (different diameter and lengths) cut, ranging from 8 to 10 for Forest Class A to 3 or 4 for Forest Class D.|$|R

40|$|The motion {{resistance}} ratio, gross traction {{ratio and}} net traction ratio of a wheel <b>cable</b> <b>skidder</b> were determined and mathematical models derived for three tire inflation pressure values {{with or without}} tire chains on forest road in mountainous conditions. The motion resistance ratio increases {{with the increase of}} tire inflation pressure. On the contrary, the gross traction ratio increases with the decrease of tire inflation pressure. However, when the tires are equipped with tire chains the skidder motion resistance is higher. The motion resistance ratio with tire chains also increases with the decrease of tire inflation pressure due to windage between the tires and chains, which results in lower tractive performance of tire chains. Therefore, by using tire chains, an increase of gross tractive ratio could be achieved, as well as the increase of motion resistance ratio compared to tires without chains. The results of the study show that it is strongly recommended to use tire chains as tightly as possible...|$|E
40|$|A winch and a sulky can {{transform}} a farm tractor into an effective small-scale logging machine, closely resembling a wheeled <b>cable</b> <b>skidder.</b> The additional cost of these implements is very small, but they offer significant benefits when extracting timber under {{the conditions of}} small-scale forestry. The authors developed a productivity model for skidding timber with wheeled farm tractors, equipped with winch and sulky. The origin data pool contained over 300 individual skidding cycles, extracted from 8 separate tests. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} allowed calculating a simple mathematical relationship for estimating skidding productivity as a function of significant work conditions, such as: piece size, winching distance, tractor power, skidding distance and crew size. This model can provide useful directions to prospective users, contributing to operation planning, costing and optimization. It can predict {{a large proportion of the}} variability in the data and was successfully validated using reserved cycle records, extracted from the same data pool and not used for model development. Depending on tractor power and piece size, the average turn volume and productivity can exceed respectively 2 m 3 per cycle and 4 m 3 per Scheduled Machine Hour (SMH). Top performance can reach 8 m 3 SMH - 1, with heavy tractors and large logs. © 2011 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn...|$|E
40|$|The use of skidders {{equipped}} with rubber tires {{is a well}} accepted practice for the extraction of timber from the forest, but the application also causes considerable environmental problems. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effects of different slope gradient, number of machine passes on skid trails and soil depth on soil compaction. The study was designed as an experiment with the factors including slope gradient, soil moisture, and soil depth on various skid trails and with different number of machine passes. The effects of four slope classes (flat, 10 %, - 10 % and - 20 %), three soil depth classes (5, 15 and 25 cm), and different compaction levels based on various number of machine passes (0, 1, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30) were evaluated. A Timberjack <b>cable</b> <b>skidder</b> was used and the study location was in the Kheyrud Educational and Research Forest located in the Hyrcanian forest in northern Iran. The increased number of machine passes increased soil bulk density, but the highest rate of compaction occurred after the initial few passes. Uphill skidding increases soil compaction more than downhill skidding. The increases in bulk density were still significant at the maximum sampling depth of 20 – 30 cm. Soil bulk densities at 5, 15 and 25 cm depth averaged 35, 22 and 17 % higher than densities of undisturbed soil...|$|E

The continuous time study method {{was applied to}} collect data for felling, skidding, loading and a transportation model. Multiple regression analysis via SPSS software was applied to develop the time models. Felling time {{was found to be}} highly dependent on diameter at breast height. Skidding distance, winching distance, slope of the trail and piece volume were significant variables for the skidding time prediction model. The loading time model was developed considering piece volume. Transportation distance and load volume were used as independent variables in modeling the transportation time. The net production of felling was estimated at 12 trees/h (56. 65 m 3 /h). The net production rates for skidding, loading and traveling averaged 18. 51, 41. 90 and 3. 32 m 3 /h respectively. The total cost of harvesting from stand to mill was estimated 19. 70 €/m 3. The skidding phase was the most expensive component of the cut-to-length method. The bucking and delimbing components were less costly than the other logging phases. The results of this study can be used for harvesting planning and productivity optimization...|$|R

ANP analysis indicated that the benefits and risks were more important in terms of decision-making, compared to the opportunities and costs. Finally, the alternative of 'rubber-tired skidder' was selected as the most suitable method for meeting SFM strategies. The decision framework proposed in this study offers a means for the reorganizing and planning of timber harvesting operations as an integral step toward SFM.

Skidding operations could lead to an increase in detrimental soil disturbance and soil surface compaction that reduced forest soil fertilities. The aim of this study was to investigate and quantify of forest soil compaction following the skidding operations with wheeled <b>cable</b> <b>skidder.</b> This study was carried out in compartment no. 311 and 319 in Gorazbon district in Kheyrud forest in Hyrcanian forest. This study was conducted in a completely randomized factorial design and changes in soil bulk density and porosity with the skidder traffic intensity such as low intensity (less than 3 passes), moderate (3 to 7 passes) and very large (more than 7 passes) and two depths of 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm of soil were measured. The results showed that with the increase of machine traffic, soil bulk density was increased but the largest percentage increase was observed in initial passes (less than 3 times). Soil bulk density at the depth 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm, was more than the control area by 21. 2 and 6. 5 percent, respectively. Soil porosity percentage at wheel rut was decreased comparing to the control area and this reduction in the 0 - 10 cm depth was greater than 10 - 20 cm soil depth.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{measuring}} maximum loads on different slopes when skidding uphill with WOO DY 110 <b>cable</b> <b>skidder</b> and adapted 4 WD agricultural tractor AGT 835 {{are described in}} the article. Both tractors are very different and were chosen {{for the purpose of}} finding the limits of uphill skidding. Besides the slope, the pre-designated loads of different sizes and log orientation (butt-end or top-end forward) have been main variables. The trial was conducted on two concave shaped test skid trails in the forest. On the lower altitudes, the skid trails had small inclination, which slowly increased to 42 % on the track where WOODY 110 was tested, and 27 % where AGT 835 was measured. First the loads were skidded uphill with butt-end and then with top-end forward. The purpose was to choose too heavy loads, as we wished to stop tractors due to overload, but on different slopes. The proper load formation (butt-end forward if possible) in uphill skidding is most important on steeper skid trails. The dependency between maximum load and slope is linear. The calculated theoretical maximum load on horizontal surface enables us to make similar assessment for any other tractor weighing between 2 and 7 tons. For this purpose, John Deere 6220 and LIMB 80 LUXS adapted agricultural tractors for forest use were chosen and compared. The ratio between the tractor load on different slopes and tractor weight was calculated for all four tractors included in our comparison. Apart from the weight, tractor's engine torque (power) has the decisive influence on the load size. Maximum loads on different slope categories were calculated according to different engine powers...|$|E
40|$|Whole {{tree and}} tree length {{thinning}} are two alternatives which {{are likely to}} be more productive and may prove to be more cost effective than conventional log length thinning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare log length, tree length, and whole tree thinning techniques in terms of productivity and harvesting costs. The thinning operation took place in a second-growth Douglas-fir stand [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] (average dbh = 12. 8 ") using a small skyline yarder (28 ' tower, 120 HP) in a gravity return configuration. The treatments were defined by the amount of work done by the faller prior to yarding. Log length implies that felling, limbing, bucking and topping occured at the stump. Tree length indicates that trees were felled, limbed and topped only, and finally, whole trees were felled only prior to yarding. A rubber-tired <b>cable</b> <b>skidder</b> was used to swing material from the landing chute to a processing area. Here the skidder operator Forest Engineering presented on April 14, 1983 completed any limbing and bucking which was necessary. He then sorted and decked the logs prior to loading. During log length thinning, logs were either cold decked in front of the yarder or swung with the skidder to a loading deck. Detailed time studies were used to evaluate the felling and yarding operations for each of the three thinning techniques. Multiple linear regression was then used to develop predictive models for felling and yarding work cycles. An analysis of the delays on this study made it possible to separate out delays which were affected by a particular thinning technique, rather than having a single prorated delay time as is usually done. By combining results from the regression and delay analyses, estimates of productivity for each thinning technique were obtained. Finally, harvesting costs in dollars per cunit at the loading deck were generated and used to compare log length, tree length, and whole tree thinning. Results indicated that where cold decking is feasible and will not overly hamper the operation it will probably still be the cheapest alternative since a skidder is not required. The cost per cunit for this method was 8. 24 or 11...|$|E

A farm tractor, <b>skidder,</b> <b>cable</b> system, forwarder, and forwarder in combination with harvester were selected as model skidding technologies. The proposed model determines one of the four categories in terms of their environmentally friendly use: 1) Fully suitable, 2) Suitable, 3) Unsuitable – not excluded and 4) Unsuitable for every forest stand and individual skidding technology. The Saaty matrix was used to define weights of input parameters for multicriteria evaluation. The selected input parameters included: slope inclination, ground bearing capacity, risk of logging-transportation erosion hazard, presence and size of obstacles, skidding distance, terrain shape and age of stands. Stocking and areal representation of selected tree species were added to the evaluation of forwarder-harvester combination. Different equipment (standard tires, low-pressure tires, wheel tracks) and climatic conditions (dry, wet) were also taken into account in the evaluation of the model.

40|$|On-board {{computing}} (OBC) {{systems in}} South African timber-harvesting operations are currently limited {{because of the}} lack of local expertise and experience. In this study three trials were conducted, monitoring three skidder extraction operations at three sites in South African softwood sawtimber operations. Both <b>cable</b> and grapple <b>skidders</b> were equipped with a MultiDAT data collection device. For all trials, parallel manual time studies were conducted. The results from the time-studies were then used as the basis for evaluation of the accuracy of the information gathered by the OBCs. The results demonstrated the usefulness of OBC devices. This paper reports the results of the application of various tools to support these assessments, considering different levels of complexity, different detail of the results and different fields of application (business uses and research purpose). With regards to the estimation of the machine utilisation rate, it was highlighted that the use of the vibration sensor with additional input from the machine operator in order to define the reason for stopping offered the best solution with an error ranging from − 0. 74 % to + 5. 54 %. This tool can be used in long-term monitoring to identify the possible under-utilisation of a machine and consequently to establish a working system that provides greater productivity. For the evaluation of machine utilisation, the simple analysis of the GPS track-log also provided good results with an error ranging from 4. 29 % to − 4. 25 %, but it required time-consuming post-operation processing of the raw data in order to correctly interpret. The use of GPS data to perform work studies in general worked reasonably well, the main problem being again that, at certain stages, the process was not easily automated and tended to require time-consuming post-operation data manipulation. However, because of the amount of information derived from data processing, it presents a useful research tool. The introduction of simple OBCs in South Africa is possible, but does require organisational changes and adaptations from both machine operators, who need to be trained to understand and manage the specific user interface and data transmission, and from management responsible for data storage, collation and analysis, and subsequently the implementation of results in improving forest operations...|$|R
