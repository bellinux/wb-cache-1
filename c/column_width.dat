25|$|The oldest Doric temple entirely {{built of}} stone is {{represented}} by the early 6th century BC Artemis Temple in Kerkyra (modern Corfu). All parts of this building are bulky and heavy, its columns reach a height of barely five times their bottom diameter and were very closely spaced with an intercolumniation of a single <b>column</b> <b>width.</b> The individual members of its Doric orders all differ considerably from the later canon, although all essential Doric features are present. Its ground plan of 8 by 17 columns, probably pseudoperipteral, is unusual.|$|E
25|$|The Parthenon {{maintains}} the same proportion at {{a larger scale}} of 8 × 17 columns, but follows the same principles. In spite of the eight columns on its front, the temple is a pure peripteros, its external cella walls align with the axes of the 2nd and 7th columns. In other regards, the Parthenon is distinguished as an exceptional example among the mass of Greek peripteroi by many distinctive aesthetic solutions in detail. For example, the antae of pronaos and opisthodomos are shortened so as to form simple pillars. Instead of longer antae, there are prostyle colonnades inside the peristasis {{on the front and}} back, reflecting Ionic habits. The execution of the naos, with a western room containing four columns, is also exceptional. The Parthenon's Archaic predecessor already contained such a room. All measurements in the Parthenon are determined by the proportion 4:9. It determines <b>column</b> <b>width</b> to column distance, width to length of the stylobate, and of the naos without antae. The temple's width to height up to the geison is determined by the reverse proportion 9:4, the same proportion squared, 81:16, determines temple length to height. All of this mathematical rigour is relaxed and loosened by the optical refinements mentioned above, which affect the whole building, from layer to layer, and element to element. 92 sculpted metopes decorate its triglyph frieze: centauromachy, amazonomachy and gigantomachy are its themes. The external walls of the naos are crowned with a figural frieze surrounding the entire cella and depicting the Panathenaic procession as well as the Assembly of the Gods. Large format figures decorate the pediments on the narrow sides. This conjunction of strict principles and elaborate refinements makes the Parthenon the paradigmatic Classical temple. The Temple of Hephaistos at Athens, erected shortly after the Parthenon, uses the same aesthetic and proportional principles, without adhering as closely to the 4:9 proportion.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of solute concentration {{are needed to}} conduct studies of solute transport process in unsaturated soil. In this paper we present a method of obtaining accurate measurements in and space using dye infiltration and image analysis. The soil color {{was related to the}} dye concentration in the soil (C-s) using 74 small calibration samples. The overall root mean square error (RMSE) 0. 057 g dm(- 3), however, for C-s < 0. 75 g dm(- 3), the RMSE was only 0. 032 g dm(- 3). Variability of the concentration estimates at the pixel scale could be reduced by using an average filter. We used the calibration relationship during four infiltration experiments in a 0. 95 by 0. 975 m large Plexiglas Hele-Shaw cell to calculate dye concentration patterns. Using the first and second order time moments, the dispersivity lambda was calculated for nine different artificial <b>column</b> <b>widths,</b> from 0. 0014 (local-scale) to 0. 72 m (meso-scale). The horizontally averaged lambda proved to be identical for <b>column</b> <b>widths</b> from 0. 0014 to 0. 045 m. For larger scales, lambda gradually increased. We noticed that the two experiments with higher flow (1 and 2) and the two experiments with lower flow (3 and 4) showed an almost identical variation of meso-scale lambda with depth. We concluded that above a specific critical value of theta (similar to 0. 22 m(3) m(- 3)), solute mixing is enhanced, leading to a lower lambda, and that solute transport can be described as a convective-dispersive process. When theta is lower than this critical level, part of the porosity is deactivated and mixing between individual stream tubes decreases, which implies that transport then occurs as a stochastic-convective process...|$|R
