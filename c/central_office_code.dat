25|$|In the United States and Canada, the Bell System {{established}} in the 1940s a uniform system of identifying central offices with a three-digit <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code,</b> that {{was used as a}} prefix to subscriber telephone numbers. All central offices within a larger region, typically aggregated by state, were assigned a common numbering plan area code. With the development of international and transoceanic telephone trunks, especially driven by direct customer dialing, similar efforts of systematic organization of the telephone networks occurred in many countries in the mid-20th century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dialing plan}} {{in some areas}} permits dialing numbers in the local calling area without using area code or city code prefixes. [...] For example, a {{telephone}} number in North America consists of a three-digit area code, a three-digit <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code,</b> and four digits for the line number. If the area has no area code overlays, seven-digit dialing may be permissible for calls within the area, but some areas have implemented mandatory ten-digit dialing.|$|E

In most cases Barbados numbers beginning with the following <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes</b> do not permit incoming collect calls.|$|R

50|$|American {{television}} programs and films often use the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code</b> 555, or KLamath 5 and KLondike 5 in older movies and shows, for fictitious telephone numbers, to prevent disturbing actual telephone subscribers {{if anyone is}} tempted to dial a telephone number seen on screen.|$|E

50|$|In the NANP {{telephone}} {{format of}} +1-NPA-NXX-xxxx, the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes</b> {{fall in the}} position of NXX. In 1996 the following <b>central</b> <b>office</b> numbering plan was put in place by the incumbent local exchange carrier.|$|R
50|$|The NANP exhaust {{analysis}} {{estimates that}} the existing numbering system is sufficient until 2044, {{based on the assumption}} that a maximum of 667 NPAs continue to be available and that on the average 4400 <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes</b> are needed per year.|$|R
50|$|Within the {{multinational}} calling area {{administered by the}} North American Numbering Plan, telephone numbers are composed of three fixed-length fields: a three-digit numbering plan area (NPA) code (area code), indicating a geographical area, a three-digit (NXX) <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code,</b> and a four-digit (XXXX) station number.|$|E
5000|$|Telephone {{numbers in}} Canada follow the fixed-length Bell System format, {{consisting}} of the country code +1, followed by a three-digit area code, a three-digit <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code</b> (or exchange code) and a four-digit station code. This is represented as 1 NPA NXX-XXXX, in which the country code is [...] "1".|$|E
5000|$|As {{this and}} other {{improved}} technologies became available, as well as Automatic Message Accounting (AMA) computers to process the long distance records into customer bills, the reach of DDD was slow in the 1950s, but quickened in the early 1960s. Electronic switching systems with stored-program capability allowed electronic processing of the dialed digits, referring to electronic memories to determine call routing, and this has reached {{the state of the}} art, with digital telephone exchanges which are basically specialized computers that route voice traffic from one [...] "peripheral" [...] to another as digital data. Call routing can now be done based on the area code, <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code</b> and even the first two digits of the line number, although routing based on digits past the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code</b> is usually limited to cases of competitive local exchange carriers, number pooling and number portability.|$|E
50|$|Note: All <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes</b> reside {{within the}} rate centre of Toronto. In some cases, 416 prefixes are {{available}} to wire centres outside Toronto city limits which serve Toronto subscribers (such as MALTON22 in Mississauga, which serves an airport hotel strip in Toronto).|$|R
50|$|Automatic number {{identification}} (ANI) on the NPA's {{switching systems}} began transmission on October 11, 1992 for some <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes.</b> The new numbering plan area (NPA) entered service on October 11, 1993. Permissive dialing of 416 continued across the Golden Horseshoe until January 1, 1994.|$|R
50|$|In North America, from 1947 to 1995, all {{numbering}} plan area (NPA) codes were distinguished with a 0 or 1 {{as the middle}} digit, while <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes</b> (the first three digits of a seven-digit local number) never had a 0 or 1 as the middle digit.|$|R
50|$|In seven-digit dialing {{only the}} <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code</b> and the station number is dialed, {{indicating}} that the call destination is within the local area code. This was the standard in most of North America from the 1950s onward. In some small villages with only one local exchange, {{it may have been}} permissible to dial only the four-digit station number.|$|E
50|$|After the {{implementation}} of the North American Numbering Plan, placing a local call within the caller's area code involved only seven-digit dialing. Callers dialed only the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code</b> (three digits) and the four-digit station number of the telephone subscriber to reach. For example, a person at a station with the telephone number 212-555-7890 called the number 212-555-3456 by dialing 555-3456.|$|E
50|$|For example, 234-235-5678 {{is a valid}} {{telephone}} number with area code 234, central office prefix 235, and line number 5678. The number 234-911-5678 is invalid, because the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code</b> must {{not be in the}} form N11. 314-159-2653 is invalid, because the office code must not begin with 1. 123-234-5678 is invalid, because the NPA must not begin with 0 or 1.|$|E
50|$|States {{that were}} divided into {{multiple}} areas were assigned area codes with a 1 in the middle, the second position, while areas that covered an entire state or province, were numbered with the digit 0 as the middle digit. In order to distinguish seven-digit dialing from ten-digit dialing, <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes</b> were restricted to not having a 0 or 1 in the middle position. This was already common practice, because the system of using the initial letters of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> names did not assign letters to digits 1 and 0. Furthermore, area <b>codes</b> and <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes</b> could not start with 0 or 1, because 0 was used for operator assistance, and a leading single pulse, i.e. the digit 1, was automatically ignored by most switching equipment of the time. Additionally, the last two digits of an area code could not be the same, so that the assignments N00 and N11 (N = 2-9) were reserved for special purposes, as some <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> had been using them already for special services. The area codes N10 were reserved similarly and most {{were used for the}} Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX).|$|R
5000|$|U.S. Carriers holding any <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Codes</b> are {{required}} to submit information regarding their own numbering resource usage to the NANPA twice yearly, by February 1 and August 1 of each year, as required under CFR Title 47, Volume 3, Section 52 (f)(6)(i). [...] Carriers which fail to submit the required information {{are at risk of}} having further requests for numbering resources being denied.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, {{mandatory}} ten-digit dialing came to Edison {{with the}} introduction of Area code 732. Edison residents living on Roxy Avenue once again were in the spotlight in the news, with one side of the street served by the Rahway <b>central</b> <b>office</b> (Area <b>code</b> 732) and {{the other side of the}} street is served by the Plainfield <b>central</b> <b>office</b> (Area <b>Code</b> 908). Residents complained to the BPU and Bell Atlantic that it would be easier to yell across the street then dial a ten-digit number call their neighbor across the street.|$|R
50|$|The North American Numbering Plan allocates {{telephone}} numbers to central offices in blocks of 10000 consecutive numbers; each block is {{identified by the}} area code (three digits) and a <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code</b> (three digits). The remaining four digits identify the line number within the exchange. For allocation to local service providers, these blocks are subdivided and assigned in groups of 1000.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} digits dialed is {{unrelated}} {{to being a}} local call or a toll call {{when there is no}} toll alerting. Allowing 7D local dial across an area code boundary, which is uncommon today, requires <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code</b> protection, locally if using toll alerting, across the entire area code otherwise, to avoid assignment of the same seven-digit number on both sides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code</b> {{protection}} {{was once}} common in communities on provincial or state boundary lines. It {{has been declining}} in use as inefficient allocation of numbering resources to {{the growing number of}} competitive local exchange carriers has caused depletion of available number prefixes, often requiring ten-digit local calls or overlay plans where multiple area codes serve the same geographic location.|$|E
5000|$|A few {{rate center}} consolidations {{have been made}} in the {{interest}} of number conservation. Scarce 1-212 numbers are more efficiently allocated now that Manhattan, New York, is entirely [...] "NYC Zone 1" [...] instead of being split into Zones 1, 2, and 3; various area code 612 rate centers have been amalgamated into [...] "Twin Cities, Minnesota". These rare efforts normally operate in parallel with other conservation measures, such as number pooling and aggressive reclamation of unused <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most populous}} states {{required}} division into multiple Numbering Plan Areas, as each NPA {{was limited to}} 540 unique <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes.</b> For example, New York state was initially divided into five areas, {{the most of any}} state, followed by Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas with four NPAs each. These divisions attempted to avoid cutting across heavy toll traffic routes, so that most toll traffic remained within an area, and outgoing traffic in one area would not be tributary to toll offices in an adjacent area.|$|R
50|$|As {{demand for}} {{telephone}} service {{grew in the}} post-World War II period, it was foreseeable that the demand would exceed the addressing capacity of the existing system of using memorable telephone <b>central</b> <b>office</b> names as prefixes in telephone numbers. Several letter combinations had no pronounceable or memorable names {{and could not be}} used. Several North American numbering plan areas (NPAs) were divided so that more <b>office</b> <b>codes</b> became available to smaller regions. However, as the growth accelerated, the Bell System decided to implement all-number calling (ANC) and to deprecate the use of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> names to provide more <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes</b> to each NPA. This extended the usable numbering plan and only two area code splits became necessary between 1962 and 1981. All-number calling was phased in starting in 1958 and most areas had adopted it fully by the mid-1960s. In some areas it did not become universal until the 1980s. The Bell System published and distributed area code handbooks yearly which compiled the towns available for calling using an area code.|$|R
50|$|In the {{administration}} of the North American Numbering Plan, <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code</b> protection was a numbering policy intended to ensure that the same local telephone number was not assigned in both of a pair of adjacent communities on opposite sides of an area code boundary. Its primary purpose was initially to preserve seven-digit dialing of local calls across a common area code boundary in border communities.|$|E
50|$|The {{dialing plan}} {{in some areas}} permits dialing numbers in the local calling area without using area code or city code prefixes. For example, a {{telephone}} number in North America consists of a three-digit area code, a three-digit <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>code,</b> and four digits for the line number. If the area has no area code overlays, seven-digit dialing may be permissible for calls within the area, but some areas have implemented mandatory ten-digit dialing.|$|E
50|$|In {{the usual}} NANPA phone number jargon, the letter N {{represents}} a numeral from 2 through 9, while the letter X represents any numeral. Thus an NXX number may be any from 200 through 999, while XXXX would be 0000 through 9999. The first three digits of ten are referred to, by industry jargon, as the NPA, {{the next three}} as the NXX or CO code (<b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> <b>code),</b> and the last four as the line number.|$|E
50|$|On January 8, 1994, {{the area}} served by 215 was split. Most of its western portion, i.e. Philadelphia's {{southern}} and western suburbs, most of Berks County and the Lehigh Valley, changed to area code 610, while Philadelphia and its northern suburbs remained 215. However, three <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes</b> were moved from 215 to 717, namely 267 in Denver, 484 in Adamstown and 445 in Terre Hill, with 215-267 becoming 717-336 because 717-267 {{was already in}} use. These exchanges were all served by non-Bell telephone companies which sought to consolidate their eastern Pennsylvania customers into one area code, and {{would have had to}} change area codes anyway. The codes 267 and 484 were later used for overlay area codes in 215 and 610 respectively.|$|R
50|$|Northwestel's {{proposal}} for a new regulatory regime was approved for 2007, allowing resale of local telephone service, but no competitors entered the market to avail themselves of the resale option. In 2011, facilities-based local service competition {{was approved by the}} Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), so additional <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>codes</b> are now required for competitive carriers wishing to offer local service. The expense of deployment is limiting deployment so far to Whitehorse, Yellowknife, Inuvik, Behchoko, Aklavik and Hay River, four of which already have multiple prefixes. Communities that now have only one prefix are not likely to need a second prefix other than for local growth or the entry of a competitor (as in Aklavik and the twin Behchoko communities*).|$|R
50|$|The {{forecast}} exhaust for {{the full}} NANP {{at the time of}} the report was beyond the year 2037, however a sensitivity analysis performed as part of the report (which utilizes a higher gross demand for numbering resources of 7,400 <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> (CO) <b>codes</b> per year, opposed to the actual estimate of 6,500) reflected an exhaust in the year 2038.|$|R
