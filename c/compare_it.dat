5|$|Tipping the Velvet is a {{historical}} novel published as Sarah Waters' debut novel in 1998. Set in Victorian England during the 1890s, it tells a coming of age story about a young woman named Nan {{who falls in love}} with a male impersonator, follows her to London, and finds various ways to support herself as she journeys through the city. The picaresque plot elements have prompted scholars and reviewers to <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to similar British urban adventure stories written by Charles Dickens and Daniel Defoe.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or {{who had lived in}} Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity to <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to {{reconstruct}} the uncut version of Greed without use of the lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the Cinémathèque royale de Belgique named Greed {{as one of the}} twelve greatest films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim's original, uncut script for Greed, which came directly from von Stroheim's personal copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac. This publication led to three separate books that all used von Stroheim's script in order {{to reconstruct}} the original version of the film and <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to the released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and Herman G. Weinberg, both in 1972. Weinberg's book utilized 400 individual stills and production photos {{to reconstruct the}} uncut version of Greed, the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is robust against small variations in the shape. They <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E
5|$|Match Point is a 2005 British-Luxembourgish {{psychological}} thriller film {{written and}} directed by Woody Allen and starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, and Penelope Wilton. In the film, Rhys Meyers's character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Johansson. The film treats themes of morality, greed, and the roles of lust, money, and luck in life, leading many to <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to Allen's earlier film Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York. The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom. Allen quickly re-wrote the script, which was originally set in New York, for a British setting.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 2010, {{long after}} the microlensing event had subsided, the science teams {{studying}} the star used the NACO adaptive optics facility at the Very Large Telescope in Chile to determine the actual apparent magnitude of the star that microlensed its background star, hoping to <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to {{the magnitude of the}} star measured during the microlensing event. A discrepancy was found, a discrepancy that may have been a result of either error or of a planetary body. Interpretation of follow-up observations led to the planet's confirmation. The ratio between the planet's mass and its host star's mass is well-constrained, but a large interval of uncertainty exists because the host star's mass is known within a large confidence interval that spans the mass of all red dwarf stars.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, {{palaeontologist}} Richard A. Thulborn {{suggested that}} Heterodontosaurus {{was a junior}} synonym of the genus Lycorhinus, which was named in 1924 with the species L. angustidens, also from a specimen discovered in South Africa. He reclassified the type species {{as a member of}} the older genus, as the new combination Lycorhinus tucki, which he considered distinct due to slight differences in its teeth and its stratigraphy. He reiterated this claim in 1974, in the description of a third Lycorhinus species, Lycorhinus consors, after criticism of the synonymy by Galton in 1973. In 1974, Charig and Crompton agreed that Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus belonged in the same family, Heterodontosauridae, but disagreed that they were similar enough to be considered congeneric. They also pointed out that the fragmentary nature and poor preservation of the Lycorhinus angustidens holotype specimen made it impossible to fully <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> properly to H. tucki. In spite of the controversy, neither party had examined the L. angustidens holotype first hand, but after doing so, palaeontologist James A. Hopson also defended generic separation of Heterodontosaurus in 1975, and moved L. consors to its own genus, Abrictosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{main source}} from which S.thiersii derives its carbon is the {{cellulose}} of the decomposing plant material found in its grassland habitat. The enzymes that degrade cellulose are homologous to the enzymes used by ectomycorrhizal fungi that have symbiotic associations with plant roots. In {{an attempt to}} identify the genes involved in these processes, researchers at the United States Department of Energy and University of Wisconsin are jointly working to sequence the S. thiersii genome and to <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> with that of Amanita bisporigera, a species which forms mycorrhizal relationships with tree and which has already been partly sequenced. They hope {{to better understand the}} genetic pathways involved in the evolution of ectomycorrhizal associations. Another research objective is to establish whether the enzymes used by S. thiersii to degrade cellulose can be cost-effectively used in the conversion of crop residues into biofuels. S.thiersii seems to be expanding its range northwards and its genome may provide clues as to how it is adapting to climate change and further information on mycorrhizal relationships.|$|E
