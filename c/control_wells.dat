50|$|In May 1868 Tevis joined Darius Ogden Mills, H.D. Bacon, Leland Stanford, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker {{in forming}} the Pacific Union Express Company. This concern began {{operating}} in 1868 between Reno and Virginia City, Nevada, {{and received a}} ten-year exclusive contract to operate over the Central Pacific Railroad and Union Pacific Railroad.

Faced with the need to get Tevis' exclusive railroad contract, in the so-called Omaha Conference of October 4, 1869, Wells Fargo accepted Tevis' controlling interest and arranged for the consolidation of Pacific Union Express and Wells Fargo, which occurred in 1870. Tevis was elected vice president and a director of Wells Fargo in 1870.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the absence}} of {{replication}} of wells, empirical criteria for enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) positivity use fixed differences or ratios between spot forming units (SFU) counts between test and control. We propose an alternative approach which first identifies the optimally variance-stabilizing transformation of the SFU counts, based on the Bland–Altman plot of the test and <b>control</b> <b>wells.</b> The second step is to derive a positivity threshold from the difference in between-plate distribution functions of the transformed test and control SFU counts. This method is illustrated using 1309 assay results from a cohort study of influenza in Vietnam in which some, but not all, of the peptide pools have clear tendencies for SFU counts to be higher in test than <b>control</b> <b>wells...</b>|$|E

40|$|High-throughput {{screening}} (HTS) is {{the result}} of a concerted effort of chemistry, biology, information technology, and engineering. Many factors beyond the biology of the assay influence the quality and outcome of the screening process, yet data analysis and quality control are often focused on the analysis of a limited set of <b>control</b> <b>wells</b> and the calculated values derived from these wells. Taking into account the large number of variables and the amount of data generated, multiple views of the screening data are necessary to guarantee quality and validity of HTS results.

30|$|The Crystal Violet {{staining}} method modified from Álvarez et al. (2006) was developed. A 24 -well microplate (Nunc) {{was used}} and 4 replications were done. One ml of supernatant of the antagonist strain at a sub-inhibitory dilution (1 : 16) {{was placed in}} each well containing 1 ml of 15 % strength NB medium (with {{a low level of}} nutrients) and the well was inoculated with 100 µl of a dilution 1 / 100 of a suspension F. psychrophilum adjusted to an OD 540 nm= 0.2 (approximately 3 × 108 cfu ml- 1), obtaining a concentration in the well of approximately 1.5 × 105 cfu ml- 1. In addition, <b>control</b> <b>wells</b> containing inoculum, medium, supernatant of F. psychrophilum but no supernatant of the antagonistic strain (negative control), as well as other <b>control</b> <b>wells</b> containing culture medium, supernatant of F. psychrophilum, but without the inoculum of F. psychrophilum (abiotic control) were included and PBS was used to obtain identical volume conditions compared to the wells containing supernatants. The microplate was left to incubate for 4 days at 15 °C and 120 rpm to allow biofilms to form. At the end of this period the planktonic culture was removed from the well and its optical density at 540 nm was measured. The wells were then washed three times with sterile distilled water prior to staining with crystal violet (Certistain 7 ®, Merk) at 1 % for 30 min. The colorant excess was eliminated by three successive washes with sterile distilled water. Finally, the microplates were dried for 10 min and the crystal violet was solubilised with 1.5 ml of ethanol for reading at 595 nm. Biofilm formation was quantified using the formula SBF = (AB-CW)/G (Niu and Gilbert 2004), where SBF is the Specific Biofilm Formation index, AB is the optical density at 595 nm of the stained cells adhering to the well, CW is the optical density at 595 nm of the stained <b>control</b> <b>wells</b> containing culture medium free of bacteria (abiotic control) and G is the optical density at 540 nm of the cells growing in the culture medium. SBF was determined for wells with antagonist supernatant and without antagonist supernatant (negative control). The average and standard deviation of three replications were determined.|$|E
