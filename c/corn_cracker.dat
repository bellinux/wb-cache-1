50|$|Within a {{half dozen}} years of {{settling}} in the area, Clemons sold his <b>corn</b> <b>cracker</b> to Henry Schell (1810-1863) in 1846, a purchase which it was said {{was made possible by}} Schell selling a young slave boy for $400. Henry Schell had previously established the community of Shell Knob in Barry County, and he brought his wife, Elizabeth Yocum Schell, and their young children to make a claim on the large tracts of land that were open in that area for homesteading. He built a grist mill {{at the site of the}} <b>corn</b> <b>cracker</b> and had a house built west of the mill out of lumber that had been sawed at the Van Winkle mill in War Eagle, Arkansas. By the time of his murder by bushwhackers in 1863, he had amassed landholdings of 1,000 acres. In the summer of 1863 the Civil War was in full swing and southwest Missouri and northwest Arkansas was an area torn by loyalties between the North and the South. Henry Schell’s four oldest sons were all fighting for the Confederate States of America. On July 11, 1863 he was working in his mill when he either heard or saw a group of bushwhackers heading his way. He took off toward his house, but was shot as he went up the hill. His wife, daughters and some neighbor women took his body and prepared it for burial, using a meal box from the mill to serve as a coffin, and buried him in the front yard of his home. One of his sons, a blacksmith by trade, later put a wrought iron fence around it. Following his death, his 1,000 acres was divided among his descendants, who built homes, started businesses and set aside land for churches, a cemetery and a school. Over time his descendants continued to subdivide their acreage and sold off plots to other families.|$|E
50|$|The hilly {{and rocky}} Ozark Mountains land {{that would become}} Jacket had served for centuries as a home to native tribes, but by the mid-19th century the native people had left and were {{replaced}} by pioneers from eastern states {{and other parts of}} Missouri and Arkansas. Though a lack of formal records has made the specifics difficult to trace, it is believed that the first pioneer to set up a permanent settlement in Jacket came to the area around 1840 or 1841 and was known as Clemons. Clemons built a water-powered <b>corn</b> <b>cracker</b> at the spot where Otter Creek, which flows north from Pea Ridge, runs into Big Sugar Creek. Both the names of Big Sugar Creek and Jacket are believed to have been coined around this time, according to local legend Big Sugar Creek was named for the groves of sugar maples that grew on its banks and Jacket was in reference to the colonies of yellow jacket wasps that were populous in the area.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to produce <b>crackers</b> based on <b>corn</b> flour and to predict its shelf life using a critical moisture approach. The best crackers were produced from a mixture of 60 % corn flour and 40 % glutinous rice flour. The products had a puffing ratio of 11 %, crispiness of 250. 8 gf and hardness of 384. 7 gf. The <b>corn</b> <b>crackers</b> had better crispiness and hardness than those of commercial rice crackers. The moisture sorption isotherm curve of <b>corn</b> <b>crackers</b> could be described using a Hasley model. Using the critical moisture approach, <b>corn</b> <b>crackers</b> packaged in a metallized plastic and stored at 30 °C and 75 % relative humidity had a shelf life of 366 days. If the products were stored at 85 % relative humidity, the product shelf life would be 150 days...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Fermentation {{is one of}} {{the food}} {{material}} processing techniques to improve the nutritional value of a product. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effect of fermentation on isotherm sorption in corn flour and <b>corn</b> <b>crackers.</b> The varieties of corn used were BISI 2 and POP obtained from Cereal Crops Research Institute of Sulawesi Selatan. Steps involved in this study include flouring, fermentation, analysis of nutrient content and isothermic sorption at 30 ºC and 40 ºC with humidity of 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, and 80 %. The results showed that the fermentation of all corn flours can improve nutritional value which were observed in both corn varieties. Likewise, isothermic sorption with type II (sigmoid) on all types of corn were observed (fermented and unfermented) in corn flour and <b>corn</b> <b>crackers.</b> Based on the volume of water absorbed during the storage process, it appeared that there was an effect of the fermentation on corn flour either at a temperature of 30 ºC or 40 ºC, particularly humidity at humidity of < 60 %. Whereas, the fermentation treatment on <b>corn</b> <b>crackers</b> showed a positive influence at the storage temperature of 30 ºC in all corn varieties. At storage temperature of 40 ºC, fermentation treatment affect only the BISI 2 varieties...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the nutrient composition of selected commercial biscuits in Malaysia. A total of six brands from each type of biscuit (chocolate chip, <b>corn,</b> <b>cracker</b> with sugar, vegetable flavoured cracker, cream filled, oatmeal, shortbread and fully coated chocolate wafer) and five brands of wholemeal crackers were sampled from local supermarkets in the Klang Valley. The total energy content in commercial biscuits was ranging from 453. 30 to 499. 25 kcal/ 100 g. Carbohydrate was the major macronutrient in commercial biscuits ranging from 56. 86 to 66. 07 g/ 100 g. The highest protein content was found in the wholemeal crackers (9. 92 g/ 100 g) and the lowest protein content was found in the cream filled biscuits (5. 65 g/ 100 g). Fat content lay in the range of 16. 89 to 25. 75 g/ 100 g. The major minerals detected in biscuits were sodium, followed by calcium and magnesium. The vitamin content in A and E of the biscuits examined was almost comparable. Small quantities of trans fatty acids were detected in all biscuits in the range of 0. 02 to 0. 68 g/ 100 g. These findings indicate that Malaysian commercial biscuits are a good source of carbohydrate (34. 12 - 39. 64 g per serving), calcium (26. 09 - 384. 67 g per serving), magnesium (10. 42 - 37. 24 g per serving) and contain low proportion of trans fatty acids (0. 01 - 0. 41 g per serving) ...|$|E

50|$|Guests board a {{train in}} the shape of Heimlich, the German-accented {{caterpillar}} from the film. Heimlich himself narrates the ride through the speakers on the trains. Heimlich's tendency to overeat is the theme of the ride, as the train appears to eat through oversized portions of human foods: candy <b>corn,</b> animal <b>crackers,</b> carrots, Brussels sprouts and watermelon. Appropriate scents accompany the giant food sets so guests can sniff to attract them. Large bites have been taken out of all the foods, so guests can tell that Heimlich has been there before. At the ride's end, Heimlich bids guests farewell and reminds them to eat their fruits and vegetables.|$|R
