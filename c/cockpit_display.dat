25|$|In its {{submission}} to the NTSB, Virgin Galactic says the second SS2, nearing completion, had been modified {{with an automatic}} mechanical inhibit device to prevent locking or unlocking of the feather during safety-critical phases. An explicit warning {{about the dangers of}} premature unlocking has also been added to the checklist and operating handbook, and a formalized crew resource management (CRM) approach, already used by Virgin for its WK2 operations, is being adopted for SS2. This will include call-outs and a challenge/response protocol. While the report cites CRM issues as a likely contributing cause, Virgin says there is no plan to modify the <b>cockpit</b> <b>display</b> system.|$|E
500|$|The primary flight {{controls}} {{are compatible with}} the Hands On Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS) control principle– the centrally mounted stick, in addition to flying the aircraft, also controls the cockpit displays and weapon systems. A triplex, digital fly-by-wire system is employed on the Gripen's {{flight controls}}, with a mechanical backup for the throttle. Additional functions, such as communications, navigational and decision support data, can be accessed via the up front control panel, directly above the central <b>cockpit</b> <b>display.</b> The Gripen includes the EP-17 <b>cockpit</b> <b>display</b> system, developed by Saab to provide pilots {{with a high level}} of situational awareness and reduces pilot workload through intelligent information management. [...] The Gripen features a sensor fusion capability, information from onboard sensors and databases is combined, automatically analysed, and useful data is presented to the pilot via a wide field-of-view head-up display, three large multi-function colour displays, and optionally a helmet mounted display system (HMDS).|$|E

2500|$|The 787 has a [...] "fly-by-wire" [...] {{control system}} similar in {{architecture}} {{to that of}} the Boeing 777. The flight deck features LCD multi-function displays, which use an industry standard Graphical user interface widget toolkit (<b>Cockpit</b> <b>Display</b> System Interfaces to User Systems / ARINC 661). The 787 flight deck includes two head-up displays (HUDs) as a standard feature. [...] The 787 shares a common type rating with the larger 777, allowing qualified pilots to operate both models. [...] Like other Boeing airliners, the 787 uses a yoke instead of a side-stick. Under consideration is future integration of forward looking infrared into the HUD for thermal sensing, allowing pilots to [...] "see" [...] through clouds. Lockheed Martin's Orion spacecraft will use a glass cockpit derived from Honeywell International's 787 flight deck systems.|$|E
