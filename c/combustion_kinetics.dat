30|$|The paper {{reports the}} effects of surface fractal {{structures}} on the rheological behavior and <b>combustion</b> <b>kinetics</b> of raw brown coal and three modified coal water slurries (CWSs). The {{results show that the}} fractal structures and physicochemical properties of samples are dependent on various modification processes. The apparent viscosities of the coal water slurries increase with increasing surface fractal dimensions (D), especially with decreasing shear rates. Furthermore, it has been proved that the ignition temperatures and apparent activation energies of modified CWSs are lower than that of raw coal water slurry. Compared with the traditional qualitative analysis of the effect of pore structures on CWSs properties, D can more efficiently indicate the quantificational effect of pore structures on the rheological behavior and <b>combustion</b> <b>kinetics</b> of CWSs.|$|E
40|$|Measurement of the {{reactivity}} {{of a solid}} fuel provides a foundation for predicting how the fuel burns. However, previous studies of the <b>combustion</b> <b>kinetics</b> of coal have been largely restricted to small sized particles (similar {{to those found in}} pulverised fuel), so that the combustion characteristics of large heterogeneous solid fuel “lumps ” (typically 5 to 50 mm in size) are not that well understood. The {{reactivity of}} these larger “lumps” cannot necessarily be determined from measurements on much smaller particles since adsorption and desorption are important controlling factors in the combustion process. This paper thus presents experimental data, measured by means of a specially designed thermobalance, for the reactivity of solid fuel briquettes under oxidising conditions. The results are analysed by modification of an existing model for the <b>combustion</b> <b>kinetics</b> of smaller solid fuel particles. The briquettes were composed of low volatile anthracite together with an inert binding agent. The addition of this binding agent further complicates the combustion process, but is necessary, as briquettes cannot be successfully produced from anthracite alone. The coal particle size can modify the briquette reactivity and the effects of this parameter are reported.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{research}} {{is based on}} a functional global reaction-rate-based auto-ignition model (FGAM) developed at the Sasol Advanced Fuels Laboratory (SAFL). During the development of the model, its performance had been validated against a detailed kinetic auto-ignition mechanism in regions of lean to stoichiometric air-fuel ratio for n-heptane, iso-octane, 1 -hexene, toluene, methanol and a quaternary gasoline surrogate blend of iso-octane, toluene, nheptane and n-hexane. Subsequent to the publication of the model, sets of reaction coefficients for PRF (Primary Reference Fuel) and TSF (Toluene Standardisation Fuel) blends had been developed and published. In its original form, however, the model could not be implemented in typical engine and chemical kinetic model simulation software. In this work, an investigation was made into the form and stiffness limitations of the FGAM which prevented implementation into standard engine and chemical kinetic codes. Changes made to the form of the model that allowed implementation into these codes without significantly altering the behavioural functions of the model were investigated. Subsequent to the investigation, a modification was introduced to the FGAM {{in the form of a}} second pseudo-QSSA (quasi-steady-state assumption) which eliminated the need for calculation of the transient concentration of one of the model species.

However, <b>combustion</b> <b>kinetics</b> is required to predict and model combustion performance of a fuel.

The aim of this research work is to investigate <b>combustion</b> <b>kinetics</b> of Rapeseed oil Methyl Ester (RME) by experimentally in Jet Stirred Reactor and modeling using CHEMKIN a software package at 1 and 10 bar for different fuel conditions. Rapeseed Oil (RSO) <b>combustion</b> <b>kinetics</b> will also be predicted using related theory and chemistry difference between RME and RSO. RME oxidation experiments and comparison with commercial Diesel showed that RME oxidation performance was better at fuel-lean conditions and higher temperatures in terms of profile trends of pollutants, especially at higher pressure suggesting higher Air/Fuel ratio is more suitable for RME combustion. RME oxidation was simulated taking unique approach of using surrogate fuels (nhexadecane, Methyl Acetate) as a model fuel, and RME as a model fuel. The surrogate fuel model results showed that oxidation of commercial biodiesel like RME can be simulated using surrogate model-fuels, but with some limitations and less accuracy. The modeling with RME as model fuel gives good agreement between the model and experimental data in terms of profile trends of key oxidation components. However model needs improvement at high pressure (10 bar). The RME reaction mechanism consists of 496 species and 2652 reversible reactions. The chemical kinetic mechanism for RSO oxidation is represented by Oleic acid (C 18 H 34 O 2) oxidation. The reaction mechanism consists of 485 species and 2531 reversible reactions.

The present work aims at presenting the current probability-based approaches along applications to real problems of <b>combustion</b> chemical <b>kinetics.</b> The main methods related to model and parameter evaluation have been explicated. An in-house program for the systematic adjustment of kinetic parameters to experimental measurements has been described and numerically validated. The GRI (Gas research institute) mechanism (version 3. 0) has been shown to initially lead to results which are greatly at variance with experimental data concerning the combustion of CH 3 CH 3 and C 2 H 6 C 2 H 6. A thorough optimisation of all parameters has been performed with respect to these profiles. A considerable improvement could be reached and the new predictions appear to be compatible with the measurement uncertainties. It was also found that neither GRI 3. 0 nor three other reaction mechanisms considered during the present work should be employed (without prior far-reaching optimisation) for numerical simulations of combustors and engines where CH 3 CH 3 and C 2 H 6 C 2 H 6 play an important role.
