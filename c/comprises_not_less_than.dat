40|$|The {{translation}} initiation region (TIR) of the Escherichia coli rpsA mRNA coding for ribosomal protein S 1 {{is characterized}} by a remarkable efficiency in driving protein synthesis despite the absence of the canonical Shine–Dalgarno element, and by a strong and specific autogenous repression in the presence of free S 1 in trans. The efficient and autoregulated E. coli rpsA TIR <b>comprises</b> <b>not</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 90 nt upstream of the translation start and can be unambiguously folded into three irregular hairpins (HI, HII and HIII) separated by A/U-rich single-stranded regions (ss 1 and ss 2). Phylogenetic comparison revealed that this specific fold is highly conserved in the γ-subdivision of proteobacteria (but not in other subdivisions), except for the Pseudomonas group. To test phylogenetic predictions experimentally, we have generated rpsA′–′lacZ translational fusions by inserting the rpsA TIRs from various γ-proteobacteria in-frame with the E. coli chromosomal lacZ gene. Measurements of their translation efficiency and negative regulation by excess protein S 1 in trans have shown that only those rpsA TIRs which share the structural features with that of E. coli can govern efficient and regulated translation. We conclude that the E. coli-like mechanism for controlling the efficiency of protein S 1 synthesis evolved after divergence of Pseudomon...|$|E
50|$|The {{membership}} of the committee {{will be determined by}} whether the liquidator determines that the company is solvent, insolvent or of doubtful solvency.

40|$|A {{series of}} polypeptoid homopolymers bearing short (C 1 –C 5) side chains of degrees of {{polymerization}} of 10 – 100 are studied {{with respect to}} thermal stability, glass transition and melting points. Thermogravimetric analysis of polypeptoids suggests stability to &gt; 200 °C. The study of the glass transition temperatures by differential scanning calorimetry revealed two dependencies. On the one hand {{an extension of the}} side chain by constant degree of polymerization decrease the glass transition temperatures (Tg) {{and on the other hand}} a raise of the degree of polymerization by constant side chain length leads to an increase of the Tg to a constant value. Melting points were observed for polypeptoids with a side chain <b>comprising</b> <b>not</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> three methyl carbon atoms. X-ray diffraction of polysarcosine and poly(N-ethylglycine) corroborates the observed lack of melting points and thus, their amorphous nature.

40|$|A {{historical}} {{survey of}} the family {{is followed by a}} discussion of the systematic position, the affinities within the family, the morphology, anatomy, phytochemical characters, flower biology, geographical distribution, dispersal, and growth. A key to the species is given. Each taxon has been described and provided with its full synonymy. All specimens have been cited except in those cases where more than 5 collections were made in one partial area (country, province, district, or small island). A complete identification list will be issued separately. In this revision of Taccaceae 1 genus and 10 species are accepted; 8 species are restricted to Indo-Malesia (SE. Asia to the Solomons), 1 to tropical South America, and 1 species occurs from the tropical west coast of Africa eastwards to Easter Island in the eastern Pacific. Two new species have been described, one from Borneo and one from the Solomons and New Guinea, and one new combination has been proposed. The genus Schizocapsa and a large number of specific names have been reduced. The species synonymy is considerable and <b>comprises</b> <b>not</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 49 specific epithets. This situation {{is due to the fact}} that some widely distributed species have proved to be very variable.

40|$|Effect of {{temperature}} and iron concentration in solution on the phase composition, particle size, and magnetization was studied. It is shown {{that amount of}} the magnetite phase increases with the temperature increase. The magnetization slightly decreases with increase in the initial iron concentration. It is found that, regardless of the deposition conditions, spherical particles are formed, the average size of which varies within 7 to 15 nm. Comparison between the for removal efficiency and sorption capacity of the particles with the magnetite and hematite phase for cobalt was carried out. The sorption capacity of the particles is essentially independent of the phase composition and is about 18 mg/g for cobalt. For preparation of sorption material based on Fe₃O₄ magnetic particles, it is recommended {{to carry out the}} precipitation at the temperature of not lower than 80 °C and the concentration of iron in solution of 0. 15 to 0. 3 M.

Brinkerhoff, J.H. Spicer, A.P. Sain, H.R. Somers, Frank Ureidenberg, J.C. Redfield, and J.M. Mattoon. The colony selected the northwestern part of Allen County for a location, and started out with great expectations. There were about 300 families engaged to settle at once. It was decided to locate and lay out a town <b>comprising</b> <b>not</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 640 acre of land.
