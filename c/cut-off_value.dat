Major variation was observed {{even within the}} same platform. <b>Cut-off</b> <b>values</b> determined in different labs are not interchangeable. SUMMARY: Background <b>Cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for interpretation of lupus anticoagulant (LA) detection are poorly investigated. Aims (i) To assess whether results from healthy donors were normally distributed and (ii) the between-laboratories differences in <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for screening, mixing and LA confirmation when calculated as 99 th or 95 th centiles, and (iii) to assess {{their impact on the}} detection rate for LA. Methods Each of 11 laboratories using one of the three widely used commercial platforms for LA detection was asked to collect plasmas from 120 healthy donors and to perform screening, mixing and LA confirmation with two methods (activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT] and dilute Russell viper venom [dRVV]). A common set of LA-positive or LA-negative freeze-dried plasmas was used to assess the LA detection rate. Results were centralized (Milano) for statistical analysis. Results and conclusions (i) Clotting times or ratios for healthy subjects were not normally distributed in the majority of cases. The take-home message is that <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> should be determined preferably by the non-parametric method based on centiles. (ii) There were relatively large inter-laboratory cut-off variations even within the same platform and the variability was marginally attenuated when results were expressed as ratios (test-to-normal pooled plasma). The take-home message is that <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> should be determined locally. (iii) There were differences between <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> calculated as 99 th or 95 th centiles that translate into a different LA detection rate (the lower the centile the greater the detection rate). The take-home message is that <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> determined as the 95 th centile allow a better LA detection rate...|$|R

Since studies began documenting IgE levels in ABPA during the 1970s, various cut-offs between 833–1000 IU/mL have been employed to both exclude ABPA and to warrant further serological testing.

In other words, a positive D-dimer is not synonymous with PE, but a negative D-dimer is, with a good degree of certainty, an indication of absence of a PE.

A standardized protocol for {{the measurement of}} grip strength has been proposed in 2011 to enable consistent measurement of grip strength and comparisons between studies. It is unknown whether this protocol has been adopted in sarcopenia research and practice. The aim {{of the study was}} to provide insight into current measurement practice, including the use of <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for low muscle strength. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted, followed by a methodological quality assessment and extraction of relevant data. Inclusion criteria included a description of the grip strength protocol, EWGSOP standards were used to define sarcopenia, data was collected after 2010 and participants were 65 years and older. Results: Twenty-seven observational papers were included in the review. The methodological quality was acceptable/good. Overall, information about the protocol was limited with a large variability in measurement approach. Most non-Asian studies used <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for low grip strength of 30 kg for men and 20 kg for women. Asian studies showed more variability in choice of <b>cut-off</b> <b>values.</b> Discussion: The proposed grip strength measurement protocol has been poorly adopted since its publication. Although there seems to be some agreement on <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> in non-Asian studies, proposed <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> need to be evaluated in specific diseases and settings and its predictive abilities regarding outcomes such as mobility limitations and falls needs to be determined.

40|$|Abdominal {{obesity is}} {{a risk factor for}} cardiometabolic disease, and has become a major public health problem in the world. Waist {{circumference}} is generally used as a simple surrogate marker to define abdominal obesity for population screening. An increasing number of publications solely rely on the method that maximises sensitivity and specificity to define ‘optimal’ <b>cut-off</b> <b>values.</b> It is well documented that the optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> of waist circumference vary across different ethnicities. However, it is not clear if the variation in <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> is a true biological phenomenon or an artifact of the method for identifying optimal cut-off points. The objective of the present review was to assess the relationship between optimal cut-offs and population waist circumference levels. Among sixty-one research papers, optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 65 · 5 to 101 · 2 cm for women and 72 · 5 to 103 · 0 cm for men. Reported optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> were highly correlated with population means (correlation coefficient: 0 · 91 for men and 0 · 93 for women). Such a strong association was independent of waist circumference measurement techniques or the health outcomes (dyslipidaemia, hypertension or hyperglycaemia), and existed in some homogeneous populations such as the Chinese and Japanese.

Electrophysiological recordings comprised nerve conduction studies (NCS) of three nerves and, if coagulation was normal, myography in three muscles.

We investigated the prognostic values of immunohistochemistry (IHC) -based prognostic models {{as an alternative to}} multigene assays. Methods: The risk categories estimated by the IHC-based prognostic models were correlated to those estimated by the multigene assays in 71 cases and the follow-up results in 642 consecutive cases of HER 2 − luminal-type early breast cancer. <b>Cut-off</b> <b>values</b> of IHC-based models were adjusted based on survival outcome to reveal maximum Harrell C index or based on the maximum positive likelihood ratio correlated to multigene assay. Results: All investigated IHC-based models could predict the risk of distant recurrence, but their <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> required adjustment. Using distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) to refine the <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> could improve the prognostic <b>values.</b> Adjusting the <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> using the results of multigene assays, the positive predictive values of an estimate of low risk or low recurrence score (≤ 21) were higher than 90 %. On average, 23 % of cases got different results of risk assessment after adjustment. Although <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> adjusted by multigene assay were not identical to those refined by survival, the adjusted values (17. 1 and 23. 8) and the refined values (17. 5 and 24. 5) of the best model (Magee Eq. 1) were close. Among all the evaluated models, Magee equation 2 was the only one without Ki 67, and its prognostic values were the lowest.

The most commonly generally used age-related PSA <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> (36 % of respondents) are – 3. 5 ng/ml for 50 – 59 year olds, 4. 5 ng/ml for 60 – 69 year olds and 6. 5 ng/ml for over 70 year olds. Two-thirds (58 %, 200 / 346) of respondents were aware of the DoH PSA guidelines but only 20 % (n = 69 / 346) follow these guidelines. The majority of respondents (68 %, n = 234 / 346) used higher PSA cut-offs than recommended by the DoH. The level of compliance showed marked regional variation with a range from 7 % to 44 % (median 19 %).

DESIGN: Population-based study aimed at determining the predictive ability of waist circumference for cardiovascular risk based {{on the use of}} previous medical diagnosis for hypertension, diabetes mellitus and/or dyslipidaemia. Descriptive analysis was used for the adequacy of current <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> of waist circumference, receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed and the most accurate criteria according to the Youden index and points of optimal sensitivity and specificity were identified. SETTING: Pelotas, southern Brazil. SUBJECTS: Individuals (n 2112) aged ≥ 20 years living in the city were selected by multistage sampling, since these individuals did not report the presence of previous myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or stroke. RESULTS: The <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> currently recommended by WHO were more appropriate in men than women, with overestimation of cardiovascular risk in women. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve showed moderate predictive ability of waist circumference in men (0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 71, 0. 76) and women (0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 73, 0. 77). The method of optimal sensitivity and specificity showed better performance in assessing the accuracy, identifying the values of 95 cm in men and 87 cm in women as the best <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> of waist circumference to assess cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> currently recommended for waist circumference are not suitable for women. Longitudinal studies should be conducted to {{evaluate the}} consistency of the findings.
