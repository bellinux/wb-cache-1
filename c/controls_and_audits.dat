This investigation focused on the policies, practices and controls that the ACC uses to ensure information relevance and security. The investigation was coordinated with the Robinson Review to ensure that any overlap or replication by our investigation was minimised. The review examined the information governance structure and the management of information in the ACC. This required us to examine the various databases used by the ACC. We examined the policies governing information management, staff integrity and risk management.

40|$|In {{this study}} we perform the first econometric attempt to {{estimate}} the trade-off between equity and efficiency of tax systems counting for the tax evasion option in a developing country such as Albania. Using the Albanian Living Srandard Measurement Survey (2005, 2008) we estimate a micro-econometric model of labour supply and incorporate the option of participation in regular and irregular labour markets. Swapping the tax rules of 2005 with 2008, {{we find that the}} flat tax has not contributed in the reduction of labour informality but rather the increases in regular wages have {{played an important role in}} convincing the individuals to move to regular market. Furthermore, we find that <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>audits</b> are more efficient than fines in inducing people to switch from the informal to formal labour market. A similar effect is achieved also when “honest” individuals are endowed with a universal benefit. In distributional terms, calculations of Gini inequality index and Sen’s welfare index demonstrate that the only scenario that would improve welfare index is a progressive tax rule as before 2007. Finally, these results suggest that a kind of progressivity should be reinserted to the taxation system without affecting the attractiveness of the simplicity exercised by the flat tax. ...|$|E
40|$|Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Arbitrage Pricing Model are {{two main}} asset pricing models that explain capital asset pricing and stock returns in {{financial}} theory. The {{purpose of this study}} is to search the validity of CAPM, which is also known as the capital market equilibrium model, in our country. In the application of the research daily closing prices of 11 banks stocks that are traded in Istanbul Stock Exchange Market (ISE) are evaluated over the 1999 - 2009 period. There {{are two main}} reasons while choosing banking sector in order to test the validity of CAPM; Banking sector in the ISE is subject to more <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>audits</b> compared to other sectors. Therefore, assets chosen from the banking sector have less possibility of overpricing, under-pricing or manipulation risks over the prices. Thus, probability of reflecting the right prices of the assets is higher for the banking sector assets. Secondly, changes in the interest rates are immediately reflected in banking sector, since their affairs based on interest rates banks are highly sensitive to interest rate changes. This sensitivity played a crucial role to consider banking sector assets. In the research performed by Copeland, Koller and Murrin (1994) it is observed that beta of banking sector is the most close to the market beta. Thereupon, it is thought that market representation likelihood of banking sector is high. ii ÖZE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Nowadays, {{the rates}} of {{malicious}} data theft and data destruction are alarming. Governments, companies and other organizations have {{lost a lot of}} money and many others have closed down due to the activities of dubious hackers and attackers. As data is the life wire of every organization, there is the need to remotely and securely store the data generated daily by these organizations in order to enable them recover quickly in the event of attach and hack. Cloud storage is needed here for the remote data storage. For many establishments, data security is one of their major concern when sending their files into the cloud. They worry about their files being seen or even compromised by malicious and dubious people because that’s what happened in the past. User accounts have been hacked, cloud storage systems failed, files and personal data were exposed. So how can you effectively prevent that from happening even if your account gets hacked or something happens to your cloud storage provider. Data encryption techniques are required to protect the integrity of the stored data. In the past, many businesses felt comfortable allowing the cloud providers to manage all their data, believing that security risks could be managed through contracts, <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>audits.</b> Over time it has become apparent, however, that cloud providers cannot honor such commitments when responding to government requests for information. In this paper, I will focus on cloud storage providers, cloud security challenges, encryption methodologies...|$|E
40|$|This article investigates {{whether an}} {{environmental}} audit {{has been conducted}} at a Federal Institution of Education. The specific objectives are to: i) verify the environmental controls held at the institution, ii) investigate the environmental audits within the institution; and, iii) prepare a list containing the main environmental factors that could be monitored by the institution. The research has a descriptive purpose; the procedures we used are bibliographic, document review, and case study. The research instrument is documentary research or primary sources to approach {{the problem in the}} qualitative way. The study sample is a federal institution of professional and technological education, and temporal analysis includes the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. Based upon the annual plan for internal audit activities, and on the annual report of the internal audit activities, we found that the institution has not conducted any environmental audits in the investigated period. The result was that, in relation to internal control, there is the obligation for the adoption of a Plan of Sustainable Logistics (PSL) and its publicity on the institutional web page. We found the absence of the PSL at the institution, making it impossible to assert that the institution conducts internal environmental controls. We observed only a self-assessment in the institutional management report, in which one of its topics included information on sustainable procurement, awareness campaigns, and waste separation. Within the absence of the environmental <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>audits,</b> we prepared a list containing the main factors that can be seen on environmental audits in the public educational institutions. </span...|$|E

40|$|Fiscal {{decentralization}} {{in developing}} countries {{has been at the}} center stage of public sector reforms in the last two decades. Yet, {{a closer look at the}} recent reforms in the developing world indicates that decentralization does not necessarily translate into better outcomes because of waste, corruption, and inefficiencies. The success of decentralization depends on the existence of a framework that keeps local or “subnational ” governments on track and holds local government officials accountable for results—two missing components in most recent decentralization efforts.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{held that the}} auditor's {{experience}} {{is the most important}} factor leading to the development and organization of the auditor's knowledge base (Waller and Felix 1984; Gibbins 1984). This study extends prior research by examining knowledge differences between auditors with similar amounts of public accounting experience (general domain experience) but with differing specific <b>audit</b> experiences <b>and</b> training. The study examines the association between experience and training and the auditors knowledge of the effectiveness of internal <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> procedures to prevent and detect potential misstatements of financial statements. This particular knowledge is important in the performance of <b>audit</b> risk assessment <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> planning tasks. Risk assessment <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> planning tasks are important tasks that auditors begin to perform early in their auditing careers. In order to test these relationships, 60 subjects with approximately one to two years of public accounting experience performed a knowledge retrieval task to assess their knowledge of the relationship between common financial statement misstatements <b>and</b> the <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> procedures that would prevent or detect those misstatements. Self-reported measures of public accounting experience and estimates of experience and training relevant to various industries <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> activities were collected to develop measures of task-relevant experience and training. The resulting evidence of this study provides limited support that differences in audit-cycle experience results in differences in the auditor's knowledge of effective internal control procedures. The study also provides evidence that the knowledge of the relationships between internal <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> procedures <b>and</b> potential misstatements to financial statements is acquired, at least in part, prior to obtaining significant experience in performing audit planning tasks...|$|R
