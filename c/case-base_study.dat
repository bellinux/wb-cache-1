40|$|Both the {{absolute}} risk {{and the relative}} risk (RR) have a crucial {{role to play in}} epidemiology. RR is often approximated by odds ratio (OR) under the rare-disease assumption in conventional case-control study; however, such a study design does not provide an estimate for absolute risk. The <b>case-base</b> <b>study</b> is an alternative approach which readily produces RR estimation without resorting to the rare-disease assumption. However, previous researchers only considered one single dichotomous exposure and did not elaborate how absolute risks can be estimated in a <b>case-base</b> <b>study.</b> In this paper, the authors propose a logistic model for the <b>case-base</b> <b>study.</b> The model is flexible enough to admit multiple exposures in any measurement scale-binary, categorical or continuous. It can be easily fitted using common statistical packages. With one additional step of simple calculations of the model parameters, one readily obtains relative and absolute risk estimates as well as their confidence intervals. Monte-Carlo simulations show that the proposed method can produce unbiased estimates and adequate-coverage confidence intervals, for ORs, RRs and absolute risks. The <b>case-base</b> <b>study</b> with all its desirable properties and its methods of analysis fully developed in this paper may become a mainstay in epidemiology...|$|E
40|$|Many {{diseases}} {{result from}} the interactions between genes and the environment. An efficient method has been proposed for a case-control study to estimate the genetic and environmental main effects and their interactions, which exploits the assumptions of gene-environment independence and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. To estimate the absolute and relative risks, one needs to resort to an alternative design: the <b>case-base</b> <b>study.</b> In this paper, the authors show how to analyze a <b>case-base</b> <b>study</b> under the above dual assumptions. This approach {{is based on a}} conditional logistic regression of case-counterfactual controls matched data. It can be easily fitted with readily available statistical packages. When the dual assumptions are met, the method is approximately unbiased and has adequate coverage probabilities for confidence intervals. It also results in smaller variances and shorter confidence intervals as compared with a previous method for a <b>case-base</b> <b>study</b> which imposes neither assumption...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{reproductive}} factors can be significant determinants of serum perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) concentrations in women. This analysis examined the distribution of seven PFASs in a cohort that included women from two previous <b>case-base</b> <b>studies</b> conducted in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa) Study. Several models were created to predict the impact of oral contraceptive (OC) use (pill and mini pill) on serum PFAS concentrations. I found that women who reported using OCs in the past 12 months had increased serum PFAS concentrations compared to women who had not reported use of OCs in the past 12 months. Additional characteristics of oral contraceptive use were analyzed, including age at first use (among OC users), lifetime duration of OC use, and recency of OC use. The interaction between duration of use and recency of use was also examined. Among OC users, age at first OC use was not found to be a strong determinant of serum PFAS concentrations. However, compared with never OC users, longer duration of OC use and more recent OC use were each found to be important determinants of increased serum PFAS concentrations. Duration of OC use and recency of OC use did not appear to have an interactive effect on serum PFAS concentrations, except in the case of women who reported a short lifetime duration of OC use (i. e., less than three years). Among these women, OC use appeared to impact PFAS concentrations only among recent OC users. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, a weighted analysis was conducted using the inverse of the sampling probabilities for each group. Second, I conducted an analysis limited to the base groups of both sub-studies. Lastly, I reran the models limited to Study A participants and included interpregnancy interval as a covariate. Results were largely unchanged in each of these sensitivity analyses. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that OC use should be considered when investigating the relationship between reproductive outcomes and serum PFAS concentrations in women. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{identify}} which British residents travelling abroad are at greatest risk of malaria infection, {{and to determine}} the efficacy of malaria chemoprophylaxis for preventing P falciparum infections in tropical Africa. DESIGN [...] Prospective cohort <b>study</b> (<b>case-base</b> linkage) with routine national surveillance systems. Denominators (base population) were obtained from monitoring {{a random sample of}} returning British travellers with the international passenger survey. Numerators (cases) were obtained from reports of malaria infections in British residents, through the Malaria Reference Laboratory network. SETTING [...] International passenger survey conducted at passport control of international airports in Britain. Malaria reports received nationally were collated centrally in London. SUBJECTS [...] 2948 British residents (0. 2 %) returning to Britain in 1987 randomly selected and questioned and 1052 British residents with microscopically confirmed malaria infections in 1987, whose case reports were reviewed and on whom additional data were collected by postal survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Annual incidence subdivided by categories of risk. Chemoprophylactic efficacy for east and west Africa by principal regimens and compliance. RESULTS [...] Annual rates of reported infection per 100, 000 travellers to Oceania were 4100; to west and east Africa were 375 and 172 respectively; to Latin America, the Far East, and the Middle East were 12, 2, and 1 respectively. Immigrants visiting friends and relatives in Ghana and Nigeria were at greatest risk (1303 and 952 per 100, 000 respectively) in west Africa. Business travellers to Kenya experienced the highest attack rates in east Africa (465 per 100, 000). Age-sex specific attack rates varied by region. No prophylaxis was reported to have been used by 23 % of British visitors to west Africa, 17 % to east Africa, 46 % to central or southern Africa, and 58 % visiting south Asia. The efficacy of chloroquine plus proguanil against P falciparum infection was 73 % and 54 % in west and east Africa respectively. Lower values were obtained for chloroquine alone and proguanil alone. The efficacy of Maloprim (pyrimethamine-dapsone) was 61 % in west Africa, but only 9 % in east Africa. Visitors to west Africa who did not comply with their chemoprophylactic regimen were at a 2. 5 -fold higher risk of infection than fully compliant users. Non-compliant visitors to east Africa had similar rates of infection as non-drug users. CONCLUSIONS [...] In 1987 chloroquine plus proguanil was the preferred chemoprophylactic regimen for P falciparum infection in Africa; antimalarial drugs must be taken regularly to be effective...|$|R
