40|$|Abstract—A {{technique}} to rapidly correct for both DAC and gain {{errors in the}} multibit first stage of an 11 -bit pipelined ADC is presented. Using a dual-ADC based approach the digital background scheme is validated with a proof-of-concept prototype fabricated in a 1. 8 V 0. 18 m CMOS process, where the calibration scheme improves the peak INL of the 45 MS/s ADC from 6. 4 LSB to 1. 1 LSB after calibration. The SNDR/SFDR is improved from 46. 9 dB/ 48. 9 dB to 60. 1 dB/ 70 dB after calibration. Calibration is achieved in approximately 10 4 clock cycles.

40|$|A new {{technique}} to measure a capacitor or a capacitive sensor {{by means of}} a direct sensor-to-microcontroller interface circuit that does not need a <b>calibration</b> <b>capacitor</b> is proposed. Basically, the measurement process consists of three consecutive steps of charge, discharge and charge of the capacitor under test. A non-linear equation is obtained and solved that is dependent only on known circuit parameters. Experimental results show {{that it is possible to}} measure a wide range of capacitor values with a maximum deviation of 2 % from the reference value, and that temperature changes from 18 to 70 °C yield relative errors below 0. 1 %. For the lowest measured capacitor range (33 pF- 4. 7 nF) the uncertainty holds below 1 pF which enables measurement of commercially available capacitive sensors. The main advantage of the proposed technique is cost and space reduction of the final design. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{method of}} {{indirect}} background digital calibration {{of the dominant}} static non-linearities in pipelined ADCs is presented. The method, called Decision Boundary Gap Estimation (DBGE), monitors {{the output of the}} ADC to estimate the size of missing code gaps that result at the decision boundaries of each stage. Missing code gaps result from such effects as capacitor mismatch, finite op-amp gain, comparator offset, and charge injection. DBGE does not require special calibration signals or additional analog hardware and can even reduce the performance requirements the analog circuitry. The calibration is performed using the input signal and thus requires that the input signal exercise the codes {{in the vicinity of the}} decision boundaries of each stage. If it does not exercise these codes, then calibration does not matter because the non-linearities will not appear in the output signal. DBGE is simple and amenable to VLSI and/or processor implementations even in older fabrication technologies. Simulation results indicate DBGE is highly accurate, robust, and adaptive even in the presence of parameter drift and thermal noise.

40|$|A {{standard}} method for picoammeter <b>calibrations</b> is the <b>capacitor</b> charging technique, which allows generating traceable currents in the sub-nA range. However, its accuracy {{is limited by}} the ac-dc differences of the capacitances involved. The Ultrastable Low-noise Current Amplifier (ULCA) is a novel high-precision amperemeter for direct current measurements in the pA range, developed at PTB. Its amplifier stages, based on resistor networks and op-amps, can be calibrated traceably with a cryogenic current comparator (CCC) system. We compare the results from both independent calibration routes for two different ULCA prototypes. We find agreement between both methods at an uncertainty level below 10 microA/A, limited by the uncertainty of the currents generated with the capacitor charging method. The investigations confirm the superior performance of the new ULCA picoammeter. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
