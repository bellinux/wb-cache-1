This {{has been shown to}} be economically viable and is a major initiative in waste reduction. The studies have included recovery processes based on dry pyrochemical iodination, chlorination, and hydrochlorination. Chlorination, using either or both chlorine and hydrogen chloride, was shown to provide better performance and is more compatible for interfacing with existing industrial chlorination processes used for fuel rod cladding manufacture from natural zirconium. The chlorination recovery process could be used for <b>chemical</b> <b>decladding</b> of intact UNF assemblies or for treatment of empty cladding segment hulls. Future work is planned to optimize recovery process conditions, equipment design, and scale-up operations...|$|E
40|$|Losses of fertile and fissile {{materials}} during <b>chemical</b> <b>decladding</b> of irradiated prototype Consolidated Edison power-reactor fuel pins by the Sulfex and Darex processes were determined, on a laboratory scale, in all-glass apparatus. For air-fired low-density (- 85 per cent of theoretical) fuel cores, minimum losses of uranium, thorium, and plutonium {{were in the}} 0. 1 to 0. 2 per cent range, by either process. These losses increased if the dejacketed cores were allowed to remain {{in contact with the}} cladding solution. No selectivity of dissolution of core components was apparent. Comparable losses were obtained with similar unirradiated fuel pins, irradiated core pellets showed a tendency to shatter. When shattered core pellets were present, losses to the cladding solution were excessive. Losses of from 0. 5 to 4. 5 per cent were observed, depending on the extent of core fragmentation and the time of contact with the cladding solution. No correlation between burnup and extent of shattering was discernible. Core dissolution times were not lengthened by irradiation to the 175 to 300 -Mwd/t core level. (auth...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRepository {{programs}} {{throughout the}} world have been slowed by the need for increased local public involvement in the siting and licensing process. The result has been an increase in the dry storage of used fuel at reactor sites and the potential that such storage may be extended for many decades, even centuries. While there are sound technical reasons to believe that dry storage can be conducted safely, there are increasing concerns that the ultimate transfer to either a future repository or a centralized separations plant may result in fractured cladding and serious handling issues, including criticality concerns. These concerns would be increased for higher burn-up fuels. Currently, various chemical pre-treatment processes under R&D for application to commercial used oxide fuel have been investigated at the laboratory scale as methods to simplify and increase the safety of the remaining stages of conventional solvent extraction processing. This includes advanced decladding methods and various oxidation/reduction processes designed to release volatile and semi-volatile fission products, produce finely divided uranium oxide powder, and ameliorate the subsequent nitric acid dissolution step. The paper examines the potential for combining several chemical and physical pre-treatment steps to minimize long-term concerns about safe transport of used fuel, possibly providing another option for future nuclear waste management. Laboratory data from both cold and hot testing will provide the basis for the evaluation. An example of a potential pre-treatment process includes shearing, advanced voloxidation and off-gas treatment, the possible mixing of the resulting uranium oxide with a secondary oxide, and densification and recanning in nitric acid-soluble storage containers for extended time periods. <b>Chemical</b> <b>decladding</b> may be feasible to replace shearing. Zirconium recycle may also be feasible, significantly reducing high level waste quantities. Both analytic and experimental data will be applied to the examination of this potential fuel cycle option...|$|E
40|$|One {{critical}} {{aspect of}} any denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) involves dismantlement {{of its nuclear}} facilities and management of their associated radioactive wastes. The decommissioning problem for its two principal operational plutonium facilities at Yongbyun, the 5 MWe nuclear reactor and the Radiochemical Laboratory reprocessing facility, alone present a formidable challenge. Dismantling those facilities will create radioactive waste in addition to existing inventories of spent fuel and reprocessing wastes. Negotiations with the DPRK, such as the Six Party Talks, need to appreciate the enormous scale of the radioactive waste management problem resulting from dismantlement. The two operating plutonium facilities, along with their legacy wastes, will result in anywhere from 50 to 100 metric tons of uranium spent fuel, as much as 500, 000 liters of liquid high-level waste, as well as miscellaneous high-level waste sources from the Radiochemical Laboratory. A substantial quantity of intermediate-level waste will result from disposing 600 metric tons of graphite from the reactor, an undetermined quantity of <b>chemical</b> <b>decladding</b> liquid waste from reprocessing, and hundreds of tons of contaminated concrete and metal from facility dismantlement. Various facilities for dismantlement, decontamination, waste treatment and packaging, and storage will be needed. The shipment of spent fuel and liquid high level waste out of the DPRK {{is also likely to}} be required. Nuclear facility dismantlement and radioactive waste management in the DPRK are all the more difficult because of nuclear nonproliferation constraints, including the call by the United States for “complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement,” or “CVID. ” It is desirable to accomplish dismantlement quickly, but many aspects of the radioactive waste management cannot be achieved without careful assessment, planning and preparation, sustained commitment, and long completion times. The radioactive waste management problem in fact offers a prospect for international participation to engage the DPRK constructively. DPRK nuclear dismantlement, when accompanied with a concerted effort for effective radioactive waste management, can be a mutually beneficial goal...|$|E
