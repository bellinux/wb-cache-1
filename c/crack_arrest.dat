40|$|International audienceThe fretting-fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> {{condition}} is formalized as the condition {{for which a}} crack nucleates but stops propagating and so the sample never fails. Usually this domain is small as the fatigue loading greatly promotes the crack propagation. The aim of this research work is to investigate the <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> condition for severe plastic condition (maximal pressure is 2. 5 {{times greater than the}} yield stress) and high fatigue stress ratio (R= 0. 94) thus for not much propagating conditions. A low alloyed industrial steel flat specimen (IS) fretted against a 35 NCD 16 steel cylinder pad was studied in order to identify the <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> condition for various fretting loadings (shear amplitude). An original experimental monitoring has been implemented on a fretting-fatigue test device to observe online the <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> using the potential drop technic. To rationalize these results, a fretting-fatigue map concept which consists to plot the <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> boundary {{as a function of the}} applied maximum fatigue stress and the fretting tangential force amplitude is applied. A 2 D plain strain FEM modelling has been implemented to simulate the complex contact stressing including the contact plasticity. This plastic deformation promotes a significant extension of the contact and a proportional reduction of contact pressure and cyclic shear stresses. One consequence is that for a given contact and fatigue loading, this plastic accommodation of the interface tends to reduce the effective stress imposed to the material. The <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> boundary was formalized applying a pure mode I effective intensity stress range approximation.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} and computational work by Link and associates {{has demonstrated that}} relatively small (W= 150 mm) single edge notched tension specimens (SE(T)) {{can be used to}} obtain <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> data high in the ductile-to-brittle transition of ferritic structural steel using dynamic computational techniques if a thermal gradient is utilized to aid in the <b>crack</b> <b>arrest.</b> Testing has been reported on two important navy structural steels that clearly defines the relative capability of the two materials to arrest rapidly growing cracks. The HY 100 material demonstrated the expected large difference between the initiation and <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> toughnesses which has made it impossible in the past to measure <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> toughness for this material using the standard ASTM procedure (E 1221). The HSLA- 100 steel, however demonstrated a much higher <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> toughness and a correspondingly smaller drop in toughness below the initiation toughness. This small difference between initiation toughness and arrest toughness suggested that the E 1221 procedure, using wedge loaded, compact <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> (CCA) specimens would be applicable to this material. Two important issues could then be investigated using this material. First, having completed the expensive and relatively complex testing of the SE(T) specimens using tensile loading and a thermal gradient, a second, quite different geometry could be tested using the E 1221 procedure, allowing an important comparison between the <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> measurements made using these two distinct geometries. Historically, obtaining <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> results using one test configuration has been so difficult, that there have been very few reports of results for the same material using two different test geometries. Transferability of the laboratory results to structural applications has thus been a matter of conjecture. Furthermore, if the E 1221 CCA specimens were strain gaged to obtain crack velocity data, and analyzed using the dynamic computational procedure used by Link on the SE(T) specimens, {{it would be possible to}} compare the results the E 1221 static analysis with the results of the dynamic computation procedure to determine the degree of conservatism present in the E 1221 standard procedure.

40|$|<b>Crack</b> <b>arrest</b> of fast running cracks is an {{important}} issue for the safety of steel structures. <b>Crack</b> <b>arrest</b> design can prevent fatal damage of large structures by restricting the influence of the incidents. Therefore <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> design is important especially for very large structure, where accidents may cause huge economical and social losses. Propagating shear fracture, long running ductile crack propagation in pipelines and brittle crack propagation in heavy thick shipbuilding steels have been investigated. For the propagating shear fracture issue, a new HLP simulation model, applicable to various backfill conditions, including underwater backfill, was developed. The proposed backfill model {{can be applied to the}} prediction of the <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> of propagating shear fracture under various backfill conditions. The new HLP simulation was successful in estimating full-scale burst tests with various backfill depths. The new HLP simulation for underwater pipelines indicated that propagating shear cracks are easily arrested in offshore pipelines compared to onshore pipeline. The toughness requirement of the line pipe for preventing propagating shear fracture can be significantly smaller in underwater pipelines compared to onshore pipelines. The margin of the underwater pipeline for propagating shear fracture was clarified by the new model developed in this thesis. For brittle <b>crack</b> <b>arrest,</b> an empirical approach for long crack propagation has been conducted. Several large-scale <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> tests were carried out in order to investigate the long crack arrestability of heavy-thick shipbuilding steel plates. All plates and their welded joints used in this study satisfied the Charpy toughness requirement for EH-grade shipbuilding steels and welded joints. A brittle crack ran along a welded joint and penetrated through the test plate under a stress exceeding 200 MPa, despite the presence of longitudinal stiffeners across the test weld. A brittle crack in a base plate model test with longitudinal stiffeners propagated through the specimen under the maximum design stress. These results suggest that EH-grade cannot ensure arrestability even in the base plate, in case of heavy thick shipbuilding steel. Two <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> tests were conducted in order to demonstrate the possibility of long <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> using high arrestability steels. The test results indicated that the <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> concept could be achieved by a combination of high arrest toughness materials and a special fabrication method which can derive a brittle crack into the base plate of high arrestability plate. The <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> design can be used in practice even for large-scale structures using heavy thick steel plates. The effective K concept, as proposed by Machida, et al. 31), provides the boundary of the “arrest” and “propagate” data in the large-scale tests conducted in this work. The effective K concept was found to be valid even for long crack propagation of such a heavy thick steel plate as investigated in this paper.
