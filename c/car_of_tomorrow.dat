5|$|There was one {{change of}} driver before the race. Jon Wood, the {{grandson}} of retired driver Glen Wood, was originally scheduled to replace 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion Bill Elliott in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing car, but withdrew {{because of a lack}} of experience with the <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tomorrow,</b> and former Haas CNC Racing driver Johnny Sauter took over his seat. Wood said he felt Sauter was a better qualifier and Elliott was not available to drive. Kahne developed a sinus infection two days before the event, and his team had Nationwide Series driver Jason Keller ready to replace him if he could not compete.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{advantage}} of running both Cup and Xfinity Series races is extra practice ("seat time") for the drivers. Xfinity races are often run as support races {{the day before}} the Sprint Cup race and use similar equipment, though Xfinity cars have less horsepower than Cup cars. Some racing experts suggested that when the Cup series transitioned to the safety-oriented <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> in 2007, the {{advantage of}} Cup drivers racing in these events would decrease greatly due to differences in the designs of the vehicles. This did not decrease the presence of Cup drivers in the series, as each Nationwide Series drivers' title from 2006 to 2010 was won by a Cup Series regular. The aerodynamic differences of the two series were greatly reduced when the Nationwide Series implemented its own <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> in 2010.|$|E

25|$|The No. 3 car was {{initially}} {{run in the}} then-Busch Series by Dale Earnhardt, Inc. beginning in 1989, winning two back-to-back championships with Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in 1998 and 1999. The No. 3 made its debut {{as part of the}} RCR stable in 2002 at the EAS/GNC Live Well 300 at Daytona, driven twice that year by Earnhardt, Jr. with sponsorships from the Nabisco brands Oreo and Nilla. Earnhardt won the Daytona race but finished 36th at the Carquest Auto Parts 300 at Charlotte after being involved in a crash. The No. 3 car returned for one race in 2010 at the Subway Jalapeño 250 at Daytona with a sponsorship from Wrangler, in a joint venture between RCR, JR Motorsports, and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. The car was once again driven by Earnhardt, Jr. with a paint scheme resembling the one used by his late father when he first drove for RCR. Earnhardt would go on to win the race, his first victory in 87 Nationwide Series starts, and the first victory in a Nationwide <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> Prior to the start, Earnhardt, Jr. claimed that it would most likely be the last time he would drive the No. 3 car.|$|E
2500|$|On March 25, 2007, {{the first}} race {{featuring}} NASCAR's new car design, the [...] "Car of Tomorrow" [...] (COT) was run at Bristol Motor Speedway. [...] Jeff Gordon {{won the first}} ever pole award in a <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tomorrow,</b> and Kyle Busch won the race, becoming the first winner in the COT.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after Earnhardt's death, NASCAR began {{developing}} the <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> (CoT), {{which was used}} in competition in the Sprint Cup Series until it {{was replaced by the}} so-called [...] "Gen 6" [...] car for the 2013 season. The design of the CoT incorporated the result of research conducted in the aftermath of Earnhardt's death. All of the safety improvements from the CoT remain in the Gen 6 design.|$|E
50|$|The 2013 {{season was}} the first season using the Generation 6 race <b>car,</b> the <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>tomorrow's</b> successor, and marked the return to the {{qualifying}} procedure that was used before the 2005 season. However, at the two road courses on the schedule drivers qualified in groups instead of single laps. In September 2012, NASCAR removed a ban introduced in the 2008 season on testing at tracks that were {{on any of the}} premier series' schedules, replacing it with a testing limit.|$|R

50|$|In {{preparation}} for the race, NASCAR held the last of its test days for Nextel Cup entrants on October 16-18 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Sessions began at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), paused from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. and concluded at 9:00 p.m. Fifty-eight <b>cars,</b> a mix <b>of</b> <b>Cars</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> and 2006 <b>cars,</b> participated in the October 16 afternoon session. Reed Sorenson was quickest with a speed of 171.652 mph, and Casey Mears had the highest speed of 173.077 mph in the evening session. During the third session (with 75 cars), Kyle Busch had the fastest speed of 175.382 mph; Gordon had the highest speed of the three days, at 175.553 mph in the fourth session. During the fifth session, {{on the afternoon of}} October 18, 23 cars were tested. Scott Wimmer had the highest speed of 172.364 mph, and Jeff Green had the highest speed of 174.639 mph in the evening session.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> {{was first}} tested in December 2005 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. [...] Next it tested at the 2.5-mile Daytona International Speedway, then on NASCAR's two {{shortest}} tracks, Bristol (0.533mi) and Martinsville (0.526mi.), the 1.5-mile Lowe's Motor Speedway, the 2.66 mile Talladega Superspeedway, and 2.0-mile Michigan International Speedway. Former NASCAR driver, current Sprint Cup pace car driver and Director of Cost Research Brett Bodine also tested the prototype car against cars prepared by current NASCAR teams.|$|E

Even then, during races with a celebrity pace car driver, Bodine rides shotgun and guides the driver through all NASCAR pace car protocols.|$|E
2500|$|The 1934 to 1936 Chrysler Imperial {{ushered in}} the 'Airflow' design, {{reflecting}} an interest in streamlining. The car was marketed with the slogan [...] "The <b>car</b> <b>of</b> <b>tomorrow</b> is here today." [...] It featured eight passenger seating and again an eight-cylinder engine. This was the first car to be designed in a wind tunnel. Initial tests indicated that the standard car of the 1920s worked best in the wind-tunnel when pointed backwards with the curved rear deck facing forward. This led to a rethinking of the fundamental design of Chrysler's line of cars. The Airflow was an exceptionally modern and advanced car, and an unparalleled engineering success. Both engine and passenger compartment were moved forward, giving better balance, ride and roadability. An early form of unibody construction was employed, making them extremely strong. This {{was one of the}} first vehicles with fender skirts.|$|E
40|$|The <b>car</b> {{occupants}} <b>of</b> <b>tomorrow</b> {{will enjoy}} a growing variety of in-vehicle services and driver assistance systems. The {{challenge is to}} make these services not only intelligent and omnipresent but, most important of all, safe to use. TNO started a research program in 2001 called CoDrive that addresses this challenge. Within CoDrive TNO developed and realised an intelligent Human Machine Interface (HMI) framework channelling the different flows of information, taking into account driver workload and attention levels. TNO developed various intelligent services too (e. g. Dynamic Travel Guidance, Friction Monitoring and Information Portal) and realised a generic development, simulation, visualisation, test and evaluation platform. The HMI framework and services are now implemented using the development platform. This paper discusses implementation issues and gives {{an overview of the}} results...|$|R
25|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{replaced the}} carburetor as the fuel distributor in the <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Tomorrow</b> starting in 2012. For 2013, NASCAR allowed manufacturers {{to design a}} brand-new body style for the COT chassis that will resemble a given production car even more. The changes were largely cosmetic, with hopes of returning mechanical grip to drivers. At the 2012 Ford Championship Weekend the body <b>of</b> the <b>car</b> made it the Gen 6 car by NASCAR. During the 2012 season, {{it was announced that}} Ford would use the Mk.V Ford Mondeo, known as the Fusion in the Americas, Toyota would continue to use the 2013 Camry, while the Holden VF Commodore, rebadged in North America as the Chevrolet Super Sport (SS), replaced the Chevrolet Impala and Dodge announced they would use the Charger. However, soon after, Dodge announced their withdrawal from the sport, after being unable to convince other teams to switch to Dodge to replace Penske Racing (which returned to Ford).|$|R
40|$|In Sweden {{close to}} 500 people are killed and several {{thousands}} severely injured in traffic each year. This {{is one of}} the largest health problems for society in both Sweden and the whole world. In the <b>cars</b> <b>of</b> <b>tomorrow</b> will the main instrument panel and the centre console be screen-based instead of the current solution with “iron instruments” and other physical devices. This future driver environment opens for a flexible and situation-dependent usage of presentation resources. The purpose of this thesis is to explore these possibilities from a warning system perspective. The project had its main focus on designing warning system concepts using the HUD and vibrotactile information in a coordinated way based on established HMI principles. Another goal for this thesis work was to generate a functional concept for demonstration and evaluation in the virtual reality lab at the University of Linköping. The method of realization was divided into three phases – information gathering, concept generation and implementation. These phases are commonly used in design projects. This way of work supplies structure to the project and makes it possible to achieve an iterative design process. The information gathering involved a thorough theoretical study of HMI, interface design and warning design. A state of the art investigation was then conducted to find out how the warning systems, relevant to this thesis, are presented today. The concept generation was divided into two parts – warning system design and visual design. The Warning system design concepts were based on different combinations from a morphologic matrix and relevant theory. Consideration was also taken to when the systems are likely to be activated and which modality, or modalities, that then was suitable to use. The visual design concepts were developed by using creative product development methods and the iterative Simulator-Based Design (SBD) theory. After concluding the concept generation was the visual design results given functionality by programming software. The visual warning system were then integrated in the simulator software and fully implemented in the simulator cockpit at the university. The implemented warning systems were then evaluated by a pilot study conducted in the simulator. Test persons were invited to the VR-lab and given an introduction to the warning systems. They were then asked to drive a predetermined route with a number of different warning system conditions. These test results were later statistically analyzed and evaluated...|$|R
2500|$|Late in the 2007 season, Richert {{was fired}} from Team Red Bull and {{replaced}} by Randy Cox, who was formerly employed on Team Red Bull's Research and Development team. Vickers struggled {{for the remainder of}} the season as Team Red Bull began to focus on developing its <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> program, which would start competing full-time the next season. The resulting inattention to its [...] "current car" [...] program severely hampered Vickers' efforts during the remaining races of that platform. It was another problem in a long line for the entire Red Bull organization, as Vickers finished thirty-eighth in points and failed to qualify for thirteen races while his teammate Allmendinger missed nineteen races and finished forty-third. One of Vickers' failures to make the race was due to a disqualification from the lineup of the 2007 Lenox Industrial Tools 301, after his car failed post-qualifying inspection three times.|$|E
2500|$|Although NASCAR {{frequently}} publicizes {{the safety}} measures it mandates for drivers, these features are often only adopted {{long after they}} were initially developed, and only {{in response to an}} injury or fatality. The impact-absorbing [...] "SAFER Barrier" [...] that is now in use had been proposed by legendary mechanic Smokey Yunick during the 1970s, but his idea had been dismissed as too expensive and unnecessary. Only after the deaths of Adam Petty, Kenny Irwin and Tony Roper in 2000, and Dale Earnhardt in 2001 did NASCAR revisit the idea of decreasing the G-forces a driver sustained during a crash. Other examples of available safety features that were slow to be implemented include the mandating of a throttle [...] "kill switch". The [...] "kill switch" [...] was mandated after the death of Adam Petty, along with the requirements of an anti-spill bladder in fuel cells. Fire-retardant driver suits were required only after the death of Glen [...] "Fireball" [...] Roberts, who died from complications of burns suffered in a crash when flames engulfed his car during a Charlotte race. Dale Earnhardt was killed after he received massive head and neck trauma from a hard crash in the 2001 Daytona 500. Earnhardt's death prompted NASCAR to require all drivers to use the [...] "HANS device" [...] (Head And Neck Support Device), a device that keeps the driver's neck from going forward in a wreck. In the mid-2000s, NASCAR redesigned the racing vehicle with safety improvements, calling it the <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> The car has a higher roof, wider cockpit, and the driver seat was located more {{toward the center of the}} vehicle.|$|E
