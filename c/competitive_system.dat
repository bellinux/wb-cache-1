2500|$|Westinghouse's {{interests}} in gas distribution and telephone switching [...] {{led him to}} become interested in the then new field of electrical power distribution in the early 1880s. Electric lighting was a growing business with many companies building outdoor direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) arc lighting based street lighting systems and Thomas Edison launching the first DC electric utility designed to light homes and businesses with his patented incandescent bulb. In 1884 he started developing his own DC domestic lighting system and hired physicist William Stanley to work on it. Westinghouse {{became aware of the}} new European alternating current systems in 1885 when he read about them in the UK technical journal Engineering. AC had the ability to be [...] "stepped up" [...] in voltage by a transformer for distribution long distances and then [...] "stepped down" [...] by a transformer for consumer use allowing large centralized power plants to supply electricity long distance in cities with more disperse populations. This was an advantage over the low voltage DC systems being marketed by Thomas Edison's electric utility which had a limited range due to the low voltages used. Westinghouse saw AC's potential to achieve greater economies of scale as way to build a truly <b>competitive</b> <b>system</b> instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents.|$|E

6000|$|As for Ruskin's ethical teaching, {{it appears}} in so many forms and in so many {{different}} works that any summary must appear inadequate.

In his economic essays Ruskin is even more directly and positively ethical. To mitigate the evils of the unreasonable <b>competitive</b> <b>system</b> under which we labor and sorrow; to bring master and man together in mutual trust and helpfulness; to seek beauty, truth, goodness as the chief ends of life, and, having found them, to make our characters correspond; to share the best treasures of art and literature with rich and poor alike; to labor always, and, whether we work with hand or head, to do our work in praise of something that we love,-- this sums up Ruskin's purpose and message.

The life of a discoverer or inventor is in itself agreeable: those who adopt it, as things are now, are seldom much actuated by economic motives, but rather by the interest of the work together with the hope of honor; and these motives would operate more widely than they do now, since fewer people would be prevented from obeying them by economic necessities.
