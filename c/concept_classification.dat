40|$|This is {{the report}} of the <b>concept</b> <b>classification</b> defined as a sematic {{information}} for Thai words. The <b>concept</b> <b>classification</b> is an complementary to the syntactic information in the disambiguation process of sentence analysis and sentence generation. We considered only the content words at this stage and divided the words into 2 groups: basic term and technical erm (the field of information processing). The classes are defined in a hierarchical manner. The upper part in the hierarchy is the super class of the lower one. The lower part in the hierarchy is the sub class of the upper one. Chapter 2 and 3 describe the nature of hierarchical structure and the relation between classes. Chapter 4 specifies the background of Thai language that is taken into consideration in the classifying process. Chapter 5 and 6 clarify the use of <b>concept</b> <b>classification</b> and their definition...|$|E
40|$|Hjorland {{contends that}} in order to further the goal of linking {{researchers}} to relevant information ‘domain analysis’ should be used in <b>concept</b> <b>classification.</b> He thinks that <b>concept</b> <b>classification</b> should not strive to classify {{on the basis of the}} properties of objects, but rather on descriptions of objects that are loosely derived from human activity and social negotiation. Currently, most information scientists operate under a ‘positivist’ view of <b>concept</b> <b>classification,</b> which, Hjorland maintains, mistakenly strives for universal classification schema while muddling the comprehension of individual researchers. Though he tends to include Wittgenstein in the positivist camp for classification, Hjorland’s domain analysis is strongly Wittgensteinian. This work seeks to support the philosophical underpinnings of domain analysis through Wittgenstein’s theory of language. Additionally, we outline Rick Szostak’s criticism of domain analysis. While he levies an important charge against Hjorland, his solution proves inadequate in light of Wittgenstein’s theory of language...|$|E
40|$|<b>Concept</b> <b>classification</b> is {{important}} to access visual information {{on the level of}} objects and scene types. So far, intensity-based features have been widely used. To increase discriminative power, color features have been proposed only recently. As many features exist, a structured overview is required of color features in the context of <b>concept</b> <b>classification.</b> Therefore, this paper studies 1. the invariance properties and 2. the distinctiveness of color features in a structured way. The invariance properties of color features with respect to photometric changes are summarized. The distinctiveness of color features is assessed experimentally using an image and a video benchmark: the PASCAL VOC Challenge 2007 and the Mediamill Challenge. Because color features cannot be studied independently from the points at which they are extracted, different point sampling strategies based on Harris-Laplace salient points, dense sampling and the spatial pyramid are also studied. From the experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects <b>concept</b> <b>classification.</b> The results reveal further that the usefulness of invariance is concept-specific...|$|E

40|$|Most dialog systems {{explicitly}} confirm user-provided task-relevant concepts. User {{responses to}} these system confirmations (e. g. corrections, topic changes) may be misrecognized because they contain unrequested task-related concepts. In this paper, we propose a concept-specific language model adaptation strategy where the language model (LM) is adapted to the concept type(s) actually present in the user’s post-confirmation utterance. We evaluate <b>concept</b> type <b>classification</b> and LM adaptation for post-confirmation utterances in the Let’s Go! dialog system.

40|$|Abstract. Bag-of-words {{representation}} {{with visual}} keypoints has recently {{emerged as an}} attractive approach for video search. In this paper, we study the degree of improvement when point-to-point (P 2 P) constraint is imposed on the bag-of-words. We conduct investigation on two tasks: near-duplicate keyframe (NDK) retrieval, and high-level <b>concept</b> <b>classification,</b> covering parts of TRECVID 2003 and 2005 datasets. In P 2 P matching, we propose a one-to-one symmetric keypoint matching strategy to diminish the noise effect during keyframe comparison. In addition, a new multi-dimensional index structure is proposed {{to speed up the}} matching process with keypoint filtering. Through experiments, we demonstrate that P 2 P constraint can significantly boost the performance of NDK retrieval, while showing competitive accuracy in <b>concept</b> <b>classification</b> of broadcast domain. ...|$|E

40|$|Speech {{understanding}} through <b>concept</b> <b>classification</b> {{offers a}} possible way of machine translation in speech-to-speech translation systems {{and can be}} used in conjunction with conventional statistical machine translation. While correct <b>concept</b> <b>classification</b> offers the promise of obtaining well-formed target language speech output, the approach does not scale well to large number of concepts. Importantly, it is also critical to know when to accept or reject the classifier. We formulate the speech classification as a MAP estimation problem to derive the understanding model and improve its performance by incorporating dialog context information. Specifically, for a twoway speech translation system, a classification scheme is derived here that utilizes context information {{from both sides of the}} conversation through an n-gram dialog model. The method was evaluated using data from an English-Farsi trans-lingual doctorpatient dialog system and its classification and rejection accuracies were compared to those of a baseline system with an understanding model only. The benefit of incorporating context with the proposed dialog model provided a modest improvement in classification accuracy (about 5 % relative error reduction) and a significant improvement in the rejection accuracy (up to 31. 4 % relative reduction in error).

40|$|As {{datasets}} grow increasingly {{large in}} content-based image and video retrieval, computational efficiency of <b>concept</b> <b>classification</b> is important. This paper reviews techniques to accelerate <b>concept</b> <b>classification,</b> where we show the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy. As a basis, {{we use the}} Bag-of-Words algorithm that in the 2008 benchmarks of TRECVID and PASCAL lead to the best performance scores. We divide the evaluation in three steps: 1) Descriptor Extraction, where we evaluate SIFT, SURF, DAISY, and Semantic Textons. 2) Visual Word Assignment, where we compare a k-means visual vocabulary with a Random Forest and evaluate subsampling, dimension reduction with PCA, and division strategies of the Spatial Pyramid. 3) Classification, where we evaluate the 2, RBF, and Fast Histogram Intersection kernel for the SVM. Apart from the evaluation, we accelerate the calculation of densely sampled SIFT and SURF, accelerate nearest neighbor assignment, and improve accuracy of the Histogram Intersection kernel. We conclude by discussing whether further acceleration of the Bag-of-Words pipeline is possible. Our results lead to a 7 -fold speed increase without accuracy loss, and a 70 -fold speed increase with 3 % accuracy loss. The latter system does classification in real-time, which opens up new applications for automatic <b>concept</b> <b>classification.</b> For example, this system permits five standard desktop PCs to automatically tag for 20 classes all images that are currently uploaded to Flickr...|$|E
40|$|Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of MIS, University of ArizonaAn {{automatic}} indexing and <b>concept</b> <b>classification</b> {{approach to a}} multilingual (Chinese and English) bibliographic database is presented. We introduced a multi-linear termphrasing technique to extract concept descriptors (terms or keywords) from a Chinese-English bibliographic database. A concept space of related descriptors was then generated using a co-occurrence analysis technique. Like a man-made thesaurus, the system-generated concept space {{can be used to}} generate additional semantically-relevant terms for search. For <b>concept</b> <b>classification</b> and clustering, a variant of a Hopfield neural network was developed to cluster similar concept descriptors and to generate a small number of concept groups to represent (summarize) {{the subject matter of the}} database. The concept space approach to information classification and retrieval has been adopted by the aupors in other scientific databases and business applications, but multilingual information retrieval presents a unique challenge. This research reports our experiment on multilingual databases. Our system was initially developed in the MS-DOS environment, running ETEN Chinese operating system. For performance reasons, it was then tested on a UNIX-based system. Due to the unique ideographic nature of the Chinese language, a Chinese term-phrase indexing paradigm considering the ideographic characteristics of Chinese was developed as a multilingual information classification model.

A novel representation, the Audio-Visual Grouplet (AVG), {{is extracted}} {{by studying the}} statistical temporal audio-visual interactions. An AVG {{is defined as a}} set of audio and visual codewords that are grouped together according to their strong temporal correlations in videos. The AVGs carry unique audio-visual cues to represent the video content, based on which an audiovisual dictionary can be constructed for <b>concept</b> <b>classification.</b> By using the entire AVGs as building elements, the audio-visual dictionary is much more robust than traditional vocabularies that use discrete audio or visual codewords. Specifically, we conduct coarse-level foreground/background separation in both audio and visual channels, and discover four types of AVGs by exploring mixed-and-matched temporal audio-visual correlations among the following factors: visual foreground, visual background, audio foreground, and audio background. All of these types of AVGs provide discriminative audio-visual patterns for classifying various semantic concepts. We extensively evaluate our method over the large-scale Columbia Consumer Video set.
