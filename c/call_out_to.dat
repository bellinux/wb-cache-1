The direction and field of vision of enemies is shown on the radar.|$|E
25|$|The Scythians {{are thought}} to have been the first people to geld their horses. They valued geldings as war horses because they were quiet, lacked mating urges, were less prone to <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> other horses, were easier to keep in groups, and were less likely to fight with one another.|$|E

25|$|Maudgalyāyana eased his mother's {{suffering}} by {{receiving the}} instructions of feeding pretas from the Buddha. The Buddha instructed Maudgalyāyana to place pieces of food {{on a clean}} plate, reciting a mantra seven times to bless the food, snap his fingers to <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the deceased and finally tip the food onto clean ground. By doing so, the preta's hunger would be relieved. Through these merits, his mother {{was able to be}} reborn as a dog under the care of a noble family.|$|E
25|$|Huang Gai {{was hit by}} a stray arrow {{during the}} battle and fell into the river. He was saved by Sun Quan's men but they were not aware of his identity, so they left him lying on a stretcher. When Han Dang passed by, Huang Gai managed to <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> him.

500|$|In {{the closing}} credits, the Sanskrit words [...] "Shantih Shantih Shantih" [...] appear as end titles. Writer and film critic Laura Eldred of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill observes that Children of Men is [...] "full of tidbits that <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the educated viewer". During {{a visit to}} his house by Theo and Kee, Jasper says [...] "Shanti, shanti, shanti." [...] Eldred notes that the [...] "shanti" [...] used in the film is also found {{at the end of}} an Upanishad and in the final line of [...] T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land, a work Eldred {{describes}} as [...] "devoted to contemplating a world emptied of fertility: a world on its last, teetering legs". [...] "Shanti" [...] is also a common beginning and ending to all Hindu prayers, and means [...] "peace," [...] referencing the invocation of divine intervention and rebirth through an end to violence.|$|E
500|$|Winning the Boston Acoustic Underground Award in 1991 [...] {{resulted}} in Paul {{playing to the}} largest crowd of his career to that point – 300. [...] He continued to play {{in and around the}} New England area. [...] Around this time, Windham Hill Records, which had previously released the [...] songwriter compilation, put a <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the music industry asking for songwriter submissions to be considered for the follow-up [...] compilation. [...] After the Old Vienna Kaffeehouse sent one of Paul's tapes to Windham Hill, Paul's [...] "Ashes to Dust" [...] from Urban Folksongs was chosen to be on the compilation. [...] In the interview with Wood, Paul stated that he felt very excited to be on the Windham Hill release because it served as a calling card that every DJ and folk promoter in the country would recognize. Legacy II was released in 1992 and included songs performed by Patty Larkin, Patty Griffin, Greg Brown, Cheryl Wheeler and several others. [...] Legacy II was Paul's first national exposure.|$|E
500|$|Ariel first {{appears in}} the sixth episode of season three, [...] "Ariel". In the Enchanted Forest flashbacks of the episode, Ariel meets Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) by saving her from drowning. Snow and Ariel become friends, during which Snow advises Ariel to pursue her love {{interest}} Prince Eric (Gil McKinney), whom she'd rescued from drowning earlier. Ursula, the sea goddess, has given merfolk the ability to gain legs once a year; Ariel uses this gift to turn human and attend Prince Eric's ball with Snow. At the ball, Ariel and Eric dance, with Eric commenting that Ariel seems familiar to him. Eric invites Ariel to join him on an expedition {{around the world that}} is leaving the following morning. As Ariel contemplates her dilemma she is approached by the Evil Queen Regina (Lana Parrilla), who has disguised herself as Ursula and pretends to want to help her. Regina's true agenda is to capture Snow, but Ariel thwarts Regina's plan and manages to escape with Snow. As an act of revenge, Regina takes Ariel's voice so she cannot <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Eric before he leaves on his voyage.|$|E

500|$|Starting on the {{electric}} piano, Charles played what felt right: {{a series of}} riffs, switching then to a regular piano for four choruses backed up by a unique Latin conga tumbao rhythm on drums. The song changed when Charles began singing simple, improvised unconnected verses ("Hey Mama don't you treat me wrong / Come and love your daddy all night long / All right now / Hey hey / All right"). Charles used gospel elements in a twelve-bar blues structure. Some of the first lines ("See the gal with the red dress on / She can do the Birdland all night long") are influenced by a boogie-woogie style that Ahmet Ertegun attributes to Clarence [...] "Pinetop" [...] Smith who used to <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dancers {{on the dance floor}} instructing what to do through his lyrics. In the middle of the song, however, Charles indicated that the Raelettes should repeat what he was doing, and the song transformed into a call and response between Charles, the Raelettes, and the horn section in the orchestra as they called out to each other in ecstatic shouts and moans and blasts from the horns.|$|E
500|$|... "Call My Name" [...] is a {{song that}} lasts for four minutes and two seconds. It was {{composed}} using common time in the key of E major, with [...] "driving rock" [...] tempo of 78 beats per minute. Mac Powell's vocal range spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The lyrics to the song {{have been described as}} being from the perspective of God, although the members of Third Day have described them differently; David Carr, the drummer for Third Day, described the lyrics as [...] "crying out to God and calling out his name", while Mac Powell described them as [...] "kind of a prayer. It's about when people are going through hard times and going through struggles that we've gotta <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> someone, and for us as people of faith it's calling out to God and hearing his voice... and for someone else it could be a friend or a family member that you've gotta reach out to kind of help share those burdens you go through". Carr also described the drum part on [...] "Call My Name" [...] as [...] "basic", and the song itself has been described as [...] "pop rock", [...] "AC-friendly", and [...] "pop".|$|E
500|$|Jassin {{writes that}} Amir's poems were also {{influenced}} by his love for one or more women, in Buah Rindu referred to as [...] "Tedja" [...] and [...] "Sendari-Dewi"; he opines that the woman or women are never named as Amir's love for them is the key. Husny writes that at least nine of the works in Buah Rindu were inspired by his longing for Aja Bun, portraying a sense of disappointment after their engagement was called off. Regarding the book's three-part dedication, [...] "to the mournful Greater Indonesia / to {{the ashes of the}} Mother-Queen / and to the feet of the Sendari-Goddess", Mihardja writes that Sundari was immediately recognisable to any of Amir's classmates; he considers her the poet's inspiration as [...] "Laura to Petrarch, Mathilde to Jacques Perk". The critic Zuber Usman finds Sundari's influence on Nyanyi Sunyi as well, suggesting his parting from her led Amir closer to God, an opinion Dini echoes. The translator Burton Raffel connects a couplet {{at the end of the}} book, reading [...] "" [...] ("A flower floating in a loose knot of hair / Gave birth to my sorrowful poems") as a <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a forbidden love. Dini credits Amir's love for Sundari for his frequent use of Javanese terms in his writing.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his {{opposition}} to idolatry, his father Azar would still send Ibrahim to sell his idols in the marketplace. Once there, Ibraham would <b>call</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> passersby, [...] "Who will buy my idols? They will not help you and they cannot hurt you! Who will buy my idols?" [...] Then Ibrahim would mock the idols. He would {{take them to the}} river, push their faces into the water and command them, [...] "Drink! Drink!" [...] Once again, Ibrahim asked his father, [...] "How can you worship what does not see or hear or do you any good?" [...] Azar replied, [...] "Dare you deny the gods of our people?

On October 5, 2011 the CRTC released their findings that included consultations with stakeholders from the telecommunications industry, media producers, and cultural leaders among others. [...] The evidence was inconclusive, suggesting that an increased availability of OTT options is not having a negative impact on the availability or diversity of Canadian content, one of the key policy mandates of the CRTC, nor are there signs {{that there has been a}} significant decline of televisions subscriptions through cable or satellite. [...] However, given the rapid progress in the industry they are working on a more in depth study to be concluded in May 2012.|$|E
