40|$|The {{cumulative}} fatigue {{behavior of}} a cobalt-base superalloy, Haynes 188 was investigated at 760 C in air. Initially strain-controlled tests were conducted on solid <b>cylindrical</b> <b>gauge</b> section specimens of Haynes 188 under fully-reversed, tensile and compressive mean strain-controlled fatigue tests. Fatigue data from these tests were used to establish the baseline fatigue behavior of the alloy with 1) a total strain range type fatigue life relation and 2) the Smith-Wastson-Topper (SWT) parameter. Subsequently, two load-level multi-block fatigue tests were conducted on similar specimens of Haynes 188 at the same temperature. Fatigue lives of the multi-block tests were estimated with 1) the Linear Damage Rule (LDR) and 2) the nonlinear Damage Curve Approach (DCA) both with and without the consideration of mean stresses generated during the cumulative fatigue tests. Fatigue life predictions by the nonlinear DCA were {{much closer to the}} experimentally observed lives than those obtained by the LDR. In the presence of mean stresses, the SWT parameter estimated the fatigue lives more accurately under tensile conditions than under compressive conditions...|$|E
30|$|The ambient airflow {{was driven}} to the test section by a {{centrifugal}} fan. The rotations per minute of the wind tunnel fan and the air speed were controlled by an inverter which provided frequency control with different accuracies: 0.01 and 0.1 Hz. The velocity of the cross flow of air was measured by a pitot-static tube. For measuring the bulk temperatures at inlet and outlet of the tube, two T type thermocouples with accuracy of 0.1 °C were calibrated and inserted into the flow. To prevent the heat transfer between the tube and the outer environment, the steel tube outside of the test section was completely isolated with glass wool. Also, other T type thermocouples were inserted in the reservoir and test section, which controlled {{the performance of the}} heaters and measured the air temperature at the inlet and outlet of the test section. The flow measuring system was a calibrated orifice which was connected to a manometer. The rate of flow which passed through the orifice was calibrated by the orifice equation presented in ASME MFC- 14 M- 2001. For calibrating the orifice, the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>gauge</b> was used and the orifice calibrated with 2 % error. A flow bypass line was used to adjust the flow rate through the test section.|$|E
40|$|KEY COMPARISON At its {{meeting in}} October 2003, the EUROMET (now EURAMET) Technical Committee for Length, TC-L, decided upon a key {{comparison}} on diameter standards. Due {{to the large}} number of participants, it was decided to have two groups arranged according to the claimed uncertainties. Eleven laboratories from EURAMET and two laboratories from other RMOs participated in the group 1. The circulation of the gauges started in June 2005. The comparison was registered as EUROMET project 812. The final report for the group 1 describes the results of measurements of five diameter standards (one sphere, two rings and two plugs). A third plug was added for optional measurements. The main measurand was the diameter of each gauge at 20 ºC and corrected to zero force. The diameter was measured at three heights of each <b>cylindrical</b> <b>gauge.</b> As requested by the protocol, laboratories also provided the departure from roundness of the sphere. Participants were invited also to report the roundness and the straightness of the cylindrical gauges. The reference values were calculated from the weighted mean of the larger consistent subset of results according to the Birge ratio criteria. In general, the overall agreement was good, with some larger spread of results for the plugs...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results of fog water {{collection}} obtained with <b>cylindrical</b> fog <b>gauges</b> at three locations on the northern side of Tenerife island (Spain) : La Esperanza (1093 m a. s. l.), Taborno (1015 m a. s. l.), and El Gaitero (1747 m a. s. l.). Concomitant meteorological variables were also measured. We show that fog precipitation was more frequent than rainfall. However, the volumes and frequency of daily fog water collection varied among the three studied sites, usually not exceeding 10 – 40 L d− 1 /m 2 of collecting surface. In La Esperanza, fog water harvesting occurred frequently, but was considerably lower than {{in the other two}} locations. However, while in Taborno fog water collection episodes were distributed throughout the period, in El Gaitero these were mainly concentrated in two periods, during autumn and winter 2012 – 2013. The study of the relationships between daily fog water yields and the averages of meteorological variables did not show any clear trend, but it suggested that the greater volumes of collected fog water were logically associated with higher wind speeds and lower solar radiation conditions. Fog water collection in La Esperanza and in Taborno typically occurred within a similar temperature interval (7. 5 – 12. 5 °C), while in El Gaitero the phenomenon was associated with a lower temperature range (2. 5 – 10 °C) ...|$|R
40|$|Understanding of the 'typical' {{amounts of}} fog intercepted by {{different}} types of cloud forests is hampered {{by a lack of}} comparative information on local fog climatology. Usually some kind of 'fog gauge' is used to characterize fog occurrence and amounts. Moreover, wind-driven fog and precipitation are difficult to measure separately and reported measurements of 'fog' often represent a combination of the two. In this paper, the term 'occult precipitation' (HP) is used to represent fog in combination with the horizontal component of wind-driven precipitation (WDR). Collection efficiencies of three widely used types of passive fog gauges, viz. a wire harp (WH) screen, a modified <b>cylindrical</b> <b>gauge</b> (MJU, Juvik-type) and a tunnel gauge (TTG, Daube-type), were derived by comparing the volumes of water collected by the respective gauges with horizontal cloud water fluxes (CWFs) derived from wind speed (u) and the fog liquid water content (LWC) as measured by a cloud particle spectrometer during conditions of fog at a windward cloud forest site in northern Costa Rica. Under conditions of fog-only, the collection efficiencies of the three gauges were linearly related to the horizontal CWF as measured by the gauges themselves. Therefore, additional information on wind speed, droplet size and fog LWC was not needed. During conditions of HP, relative collection efficiencies were derived by comparing the volumes collected by the respective gauge types. The modified Juvik gauge had an efficiency close to 100 %, independently of the wind speed and direction, whereas the efficiency of the WH depended critically on the wind speed. The tunnel gauge had an efficiency comparable to that of the Juvik gauge, with some additional catch occurring under conditions of low precipitation angles due to the reclined frontal surface of the gauge.

40|$|In {{the present}} work the LCF (Low Cycle Fatigue) crack {{initiation}} {{life of the}} conventionally cast Ni-base alloy RENE 80 was analyzed {{as a function of}} specimen size and grain orientation. Five specimen geometries with distinctly different gauge sections were used: 3 geometries with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>gauge</b> section (G 1 -G 3) and two notched geometries with a stress concentration factor of alpha 1 = 1, 62 (KG 1) and alpha 2 = 2, 60 (KG 2), resulting in a maximum difference of the damage relevant surface area up to a factor of approximately 72. Correction factors were determined by FEM calculations for all specimen geometries with highly reduced gauge sections where direct strain measurement was not possible. Additionally a uniform failure criterion with a relatively small crack size of 0, 962 mm 2 was defined. Totally, 116 isothermal LCF tests were carried out at the different specimen types at a temperature of 850 °C in total strain control with a load ratio (minimum strain/maximum strain) of Re = - 1. The load cycles were applied with triangular waveform at a frequency of 0. 1 Hz for high strain amplitudes and 1 Hz for low strain amplitudes, respectively. After the LCF-Tests the fracture surfaces of all samples were analyzed in more detail by SEM to identify the crack initiation mechanisms as well as the crack initiation sites. In this context it could be shown, that fatigue cracks were generally initiated at slip bands in surface grains. Accordingly, the grain orientations at the crack initiation sites were measured by electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) and the maximum shear stresses in the respective principal slip system (111) was calculated using the Schmid approach. For this, longitudinal sections were be prepared exactly at the crack initiation sites of samples loaded with low strain amplitudes where clearly defined single crack initiation sites were observed. Afterwards the maximum shear stress in the principal slip system at the crack initiation site was correlated to the lifetime behavior, resulting in a distinct decrease of scatter and size influence compared to the conventional representation total strain vs. cycles to failure...|$|E
