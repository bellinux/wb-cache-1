As mitochondria play a key role during apoptosis, we investigated mitochondria as a potential target for C 5 a. Using PC 12 cells, we demonstrated that exposure to C 5 a led to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase activities. Interestingly, an increase in expression of the mitochondrial stress protein chaperonin 60 was also observed, confirming a marked effect of C 5 a on mitochondrial functions.

While initially {{described as a}} regulator of complement activity, it later became a ‘magnet for pathogens’, binding to several viruses and bacteria. More recently, an alternative role for such <b>complement</b> <b>molecules</b> has emerged: they do regulate T-cell immunity, affecting T-cell proliferation and differentiation. In particular, CD 46 stimulation induces Tr 1 cells, regulatory T cells characterized by massive production of interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine. Hence, CD 46 is likely to control inflammation. Indeed, data from CD 46 transgenic mice highlight a role for CD 46 in inflammation, with antagonist roles depending on the cytoplasmic tail being expressed. Furthermore, recent data have shown that CD 46 is defective in multiple sclerosis, IL- 10 production being severely impaired in these patients. This lack of IL- 10 production probably participates in the inflammation observed in patients with multiple sclerosis. This review will summarize the data on CD 46 and T cells, and how CD 46 is likely involved in multiple sclerosis...|$|R

Excitotoxicity, triggered by excessive activation of glutamate receptors, has been implicated in neuronal death following diverse insults, including ischemia and seizures. Clinical studies suggested that a minimal excitotoxic insult might sensitize neurons to complement attack. We found that fleeting activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors sensitizes neurons but not astrocytes to complement attack. The <b>complement</b> <b>molecule</b> effecting cytotoxicity was the membrane attack complex. The site within the complement cascade at which sensitization was effected was the membrane attack pathway.

5|$|In humans, this {{response}} is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response {{is a result of}} signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of <b>complement</b> <b>molecules,</b> which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|R
50|$|The {{complement}} {{system is a}} part of the innate immune response. C3b, C4b, and C1q are important <b>complement</b> <b>molecules</b> that serve as opsonins. As a part of the alternative complement pathway, the spontaneous activation of a complement cascade converts C3 to C3b, a component that can serve as an opsonin when bound to an antigen's surface. Antibodies can also activate complement via the classical pathway, resulting in deposition of C3b and C4b onto the antigen surface. After C3b has bound to the surface of an antigen, it can be recognized by phagocyte receptors that signal for phagocytosis. Complement receptor 1 is expressed on all phagocytes and recognizes a number of complement opsonins, including C3b and C4b which are both parts of C3-convertase. C1q, a member of the C1 complex, is able to interact with the Fc region of antibodies.|$|R

This study analyzed whether significant changes occur in the levels of a terminal panel of complement molecules (C 3 a, C 5 a, and C 5 b- 9 /membrane attack complex) during the early phase of human kidney allograft reperfusion and evaluated the potential association of these changes with clinical post-transplant graft function in kidney transplant recipients. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Seventy-five renal transplant recipients undergoing transplanta-tion between 2004 and 2006 were enrolled in the study and divided into early, slow, and delayed graft function groups. Blood samples were collected perioperatively during consecutive minutes of allograft reperfusion from the renal vein. Levels of complement molecules were measured using ELISA. Results Analysis revealed no significant changes in C 3 a and C 5 a levels throughout reperfusion. The main <b>complement</b> <b>molecule</b> that was significantly associated with post-transplant graft function was C 5 b- 9 /membrane attack complex; throughout the reperfusion period, perioperative levels of C 5 b- 9 /membrane attack complex were around two to three times higher in delayed graft function patients than early and slow graft function individuals (P, 0. 005). In addition, C 5 b- 9 /membrane attack complex levels had a relatively high clinical sensitivity and specificity (70 %– 87. 5 %) for the prediction of early and long-term (1 year) post-transplant allograft function. Conclusions This clinical study supports a role for the complement cascade in delayed graft function development. However, additional studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. In addition, perioperative measurements of C 5 b- 9 /membrane attack complex are highlighted as promising potential clinical markers of post-transplant renal allograft function...|$|E

40|$|Complement is a {{critical}} system of enzymes, regulatory proteins and receptors that regulates both innate and adaptive immune responses.

While anaphylatoxins C 3 a and C 5 a trigger inflammasome activation, opsonins such as C 1 q and related molecules (MBL and adiponectin) downregulate inflammasome activation and inflammation, and upregulate engulfment of apoptotic cells consistent with a pro-resolving or M 2 macrophage phenotype.

40|$|Mouse B {{lymphocytes}} can bind soluble immune complexes {{by means}} of two operationally distinct membrane receptors, one specific for the Fc portion of the antibody molecules aggregated by the antigen (1, 2), and the other specific for <b>complement</b> <b>molecules,</b> presumably C 3 -derived (3). Membrane receptors with similar properties have been found on macrophages, granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets (4 - 7). There is suggestive evidence that these receptors for complement and immunoglobulin play a primary role in the initiation of phagocytosis (8 - 13) and, in some circumstances, in the triggering of the release of vasoactive amines from platelets (14, 15) and of lysozomal enzymes from granulocytes (16, 17). The functions of the receptors on lymphocytes are less clear. The receptors may promote the follicular localization of antigen in lymphoid organs (18, 19), be instrumental in the induction of the cytotoxicity of B lymphocytes for antibody-coated target cells (20 - 22), or perhaps, as recently proposed, {{play a role in}} the initiation of the immune response (23). 1 Soluble immune complexes, prepared with ~ 25 I-labeled bovine serum albumi...|$|R

Results indicated that this removal of Fab arms is probably a random process. As the average number of Fab arms per molecule was decreased the ability to agglutinate Salmonella oranienburg (mt-H) gradually diminished. Complement fixation by the complexes however, decreased rapidly, and became negligible when the average number of Fab arms was four. This was confirmed by using a preparation containing mainly molecules with three or four Fab arms. The overall results showed that molecules with three or four Fab arms can agglutinate Salmonella but that these complexes do not fix <b>complement.</b> <b>Molecules</b> with five arms probably behave like those with four.

In the present study we employ zebrafish as a model to characterise the expression pattern and role of a novel NF-jB regulator, termed Cactin, in early development. Cactin was first characterised in Drosophila as a new member of the Rel pathway that could affect the generation of dorsal–ventral polarity. To explore the potential developmental role of Cactin in zebrafish, we initially investigated its expression pattern and functional role during early embryonic developmental stages. We detect Cactin expression at all stages of early development and knockdown of Cactin by specific morpholino antisense oligonucleotides causes developmental abnormalities manifested by an overall dysmorphic cellular organisation.

The serum protein has previously been described as having structural features that are immunoglobulin-like. Amino acid sequence obtained from the 77 -kDa H 1 heavy chain facilitated the isolation of a genomic clone containing at least two coding regions. Through use of primers derived from the genomic sequences, a 231 -base-pair cDNA fragment was obtained by PCR from liver RNA.

Observation of structural and functional similarities associated with the sequence similarity indicate that these molecules share an evolutionary relationship: the polypeptide chain structure of hagfish complement-like protein (CLP) resembles that of C 4; CLP contains a hidden thioester group on the 70 -kDa chain; CLP binds to streptococcal cells and enhances the phagocytosis of yeast by hagfish leukocytes.

Inhibition of single downstream proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6, have failed in clinical sepsis trials, which might not be unexpected, given the substantial amounts of mediators involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. Instead, we have put forward a hypothesis of inhibition at the recognition phase by “dual blockade” of bottleneck <b>molecules</b> of <b>complement</b> and TLRs. By acting upstream and broadly, the dual blockade could be beneficial in conditions with improper or uncontrolled innate immune activation threatening the host. Key bottleneck molecules in these systems that could be targets for inhibition are the central <b>complement</b> <b>molecules</b> C 3 and C 5 and the important CD 14 molecule, which is a coreceptor for several TLRs, including TLR 4 and TLR 2. This review summarizes current knowledge of inhibition of complement and TLRs alone and in combination, in both sterile and nonsterile inflammatory processes, where activation of these systems is of crucial importance for tissue damage and disease.

To investigate the structural requirements for CD 4 binding in each molecule we have constructed a number of hybrid glycoproteins in which sequences are exchanged between the two molecules via conserved residues and subsequently tested {{for their ability to}} bind to CD 4. We found that two constructs in which the V 1 /V 2 or V 3 loops of gpl 05 are exchanged for those of gpl 20 continue to bind to CD 4.

Pathogenic Leptospira {{have the ability to}} escape the human Complement System, being able to survive when in contact with normal human serum. In a previous study, our group demonstrated that supernatants of pathogenic Leptospira (SPL) inhibit the three activation pathways of the Complement System. This inhibition can be directly correlated with the activity of secreted proteases, which cleave the <b>Complement</b> <b>molecules</b> C 3, Factor B (Alternative Pathway), C 4 and C 2 (Classical and Lectin Pathways). In this work, we analyze the activity of the leptospiral proteases on the components of Terminal Pathway of Complement, called the membrane attack complex (MAC). We observed that proteases present in SPL from different Leptospira strains were able to cleave the purified proteins C 5, C 6, C 7, C 8, and C 9, while culture supernatant from non-pathogenic Leptospira strains (SNPL) had no significant proteolytic activity on these substrates. The cleavages occurred in a time-dependent and specificity manner. No cleavage was observed when we used whole serum as a source of C 5 –C 9 proteins, probably because of the abundant presence of plasma protease inhibitors such as α 2 -macroglobulin. Complement protein cleavage by SPL was inhibited by 1, 10 -phenanthroline, indicating the involvement of metalloproteases. Furthermore, 1, 10 -phenanthroline- treated normal human serum diminished pathogenic leptospira survival. We also analyzed the proteolytic activity of thermolysin (LIC 13322) a metalloprotease expressed exclusively by pathogenic Leptospira strains. Recombinant thermolysin was capable of cleaving the component C 6, either purified or as part of the SC 5 b- 9 complex. Furthermore, we found that the MAC proteins C 6 –C 9 interact with thermolysin, indicating that this metalloprotease may have an additional inhibitory effect on these molecules by direct interactions. Finally, a functional assay demonstrated that thermolysin was able to inhibit MAC-dependent erythrocytes lysis. We conclude that proteases secreted exclusively by pathogenic Leptospira strains are capable of degrading several <b>Complement</b> effector <b>molecules,</b> representing potential targets for the development of new therapies and prophylactic approaches in leptospirosis...|$|R
40|$|The human {{complement}} system {{plays an important}} role in the defense against invading pathogens, inflammation and homeostasis. Invading microbes, such as bacteria, directly activate the {{complement system}} resulting in the formation of chemoattractants and in effective labeling of the bacteria for phagocytosis. In addition, formation of the membrane attack complex is responsible for direct killing of Gram-negative bacteria. In turn, bacteria have evolved several ways to evade complement activation on their surface in order to be able to colonize and invade the human host. One important mechanism of bacterial escape is attraction of complement regulatory proteins to the microbial surface. These molecules are present in the human body for tight regulation of the complement system to prevent damage to host self-surfaces. Therefore, recruitment of complement regulatory proteins to the bacterial surface results in decreased complement activation on the microbial surface which favors bacterial survival. This review will discuss recent advances in understanding the binding of complement regulatory proteins to the bacterial surface at the molecular level. This includes, new insights that have become available concerning specific conserved motives on complement regulatory proteins that are favorable for microbial binding. Finally, <b>complement</b> evasion <b>molecules</b> are of high importance for vaccine development due to their dominant role in bacterial survival, high immunogenicity and homology as well as their presence on the bacterial surface.

Until 1884, it was generally believed that the {{complement system}} was an unique feature of vertebrates since all attempts to identify complement components in invertebrates failed.

Genome analyses carried out in the solitary ascidian Ciona intestinalis revealed that most complement gene families are present in urochordates. We recently carried out the assembling of EST collections from the colonial ascidian B. schlosseri, obtained in our and other laboratories: we found multiple transcripts showing high similarity with vertebrate complement components such as C 3, MASP, MBL and C 6. Preliminary in silico studies revealed close relationships between Botryllus C 3, MASP and MBL and orthologues from other chordates.

Future studies will be devoted to the analysis of the expression of genes for complement components of B. schlosseri...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Serum {{proteins}} {{carry out}} several {{functions in the}} circulation, including transfer, immunological functions, messenger functions, coagulation, and regulation of homeostasis. To investigate changes in serum proteins that occur during development, the serum proteomes of embryonic 15. 5 (E 15. 5) fetuses and newborn rats were compared using LC-MS/MS. Results A total of 958 proteins were identified in the serum of rats at both developmental stages. The serum proteome pattern of newborn rats was compared to E 15. 5 fetuses by relative quantitation. The expression patterns of hemoglobin subunits were different at the two stages, {{with most of the}} subunits having decreased expression in newborn rats compared to E 15. 5 fetuses. In addition, 8 of 12 apolipoproteins were significantly decreased and 10 of 11 identified <b>complement</b> <b>molecules</b> were increased, with 4 exhibiting a significant increase. Moreover, 11 of 14 of the significantly increased enzyme regulators were inhibitors. The serum proteome patterns of different littermates from both developmental stages were also compared. We found that the levels of many highly abundant serum proteins varied between littermates, and the variations were larger than the variations of the technical control. Conclusions The serum proteomes of newborn rats and E 15. 5 fetuses were compared. The expression patterns of hemoglobin subunits were different at the two developmental stages, with most of the subunits having decreased expression. The majority of apolipoproteins had significantly decreased expression, while almost all identified complement proteins had increased expression. The levels of several highly abundant serum proteins also varied among littermates at these two developmental stages. This is the first study using LC-MS/MS to investigate serum proteome development. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Complement</b> {{regulatory}} <b>molecules,</b> membrane cofactor protein (MCP), decay accelerating factor (DAF) and CD 59, protect body {{cells from}} autologous complement. They have wide tissue distribution {{but nothing is}} known about the expression of these molecules on human melanocytes. Since melanocytes are lysed in the lesional skin of patients with a depigmentary disorder vitiligo, it is important to compare the protection offered by <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>molecules</b> to melanocytes present in normal and vitiligo epidermis, against autologous complement. From this point of view, we investigated the differential expression of MCP, DAF and CD 59 on normal cultured human melanocytes and assessed their individual contribution in the protection of these cells against complement-mediated damage. Flow cytometric analysis showed that MCP and DAF but not CD 59 were expressed on cultured melanocytes. When heat inactivated sera of patients with vitiligo were used as a source of anti-melanocyte antibody to sensitize melanocytes, and guinea pig serum (GpS) or normal human serum (NHS) as a source of complement, GpS was found to be more effective in causing the lysis of melanocytes than NHS. When melanocytes were sensitized with autoantibody as well as F(ab') 2 fragment of either anti-MCP or anti-DAF and subsequently incubated with NHS or GpS, both antibody fragments increased the killing of melanocytes by NHS as well as by GpS. F(ab') 2 fragment of anti-DAF was much more effective in causing enhancement of lysis than that of anti-MCP. Thus, cultured normal human melanocytes express functionally active MCP and DAF but not CD 59. Contribution of DAF in protecting melanocytes against complement attack was much more than that of MC...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether cell-derived microparticles {{play a role}} in complement activation in pericardial blood of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and whether microparticles in pericardial blood contribute to systemic complement activation upon retransfusion. Pericardial blood of 13 patients was retransfused in 9 and discarded in 4 cases. Microparticles were isolated from systemic blood collected before anesthesia (T 1) {{and at the end of}} CPB (T 2), and from pericardial blood. The microparticles were analyzed by flow cytometry for bound complement components C 1 q, C 4 and C 3, and bound <b>complement</b> activator <b>molecules</b> C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid P-component (SAP), immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG. Fluid-phase complement activation products (C 4 b/c, C 3 b/c) and activator molecules were determined by ELISA. Compared with systemic T 1 blood, pericardial blood contained increased C 4 b/c and C 3 b/c, and increased levels of microparticles with bound complement components. In systemic T 1 samples, microparticle-bound CRP, whereas in pericardial blood, microparticle-bound SAP and IgM were associated with complement activation. At the end of CPB, increased C 3 b/c (but not C 4 b/c) was present in systemic T 2 blood compared with T 1, while concentrations of microparticles binding complement components and of those binding <b>complement</b> activator <b>molecules</b> were similar. Concentrations of fluid-phase complement activation products and microparticles were similar in patients whether or not retransfused with pericardial blood. In pericardial blood of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, microparticles contribute to activation of the complement system via bound SAP and IgM. Retransfusion of pericardial blood, however, does not contribute to systemic complement activatio...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that complement {{may play a}} role in bone development. Our previous studies demonstrated that the key complement receptor C 5 aR was strongly expressed in the fracture callus not only by immune cells but also by bone cells and chondroblasts, indicating a function in bone repair. To further elucidate the role of complement in bone healing, this study investigated fracture healing in mice in the absence of the key <b>complement</b> <b>molecules</b> C 3 and C 5. C 3 (-/-) and C 5 (-/-) as well as the corresponding wildtype mice received a standardized femur osteotomy, which was stabilized using an external fixator. Fracture healing was investigated after 7 and 21 days using histological, micro-computed tomography and biomechanical measurements. In the early phase of fracture healing, reduced callus area (C 3 (-/-) : - 25 %, p= 0. 02; C 5 (-/-) : - 20 % p= 0. 052) and newly formed bone (C 3 (-/-) : - 38 %, p= 0. 01; C 5 (-/-) : - 52 %, p= 0. 009) was found in both C 3 - and C 5 -deficient mice. After 21 days, healing was successful in the absence of C 3, whereas in C 5 -deficient mice fracture repair was significantly reduced, which was confirmed by a reduced bending stiffness (- 45 %; p= 0. 029) and a smaller callus volume (- 17 %; p= 0. 039). We further demonstrated that C 5 a was activated in C 3 (-/-) mice, suggesting cleavage via extrinsic pathways. Our results suggest that the activation of the terminal complement cascade in particular may be crucial for successful fracture healing...|$|R
