40|$|The {{focus of}} this report is the {{coupling}} of conductive heat transfer and boiling convective heat transfer, with boiling flow in a rock fracture. A series of experiments observed differences in boiling regimes and behavior, and attempted to quantify a <b>boiling</b> <b>convection</b> coefficient. The experimental study involved boiling radial flow in a simulated fracture, bounded {{by a variety of}} materials. Nonporous and impermeable aluminum, highly porous and permeable Berea sandstone, and minimally porous and permeable graywacke from The Geysers geothermal field. On nonporous surfaces, the heat flux was not strongly coupled to injection rate into the fracture. However, for porous surfaces, heat flux, and associated values of excess temperature and a <b>boiling</b> <b>convection</b> coefficient exhibited variation with injection rate. Nucleation was shown to occur not upon the visible surface of porous materials, but a distance below the surface, within the matrix. The depth of boiling was a function of injection rate, thermal power supplied to the fracture, and the porosity and permeability of the rock. Although matrix boiling beyond fracture wall may apply only to a finite radius around the point of injection, higher values of heat flux and a <b>boiling</b> <b>convection</b> coefficient may be realized with boiling in a porous, rather than nonporous surface bounded fracture...|$|R

The parametric trend of the CHF data was well consistent with previous understanding in water. The comparison between the present results with effect of the flow obstacle enhancing CHF and water data in similar geometry shows R- 134 a can be a modeling fluid for simulating water CHF in high pressure and high temperature condition even for annular geometry.

The experiments demonstrate that if buoyancy is significant reative to bulk liquid momentum, then {{a decrease in the}} buoyant force normal and away from the heater surface enhances the heat transfer, with the effect being most prominent at low values of heat flux.

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} for an investigation of free <b>convection</b> film <b>boiling</b> heat transfer to saturated ethanol, saturated Freon 113, and saturated distilled water from a vertical cylinder. High speed motion pictures of the vapor-liquid interface in film boiling have been obtained. All tests have been conducted at atmospheric pressure over a range of heat flux between 9000 and 37000 BTU/hr ft(2). A study of {{the stability of the}} vapor-liquid interface is performed and the results are compared to the photographic data. Parameters influencing the heat transfer process are developed and the experimental data is used to determine their proper relationship. The heat transfer coefficient in natural <b>convection</b> film <b>boiling</b> of saturated liquids on moderately long vertical surfaces at constant heat flux is shown to be insensitive to vertical position, and to be dependent only on the temperature differential and the fluid properties. Large scale waves have been observed on the vapor-liquid interface: however, their effect on the heat transfer is minimal. It appears that intense vaporization at the interface {{plays an important role in}} the generation of these waves, while surface tension does not. A strong possibility of liquid droplet entrainment in the vapor flow is indicated by the presence of a rough, wavy interface, a relatively high speed vapor-flow, and by the unexpectedly strong dependence of the heat transfer on the latent heat of vaporization. ...|$|R

Bearing elements, shaft, carrier, housing, cryogen flow characteristics, friction heat, and fluid viscous energy {{are included in the}} model. Heat transfer characteristics for the regimes of forced <b>convection</b> <b>boiling</b> are modeled for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid nitrogen (LN 2). Large temperature differences between the cryogenic fluid and baring contact surfaces require detailed nodal representation in these areas. Internal loads and friction heat are affected by temperature dependent operating clearances requiring iterations between bearing thermal and mechanical models. Analyses indicate a thermal-mechanical coupling resulting in reduced operating clearances, increased loading and heating which can contribute to premature bearing failure. Contact surfaces operate at temperatures above local saturation resulting in vapor rather than liquid in the contacts, precluding possible liquid film lubrication. Elevated temperatures can reduce lubrication, increase friction, and reduce surface hardness supporting a surface failure mode rather than subsurface fatigue...|$|E
40|$|Following a {{long-lasting}} {{failure in}} the cooling system of a water reactor, the superheated core can be cooled down efficiently by reflooding. At the French Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), the macroscopic model used to simulate this process is based on strong assumptions on the local flow patterns. This paper presents an experimental study of boiling in porous media with focus on different pore-scale boiling regimes. The experimental setup is a "two-dimensional" porous medium made of 2 mm diameter cylinders randomly placed between two ceramic plates. The 145 heating cylinders are RTD probes (Resistance Temperature Detectors), used to give pore-scale thermal measurements as well as heat generation. The operating fluid is HFE- 7000, a Fluorinert liquid with a low saturation temperature (Tsat = 34 °C at atmospheric pressure), which allows all the boiling regimes to be observed with moderate thermal constraints.

Although both pool and flow boiling would be involved, research results to date include only pool boiling because buoyancy effects are maximized for this case. The effective application of forced <b>convection</b> <b>boiling</b> heat transfer in the microgravity of space will require a well grounded and cogent understanding of the mechanisms involved. Experimental results are presented for pool boiling from a single geometrical configuration, a flat surface, covering {{a wide range of}} body forces from a/g = 20 to 1 to a/g = 0 to - 1 for a cryogenic liquid, and from a/g = 20 to 1 for water and a liquid metal.

The analytical solution was obtained for the integrated boundary-layer equations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{experimentally}} investigate the effect of the coiled wire insertions on dynamic instabilities and to compare the results with the smooth tube for forced <b>convection</b> <b>boiling.</b> The experiments were conducted in a circular tube, and water was used as the working fluid. Two different pitch ratios (H/D= 2. 77 and 5. 55) of coiled wire with circular cross-sections were utilised. The constant heat flux boundary condition was applied to the outer side of the test tube, and the constant exit restriction was used at the tube outlet. The mass flow rate changed from 110 to 20 [*]g/s in order to obtain a detailed idea about the density wave and pressure drop oscillations, and the range of the inlet temperature was 15 – 35 °C. The changes in pressure drop, inlet temperature, amplitude, and the period with mass flow rate are presented. For each configuration, it is seen that density wave and pressure drop oscillations occur at all inlet temperatures. Analyses show that the decrease in the mass flow rate and inlet temperature causes the amplitude and the period of the density wave and the pressure drop oscillations to decrease separately...|$|E

It {{can be seen that}} many researches have been carried out on the directions of preparation and properties of nanofluids [1 – 7]. Meanwhile, there are also many attempts that have been made for application of nanofluid, especially in energy systems [8 – 11]. Due to the enhancement in heat and mass transfer process, TiO 2 nanofluids have been tentatively applied to the fields of solar collectors [12], refrigeration [13 – 16], energy storage [17, 18], heat pipes [19 – 21], and other energy applications [22 – 34], such as car radiator [31], PV/T hybrid system [32, 33], and combined heat and power (CHP) systems [34]. In our previous studies, the heat transfer characteristics of TiO 2 nanofluids in heat conduction, forced <b>convection</b> <b>boiling</b> heat transfer, and natural convection heat transfer have been summarized [35]. However, it is far from a comprehensive summary for application of TiO 2 nanofluids; there are also many practical applications for TiO 2 nanofluids.

We hope that the two reviews combined with our previous report [35] can provide a comprehensive understanding on research progress of TiO 2 nanofluids. With the development of nanofluid technology, it is expected that nanofluids will be practically applied as a new and efficient work fluid for those energy systems.|$|E
40|$|Forced <b>convection</b> <b>boiling</b> flow, often {{referred}} to as two-phase flow, is a common phenomenon which occurs in many industrial processes. The relationship between the total pressure drop in a channel containing two-phase flow and the mass flux of the flow is known as the pressure characteristic curve. If any part of pressure characteristic curve contains a negative slope, flow instabilities might occur in the channel. Flow instabilities are unwanted because they can reduce the efficiency of the industrial process. In this study experimental work has been done to analyze the behavior of the pressure characteristic curve in two-phase flow by applying a sensitivity analysis. The parameters which were analyzed in the sensitivity analysis were inlet pressure, subcooling temperature, total heating power and heating power distribution. Also, experimental results from this study were compared with the results from a numerical study of the characteristic pressure curve of two-phase flow [1]. The experimental study showed that all the analyzed parameters influence the behavior of the pressure characteristics curve. The comparison with the numerical study showed the same trends for behavior for the pressure characteristic curve for all analyzed parameters except for the total heating power. From the analyzed parameters it was shown that the inlet pressure has the largest relative influence on the behavior of the pressure characteristic curve compared to the other parameters. Lowering the inlet pressure leads to the largest change in the mass flux range where flow instabilities can occur. Lowering the inlet pressure also leads to the largest change in the negative slope the pressure characteristic curve. </p...|$|E
