5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically <b>calibrates</b> data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E

25|$|Business records exception: {{business}} records created during the {{ordinary course of business}} are considered reliable and {{can usually be}} brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone with knowledge of the records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as substantive evidence against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the Business Records exception. Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is admissible under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John's speed with radar, records the speed in an incident report. He also <b>calibrates</b> and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be admissible as it pertained to the facts of the case. However, the officer's daily log in which he records his calibration and the daily diagnostics of his radar unit would be admissible under the {{business records}} exception.|$|E

Binocular stereovision {{system is}} {{regularly}} only <b>calibrated</b> once, that is each camera is <b>calibrated</b> using {{a picture of}} the calibration pattern laid in the cross field. This method’s calibration accuracy is expected to be improved. A twice <b>calibrating</b> method is proposed here. Each camera’s extrinsic and intrinsic parameters are <b>calibrated</b> in different fields. The extrinsic parameters are firstly <b>calibrated</b> in the cross field, then the intrinsic parameters are <b>calibrated</b> in the close-range field. By applying the method to one binocular stereovision system built in our lab, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can improve the calibration accuracy more than 3. 4 dB than the once <b>calibrating</b> method. Its accuracy makes this novel method more suitable for high accurate target tracking application...|$|R

40|$|Visual {{surveillance}} using {{a camera}} network has imposed new challenges to camera calibration. An essential {{problem is that}} a large number of cameras may not have a common field of view or even be synchronized well. We propose to use a hybrid camera network that consists of catadioptric and perspective cameras for a visual surveillance task. The relations between multiple views of a scene captured from different cameras can be then <b>calibrated</b> under the catadioptric camera’s coordinate system. This paper addresses the important issue of how to <b>calibrate</b> the hybrid camera network. We <b>calibrate</b> the hybrid camera network in three steps. First, we <b>calibrate</b> the catadioptric camera using only the vanishing points. In order to reduce computational complexity, we <b>calibrate</b> the camera without the mirror first and then <b>calibrate</b> the catadioptric camera system. Second, we determine 3 D positions of some points using as few as two spatial parallel lines and some equidistance points. Finally, we <b>calibrate</b> other perspective cameras based on these known spatial points. 1...|$|R
40|$|Excellent ranking power {{along with}} well <b>calibrated</b> {{probability}} estimates {{are needed in}} many classification tasks. In this paper, we introduce a technique, <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest that captures both. This novel technique is an ensemble of gradient boosting machines that can support both continuous and binary labels. While offering superior ranking power over any individual regression or classification model, <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest is able to preserve well <b>calibrated</b> posterior probabilities. Along with these benefits, we provide {{an alternative to the}} tedious step of tuning gradient boosting machines. We demonstrate that tuning <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest can be reduced to a simple hyper-parameter selection. We further establish that increasing this hyper-parameter improves the ranking performance under a diminishing return. We examine the effectiveness of <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest on ligand-based virtual screening where both continuous and binary labels are available and compare the performance of <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest with logistic regression, gradient boosting machine and deep learning. <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest achieved an approximately 48 % improvement compared to a state-of-art deep learning model. Moreover, it achieved around 95 % improvement on probability quality measurement compared to the best individual gradient boosting machine. <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest offers a benchmark demonstration that in the field of ligand-based virtual screening, deep learning is not the universally dominant machine learning model and good <b>calibrated</b> probabilities can better facilitate virtual screening process.
