50|$|The title {{industry}} is {{highly dependent on}} real estate markets, which, in turn, are highly sensitive to mortgage interest rates and the overall economic well-being. During the housing bubble from 2000 through 2006, the industry's revenue more than doubled. As the surge in real estate transactions drove up title insurance revenue—along with a greater incidence of claims—the economic downturn that started in 2007 pared back revenue significantly for several years. To compare, the industry reported nearly $17 billion in title insurance premiums in 2005, but volume fell to $9.6 billion in 2009. In 2012, according to ALTA, the industry paid out about $908 million in claims, about 8.1% percent of the $11.2 billion taken in as premiums.

40|$|How {{malleable}} are preferences? This paper provides {{experimental evidence}} {{on the extent to}} which insurance sellers can influence buyers and whether mandatory information disclosure offsets these effects. The experiment involves 214 subjects seeking or recently obtaining unsecured loans and 25 sellers with experience of commission selling and in receipt of substantial performance pay. Potential insurance buyers had up to £ 5, 750 value at risk. Extravert sellers are particularly effective. The most persuasive sellers raise willingness to pay by a substantial amount relative to the least successful. These differences arise even though sellers are only given a couple of minutes to make a “pitch”. Trusting buyers seem the most susceptible to seller influence. Revealing information concerning value for money (the <b>claims</b> <b>ratio)</b> or the seller’s commission is regarded as important by most consumers but is found to have negligible effects on behaviour.

In addition, the effects of firm-specific factors including firm size and firm profitability on the reinsurance decision of the sample of UK liability insurance companies is tested. Due {{to the fact that}} the demand for reinsurance is measured by the reinsurance <b>claims</b> <b>ratio</b> which should be restricted to the unit interval of zero to one, the sample panel data of 2103 firm/year observations is divided into two separate groups. One group includes the UK liability insurers with reinsurance claims ratios defined on the open interval of zero to one and the other group includes the UK liability insurance firms with reinsurance claims ratios equal to the boundary values of zero and/ or one. In group one, it is observed that underwriting risk and firm size are important determinants of the level of the reinsurance purchased by the UK liability insurance companies. Additionally, it is shown that firm size, firm profitability and solvency risk impact the amount of reinsurance purchased by the UK liability insurers in group two. As it is proved that firm size is an important determinant of the reinsurance demand, it should be investigated why it has opposite impacts on the UK liability insurers’ reinsurance decisions in the two separate groups of this study. It is shown that the sample of UK liability insurers mostly constitutes of large insurance companies which are engaging in reinsurance activities contrary to our prediction as they are providing reinsurance internally through their captives or their subsidiaries. On the other hand, the small to normal sized UK liability insurance companies are engaging in reinsurance activities consistent with our prediction and the smaller ones have higher reinsurance demands.

40|$|This study {{points out}} a {{potential}} unintended effect of efforts to enhance affordability of insurance prices by regulating rates: It may ultimately lead to higher insurance costs. This is because rate regulation that suppresses insurance prices below competitive levels, or provides significant premium subsidies for some consumers, creates a variety of incentive distortions in the market. The article summarizes the theoretical arguments for this effect and provides empirical evidence of cost-increasing effects of rate regulation. The analysis uses state-level data on automobile insurance costs and claims rates for the period 1990 through 1998, and employs empirical methods that control for the possible reverse causation of high insurance costs leading to consumer demand for rate regulation. We find that bodily injury and property damage liability loss costs are higher in rate-regulated states, and that the bodily injury to property damage liability <b>claims</b> <b>ratio</b> is higher in regulated states...|$|E

These information disclosures have virtually no effect despite most buyers claiming to value such information. Instead, our data reveal that whether the subject is generally trusting plays an important role. Trust is clearly associated with greater willingness to pay for insurance. Unlike in previous work, trust in our setting is not about obligations being fulfilled. The contract is complete, simple {{and the possibility of}} breach is negligible. However, as for much B 2 C insurance marketing, face-to-face selling plays a crucial role in our experimental design. Trusting buyers are more suggestible, so take advice more readily and buy more insurance, although they are no more risk averse than the uninsured. Moreover, trusting buyers feel less pressured by sellers, and are more confident in their decisions which suggests that they are easier to persuade. Therefore, in markets where persuasion is important, public policy designed to increase consumer information is likely to be ineffective. insurance selling, trust, persuasion...|$|E

40|$|The stormy years {{following}} {{introduction of the}} single market appear to be over at last. In {{spite of the fact}} that the premium level in the main segments was cut for good, insurers were for the first time able to impose substantial increases in premium rates in 2001, a development which is reflected in the consumer price index. Premium revenues were also augmented by a greater number of insured risks. The need for Austrian insurers to correct their price policy was driven chiefly by the negative actuarial results of the property and liability insurance. More than a third of the insurers in this business were unable to compensate losses from the actual insurance business by income from investment. Echoing the overall economic development, income from premiums on life insurance also showed stunted growth in 2001. The only volume to develop with genuine dynamism was that of annuity insurance premiums (+ 42. 8 percent). Payouts from life insurance rose dramatically in 2001, as a consequence of the 1996 tax reform which produced a surge in advanced insurance contracts. Those contracts are now beginning to mature. Demand for supplementary health insurance coverage has been declining for years, but insurers could still boost revenues by increasing premium payments. Expenditure on claims was affected by an increase of almost 3 percent in the number of claims incurred. After the disasters of 2000, the number of claims incurred levelled off throughout the property liability insurance sector. Developments in both revenues and expenditures markedly moderated the <b>claims</b> <b>ratio</b> for the entire business segment. In 2001, private insurers recorded the lowest growth rate of provisions during the past decade. The lower growth rate in actuarial reserves for life insurance was not fully compensated by the upswing in the two other segments. With regard to the portfolio structure, the shift from loans to mutual funds continues; cash holdings expanded considerably in 2001. The return on investment dipped slightly, so that the gap to the yield on federal bonds narrowed to some 1. 5 percentage points.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{number of}} medical {{malpractice}} claims {{has been increasing}} in recent years. However, because of the sensitiveness of information and no malpractice insurance coverage, no objective claims-based data has been released in Taiwan to estimate malpractice risk and its economic burden. In a university hospital of Taiwan, after forming a working group for solving malpractice claims in the past 6 years (2005 - 2010), we have collected 445 cases and examined the clinical, administrative, economic and legal information for these cases. First, after applying the Theory of Planned Behavior as our conceptual framework, we have performed several risk-adjustment models of associated factors on the odds of having legal action. Our main results are {{that the number of}} meetings between doctor and patient (OR= 2. 478, p less than O. OOO 1), along with other factors are significantly associated with the incidence of a malpractice claim developing into a legal action (c-statistics= 0. 838). Second, using the amount of compensation as the outcome variable in all settled claims, we have constructed two-part models to describe the relationship between risk factors and outcome. The two-part models contain a logistic regression model as the first part to predict the frequency of paid claims (4. 2 times more odds of having paid claims with every meeting between doctor and patient, OR= 4. 235, p< 0. 001; c-statistics= 0. 918) and an ordinary linear regression model as the second part to predict the amounts of these payments (every meeting between doctors and patient increasing the payment at 0. 18 million NTD [R-square= 0. 5521]). Our third study estimates nationwide malpractice costs for Taiwan based on our database, given limitations of extrapolating from a single hospital. We find that the estimated annual cost of medical malpractice for all of Taiwan's doctors is NTD 239. 6 million (7. 99 million USD) with a range from NTD 168. 6 million to 404. 3 million (5. 62 million to 13. 4 million USD). Such a low estimate may be caused by low lawsuit costs (42. 7 million NTD, 1. 42 million USD) and lower paid <b>claims</b> <b>ratio</b> for settled claims (21 %).
