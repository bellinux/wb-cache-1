40|$|Magnetite {{iron ore}} green pellets are {{produced}} by balling moist concentrates to green pellets, which are then dried, oxidized to hematite, sintered, cooled and transported to steelmaking plants. The existing theory for balling {{is based on the}} capillary theory, but its applicability under industrial balling conditions is unclear. The aim of this study has been to clarify the principal mechanisms controlling the properties of iron ore green pellets. Special {{attention has been paid to}} studying how variations in raw material fineness influence green pellets behaviour during balling, oxidation and sintering. This knowledge of the principal mechanisms is needed to provide a sound basis for a successful process control strategy. The applied approach was to further develop the laboratory methods used in green pellet characterization. Oxidation in green pellets was measured by thermogravimetry and sintering was followed by dilatometry. A new measuring device for the characterization of green pellet strength was built and a new measuring method for green pellet plasticity was developed. The optimum moisture content in balling was defined as the moisture content resulting in a given degree of plasticity in green pellets. Pellet feeds with steeper particle size distributions required a higher moisture content in balling. Properties of green pellets prepared from different raw materials should be compared at constant plasticity (under realistic balling conditions), not at constant moisture content, as has been done earlier. At constant plasticity and with 0. 5 % bentonite binder, variations in the fineness of the magnetite concentrate did not influence the green pellet wet strength, within the limits studied in this work. This is because in the presence of the bentonite binder, green pellet wet strength was mainly controlled by the viscous forces of the binder liquid. A marked degradation in green pellet mechanical strength both in wet and dry states was found in the presence of a surface-active flotation collector reagent. This loss in green pellet quality was explained by a strong attachment of air bubbles in the green pellet structure. High-speed camera images showed multi-breakage patterns due to crack propagation between the air bubbles. This explains the increased generation of dust observed at the pellet plant. The negative effects of the flotation collector reagent on balling diminished during storage of the pellet feed. The results emphasize the importance of minimizing the reagent dosages in flotation and maximizing the residence time of the pellet feed in the homogenizing storage before balling. When a pellet starts to oxidize, a shell of hematite is formed while the pellet core is still magnetite. Thermal volume changes in these two phases were studied. Sintering in the magnetite phase started earlier (950 °C) compared to the hematite phase (1100 °C). Therefore, the difference in sintering rates between the magnetite and hematite phases was largest at around 1100 °C. The sintering rate increased in both phases with increasing fineness in the magnetite concentrate. A finer grind in the raw material would, therefore, promote the formation of the unwanted duplex structures with a more heavily sintered <b>core</b> <b>pulling</b> off from the shell. At constant original porosity in green pellets, the oxidation rate decreased as the magnetite concentrate became finer, because of the enhanced sintering. However, in practical balling, finer raw materials would necessitate the use of more water in balling, which results in an increase in green pellet porosity. These two opposite effects levelled out and the oxidation time became constant. Under process conditions, differences in the duplex structure would still be expected. This is because only partial oxidation takes place before sintering in the kiln. Olivine, which is used as an additive in LKAB blast furnace pellets, was found to initiate the dissociation of hematite back to magnetite already at temperatures that can occur during oxidation in the PH zone. The rate of dissociation was largely influenced by the olivine fineness. If the dissociation temperature is exceeded, the resulting decrease in the oxidation rate increases the size of the un-oxidized core exposed to sintering before oxidation. Also, dilatometer measurements showed opposite thermal volume changes in the oxidized hematite shell and in the magnetite core in the presence of olivine. Dissociation caused a large volume increase in the oxidized hematite shell, while the olivine addition further enhanced the sintering of the magnetite core. These mechanisms lead to increased structural stress between the hematite shell and the magnetite core. This knowledge was applied at the LKAB Svappavaara pelletizing plant. Coarser grinding of the olivine additive resulted in a marked improvement in the low- temperature reduction strength (LTD) in pellets. The final conclusion, then, is that excessive grinding of the pelletizing raw materials, both the magnetite concentrate and the additives, can cause severe problems and step-wise changes in the oxidation and sintering mechanisms without resulting in any additional gain in terms of green pellet mechanical strength. The capillary theory failed to describe the properties of wet green pellets under industrial balling conditions. The results also clearly point out that continuous variations in raw material properties would cause complex fluctuations in both balling and induration. Godkänd; 2007; 20070504 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The slanted-guide-pillar core-pulling {{mechanism}} {{is the most}} commonly used side core-pulling mechanism in die-casting die. But when filling the die with pressure, aluminum leak frequently happens between lower motion-stopping surface of sliding block and side surface of moving die insert, since the clearance is bigger between side core and core hole. In many improved approaches, changing the lower motion-stopping surface of sliding block into upper motion-stopping surface of it or reducing the lower motion-stopping surface area is the simplest and reliable measure. The sliding block’s setback which occurs in die-casting process can be eliminated effectively and the workload of maintaining die can be reduced by this measure. Common structure of Slanted-guide-pillar core-pulling mechanism in die-casting die The die casting is one of main formed methods for aluminum alloy. If there are holes or grooves or convex plates in sidewall of casting part, the corresponding components in die-casting die must be designed the movable cores which can move in side direction[1].

40|$|A tool makes a cut {{perpendicular}} to the cylindrical axis of a core hole at a predetermined depth to free the core at that depth. The tool does not damage the surrounding material from which the core was cut, and it operates within the core-hole kerf. Coring usually begins with use of a hole saw or a hollow cylindrical abrasive cutting tool to make an annular hole that leaves the core (sometimes called the plug) in place. In this approach to coring as practiced heretofore, the core is removed forcibly in a manner chosen to shear the core, preferably {{at or near the}} greatest depth of the core hole. Unfortunately, such forcible removal often damages both the core and the surrounding material (see Figure 1). In an alternative prior approach, especially applicable to toxic or fragile material, a core is formed and freed by means of milling operations that generate much material waste. In contrast, the present tool eliminates the damage associated with the hole-saw approach and reduces the extent of milling operations (and, hence, reduces the waste) associated with the milling approach. The present tool (see Figure 2) includes an inner sleeve and an outer sleeve and resembles the hollow cylindrical tool used to cut the core hole. The sleeves are thin enough that this tool fits within the kerf of the core hole. The inner sleeve is attached to a shaft that, in turn, can be attached to a drill motor or handle for turning the tool. This tool also includes a cutting wire attached to the distal ends of both sleeves. The cutting wire is long enough that with sufficient relative rotation of the inner and outer sleeves, the wire can cut {{all the way to the}} center of the core. The tool is inserted in the kerf until its distal end is seated at the full depth. The inner sleeve is then turned. During turning, frictional drag on the outer <b>core</b> <b>pulls</b> the cutting wire into contact with the core. The cutting force of the wire against the core increases with the tension in the wire and, hence, with the frictional drag acting on the outer sleeve. As the wire cuts toward the center of the core, the inner sleeve rotates farther with respect to the outer sleeve. Once the wire has cut to the center of the core, the tool and the core can be removed from the hole. The proper choice of cutting wire depends on the properties of the core material. For a sufficiently soft core material, a nonmetallic monofilament can be used. For a rubber-like core material, a metal wire can be used. For a harder core material, it is necessary to use an abrasive wire, and the efficiency of the tool can be increased greatly by vacuuming away the particles generated during cutting. For a core material that can readily be melted or otherwise cut by use of heat, it could be preferable to use an electrically heated cutting wire. In such a case, electric current can be supplied to the cutting wire, from an electrically isolated source, via rotating contact rings mounted on the sleeves...|$|R

Yet, despite its importance we have only limited insights into how such policy credibility is formed. To address this gap we explore whether and to what extent corporate perceptions of policy credibility depend on the current policy mix with its national targets, concrete policy instruments and their consistency as well as policy making and implementation. For this, we use the case of the German Energiewende and rely on data collected in 2014 through a survey of German manufacturers of renewable power generation technologies. We analyze the answers of 390 companies through a linear regression to identify policy mix related determinants of perceived policy credibility - measured by a novel indicator based on four survey items. We find that corporate perceptions of policy credibility are mainly shaped by two characteristics of the policy mix, namely the coherence of policy making and implementation, followed by the consistency of the policy mix. Elements of the policy mix matter as well, in particular changes {{in the design of the}} <b>core</b> demand <b>pull</b> instrument (the Renewable Energy Sources Act, EEG) and the nuclear phase-out policy, but also the German targets for the expansion of renewable energies play a role.

40|$|Turbulence {{has long}} been {{believed}} {{to be associated with}} the behavior of vorticity. Ever since experiments showed clearly the presence of vortex structures in turbulent flow, concentrated efforts have tried to identify the important dynamics of three-dimensional vortex flow. In particular, conjectures abound about the importance of vortex stretching and vortex line reconnection. Numerical experiments based on ad hoc assumptions on the nature of the cores of vortex filaments have shown interesting behavior. In some cases, it has been argued that singularities develop in finite time and in other cases that the filament exhibits fractal dimensions. These inviscid calculations also show that filaments of opposite signed vorticity tend to pair up and that the local flow is two-dimensional. Consequently, we have begun a study that clarifies the behavior of a pair of counter-rotating vortices in the presence of an external strain flow that would be induced by the presence of vorticity well away from the local two-dimensional plane. So far, the results are quite interesting and depend on the nature of the strain flow. We always assume that the horizontal component of the strain pushes the filaments together. It is the other two components that then affect the results. Without any strain along the axes of the filaments, the vortex <b>cores</b> are <b>pulled</b> into parallel elliptical shapes. Eventually, the cores are so deformed that they become unstable in the same way a parallel shear flow would and the vortex structures disrupt. This phenomenon will be missed by filament codes that assume the cores remain circular. On the other hand, a strain component along the filaments increases the vorticity but keeps the core structure mostly circular. As the cores approach one another, viscous effects overcome the increase in vorticity due to stretching and the cores dissipate away...|$|R
40|$|The energy dissipators are passive {{components}} that {{are incorporated into}} buildings and other structures undergoing dynamic excitations, especially earthquakes. Its purpose is to absorb the greatest part of the input energy, thus protecting the main structure. These devices are {{not a part of}} the main load-carrying system and therefore can be easily replaced after suffering serious damage. These devices are connected to the structure to be protected in such a way that they experience large strains under the action of the earthquakes; such strains produce the energy absorption. In building structures, the dissipators are installed in frames, usually in concentric bracing bars (either diagonal or chevron braces) since the interstory drifts generate significant distortions in these elements. Various types of dissipators have been proposed for building structures. Those based on yielding of metals, commonly known as hysteretic, are distinguished by their simplicity, economy and robustness; among them, the so-called buckling restrained braces have experienced a remarkable development because of their important advantages. The buckling restrained braces consist of concentric bracing bars composed by a slender steel core surrounded by a stockier casing, usually made of mortar and / or steel. It is crucial that there is a sliding interface between the core and the cover, to prevent relevant shear stress transfer. When the <b>core</b> is <b>pulled</b> or pushed it yields; the casing prevents the buckling of the core. These cycles of tensile and compressive yielding constitute the hysteresis loops through which the energy is dissipated. Despite relevant experience exists on buckling restrained braces (both on research and practical applications) many questions still remain unanswered. In particular, no reliable and accurate model of the structural behavior has been proposed. This lack prevents a deep understanding of the complex phenomena that occur during the operation of these elements, and hinders the development of innovative solutions. This work aims to improve the knowledge about the behavior of these devices, developing a comprehensive numerical model that opens the door for future developments. The results obtained with the proposed numerical model are compared with experimental results obtained at the University of Girona and the University of California.

These studies are teasing out answers by investigating the record of sediment build-up, the profile of ciénaga-drawn cores containing stable sedimentary isotopes, pollen, microscopic charcoal or fire remnants, elemental fractions of organic materials and identifying {{the sources of the}} organic matter buried within the sediments. The following time line summarizes several of these studies:21,000 BP — The period of the last glacial maximum when ice sheets throughout the globe were at their maximum extension of the earth, glaciers were at their thickest and the sea levels were at their lowest. The American Deserts were forested, with large pluvial lakes punctuating and rivers flowing across the landscape. The Pleistocene or Ice Age ended, and the Holocene Epoch began.11,500 BP — Stream flows remained strong, capable of moving rocks and cobbles, precluding establishment of most ciénagas, save those few along more protected reaches.8000 BP — Furthest time for which scientists have collected continuous evidence of ciénaga materials to determine when and how ciénagas developed. Water flows remained robust and still prevented the wholesale establishment of ciénagas, a time [...] "when winter precipitation was minimal, fire was rare." [...] "However we do have evidence from the American Deserts of ciénegas deep into the last ice age."7200 BP — Initial stabilization of ciénaga occurred as flows slowed, allowing formation of wetlands. [...] "During most of the past 7,068 years this environment has been slowly aggrading…although this generally slow process of accumulating sediments is punctuated by periods of rapid development." [...] 6000 BP — Onset of El Niño/La Niña-Southern Oscillation, warm and cool recurring, alternating, quasi-periodic climate pattern that occurs across the tropical Pacific Ocean and accounts for much of the fire variability in the Southwest.5300 BP — Before this period, woody plants dominated the uplands with [...] "fire episode frequency below (1 fire every 200 years)" [...] and even more infrequent when winter precipitation was low. The transition to grasslands began around this time; after this period, fire frequency increased to [...] "1.3 every 100 years."7200 - 4100 BP — Fine grain sediment increases, suggesting permanent and prolonged annual wetting, stable ciénagas that went through at least three steady states after initial stabilization: · 6300 - 6000 BP· 4700 - 4000 BP· 1600 - 750 BP4500 BP — Due to heavy moisture, a period of river system down-cutting in the Southwest; fire frequency increased to [...] "2.1 fires/100 years" [...] or one fire every 48 years.4100 - 2400 BP — 1,700-year dry interval period where ciénaga water permanence severely lessened, and fire frequency decreased to only [...] "1 fire every 100 years."4100 - 1300 BP — Dominated by grasses, this period was similar to present day. Ciénagas were stable with the transitional shift from arid habitat to wetter conditions, trending toward more aquatic states—conditions that persisted until European settlement.3400 BP — Earliest prehistoric presence of human activity is demonstrated by the presence of corn (Zea) pollen at Animas Creek ciénaga in New Mexico. Zea pollen, found in various sediment <b>cores</b> <b>pulled</b> from ciénagas throughout the region, establishes Native Americans' use of ciénagas and their surrounds.1300 - 750 BP — Stability in upland vegetation and ciénaga surfaces was established, [...] "water ponding and stagnation of the water was likely occurring," [...] sedges and cattails dominated, and fire frequency increased to [...] "2.6 fire episodes per 100 years" [...] or a fire, on average, every 38 years.1692 CE — The Spanish arrived in large numbers after the reconquista, 200 years after Columbus.1700s CE — The dramatic decline of charcoal corresponds with the appearance of filaree (Erodium cicutarium) pollen in sediment cores about 1795, which in turn corresponds with the establishment of Camp Grant in 1860, almost 200-years after Spanish colonization in 1692. Coring shows frequent burning of some ciénagas before European contact, and six ciénagas record an increase in dung fungus (Sporormiella) spores common among grazing animals increased during the so-called (post-contact) historic period in response to the introduction of livestock. “The change in fire history is linked to human activity by the prehistoric presence of the pollen of weeds and corn (Zea) in the ciénegas."1800 CE — Before 1800, fire frequency had increased, on average, to one fire every decade, but abruptly decreased with the displacement of native agriculture by European settlement, triggering accelerated post-settlement transformation of wetland vegetation back to woody species.There are several undeniable conclusions from these studies: ...|$|R
40|$|How does an {{oil boom}} affect the forest cover of {{tropical}} oil exporting-countries? Are they {{more or less}} likely than non-oil countries to experience forest loss? What macro-economic linkages and policies are decisive? This article summarises research on land-use changes in eight tropical developing countries. Our country-comparative approach reveals that the direct oil impacts on forests are unquestionably subordinate compared to oil's derived macroeconomic impact. In most cases, oil wealth indirectly but significantly comes to protect tropical forests. The core mechanism here is that oil rents cause 'Dutch Disease', decreasing the price-competitiveness of agriculture and logging, which strongly diminishes pressures for deforestation and forest degradation. But domestic policy responses to oil wealth are also vital determinants for the forest outcome. When governments use most oil wealth for urban spending sprees, this reinforces the <b>core</b> effect by <b>pulling</b> more labor out of land-using and forest-degrading activities. Yet, in extreme cases when boosting oil revenues finance large road-construction programs or frontier-colonization projects, the core forest-protective effect of oil wealth can be reversed. Repeated currency devaluation and import protection of heavily land-using domestic sectors also contribute to increased forest pressures. These conclusions have ample policy implications, reaching beyond the group of tropical oil countries. Other international capital transfers, like bilateral credits, aid or debt relief can have similar impacts. These measures will alleviate pressures on forests, unless they come to bolster specific forest-detrimental policies.

The mentioned project is the most prominent and successful representative of conducted in formal Soviet Union countries (FSU) program of super-deep scientific drilling in 70 th- 90 th years of the last century. The program of super-deep borehole construction was in many senses a unique long-term field experiment. Several new drilling technologies have been developed at this time.

Interest of scientists to the composition and structure of the deep zones of the crust is inexhaustible and is always on the agenda. But the possibility of getting the unique scientific and technological data is limited to the actual level of scientific and technical progress. Modern simulators and software products together with experience based engineering approach allows us to consider in more detail the calculation of loads on the drill string and take into account a number of relevant factors. A suchlike working mechanism was not available to engineers thirty years ago and the work was generally based on intuitive knowledge and experience of the scientists and engineering community. Outcome of the conducted project on Kolskyi peninsula was outstanding not only as a result for geological and geophysical areas, but also as an outcome in commercial drilling engineering. It gave an impulse for the further drilling technology development and played the role in the oil and gas drilling technology upgrading. Important to notice, that aluminium high strength drill-pipes was developed at this time and found successful application in offshore riser-less drilling. Aluminium drill-strings become a source of increased interest in the last decade mainly because of the hidden potentials for extended reach and horizontal drilling applications and improved drill rig capacity.

40|$|To take {{advantage}} of the processing power in the Chip Multiprocessors design, applications must be divided into semi-independent processes that can run concur- rently on multiple cores within a system. Therefore, programmers must insert thread synchronization semantics (i. e. locks, barriers, and condition variables) to synchro- nize data access between processes. Indeed, threads spend long time waiting to acquire the lock of a critical section. In addition, a processor has to stall execution to wait for load data accesses to complete. Furthermore, there are often independent instructions which include load instructions beyond synchronization semantics that could be executed in parallel while a thread waits on the synchronization semantics. The conveniences of the cache memories come with some extra cost in Chip Multiprocessors. Cache Coherence mechanisms address the Memory Consistency problem. However, Cache Coherence adds considerable overhead to memory accesses.
