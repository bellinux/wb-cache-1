Many applications (e. g., sensors, microelectronics, optics, and biomedical applications, etc.) utilize thin polymer waveguide films, and non-destructive characterization methods based on Fourier transform (FT) -plasmon waveguide spectroscopy (PWR) and scanning angle (SA) Raman spectroscopy are used to extract optical, physical, and chemical properties simultaneously. The FT-PWR method measures reflected light at polymer waveguide interface as both the incident frequency (wavelength) and incident angle are scanned. This method uses p- and s-polarized light to simultaneously extract the polymer waveguide thickness and apparent anisotropic indices of refraction. Polystyrene waveguide films ranging from 360 to 800 nm are used to demonstrate the method and it has an average 0. 4 % relative error when compared to profilometry and atomic force microscopy measurements. SA Raman spectroscopy is used to measure mixed waveguide polymer films consisting of polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) and homopolymer poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA:PMMA), and poly(2 -vinylnapthalene) -block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (P 2 VN-b-PMMA). PMMA homopolymer {{is added to the}} PS-b-PMMA solutions to vary the chemical composition. The chemical composition of each mixed film is quantified (SA Raman peak amplitude ratios) and averaged over all incident angles and is termed the Raman amplitude ratio (rps). This parameter is used to calculate the refractive index of each mixed waveguide polymer film. The refractive index is an input parameter for sum square electric field (SSEF) calculations, which are used to model SA Raman spectra as a function of incident angle to extract the film thickness. The mixed polymer waveguide film thicknesses ranged from 495 to 971 nm, and the SA Raman spectroscopy method has an average 5 % difference between the values determined by profilometry. The SA Raman spectroscopy method developed for mixed polymer waveguide films is used to measure the chemical composition and extract interface locations in bilayer and <b>trilayer</b> <b>films</b> consisting of PMMA/PS or PMMA/PS/PMMA, respectively.

40|$|My PhD {{study was}} focused on the {{continuous}} development of microbridge tests on thin films. We developed a microbridge testing method to characterize the mechanical properties of a symmetrical <b>trilayer</b> thin <b>film</b> composed of two kinds of materials. Theoretically, taking the substrate deformation into account, we analysed the deformation of the symmetrical trilayer microbridge sample with a deformable boundary condition and derived load-deflection formulas in closed-form. The symmetrical condition was satisfied by fabricating the same material layer with the same conditions. In a symmetrical trilayer sample, there is no residual moment and hence no residual deflection in the film, thereby eliminating the effect of residual deflection on the measurement of the load-induced deflection. On the other hand, a zero value of the tension and bending coupling stiffness makes it possible for us to evaluate the Young's modulus of two kinds of materials and the average residual stress of the <b>trilayer</b> thin <b>film</b> simultaneously. The slope of a load-deflection curve under small deformation gives the relationship of the bending stiffness and the residual force, which reduces the number of the parameters to be evaluated from the load-deflection curve under large deformation to two. The designed experiment on the symmetrical SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 thin films, which were fabricated by using the MEMS technique and tested by Nanoindentation with a wedge indenter, verifies the novel microbridge testing method. The crucial measurement in the microbridge test is the thickness measurement of each layer in the <b>trilayer</b> <b>film</b> because a small error in the thickness measurement will lead to a large error in the determination of Young's modulus and residual stress. The error analysis indicates that enhancing the measurement precision of the sample geometry will greatly improve the experimental accuracy. The microbridge test was applied to characterize mechanical properties of asymmetrical <b>trilayer</b> thin <b>films</b> by taking the initial deflection into account. To increase the measurement accuracy, we re-calculated the spring compliances as functions of the film thickness and the thickness-averaged Young's modulus. In general, a residual moment is induced in an asymmetrical trilayer microbridge sample and results in an initial deflection. The profile of the initial deflection provides information about the mechanical properties of the <b>trilayer</b> <b>film,</b> which can be utilized in the mechanical characterization of the film. With the addition information provided by the slope of a load-deflection curve under small loads, which gives the relationship of the equivalent bending stiffness and the initial resultant force, we are able to determine the tension stiffness, the bending stiffness, the residual moment, and the residual force, from the profile of the initial deflection on a single sample based on the beam theory without other assumptions. Then, if two of the four parameters are used as input data, we can verify the other two parameters from fitting the entire load-deflection curve under large deformation. It should be emphasized that although an asymmetrical <b>trilayer</b> thin <b>film</b> was used here to demonstrate the extended microbridge testing method, the extended microbridge testing method holds actually for multilayer films because only the four parameters, the tension stiffness, the bending stiffness, the residual moment, and the residual force, determine the response of a multilayer microbridge sample in the test. We also developed a microbridge testing method for a bilayer microbridge beam initially buckled by residual compressive resultant force and residual moment. A multilayer beam with a compressive residual resultant force will be buckled if the compressive residual resultant force exceeds a critical value. If there co-exist a residual moment and a compressive residual resultant force in a multilayer beam, the residual moment may change the critical value of compressive residual resultant force for buckling due to substrate deformation. The large absolute net moment determines the buckling direction. Measuring the buckling profile and the slope of deflection to load, we determine the four parameters, which govern the buckling and bending behaviors of the multilayer beam. For bilayer beams, the Young's modulus and the residual stress of each layer can be uniquely ascertained from the microbridge test without any further assumptions. In addition, we adopted the microbridge testing method to characterize the interface stress and the interface stiffness in a bilayer thin film. Considering the interface, we analysed the deformation of a bilayer microbridge with the deformable boundary condition and derived a load-deflection formula in closed-form. We fabricated silicon oxide and silicon nitride bilayer films. By maintaining the underneath layer thickness unchanged and varying the thickness of the upper layer, we determine the interface stress and the interface stiffness...|$|R

However, the magnetic properties are determined by the whole of films associated with the crossoverlayers and the strong magnetic coupling interaction between the inter-layers.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the work {{carried out by the}} author on thin {{magnetic}} multilayer films that were deposited using a closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering (CFUBMS) system. The sputtering system was developed by TEER Coatings Ltd and has to date been used only for micron thick films. This study of magnetic multilayers is prompted by the interesting properties they exhibit and their application as read heads and magnetic sensors. In addition, TEER Coatings would like to market the CFUBMS system as a nanoscale deposition system for these applications. This project involved the deposition of nanoscale magnetic multilayer films using the CFUBMS system. Optimisation of the deposition conditions for nanoscale deposition was first carried out. The magnetic properties, magnetic domain structure during reversal and the microstructure of <b>trilayer</b> and multilayer <b>films</b> was analysed and the affect of thickness changes determined. In addition, interface modification by annealing and ion-bombardment was carried out on <b>trilayer</b> <b>films</b> and the effect on magnetic properties and microstructure was studied. Changes in the sputtering power, gas pressure, bias voltage and deposition time were shown to affect the film deposition rate. The effects of increasing gas pressure and bias voltage were shown not to affect the deposition rate very much when compared to much greater effect of increasing the target power. Changes in the magnetic properties, domain structure and microstructure were observed with varying Py, Au and Cu layer thicknesses in both <b>trilayer</b> and multilayer <b>films.</b> Single, double and cross-tie domain walls were all observed in the domain structure of films during magnetisation reversal. In addition, crystalline texture was induced in films by increasing the Au layer thickness. A comparison of as-grown, annealed and ion-bombarded films showed that interface modification results in changes in the magnetisation reversal mechanism, saturation field and coupling strength of the films. In addition, the author developed a method for extracting the total film thickness and top surface roughness from LAXRR profiles.

40|$|Atomically flat {{monolayer}} and <b>trilayer</b> <b>films</b> of polydiacetylenes {{have been}} prepared on mica and silicon using a horizontal deposition technique from a pure water subphase. Langmuir films of 10, 12 -pentacosadiynoic acid (I) and N-(2 -ethanol) - 10, 12 -pentacosadiynamide (II) were compressed to 20 mN/m and subsequently polymerized by UV irradiation at the air-water interface. Blue and red forms of the films were prepared by varying exposure times and incident power. Polymerization to the blue-phase films produced slight contractions in the film of 2 and 5 % for the films of II and I, respectively. Longer UV exposures yielded red-phase films with dramatic film contraction of 15 and 32 % for II and I, respectively. The horizontal deposition technique provided transfer ratios of unity with minimal film stress or structure modification. Atomic force microscopy images revealed nearly complete coverage of the substrate with atomically flat films. Crystalline domains of up to 100 microns of highly oriented polydiacetylene molecules were observed. The results reported herein provided insight into the roles of molecular packing and chain orientations in converting the monomeric film to the polymerized blue- and red-phases...|$|R

Crystal structure, surface morphology, visible transmittance, and color {{scale of the}} AZO/Ag/AZO coated trilayers as functions of Ag and AZO layers thickness were investigated by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), optical transmittance spectra and CIELAB system. In addition, the electrical and infrared reflection properties of the coated trilayers were examined by four-point probe system and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The {{results indicated that the}} Ag inner layer started forming a continuous film at the thickness of 10 nm which was supported by XRD result of the distinct 200 and 220 Ag peaks. Besides, the highest average visible transmittance of 80. 5 % was obtained by the AZO (30 nm) /Ag (10 nm) /AZO (30 nm) structure. Furthermore, the lowest sheet resistivity of 4. 36 Ω/sq and the highest infrared reflection rate of 96 % in FIR region can be obtained by the AZO (30 nm) /Ag (13 nm) /AZO (30 nm) structure. The high infrared reflection property of the AZO/Ag/AZO trilayers makes it a promising candidate for energy conservation coatings. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Photonic {{integrated}} circuits require magneto-optical (MO) materials for making nonreciprocal {{devices such as}} isolators and circulators. The most successful MO materials are rare-earth-substituted iron garnets, but these can be challenging to grow on silicon without a seed layer, which introduces spacing loss between the waveguide and the MO cladding. A pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) method is used for making MO Ce:YIG (Ce[superscript 1]Y[superscript 2]Fe[superscript 5]O[superscript 12]) /YIG (Y[superscript 3]Fe[superscript 5]O[superscript 12]) bilayer or <b>trilayer</b> <b>films</b> on different substrates, including silicon, quartz, and Gd[superscript 3]Ga[superscript 5]O[superscript 12] (GGG), in which a multilayer film is deposited in one run and then annealed. A YIG seed layer grown above the MO Ce:YIG facilitates recrystallization during ex situ rapid thermal annealing, which results in a reduced thermal budget and simplified deposition process. A monolithically integrated optical isolator was demonstrated by direct deposition of a bilayer Ce:YIG/YIG capping layer onto a silicon-on-insulator resonator. The device exhibited an insertion loss of 7. 4 ± 1. 8 dB and an isolation ratio of 13. 0 ± 2. 2 dB within the telecommunication window (λ = 1564. 4 nm), which outperforms previously reported monolithic isolators.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for nondestructive in situ techniques that measure chemical content, total thickness, and interface locations for multilayer polymer films, and scanning angle (SA) Raman spectroscopy in combination with appropriate data models can provide this information. A SA Raman spectroscopy method was developed to measure the chemical composition of multilayer polymer waveguide films and to extract the location of buried interfaces between polymer layers with 7 - to 80 -nm axial spatial resolution. The SA Raman method acquires Raman spectra as the incident angle of light upon a prism-coupled thin film is scanned. Six multilayer films consisting of poly(methyl methacrylate) /polystyrene or poly(methyl methacrylate) /polystyrene/poly(methyl methacrylate) were prepared with total thicknesses ranging from 330 to 1, 260 nm. The interface locations were varied by altering the individual layer thicknesses between 140 and 680 nm. The Raman amplitude ratio of the 1, 605 -cm− 1 peak for polystyrene and 812 -cm− 1 peak for poly(methyl methacrylate) was used in calculations of the electric field intensity within the polymer layers to model the SA Raman data and extract the total thickness and interface locations. There is an average 8 % and 7 % difference in the measured thickness between the SA Raman and profilometry measurements for bilayer and <b>trilayer</b> <b>films,</b> respectively...|$|R
