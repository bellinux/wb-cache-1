This Recommendation, which was subsequently endorsed by the EU Council of Ministers (July 2013), sets out a common European Framework for tackling child poverty and social exclusion and promoting child well-being. The European Commission asked the European Social Policy Network (ESPN) to prepare country reports and an overall Synthesis Report on the implementation of the Recommendation since its adoption in 2013. The reports are also intended to help the Commission and Member States in setting priorities for implementing the principles in relation to children in the Pillar of Social Rights and to inform the discussion on establishing a European <b>Child</b> <b>Guarantee.</b> This report details the national findings from the United Kingdom...|$|E

50|$|Under Dean's {{leadership}} the SBLC in 2000 authored the Children's Health Initiative, a plan {{to expand}} Medi-Cal service to offer universal healthcare to children in San Jose. With Chavez on the Council, the plan initially had majority support. The plan depended on $2 million from the city {{in order to qualify}} for matching federal and state funds, but Mayor Gonzales managed to withhold the funds after offering $2.3 million in project funding to Councilwoman Pat Dando, who reversed her vote.After the initiative failed in City Council, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors offered the starting funds, and the program began the next year. After the plan began, the mayor and City Council reversed the earlier position and committed $3 million to fund the program. The Children's Health Initiative extended coverage to 70,000 <b>children,</b> <b>guaranteeing</b> health insurance to an estimated 360,000 San Joseans below the age of 18.

5000|$|On January 9, 2017, Pernar wrote a Facebook status {{claiming}} that pharmaceutical companies make poisoned vaccines which [...] "mark people like livestock". Furthermore, {{he asked his}} followers why [...] "such small needles leave such big marks" [...] and why [...] "vaccined children develop autism". Such claims drew criticism from the local media ranging from calling Pernar a conspiracy theorist, to referring to the MMR vaccine controversy case in order to dismiss his claims. Croatian Ombudsman for Children Ivana Milas-Klarić and certain pediatricians also expressed outrage for Pernar's claims. Milas-Klarić accused Pernar that by publishing such status, he violated the article 24 of UN's Convention on the Rights of the <b>Child</b> which <b>guarantees</b> <b>children</b> the [...] "highest attainable standard of health" [...] and described his actions as [...] "sad".|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether there is a relationship between state policies on Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), declines in both TANF and Medicaid caseloads, and the {{rise in the number of}} uninsured. METHODS: Extant data sources of state TANF policies, TANF and Medicaid participation, and uninsurance rates were analyzed, with the state as the unit of analysis. The independent variables included state TANF policies that directly address receipt of benefits or relate to health; dependent variables included changes in state TANF enrollment, Medicaid enrollment, and health insurance status since the enactment of the law. RESULTS: In the bivariate analysis, declines in Medicaid were associated with sanction for work noncompliance, lack of a <b>child</b> care <b>guarantee,</b> and strategies to deter TANF enrollment; this last factor was also associated with increased uninsurance. In the multivariate analysis, lack of a <b>child</b> care <b>guarantee</b> and deterrent strategies predicted TANF declines; deterrent strategies predicted Medicaid decline and uninsurance increases. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that policies deterring TANF enrollment may contribute to declines in Medicaid and increased uninsurance. To maintain health insurance for the poor, policymakers should consider revising policies that deter TANF enrollment...|$|R
50|$|The Labour Standards Act of September 1947 {{introduced}} {{maternity leave}} for a five weekly mandatory post-natal period, and prohibited dismissal of women during maternity leave and for thirty {{days after the}} end of the leave, although not all workers were covered. In addition, the law provided for equal pay for equal work. The Employment Security Law of November 1947 contained authority for the government to operate a system of free public employment exchanges on a broader and more democratic basis than under the former Employment Exchange Law. It also provided for public services to the handicapped in securing employment, and outlawed labor bosses and other undemocratic forms of labor recruitment. The Child Welfare Law of December 1947 extended special protection to abused, abandoned, and neglected <b>children,</b> <b>guaranteed</b> the privacy rights of children born out of wedlock, established health-care programmes for mothers and children, provided for prenatal care, outlawed the employment of minors in dangerous occupations, and abolished the practice of indentured labour.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the <b>Child</b> which <b>guarantees</b> <b>children</b> certain rights {{including}} the right to be heard in matters that affect them was ratified by Nigeria in 1991. After the ratification and the submission of her initial progress report, the country has domesticated the Convention by passing a law {{on the rights of the}} child. This exploratory study was designed to find out the extent to which primary school pupils in Ile – Ife town were aware of their rights and to explore their views about the exercise of these rights. Data for the study were gathered by the means of semi-structured oral interviews held with 144 pupils in four primary schools in the town. Data analysis showed that the children had very limited awareness of their rights; about three quarters of the children were not willing to exercise their rights mainly because they felt that there was no need for children’s rights and also because of the cultural norms of the Nigerian society. It was concluded that the objectives of the UN Convention on Children’s Rights were yet to be achieved in the schools. Key Words: Children’s participatory rights; primary school children and decision making...|$|R

50|$|In {{regards to}} women, the {{constitution}} denies {{the ability for}} women to pass citizenship onto their children, but men have virtually no barriers to pass citizenship onto their children. A foreign spouse of a Nepali man can obtain Nepali citizenship soon after the marriage; however, {{there is no such}} provision for foreign spouses of Nepali women. Thus, single Nepali women or those married to a foreign spouse are not able to pass citizenship onto their children, which creates a growing group of stateless <b>children</b> without <b>guaranteed</b> access to rights and privileges such as education and health care. Therefore, 2.1 million people will remain stateless in Nepal, and because of the new constitution, that number is expected to grow.|$|R
40|$|Article 6 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the <b>Child</b> <b>guarantees</b> {{to all of}} the world’s {{children}} the right to life, survival and development. The right to life has long featured in international, regional and domestic human rights instruments. By including reference to survival and development, article 6 enriches the basic right to life and addresses a long-standing division in international human rights: that between civil and political rights, on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights, on the other. When the content of the obligations under article 6 is examined in the context of human rights more generally, the immense breadth of its compass becomes apparent. The danger is that, by trying to address “everything”, efforts may become so fragmented that it comes to mean nothing, particularly in countries with very limited resources. That threat can be addressed by prioritising some rights over others, but such an approach is controversial in human rights discourse. Indeed, the Vienna Declaration of 1993 describes human rights as “universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated. ” Does this universality mean that all human rights are equally important, precluding any hierarchy of rights? In seeking an answer to that core question, this article sets the scene for the other articles that follow in this issue by examining what the drafters sought to achieve in article 6 and drilling down into its precise content by exploring it in the wider human rights context and identifying some of the issues highlighted by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in its Concluding Observations on states parties’ periodic reports...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} created to help {{document}} the true {{nature and extent of}} violence against children across the world. Foreword Violence against children occurs every day, everywhere: the slaps of an upset parent to control an ‘unruly’ child, the sexual victimization of a teenager by a peer or a neighbour, the bullying of one child by another in the schoolyard, the emotional degradation of a child bride by her spouse. Too many children worldwide are affected by such violence, yet it is rarely acknowledged, in part because it is so commonplace. The repercussions are not inconsequential, with ripple effects throughout society as well as future generations. Everyday violence may be pervasive, but it is not inevitable. The first step in curbing all forms of violence against children is bringing the issue to light – in all its complexity. Despite the difficulties in measuring violence against children, and considerable gaps, an unprecedented volume of data on the subject has become available {{over the last two decades}} that is providing the evidence countries need to develop effective policies, legislation and programmes to address violence. Solid data and research are essential in bringing the issue out of the shadows. They are also important in revealing hidden attitudes and social norms that may perpetuate violence against children and factors that may place certain children at higher risk. The Convention on the Rights of the <b>Child</b> <b>guarantees</b> that <b>children</b> everywhere should live free from all forms of violence. For this to happen, the true nature and extent of the problem must be documented. It is to that end that this report is dedicated...|$|R
