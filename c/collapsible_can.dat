Alternatively, note that the dunce hat is the CW-complex obtained by gluing the boundary of a 2-cell onto the circle. The gluing map is homotopic to the identity map on the circle and so the complex is homotopy equivalent to the disc. By contrast, it is not collapsible {{because it does not}} have a free face.|$|R
50|$|Buckets <b>can</b> be <b>collapsible</b> or {{rigid and}} vary in {{capacity}} from 72 to 2600 gal. The size of each bucket {{is determined by}} the lifting capacity of the helicopter required to utilise each version. Some buckets can include fire retardant foam or the ability to pump water from the bucket into an internal tank. Smaller <b>collapsible</b> buckets <b>can</b> use water sources as shallow as 1 ft. Worldwide, the term monsoon bucket is widely used and accepted as a generic term. In the United States, this type of bucket is officially referred to as a helibucket.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{conditions}} under which discontinuous mechanical properties of a <b>collapsible</b> tube <b>can</b> induce transcritical flows, i. e. the transition through the critical state where the speed index (analogous to the Mach or the Froude numbers for compressible and free surface flows, respectively) is one. Such a critical transition may strongly modify the flow properties, cause a significant reduction in the cross-sectional area of the tube, and limit the flow. General relationships are obtained for a short segment using a one-dimensional model under steady flow conditions. Marginal curves delimiting the transcritical regions are identified in terms of the speed index and the cross-sectional area ratio. Since there are many examples of such flows in physiology and medicine, we also analyse the specific case of prosthesis (graft or stent) implantation in blood vessels. We then compute transcritical conditions for the case of stiffness and reference area variations, considering a collapsible tube characterized by physiological parameters representative of both arteries and veins. The results suggest that variations in mechanical properties may induce transcritical flow in veins but is unrealistic in arterie...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{occurrence}} of the multiple steady states that flows in a <b>collapsible</b> tube <b>can</b> develop under the effect of: (i) geometrical alterations (e. g. stenosis), (ii) variations of the mechanical properties of the tube wall, or (iii) variations of the external pressure acting on the conduit. Specifically, if the approaching flow is supercritical, two steady flow states are possible in a restricted region of the parameter space: one of these flow states is wholly supercritical while the other produces an elastic jump that is located upstream of the variation. In the latter case the flow undergoes a transition through critical conditions in the modified segment of the conduit. Both states being possible, the actual state {{is determined by the}} past history of the system, and the parameter values show a hysteretic behaviour when shifting from one state to the other. First we set up the problem in a theoretical framework assuming stationary conditions, and then we analyse the dynamics numerically in a one-dimensional framework. Theoretical considerations suggest that the existence of multiple states is associated with non-uniqueness of the steady-state solution, which is confirmed by numerical simulations of the fully unsteady proble...|$|R
40|$|Steady and {{unsteady}} numerical {{simulations of}} two-dimensional flow in a collapsible channel {{were carried out}} to study the flow limitation which typically occurs when the upstream transmural pressure is held constant while flow rate and pressure gradient along the <b>collapsible</b> channel <b>can</b> vary independently. Multiple steady solutions are found {{for a range of}} upstream transmural pressures and Reynolds number using an arclength control method. The stability of these steady solutions is tested in order to check the correlation between flow limitation and self-excited oscillations (the latter being a consequence of unstable steady solutions). Both stable and unstable solutions are found when flow is limited. Self-excited oscillations and divergence instabilities are observed in certain solution branches. The instability of the steady solutions seems to depend on the unsteady boundary conditions used, i. e. on which parameters are allowed to vary. However, steady solutions associated with the solution branch before flow limitation where the membrane wall bulges are found to be stable {{for each of the three}} dierent boundary conditions employed. We conclude that there is no one to one correlation between the two phenomena in this two dimensional channel model. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{buttstock}} is collapsible on the M4 Model (designated 11707) {{but will}} not collapse on the M1014. This is because the M1014 was manufactured before the U.S. 1994 assault weapon ban expired, whereas the M11707 has been manufactured since the ban expired therefore {{not subject to the}} terms under the ban. Collapsing the buttstock shortens the weapon by almost 8 inches, allowing easier storage and transportation; furthermore, it permits better maneuverability around tight corners and over obstacles. The M4 is also available with a fixed stock (pistol grip and semi-pistol grip styles are both available). The M4 is no longer sold today with the skeleton fixed stock (model M11707) to civilians. Benelli only sells the M4 with a fixed pistol grip style tactical stock in the United States. However, the <b>collapsible</b> butt stock <b>can</b> be purchased by civilians in Canada.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reflects}} {{upon the}} position of young men in school. Largely based on empirical, school-based studies in the UK, the paper explores the contours of young masculinities as they manifest themselves in peer group arrangements within educational environments. Studies of youthful masculinity suggest that young men engage in hierarchically organised peer group cultures in which the demonstration of heterosexual masculinity is both a requirement and a resource. The paper document {{the ways in which}} humour, competitive game-playing and homophobia remain key features of heterosexual hierarchies, constantly drawn upon by young men to maintain or enhance their status within the peer group. The pumped up displays of heterosexual masculinity demonstrate the fragile dominance of masculinity as a performance that needs to be constantly invoked and re-established in routine social encounters. The paper argues that competitive and conservative versions of masculinity hold sway in school because they exist as important identity markers in the face of potentially emasculating experiences. Further, the paper considers the recent construction of masculinity as 'in crisis' and draws attention to the limitations of viewing the categories of 'young men' and 'masculinity' as <b>collapsible,</b> that <b>can</b> be characterised by moments of dispossession and 'failure'. The final part of the paper discusses the way in which peer group masculinities appear out-of-step with processes of social change and developments in popular cultures and suggests that psycho-social perspectives may help to understand and theorise the seemingly retrogressive style of contemporary 'lad' culture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{design of}} a pop-up book or card has {{hitherto}} been labour intensive with tasks of trials and errors. The constructions of <b>collapsible</b> pop-up structures <b>can</b> be demanding and inefficient without adequate knowledge of their geometric properties. This paper examines the properties of creases in 90 ° pop-up structures. A 90 ° pop-up structure is one that erects fully when two adjacent base pages, on which it sits, are opened to a right angle. In particular, we define a boundary region for creating 90 ° pop-ups. Similarly, paper folds are able to achieve pop-up effects and can be integrated with 90 ° pop-up constructions. The development of these pop-up structures can be represented graphically. Through this study, a fundamental foundation for pop-up topology and geometry is built. This foundation would be vital for understanding the applications of pop-up making techniques. The mathematical relationships devised would be useful for developing computer-enhanced pop-up design.

40|$|When {{an antenna}} of large {{aperture}} {{is required for}} a small-satellite application, this antenna is most conveniently realized as a <b>collapsible</b> structure.

The lens antenna has particular advantages, because the lens can be realized {{in the form of}} thin copper circuits printed on a flexible membrane. A further advantage of the lens is that it is relatively insensitive to the exact surface profile which is achieved after deployment. Different types of printed structures have been analyzed {{in order to determine the}} optimal design strategy for a printed, collapsible lens. In order to simplify the mechanical design of the collapsible structure itself, a major emphasis of the study has been to arrive at a design for which the electrical performance of the lens is essentially independent of the profile of the lens surface, and also of the distance between this surface and the primary feed device. The electrical performance has been calculated for promising candidate lens designs...|$|R

40|$|Object: A {{collapsible}} segment in the venous outflow {{has been}} noted in many patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Mathematical modeling has shown that these <b>collapsible</b> segments <b>can</b> account for the elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures associated with IIH. However, the model required an elevated outflow resistance of up to 10 times normal to predict the CSF pressures actually found clinically. Measurement of blood flow in patients with IIH has shown that inflow rates vary, with higher rates noted in patients with lesser outflow stenoses. The aim of this work was to extend a simple model of cerebral hydrodynamics to accommodate a collapsible sinus and elevations in cerebral blood flow in accordance with in vivo measurements. Methods: Forty patients with IIH underwent MR imaging in which the degree of stenosis on MR venography was compared with the total blood inflow by using MR flow quantification. The relative outflow resistance in IIH was estimated using the CSF opening pressure. The patients were compared with 14 age-matched control individuals. Results: Patients were divided into 3 groups based on MR venography appearances (minimal stenosis, stenosis of 40 – 70 % and > 70 % stenosis). In vivo measurements suggested a relative resistance elevation of 2. 5 times normal, 4. 2 times normal, and 4. 8 times normal in the 3 groups, respectively. There was an increased inflow of 1. 56 times normal, 1. 28 times normal, and 1. 19 times normal in these groups. Conclusions: The model correctly predicted the CSF pressures noted in vivo, suggesting that high arterial inflow is required for patients with low-grade stenoses to be symptomatic...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{research into}} technological means for addressing two consequences {{of climate change}} for coral ocean acidity and increasing sea surface temperatures leading to coral bleaching. Technology for a multi- integrated response is proposed. Sea surface temperatures can be monitored via satellite and on-line telemetry. Technology for moderating sea surface temperature spikes is based on pumping deeper cool seawater over coral reefs. The technology proposed includes plastic <b>collapsible</b> pipelines that <b>can</b> be deployed like oil spill booms with flat disc pumps and renewable energy devices (tidal turbines) to power the pumps. The technology for counteracting increasing ocean acidity on coral reefs {{is based on the}} Accelerated Weathering of Limestone (AWL). It is proposed that an acceleration of the natural process that restores the carbon balance, can be realized using a modified electrolyzer powered by renewable energy. The AWL process sequesters CO₂ and produces H₂ while generating a buffer solution that increases reef pH and also provides alkalinity to feed reef and shellfish calcification. The AWL buffer solution will be distributed where required using the same renewable energy powered pumps and pipelines as used to mitigate sea surface temperature spikes. The AWL process will operate continuously but can be interrupted whenever the pumps and collapsible pipes are required to avoid potential coral thermal bleaching events.

The weapon uses the [...]338 Norma Magnum round, giving it greater lethality and double the range of the 7.62 NATO round. The LWMMG has a rate of fire of 500 rounds per minute, an effective range of 1,700 meters (1,860 yards), and a maximum range of 5,642 meters (6,170 yards). It weighs 24 pounds, making it only slightly heavier than the M240L, and 3 lb lighter than the M240B. The [...]338NM bullet has over [...] of muzzle energy and is four times more powerful than the 7.62 NATO at 1,000 meters. An individual round is twice as heavy (45.5 grams compared to 24 grams), as are each belt link (8 grams compared to 4 grams). For each weapon to fire for one minute, a belt of 500 [...]338NM rounds would weigh 37.6 kg, while a belt of 800 7.62 NATO rounds would weigh 34.4 kg. The LWMMG is operated by a gas-operated, long-stroke piston with a rotating bolt located under the barrel and fires from an open bolt. It uses “Short Recoil Impulse Averaging” technology, patented by General Dynamics and previously used on their XM806 machine gun, where the entire barrel, barrel extension, gas system, and bolt assembly recoil inside the outer housing. The LWMMG is equipped with a quick-change barrel, quad picatinny rails, <b>collapsible</b> stock, and <b>can</b> be used by dismounted troops or mounted on a platform.|$|R
40|$|Collapsible {{soils are}} weak soils {{that appear to}} be stable in their natural state, {{normally}} dry condition, but rapidly deform under saturation (wetting), thus generating large and unexpected settlements which often yield disastrous consequences for structures unwittingly built on such deposits. In this study, a prediction model for the relative subsidence of stressed collapsible soils based on dielectric permittivity measurement is presented. Unlike most existing methods for soil subsidence prediction, this model does not require moisture content as an input parameter, thus providing the opportunity to obtain accurate estimation of the relative subsidence of collapsible soils using dielectric measurement only. The prediction model is developed based on an existing relative subsidence prediction model (which is dependent on soil moisture condition) and an advanced theoretical frequency and temperature-dependent electromagnetic mixing equation (which effectively removes the moisture content dependence of the original relative subsidence prediction model). For large scale sub-surface soil exploration purposes, the spatial sub-surface soil dielectric data over wide areas and high depths of weak (<b>collapsible)</b> soil deposits <b>can</b> be obtained using non-destructive high frequency electromagnetic (HF-EM) measurement techniques such as ground penetrating radar (GPR). For laboratory or small scale in-situ measurements, techniques such as an open-ended coaxial line with widely applicable time domain reflectometry (TDR) or vector network analysers (VNAs) are usually employed to obtain the soil dielectric data. By using soil dielectric data obtained from small or large scale non-destructive HF-EM investigations, the new model can effectively predict the relative subsidence of weak soils without the need to extract samples for moisture content measurement. Some of the resulting benefits are the preservation of the undisturbed nature of the soil as well as a reduction in the investigation costs and analysis time in the identification of weak (problematic) soils. The accuracy of prediction of the presented model is assessed by conducting relative subsidence tests on a collapsible soil at various initial soil conditions and a good match between the model prediction and experimental results is obtained...|$|R

The ultimate goal is to propose a solution for to facilitate office workers’ emotional recovery and wellbeing while in the workplace. More specifically, our study proposes a developmental concept of the “Aerie”, a bespoke portable and <b>collapsible</b> structure that <b>can</b> be empirical tested in different workplace areas. Its modular design accommodates a range of interactive technologies aiming to improve and maintain personal wellbeing in workplace with minimal lose in working time or productivity. A preliminary literature review has provided some cues about features of an ideal regenerative space; drawing from this existing knowledge, we have developed a conceptual space to test participants’ response to a combination of these features. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate which combination of features could calm individuals through a multi - sensory experience combined with a guided relaxation exercise. Findings from this pilot projects have provided an insight in the design of the “Aerie”. Out of 38 participants, the majority reported that blue/purple lights and rain as white noise were very relaxing features. The mindfulness mediation audio was also well received. Most participants preferred to sit in a small cosy space (such as a corner or bean bags), rather than larger more exposed arrangements, for example chair or sitting-ball. Drawing from these findings, an initial prototype of Aerie was developed; this will be displayed at the Wellbeing conference to demonstrate the principle and verify its feasibility. In the next stage of the project, a working prototype of the Aerie will be built...|$|R
