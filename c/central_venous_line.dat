5000|$|A central venous {{catheter}} (CVC), {{also known}} as a central line, <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>line,</b> or central venous access catheter, is a catheter placed into a large vein. Catheters can be placed in veins in the neck (internal jugular vein), chest (subclavian vein or axillary vein), groin (femoral vein), or through veins in the arms ({{also known as a}} PICC line, or peripherally inserted central catheters). It is used to administer medication or fluids that are unable to be taken by mouth or would harm a smaller peripheral vein, obtain blood tests (specifically the [...] "central venous oxygen saturation"), and measure central venous pressure.|$|E

40|$|Recommendations {{for skin}} {{preparation}} for infection reduction in children: 1. Educational Program and standardization of {{procedures in the}} operating room; risk of infection reduced with education and standardization of care. 2. Wash Hands with alcohol based solutions prior to peripheral IVs, <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>lines,</b> arterial lines; use of gloves (sterile or non-sterile) does not eliminate need to wash hands. 3. Prep with Chlorhexidine gluconate 2 % for children> 2 months of age. 4. Maximum Sterile Barrier Precautions for placement of <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>lines</b> 5. Monitor infection rates of <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>lines</b> placed in the operating room, and monitor adherence to guidelines during insertion. Technologic improvements in catheter design and imaging have facilitated line placement and reduced the risk associated with these devices.

5000|$|As the {{internal}} jugular is large, central and relatively superficial, {{it is often}} used to place <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>lines.</b> Such a line may be inserted for several reasons, such as to accurately measure the <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> pressure or to administer fluids when a line in a peripheral vein would be unsuitable (such as during resuscitation when peripheral veins are hard to locate).|$|R
40|$|Background. The use of <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>lines</b> {{carries a}} {{significant}} risk for serious complications and high economic costs. Lately, the peripherally inserted <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> catheter (PICC) has gained in popularity due to presumed advantages over other <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>lines.</b> The {{aim of this}} systematic literature review was to identify scientific evidence justifying the use of PICC. Material and methods. The literature review was performed according {{to the principles of}} Cochrane Collaboration. The electronic literature search included common databases up to March 2011. Only those studies rated as high or moderate quality were used for grading of evidence and conclusions. Results. The search resulted in 827 abstracts, 48 articles were read in full text, and 11 met the inclusion criteria. None of the articles was classified as high quality and two had moderate quality. The results of these two studies indicate that PICC increases the risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), but decreases the risk for catheter occlusion. The quality of scientific evidence behind these conclusions, however, was limited. Due to the lack of studies with sufficiently high quality, questions such as early complications, patient satisfaction and costs could not be answered. Discussion. We conclude that although PICCs are frequently used in oncology, scientific evidence supporting any advantage or disadvantage of PICC when comparing PICC with traditional <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>lines</b> is limited, apart from a tendency towards increased risk for DVT and a decreased risk for catheter occlusion with PICC...|$|R

40|$|<b>Central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>line</b> {{is one of}} a {{creative}} instrument that saves human’s life in critical medical situation. <b>Central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>line</b> access is frequently involved in the disease management.

40|$|A 4 {{year old}} child was {{referred}} for small bowel transplantation.

30|$|Cases of {{bilateral}} internal jugular thrombosis are rare. The reported cases occurred {{in patients with}} a history of multiple percutaneous catheterization, intravenous drug abuse, trauma, infection or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [3 – 5]. It is hypothesized that the vessels {{in the head and neck}} are less susceptible to thrombosis because the veins are valveless and gravity aids the flow in these vessels. In this case, the reason for bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis was probably due to a combination of the patients history of multiple <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>lines</b> and cancer leading to SVC syndrome.|$|R
30|$|The {{primary safety}} outcome {{measures}} were documented, i.e., significant bleeding and transfusion. Significant bleeding was subdivided into {{major and minor}} bleeding complications. Major bleeding was defined as intracranial, pulmonary, retroperitoneal, or gastrointestinal bleeding found clinically or with imaging techniques. Minor bleeding was defined as bleeding {{at the site of}} puncture for <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>lines</b> or other catheters, the nasopharyngeal zone, epistaxis, or from skin lesions.

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{establish}} the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in 21 children (median age 12 months; range 5 - 132 months) with <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>lines</b> in situ > 3 months (median 10 months; range 3 - 47). Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and echocardiograms were analysed in a retrospective study using ECG and echocardiographic criteria for pulmonary embolism-previously established and validated in adult patients- and standard paediatric ECG values as control data. Patients were scored as having definite (n = 7), probable (n = 5), or no pulmonary embolism (n = 9). Overall 57 % of ECGs showed abnormalities compatible with pulmonary embolism. In two patients, serial ECGs obtained during an acute cardiorespiratory illness showed cumulative changes diagnostic of pulmonary embolism. Eight of 12 patients with abnormal ECGs had echocardiography; in seven of these (88 %) the right ventricular end diastolic diameter was > 2 SD above the mean value for age. Twelve of the patients {{included in this study}} have died; two died following an acute respiratory illness. There was postmortem evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism in both of the two children for whom necropsy information was available. The data suggest that pulmonary embolism is common in children who have <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>lines</b> in situ for > 3 months. Serial studies are of value in some patients. Pulmonary embolism may compromise the long term survival of children with small bowel failure and preclude consideration for liver and small bowel transplantation...|$|R
