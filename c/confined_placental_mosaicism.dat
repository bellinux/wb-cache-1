5000|$|A small {{percentage}} (1-2%) of pregnancies have <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism,</b> where some {{but not all}} of the placental cells tested in the CVS are abnormal, even though the pregnancy is unaffected. Cells from the mother can be mixed with the placental cells obtained from the CVS procedure. Occasionally if these maternal cells are not completely separated from the placental sample, this can lead to discrepancies with the results. This phenomenon is called Maternal Cell Contamination (MCC). [...] CVS cannot detect all birth defects. It is used for testing chromosomal abnormalities or other specific genetic disorders only if there is family history or other reason to test.|$|E
40|$|We {{retrospectively}} investigated six {{cases of}} discrepancy between prenatal fetal karyotype and postnatal findings. In five cases, the chromosomal abnormalities initially found by CVS or amniocentesis were not confirmed by later analyses and postnatal examination. In one case, the fetal karyotype {{found to be}} normal by CVS had to be checked due to sonographic features and clinical anomalies found after birth. In most cases, the normal development on sonographic examination raised the doubt about the abnormal fetal karyotype. Discrepant findings between fetal karyotype results and sonographic findings require great caution in their interpretation and counseling of parents. <b>Placental</b> <b>confined</b> <b>mosaicism</b> {{seems to be the}} most frequent cause of such discrepant results.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the first case}} of mosaic supernumerary marker iso (8 p) displaying a karyotype discordance between chorionic villi (CV) and amniotic fluid (AF) cultures during prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis. In the first trimester, cytogenetic analysis after chorionic villi sampling (CVS) was normal in all metaphases in the short-term cytotrophoblast cell culture, but an undefined supernumerary marker was detected in 60 % of mesenchymal cells in the long-term CV culture. Informed of the mosaicism, the couple selected amniotic fluid sampling as a second-trimester confirmatory diagnostic procedure. The supernumerary marker was absent {{in all of the}} 25 available AF cells metaphases. The prospective parents received genetic counselling and were informed that the discordance could be interpreted as a <b>placental</b> <b>confined</b> <b>mosaicism</b> or as a true foetal mosaicism with low percentage of affected cells. The couple opted to continue the pregnancy. In the second month of life, the child had abnormal development with severe psychomotor delay and frequent episodes of epilepsy. Postnatal cytogenetic extensive re-evaluation discovered that the previously detected supernumerary marker was indeed an isochromosome (8 p) rearrangement present at low frequency in 5 % of the blood lymphocytes.

50|$|However, some pregnancies with CPM {{experience}} prenatal or perinatal complications. The {{pregnancy loss}} rate in pregnancies with <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism,</b> diagnosed by chorionic villus sampling, {{is higher than}} among pregnancies without placental mosaicism. It may be that sometimes the presence of significant numbers of abnormal cells in the placenta interferes with proper placental function. An impaired placenta cannot support the pregnancy and this {{may lead to the}} loss of a chromosomally normal baby. On the other hand, an apparently normal diploid fetus may experience problems with growth or development due to the effects of uniparental disomy (UPD). Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been reported in a number of CPM cases. In follow-up studies adequate postnatal catch-up growth has been demonstrated, which may suggest a placental cause of the IUGR.|$|E
50|$|<b>Confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> (CPM) {{represents}} a {{discrepancy between the}} chromosomal makeup of the cells in the placenta and the cells in the baby. CPM was first described by Kalousek and Dill in 1983. CPM is diagnosed when some trisomic cells are detected on chorionic villus sampling and only normal cells are found on a subsequent prenatal test, such as amniocentesis or fetal blood sampling. In theory, CPM is when the trisomic cells are found only in the placenta. CPM is detected in approximately 1-2% of ongoing pregnancies that are studied by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy. Chorionic villus sampling is a prenatal procedure which involves a placental biopsy. Most commonly when CPM is found it {{represents a}} trisomic cell line in the placenta and a normal diploid chromosome complement in the baby. However, the fetus is involved in about 10% of cases.|$|E
50|$|Specific chromosomes: The {{influence}} of CPM on fetal growth is chromosome specific. Certain chromosomes carry imprinted genes involved in growth or placental function, which {{may contribute to}} impaired pregnancy progress when CPM is detected. Different chromosomes are observed at different frequencies {{depending on the type}} of CPM observed. The pregnancy outcome is strongly chromosome specific. The most frequently seen trisomic cells in <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> involve chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 8 and 16. The next frequently involved are 9, 13, 15, 18, 20 and 22. It has been observed that CPM involving the sex chromosomes usually has no adverse effects on fetal development. The common autosomal trisomies (21, 18, 13) made up a smaller number of cases of mosaicism detected on CVS, but were more often confirmed in fetal tissue (19%). On the other hand, the uncommon autosomal trisomies accounted for a greater number of placental mosaicism cases, but were less often confirmed in fetal tissue (3.2%). When CPM is detected on CVS involving certain chromosomes which are known or suspected to carry imprinted genes, molecular investigations should be performed to exclude fetal UPD. We will explore chromosome specific cases in the chromosome specific section.|$|E

40|$|<b>Confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> is the {{presence}} of an abnormal cell line in the placenta of a fetus having a normal karyotype. It is diagnosed by the detection of both normal and abnormal cell lines in samples of chorionic villi, while only the normal cell line is detected in fetal blood samples and by amniocentesis. Uniparental disomy refers to the transmission of both members of a homologous chromosome pair from the same parent and can be present together with confined placental mosacisim. The prevalence of <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> in the population of idiopatic intrauterine growth retardation varies between 15. 7 % and 25 %. <b>Confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> is also associated with oligohydramnios, spontaneous abortion and fetal loss. Intrauterine growth retardation is most commonly reported in <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> for chromosomes 2, 7, 15 and 16 and in uniparenteral disomy for chromosomes 7, 11, 14, 15 and 16.

40|$|Objective: This {{study is}} aimed at {{prenatal}} diagnosis of a distal 3 p deletion associated with fetoplacental chromosomal discrepancy and <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism,</b> and providing evidence for the limitation of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on placental tissues for molecular cytogenetic characterization of prenatally detected aneuploidy. Case Report: A 30 -year-old woman underwent amniocentesis at 18 weeks of gestation because of maternal anxiety. Results of amniocentesis revealed a distal deletion of chromosome 3 p. A malformed female fetus was delivered at 20 weeks of gestation with brachycephaly and facial dysmorphisms, and a cytogenetic analysis of the cord blood revealed a karyotype of 46,XX,del(3) (p 26. 1),inv(9) (p 12 q 13). A whole-genome aCGH on uncultured cord blood and placental tissue was performed. The aCGH on cord blood revealed a 7. 4 -Mb deletion at 3 p 26. 3 -p 26. 1. However, the aCGH on placental tissue revealed a 32. 42 -Mb gene dosage increase at 3 p 26. 1 -p 22. 1 and a 26. 28 -Mb gene dosage increase at 1 p 36. 33 -p 36. 11 {{in addition to a}} 7. 4 -Mb deletion at 3 p 26. 3 -p 26. 1, indicating <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> for partial trisomy 3 p (3 p 26. 1 →p 22. 1) and mosaicism for partial trisomy 1 p (1 p 36. 33 →p 36. 11). The 7. 4 -Mb deleted region of 3 p 26. 3 -p 26. 1 contained the following genes: CHL 1, CNTN 4, CRBN, LRRN 1, and ITPR 1.

40|$|Finding {{of fetal}} {{chromosomal}} mosaicism complicates genetic counseling, {{as well as}} pregnancy management. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the risk of <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> in short term culture of chorionic villous samples. We conducted a retrospective review of karyotype analysis results obtained after chorionic villous sampling (CVS) in two years period. A 420 samples of chorionic villi were taken transabdominally and obtained by a semidirect method (overnight incubating culture). All fetuses with CVS mosaicism were under the intensive perinatal care. In all cases of chromosome mosaicism the additional karyotyping was performed from fetal blood samples after 22 nd gestational week in order to exclude true fetal mosaicism. After delivery newborns were examined by experienced pediatrician. From 420 analyzed samples in 11 (2, 6 %) cases we found placental mosaicism. No anomalies were seen in genetic sonogram of this fetuses and mosaicism was confirmed only in one case. <b>Confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> (CPM) was found in 2, 1 % (9 / 420) of all analyzed cases, and it made 90 % of all placental mosaicism. In 60 % (6 / 10) of placental mosaicism cases we found mosaicism with single aberrant cell. Trisomy 21 mosaicism was the most frequent aberration found in 30 % of cases. Finding of mosaicism in chorionic villi sample is at special importance for genetic counseling, because every case has to be reveled individually regarding the type and level of mosaicism. Anyway, in every case of placental mosaicism intensive antenatal monitoring is necessary, with additional chromosome analysis from different tissue in consideration of previous findings...|$|E
40|$|The best-known {{situation}} indissolubly {{linked to}} mosaicism is the uniparental disomy where a trisomic or monosomic zygote develops {{at least one}} cell line with 46 chromosomes. The mosaicism normal/abnormal cell lines may remain confined to placenta or persist in the embryo. Here, we describe a second situation that might also be indissolubly linked to a mosaic condition {{or at least to}} a <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism.</b> We analysed the case of a mosaicism del(8 p) /inv dup(8 p) found in prenatal diagnosis. We had already demonstrated that the first product of the abnormal meiotic recombination at the basis of the inv dup rearrangements is a dicentric chromosome. Its breakage leads to the formation of a deleted and an inv dup chromosome. Although we had previously assumed that the dicentric underwent a breakage at meiosis II so that the zygote inherited the inv dup chromosome, our findings and those of others indeed indicate that the dicentric may be inherited in the zygote and that it might persist as such in early postzygotic stages, then undergoing different breakages in different cells leading to different abnormal chromosomes, either deleted or duplicated. Selection versus the most viable cell line(s) results either in a <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> with the inv dup cell line as the only one present in the embryo or in children with both the deleted and the inv dup cell lines. Phenotype/karyotype relationships in inv dup rearrangements must also take into account the influence of the other abnormal cell line during embryogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Background. Noninvasive {{prenatal}} screening (NIPS) is revolutionizing {{prenatal screening}} {{as a result}} of its increased sensitivity, specificity. NIPS analyzes cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) circulating in maternal plasma to detect fetal chromosome abnormalities. However, cffDNA originates from apoptotic placental trophoblast; therefore cffDNA is not always representative of the fetus. Although the published data for NIPS testing states that the current technique ensures high sensitivity and specificity for aneuploidy detection, false positives are possible due to isolated <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism,</b> vanishing twin or cotwin demise, and maternal chromosome abnormalities or malignancy. Results. We report a case of false negative cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening due to fetoplacental mosaicism. An infant male with negative cfDNA screening result was born with multiple congenital abnormalities. Postnatal chromosome and FISH studies on a blood specimen revealed trisomy 13 in 20 / 20 metaphases and 100 % interphase nuclei, respectively. FISH analysis on tissues collected after delivery revealed extraembryonic mosaicism. Conclusions. Extraembryonic tissue mosaicism is likely responsible for the false negative cfDNA screening result. This case illustrates that a negative result does not rule out the possibility of a fetus affected with a trisomy, as cffDNA is derived from the placenta and therefore may not accurately represent the fetal genetic information...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Mosaicism with trisomy {{confined}} to the placenta is present in ~ 1 % of ongoing pregnancies {{at the time of}} chorionic villus sampling.

50|$|Origin of error: Somatic {{errors are}} {{associated}} {{with lower levels of}} trisomy in the placenta and are expected usually to involve only one cell line (i.e.: the trophoblast cells or the villus stroma cells). Somatic errors are thus less likely than meiotic errors to be associated with either ultrasound abnormalities, growth problems or detectable levels of trisomy in small samples of prenatal CVS. Currently, {{there is no evidence that}} somatic errors, which lead to <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> trisomy, are of any clinical consequence. Errors of meiotic origin are correlated with higher levels of trisomy in placental tissues and may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. The cell type in which the abnormality is seen is also an important factor in determining the risk of fetal involvement. The villus stroma or mesenchymal core is more likely than the cytotrophoblast to be reflective of the fetal genotype.|$|R
40|$|Uniparental disomy (UPD) {{describes}} the inheritance of both homologues {{of a pair}} of chromosomes from only one parent.

About 25 % of PWS and 3 %- 5 % of AS are a consequence of UPD with the resulting phenotype generated from the parent of origin of the disomic pair of chromosomes 15.

40|$|Intrauterine growth {{retardation}} (IUGR) {{with or without}} additional abnormalities is recognised as a common feature of maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 16  (mUPD 16) and is usually associated with <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> (CPM). Although {{it is likely that}} the CPM largely contributes to the IUGR, postnatal {{growth retardation}} and other common abnormalities may also be attributed to the mUPD. Five cases with mUPD 16  and CPM were analysed for common regions of isodisomy using polymorphic markers distributed along the length of the chromosome. In each case the aberration was consistent with a maternal meiosis I error. Complete isodisomy was not detected in any of the patients although two patients were found to be mixed with both iso- and heterodisomy. Interestingly, the patient with the greater region of isodisomy was the most severely affected. The fact that there were no common regions of isodisomy in any of the patients supports the hypothesis that imprinted genes, rather than recessive mutations, may play a role in the shared phenotypes.    Keywords: IUGR; mUPD; heterodisomy; isodisom...|$|E
40|$|In most pregnancies the {{chromosomal}} complement {{detected in}} the fetus is also present in the placenta. The detection of an identical chromosomal complement in both the fetus and its placenta has always been expected as both develop from the same zygote. However, in approximately 2 % of viable pregnancies studied by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 9 to 11 weeks of gestation, the cytogenetic abnormality, most often trisomy, is confined to the placenta. This phenomenon is known as <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> (CPM). It was first described by Kalousek and Dill in term placentas of infants born with unexplained intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Contrary to generalised mosaicism, which is characterised {{by the presence of}} two or more karyotypically different cell lines within both the fetus and its placenta, CPM represents tissue specific chromosomal mosaicism affecting the placenta only.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been demonstrated that {{a large percentage of}} in vitro generated human embryos are chromosomally mosaic. The current thesis investigated this mosaicism in greater detail. It characterized the mosaicism present at each stage of preimplantation development in vitro. It examined the relevance of the different forms of the observed mosaicism to preimplantation embryo wastage, implantation failure, and fetal and <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism.</b> Finally, it addressed the identification of the chromosomally mosaic embryos during preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). For each of the studies presented within the thesis, blastomeres from "spare" in vitro generated embryos were assessed for chromosomal content using multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) DNA probes. Mosaicism was detected at all stages of preimplantation development, from the 2 -cell stage to the blastocyst stage; it comprised of diploid, aneuploid, "chaotic", haploid, and polyploid chromosome patterns. Compared to blastocysts, arrested embryos or embryos at the earlier stages of development, showed a much higher incidence of mosaicism involving "chaotic" imbalances for multiple chromosomes and/or high percentages of abnormal cells. These results indicate that extensive post-zygotic abnormalities impair embryonic development to the blastocyst stage. The presence of mosaicism was not predicted by embryo morphology. Mosaicism may therefore contribute to the low rates of blastocyst formation in vitro and to the high rates of implantation failure following cleavage stage embryo transfer. Probe mixtures comprising of three autosomes, of one autosome and gonosomes, or of five autosomes could be applied for the identification of the mosaic embryos during cleavage stage PGD. Culture of isolated blastomeres from cleavage stage embryos for genetic diagnosis increases the number of cells available for analysis; however, the presence of nuclear defects and mosaicism among the cultured cells indic...|$|R
40|$|Because {{products}} of conception often contain maternal and villous tissues, {{the determination of}} maternal and villous genotypes based on genetic polymorphisms can help discern maternal and paternal chromosomal contribution and aid in the diagnosis of hydatidiform moles. Polymorphic deletion probe (PDP) {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) probes based on copy number variants are highly polymorphic and allow in situ determination of genetic identity. By using three informative PDPs on chromosomes 2 p, 4 q, and 8 p, we compared maternal with villous genotypes and determined the ploidy of villous tissue. PDP FISH was performed on 13 complete moles, 13 partial moles, 13 nonmolar abortions, and an equivocal hydropic abortion. PDP FISH permitted definitive diagnosis of complete moles in five of 13 cases for which maternal and villous genotypes were mutually exclusive. A complete mole was highly suspected when all three PDP loci showed homozygous villous genotypes. The diagnosis of a complete mole by PDP FISH yielded a theoretical test sensitivity of 87. 5 %, specificity of 91. 8 %, an observed test sensitivity of 100 %, and specificity of 92. 3 %. Triploidy was observed in all partial moles, in which diandric triploidy was confirmed in six cases.

40|$|SODIUM BUTYRATE {{has been}} {{observed}} to reduce growth rate, alter synthesis of specific proteins and induce biochemical and morphological differentiation, {{in a variety of}} cultured tumour-cell lines (Prasad & Sinha, 1976). Its effects on cell lines of human origin include: (1) induction of erythroid differentiation in leukaemia cells (Andersson et al., 1979); (2) induction of neurite formation in neuroblastoma cells (Prasad & Kumar, 1974); (3) stimulation of synthesis of the glycoprotein hormones FSH and hCG, and of their common a-subunit by HeLa cells (derived from cervical carcinoma) (Ghosh & Cox, 1976, 1977; Lieblich et al., 1977); and (4) stimulation of synthesis of o-subunit by a bronchial-carcinoma line (Chou et al., 1977).

40|$|Uniparental disomy has {{recently}} been recognized to cause human disorders, including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We describe a particularly instructive case which raises important issues concerning the mechanisms producing uniparental disomy and whose evaluation provides evidence that trisomy may precede uniparental disomy in a fetus. Chorionic villus sampling performed for advanced maternal age revealed trisomy 15 in all direct and cultured cells, though the fetus appeared normal. Chromosome analysis of amniocytes obtained at 15 wk was normal in over 100 cells studied. The child was hypotonic at birth, and high-resolution banding failed to reveal the deletion of 15 q 11 - 13, a deletion which is found in 50 %- 70 % of patients with PWS. Over time, typical features of PWS developed. Molecular genetic analysis using probes for chromosome 15 revealed maternal disomy. Maternal nondisjunction with fertilization of a disomic egg by a normal sperm, followed by loss of the paternal 15, is a likely cause of <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> and uniparental disomy in this case of PWS, and advanced maternal age may be a predisposing factor...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} the long-term health {{and development of}} a cohort of children in whom <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> (CPM) was diagnosed at prenatal diagnosis. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed comparing 36 children in whom CPM had been diagnosed prenatally with 195 controls subjects in whom a normal karyotype had been detected prenatally. Data comprising birth information, health, health service utilisation, growth, development, behaviour, and the family were collected by a maternal questionnaire administered when the subjects were aged between 4 and 11 years. Results CPM cases {{did not differ from}} controls across a broad range of health measures and there were no major health problems or birth defects among the CPM group. No increase was detected in the incidence of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) among CPM cases; however, postnatal growth was reduced compared with controls (p = 0. 047). Development and behaviour in CPM cases was similar to that of controls. Conclusions The prenatal diagnosis of CPM is not associated with an increased risk of birth defects or developmental problems, but may be associated with decreased growth.

40|$|Preeclampsia is characterised by new onset {{hypertension}} and proteinuria {{and is a}} major obstetrical problem for both mother and foetus. Haemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome is an obstetrical emergency and most cases occur {{in the presence of}} preeclampsia. Preeclampsia and HELLP are complicated syndromes with a wide variety in severity of clinical symptoms and gestational age at onset. The pathophysiology depends not only on periconceptional conditions and the foetal and placental genotype, but also on the capability of the maternal system to deal with pregnancy. Genetically, preeclampsia is a complex disorder and despite numerous efforts no clear mode of inheritance has been established. A minor fraction of HELLP cases is caused by foetal homozygous LCHAD deficiency, but for most cases the genetic background has not been elucidated yet. At least 178 genes have been described in relation to preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome. <b>Confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> (CPM) is documented to cause early onset preeclampsia in some cases; the overall contribution of CPM to the occurrence of preeclampsia has not been adequately investigated yet.

40|$|An {{increase}} in extremely skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) (⩾ 90 %) among women who experienced recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) {{has been previously}} reported. To further delineate the etiology of this association, we have evaluated XCI status in 207 women who experience RSA. A significant excess of trisomic losses was observed among the women who had RSA with skewed XCI versus those without skewed XCI (P=. 02). There was also a significant excess of boys among live births in this group (P=. 04), which is contrary to expectations if the cause of skewed XCI was only that these women carried X-linked lethal mutations. To confirm the association between skewed XCI {{and the risk of}} trisomy, an independent group of 53 women, ascertained {{on the basis of a}} prenatal diagnosis of trisomy mosaicism, were investigated. Only cases for which the trisomy was shown to be of maternal meiotic origin were included. The results show a significantly higher level of extreme skewing (⩾ 90 %) in women whose pregnancies involved <b>placental</b> trisomy <b>mosaicism</b> (17 %) than in either of two separate control populations (n= 102 and 99) (P=. 02 compared with total control subjects). An additional 11 cases were ascertained on the basis of one or more trisomic-pregnancy losses. When all women in the present study with a trisomic pregnancy (n= 103) were considered together, skewed XCI was identified in 18 %, as compared with 7 % in all controls (n= 201) (P=. 005). This difference was more pronounced when a cutoff of extreme skewing of 95 % was used (10 % vs. 1. 5 % skewed; P=. 002). Maternal age was not associated with skewing in either the patient or control populations and therefore cannot account for the association with trisomy. Previous studies have shown that a reduced ovarian reserve is associated with increased risk of trisomic pregnancies. We hypothesize that the association between skewed XCI and trisomic pregnancies is produced by a common mechanism that underlies both and that involves a reduction of the size of the follicular pool...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} urinary beta-core {{human chorionic gonadotropin}} (beta-core hCG) in {{the detection}} of fetal Down's syndrome (DS) in the first trimester of pregnancy. Urine was collected prior to performing chorionic villous sampling (CVS) between 10 and 12 completed weeks from the last menstrual period. In the 9 months of the study, there were 15 chromosomal abnormalities detected by CVS: five trisomy 21, four monosomy X, two trisomy 18, and four cases of <b>confined</b> <b>placental</b> <b>mosaicism</b> (CPM). In these 15 aneuploid pregnancies, the levels of urinary beta-core hCG were expressed as multiples of the median (MOM) of the ratio of beta-core hCG/creatinine for gestational age. The MOMs of this ratio {{in each of the}} five DS pregnancies were 0. 2, 0. 5, 1. 3, 1. 4, and 1. 7. No difference was found between fetuses with DS {{or any of the other}} chromosomal abnormalities tested and normal fetuses. Contrary to optimistic reports of urinary beta-core hCG in the second-trimester detection of fetal DS, our data suggest that this is not a useful screening test for DS in the first trimester of pregnancy.
