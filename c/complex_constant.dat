2500|$|Example: Suppose {{that the}} {{manifold}} is the circle (thought of as R/Z), and D is the operator d/dx − λ for some <b>complex</b> <b>constant</b> λ. (This is the simplest {{example of an}} elliptic operator.) Then the kernel is the space of multiples of exp(λx) if λ is an integral multiple of 2πi and is 0 otherwise, and the kernel of the adjoint is a similar space with λ replaced by its complex conjugate. [...] So D has index 0. This example shows that the kernel and cokernel of elliptic operators can jump discontinuously as the elliptic operator varies, {{so there is no}} nice formula for their dimensions in terms of continuous topological data. However the jumps in the dimensions of the kernel and cokernel are the same, so the index, given by the difference of their dimensions, does vary continuously, and can be given in terms of topological data by the index theorem.|$|E

The interests, moral and natural, of a community in our highly differentiated civilization are so complex, intricate, delicate and interdependent, {{that you can not}} touch one without affecting all. It is a familiar truth that no law was ever passed that did not have unforeseen results; but of these results, by far the greater number are never recognized as of its creation. The best that can be said of any [...] "measure" [...] is, that the sum of its perceptible benefits seems so to exceed the sum of its perceptible evils as to constitute a balance of advantage. Yet the magnificent innocence of the statesman or philosopher to whose understanding [...] "the whole matter lies in a nutshell"--who thinks he can formulate a practical political or social policy within the four corners of an epigram--who fears nothing because he knows nothing--is constantly to the fore with a simple specific for ills whose causes are <b>complex,</b> <b>constant</b> and inscrutable. To the understanding of this creature a difficulty well ignored is half overcome; so he buttons up his eyes and assails the problems of life with the divine confidence of a blind pig traversing a labyrinth.|$|E

In {{order to}} {{research}} the feasibility of monitoring chromium contaminated field using <b>complex</b> dielectric <b>constant</b> method, {{we designed an experiment}} to compare the soil <b>complex</b> dielectric <b>constants</b> in conditions of different chromium pollution concentration, soil water content and void ratio. The result shows that, the <b>complex</b> dielectric <b>constant</b> of contaminated soil decreases obviously with the increasing frequency. And, when the frequency is lower than 50 MHz, a significant change of the real and imaginary parts of soil <b>complex</b> dielectric <b>constant</b> can be observed. Moreover, with the increasing chromium pollutants concentration, water content and void ratio, both of the real and imaginary parts of soil <b>complex</b> dielectric <b>constant</b> increase as well. With the analysis of the relationship among soil dielectric constant, moisture content, and chromium pollution concentration, we built two soil dielectric constant models on the real quantity and imaginary quantity. Therefore, through the comparison of the real and imaginary quantity of the <b>complex</b> dielectric <b>constant,</b> we could evaluate and monitor the chrome pollutions...|$|R
