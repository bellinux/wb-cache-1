This paper discusses the governance of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> network <b>infrastructure</b> using four building blocks: network planning, ownership, financing and cost allocation. Firstly, the key characteristics of current regulatory arrangements and challenges faced are identified for each building block. Options are proposed jointly to address the identified challenges. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of <b>cross-border</b> electricity <b>transmission</b> and pumped hydro storage on annual dispatch costs, curtailment of variable renewable energy sources (RES) and CO 2 emissions, {{as well as their}} impacts on one another in a power system with a high RES penetration. EUPowerDispatch, a minimum cost dispatch model of the European power system, is used to compare different scenarios with varying <b>cross-border</b> electricity <b>transmission</b> and hydro pumping capacities. The results show that increasing <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> capacity or hydro pumping capacity reduces annual dispatch costs, RES curtailment needs and CO 2 emissions. The study concludes that <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> and hydro pumped storage can be considered as complementary technologies that display a partial substitution effect. JRC.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the extent to which electric vehicle (EV) charging control substitutes the needs for <b>cross-border</b> electricity <b>transmission</b> investment. Method: EUPowerDispatch, a minimum-cost unit commitment dispatch model, is used to compare the impacts of controlled EV charging and <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> for different levels of variable renewable energy sources penetration in two case studies: a conceptual two-node system and the European power system. Results: Results show how both controlled EV charging and <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> capacity reduce electricity dispatch costs, curtailment of variable renewable energy sources (RES), storing energy by utilising pumped hydro, and unserved load. The paper shows that when the demand for arbitrage is low, controlled EV charging can substitute for a certain volume of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> capacity. When demand for arbitrage becomes higher due to higher volumes of RES, the two increasingly complement one another with respect to reducing dispatch costs. The main reason for this is that <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> capacity is needed to transport power to where electric vehicles can absorb it. Conclusion: Demand response, in this case EV charging control, is not only a competitor of <b>cross-border</b> electricity <b>transmission.</b> In the presence of a high volume of RES, they can complement one another. Practical implications: The study presented in this paper provides insights about potential investment decisions that Europe will have to face in order to meet the decarbonisation goals set by the European Commission by 2050. Transmission planners should take into consideration that while demand response and <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> capacity may substitute each other at a limited share of intermittent renewable energy, at a higher share their interactions become more complex as their benefits become dependent on each other.

40|$|Sufficient <b>cross‐border</b> {{electricity}} <b>transmission</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is a pre‐requisite for {{a functioning}} European internal market for electricity. Also, {{the achievement of}} the EU’s energy policy objectives – sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply – critically depends on adequate investment in physical interconnections between the member states. Mainly focusing on the “regulatory path”, this paper assesses different ways to achieve a sufficient level of interconnector investment. In a first step, economic analysis identifies numerous impediments to interconnector investment adding up to an “interconnector investment failure”. Reflecting on the proper regulatory design of an EU framework able to overcome the interconnector investment failure, a number of recommendations are put forward:  All congestion rents should be channeled into interconnector building. Unused rents should be transferred to a European interconnector fund supervised by an EU agency.  Even though inherently sub‐optimal, merchant transmission investment {{can be used as a}} means to put pressure on regulated transmission system operators (TSO) that do not deliver. An EU agency should have exclusive competence on merchant interconnector exemptions.  A European TSO organization should be entrusted with supra‐national network planning, supervised by an EU agency.  The agency should decide on investment cost reallocation for interconnector projects that yield strong externalities. Payments could be settled via a European interconnector fund.  In case of non‐compliance with the supra‐national network plan, the EU agency should have the right to organize a tender – financed by the European interconnector fund – in order to get the “missing link” built. Assessing the existing EU regulatory framework, the efforts of the 2009 “third energy package” to fill the “regulatory gap” with new EU bodies – ACER and ENTSO‐E – are acknowledged. However, striking holes in regulatory framework are spotted, notably with regard to the use of congestion rents, interconnector cost allocation, and the distribution of decision making powers on new infrastructure exemptions A discussion of the TEN‐E interconnector funding scheme shows that massive funding can be an interim solution to the problem of insufficient interconnection capacities while overcoming the political deadlock on sensible regulatory topics such as interconnector cost allocation.

40|$|An {{increase}} in cross-border electricity flows is foreseen in Europe {{in the coming}} decades due to large-scale penetration of renewable energy, the electrical integration of the Euro-Mediterranean region, the electrification of transport, and possible shifts in electricity generation dispatch caused by the evolution of CO 2 prices. This dissertation explores the impacts of possible changes in electricity generation and demand patterns on the need for <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> investment in Europe. The analysis is performed with EUPowerDispatch, a minimum-cost unit commitment dispatch model of the European electricity system which was developed by the author and which constitutes one of the main products of his research. It is concluded that the <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> investment plans that are foreseen by ENTSO-E by 2025 are adequate given the expected evolution of the European power system. However, in order to reach the challenging European power system decarbonisation goal, significantly more <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> investment is needed, in addition to much stronger decarbonisation policies.

In Europe, Flow-based Market Coupling (FMC) is {{the state of the art}} methodology in this regard and is near its implementation in the Central and Western Europe (CWE) region. The CWE transmission system is equipped with power flow controlling devices (PFCs), such as Phase Shifting Transformers (PST), to mitigate loop flows. Such devices can change the flow pattern throughout the system and therefore affect the FMC output. This paper analyzes the potential influence of PSTs in the results of FMC. The FMC algorithm is modified adding PST setting as a variable and illustrated for a 3 -zone example.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the needs for {{investment}} in electricity interconnectors in Europe by 2025. We evaluate the impact of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> capacity on dispatch costs,curtailment needs for renewable energy sources (RES),on CO 2 emissions, on hydrostorage utilisation and on security of supply (in terms of energy not served). The analysis is performed with EUPowerDispatch, a minimum-cost dispatch model. For the evolution of the electricity generation portfolio and electricity consumption we use the latest Scenario Outlook and Adequacy Forecast of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). The model results show that the planned additional <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> capacity between 2010 and 2025 will reduce annual dispatch costs, will have limited impact on the security of supply and will not be a significant cause of variable RES curtailment. However,in case of more RES, it will reduce dispatch costs to a larger extent and will considerably reduce RES curtailment needs, and, if demand grows at the historical rate of 2 %, it will be needed to maintain the current level of security of supply. Moreover,our study shows that hydro pumping and storage and <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> are partly complementary technologies. JRC. F. 3 -Energy securit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: According to the European Commission, Svenska Kraftnät, the Swedish network operator, {{might have}} {{violated}} competition rules by limiting <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> capacity {{to relieve congestion}} within Sweden. Eventually, the case was settled and Svenska Kraftnät offered commitments to address the Commission’s concerns. As an interim remedy, it committed to reduce transmission flow of electricity on internal network bottlenecks primarily by introducing national measures and by not reducing interconnection capacity. As a final remedy, Svenska Kraftnät agreed to split the Swedish market into multiple price zones. Congestion within Sweden would then be solved by adjusting the prices of those zones. We analyse the economic effects of the alleged abuse and the remedy package. We make three observations. Firstly, it might be socially optimal to reduce cross-border capacity in response to internal congestion. Hence, without an in-depth economic analysis the Commission risked preventing efficient behaviour. Secondly, the interim remedy of handling internal congestion primarily by national measures is not socially optimal, and it cannot be ruled out that it reduces overall welfare. Thirdly, even though splitting the market into price zones may improve allocative efficiency within Sweden, it does not prevent Svenska Kraftnät from potential manipulation of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transmission</b> capacity. ...|$|R
