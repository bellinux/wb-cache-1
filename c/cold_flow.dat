25|$|Chemically, transesterified {{biodiesel}} comprises {{a mix of}} mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids. The {{most common}} form uses methanol (converted to sodium methoxide) to produce methyl esters (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Methyl Ester – FAME) {{as it is the}} cheapest alcohol available, though ethanol can be used to produce an ethyl ester (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Ethyl Ester – FAEE) biodiesel and higher alcohols such as isopropanol and butanol have also been used. Using alcohols of higher molecular weights improves the <b>cold</b> <b>flow</b> properties of the resulting ester, at the cost of a less efficient transesterification reaction. A lipid transesterification production process is used to convert the base oil to the desired esters. Any free fatty acids (FFAs) in the base oil are either converted to soap and removed from the process, or they are esterified (yielding more biodiesel) using an acidic catalyst. After this processing, unlike straight vegetable oil, biodiesel has combustion properties very similar to those of petroleum diesel, and can replace it in most current uses.|$|E
25|$|In {{ammunition}} manufacture, swaged bullets are bullets {{manufactured by}} compressing metal {{at room temperature}} into a die to form it {{into the shape of}} a bullet. The other common manufacturing method is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mold. Since metals expand when heated and contract when cooled, cast bullets must be cast with a mold slightly larger than the desired finish size, so that as the molten metal cools, it will harden at just the right point to shrink to the desired size. In contrast, swaged bullets, since they are formed at the temperature at which they will be used, can be formed in molds of the exact desired size. This means that swaged bullets are generally more precise than cast bullets. The swaging process also leads to fewer imperfections, since voids commonly found in casting would be pressed out in the swaging process. The swaging process in reference to <b>cold</b> <b>flow</b> of metals into bullets is the process not of squeezing the metals into smaller forms but rather pressing smaller thinner items to form into shorter and slightly wider shapes.|$|E

40|$|We use cosmological hydrodynamical {{simulations}} of Milky Way-sized halos with different feedback strengths or merger histories {{to investigate the}} formation of X-ray luminous coronae. We show that a galactic corona is not a consequence of hot spherical accretion onto a galaxy but of mergers-induced shock heating and supernova feedback. Coronae grow inside-out and detach galaxies from the filamentary network as they outbalance the pressure of <b>cold</b> <b>flows.</b> Additionally, ram pressure strips <b>cold</b> <b>flows</b> {{at the intersection of}} the two fronts. Coronae thus drive the transition from the cold mode to hot mode accretion. Our results predict the presence of gas at high temperatures even as early as $z= 3 - 4 $, and in halos of much lower mass than the critical mass for hot mode accretion suggested by previous simulations and analytical models (Dekel et al.). All this {{is quite different from the}} standard picture in which diffuse halos are a consequence of the thermalisation of kinetic energy derived from gravity and/or the geometric effect of cross sections of halos vs. filaments, and may be more relevant for halos harbouring typical spiral galaxies. We show that SN feedback impacts the galaxy <b>cold</b> <b>flows</b> connection, which has also consequences for the large-scale gas supply and may contribute to galaxy quenching.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, mysterious blobs of Lyα {{emission}} by hydrogen {{have been discovered}} {{in the vicinity of}} galaxies at early cosmic times 1 − 3. Although a number of possible models were proposed to explain these blobs 4 − 9, none appeared to be consistent with all available data. In a seemingly unrelated frontier, the latest computer simulations of galaxy formation 10 − 11 reveal streams of cold (∼ 104 K) gas feeding the cores of dark matter halos as massive as 1012 – 1013 M⊙. Here we show that the simulated <b>cold</b> <b>flows</b> are spatially extended Lyα sources with luminosities, Lyα line widths, and abundances that {{are similar to those of}} observed Lyα blobs.

40|$|Simulations {{predict that}} galaxies grow {{primarily}} through the accretion of gas {{that has not}} gone through an accretion shock near the virial radius and that this <b>cold</b> gas <b>flows</b> towards the central galaxy along dense filaments and streams. There is, however, little observational evidence {{for the existence of}} these <b>cold</b> <b>flows.</b> We use a large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation that has been post‐processed with radiative transfer to study the contribution of <b>cold</b> <b>flows</b> to the observed z= 3 column density distribution of neutral hydrogen, which our simulation reproduces. We find that nearly all of the H I absorption arises in gas that has remained colder than 105. 5  K, at least while it was extragalactic. In addition, the majority of the H I is falling rapidly towards a nearby galaxy, with non‐negligible contributions from outflowing and static gas. Above a column density of Graphic cm− 2, most of the absorbers reside inside haloes, but the interstellar medium only dominates for Graphic cm− 2. Haloes with total mass below 1010 M⊙ dominate the absorption for Graphic cm− 2, but the average halo mass increases sharply for higher column densities. Although very little of the H I in absorbers with Graphic cm− 2 resides inside galaxies, systems with Graphic cm− 2 are closely related to star formation: most of their H I either will become part of the interstellar medium before z= 2 or has been ejected from a galaxy at z > 3. <b>Cold</b> accretion <b>flows</b> are critical for the success of our simulation in reproducing the observed rate of incidence of damped Lyman‐α and particularly that of Lyman limit systems.

In this paper we show that if > 20 % of the gravitational binding energy of the gas is radiated away, then the simulated <b>cold</b> <b>flows</b> are spatially extended Lyman Alpha (Lya) sources with luminosities, Lya line widths, and number densities that are {{comparable to those of}} observed Lya blobs. Furthermore, the filamentary structure of the <b>cold</b> <b>flows</b> can explain the wide range of observed Lya blob morphologies. Since the most massive halos form in dense environments, the association of Lya blobs with overdense regions arise naturally. We argue that Lya blobs - even those which are clearly associated with starburst galaxies or quasars - provide direct observational support for the cold accretion mode of galaxies. We discuss various testable predictions of this association. Comment: MNRAS in press. 13 pages, 6 figures. Discussion + references added. Main conclusions unaffecte...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{exchanger}} optimization is {{a significant}} aspect of mesoscale combustor development which utilizes heat recirculation principle. Spiral heat exchangers (SHEs) are usually employed for this purpose. The two commonly used spiral geometries are rectangular spiral and Archimedean spiral. However, there is a non-availability of research data regarding the relative merits and demerits of these two geometries, in particular their heat transfer performance in small scales. Comparison cannot be made using conventional heat exchanger equations and correlations because of the invalidity of the basic assumptions in small scales. In the present work comparison between these two geometries were performed using CFD simulations {{with the aid of}} a RANS type software code. The geometries considered are based on a mesoscale combustor developed in our previous study using propane-air combustion.

40|$|Two of the {{dominant}} channels for galaxy mass assembly are <b>cold</b> <b>flows</b> (<b>cold</b> gas supplied via the filaments of the cosmic web) and mergers. How these processes combine in a cosmological setting, at both low and high redshift, to produce the whole zoo of galaxies we observe is largely unknown. Indeed {{there is still much}} to understand about the detailed physics of each process in isolation. While these formation channels have been studied using hydrodynamical simulations, here we study their impact on gas properties and star formation (SF) with some of the first from simulations that capture the multiphase, cloudy nature of the interstellar medium (ISM), by virtue of their high spatial resolution (and corresponding low temperature threshold). In this regime, we examine the competition between <b>cold</b> <b>flows</b> and a supernovae(SNe) -driven outflow in a very high-redshift galaxy (z ~ 9) and study the evolution of equal-mass galaxy mergers at low and high redshift, focusing on the induced SF. We find that SNe-driven outflows cannot reduce the cold accretion at z ~ 9 and that SF is actually enhanced due to the ensuing metal enrichment. We demonstrate how several recent observational results on galaxy populations (e. g. enhanced HCN/CO ratios in ULIRGs, a separate Kennicutt Schmidt (KS) sequence for starbursts and the population of compact early type galaxies (ETGs) at high redshift) can be explained with mechanisms captured in galaxy merger simulations, provided that the multiphase nature of the ISM is resolved...|$|R

The counter flow toroid is the most promising because it has the best stability and theoretically prevents mixing of the fissile fuel and propellant more effectively than the aforementioned concepts. In this design, the fissile fuel is kept mostly in a base injection stabilized recirculation bubble by hydrodynamic confinement. Most designs utilize a cylindrical gas core wall for ease of modeling.

As cold accretion is the main driver for gas velocity dispersion in our model, star formation efficiency parallels cold accretion rates, and allows fast conversion into stars. At z ∼ 2, we find a space density 10 − 4 Mpc − 3 in star-forming galaxies with ˙ M ∗> 120 M ⊙ yr − 1, in better agreement than earlier estimates form SAMs. However, the fundamental relation between ˙ M∗ and M ∗ is still offset from the observed relation, indicating the need for possibly more efficient star formation at high z perhaps associated with a role for AGN triggering...|$|R
