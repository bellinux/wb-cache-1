5|$|The {{smoke and}} {{airborne}} particulates from the fires posed {{a threat to}} local communities on several occasions. Smoke and particulates were especially high in Gardiner, Montana. There, monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate <b>concentrations</b> <b>were</b> exceeded. This was also the case near fires, and on 7 occasions at Mammoth, Montana, {{the location of the}} park headquarters. In no other surrounding communities were particulates found to be above acceptable levels. Smoke and haze made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous.

25|$|Clonazepam is lipid-soluble, rapidly {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier, and penetrates the placenta. It is {{extensively}} metabolised into pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Clonazepam is metabolized extensively via nitroreduction by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C19 {{and to a}} lesser extent CYP3A4. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, cimetidine, and grapefruit juice are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and can affect the metabolism of benzodiazepines. It has an elimination half-life of 19–60 hours. Peak blood concentrations of 6.5–13.5ng/mL were usually reached within 1–2 hours following a single 2mg oral dose of micronized clonazepam in healthy adults.
