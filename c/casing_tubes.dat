40|$|At present, the aeration-assisted cutting-carrying {{technology}} {{is faced with}} complexities in the drilling of CBM multi-branch horizontal wells. For example, the aerating pressure is hardly maintained, and the borehole instability may happen. In view of these prominent problems, the technology of double <b>casing</b> <b>tubes</b> & a binary cycle system suitable for CBM multi-branch horizontal wells was developed according to the Venturi principle by means of parasitic tube insufflation which is used for well control simulation system. Then, a multiphase flow finite element model was established for the fluid-cutting particle system in this drilling condition. This technology was tested in field. Double-casing tubes cementing is adopted in this technology and a jet generator is installed {{at the bottom of}} the inner casing. In the process of drilling, the drilling fluid injected through double intermediate casing annulus is converted by the jet generator into a high-efficiency steering water jet, which, together with the water jet generated by the bit nozzle, increases the fluid returning rate in the inner annulus space. It is indicated from simulation results that the cutting-carrying effect is the best when the included angle between the nozzle of the jet generator and the vertical direction is 30 °. Besides, the influential laws of cutting size, primary cycle volume, accessory cycle volume and drilling velocity on hole cleaning are figured out. It is concluded that this technology increases the flow rate of drilling fluid in annulus space, the returning rate of drilling fluid significantly and the cutting-carrying capacity. It is currently one of the effective hole cleaning technologies for CBM multi-branch horizontal wells where fresh water is taken as the drilling fluid...|$|E
40|$|As {{the shallow}} and easily {{accessible}} {{oil and gas}} reservoirs are becoming depleted, {{the oil and gas}} industry has turned its attention towards the deeper and more remote reservoirs. The increased drilling depth, more complex well paths and tougher drilling conditions have pushed the limits of traditional drilling methods. Longer drill strings and increased amount of rotation hours have been found to wear out the well-supporting <b>casing</b> <b>tubes</b> at alarming rates. A measure to deal with these problems have for many years been to apply wear-resistant hardbanding materials on the drill string. Hardbanding materials were in the earlier years developed by trial and error, but now a days full-scale testing is most commonly used. However, full-scale testing is expensive, difficult to control and time consuming. The aim of this master thesis has thus been to design a lab-scale hardbanding/casing wear test setup, able to reproduce already known full-scale wear mechanisms with the use of close-to-field parameters. A lab-scale pin-on-ring setup were designed and proved able to reproduce many of the wear mechanisms from the full-scale tests. Adhesive wear by galling, which is regarded as the most important wear mechanism with respect to wear rate, was found on many of the casing samples by the presence of work-hardened surface layers. Abrasive wear was most prominent at low contact pressures and at large sand quantities in the system. Fatigue wear, the third mechanism known from full-scale tests, was only present in the most brittle hardbanding samples. It was concluded that the test duration of 15 minutes was too short for this type of wear to evolve. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of energy-absorbing cable, Constant-Resistance Large Deformation cable (CRLD cable) with three {{different}} specifications, has been recently developed and tested.

40|$|AbstractRegarding the {{geological}} storage of CO 2 in aquifers or in depleted gas fields, the reactivity {{of the well}} casing left in the abandoned well is important in order to investigate the potential for leakage. The corrosion behavior of the <b>casing</b> steel <b>tube</b> was investigated in highly pressurized CO 2 environments. The corrosion test of the J 55 and N 80 steel tube in API specification 5 CT was conducted. Those steel tubes have been frequently used as <b>casing</b> <b>tube</b> and are found in abandoned natural gas wells. The following test conditions were achieved with the autoclave apparatus: temperature at 50 to 70 °C, CO 2 pressure at 5 to 18 MPa with/without the impurities of 20 ppm H 2 S and 2000 ppm CO, in/above stagnant 0. 5 M NaCl solution of simulated formation water. The test durations were 100, 300 and 1000 hours. After the corrosion test, the specimens were analyzed by Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry and X-ray diffractometry. The specimens {{were found to be}} covered mainly with FeCO 3, which is considered to be formed from dissolved Fe 2 + and environmental CO 2. The corrosion rate was evaluated via the weight loss of the specimens after the removal of the surface corrosion products, containing FeCO 3. No significant differences were observed between J 55 and N 80 in terms of FeCO 3 formation and corrosion weight loss. It was found that the weight loss by corrosion, around 100 mg/cm 2 after 100 hours, was remarkably large when the specimen was placed in the solution and was, in contrast, two orders of magnitude smaller when the specimen was above the solution. In the case with the impurities of 20 ppm H 2 S and 2000 ppm CO, the weight loss in the solution was less relative to the pure CO 2 condition. The weight loss in the solution reached a plateau in initial 100 hours, and was only slightly increased in the 300 - and the 1000 -hour tests. The ‘plateau’ was considered to be due to the protective effect of the FeCO 3 formed on the specimen. Considering the protective effect of the FeCO 3, the corrosion of the steel casing {{over a long period of}} time is small under the stagnant condition, and would be expected to remain in place with little structural degradation...|$|R

30|$|To {{access the}} quality of the {{groundwater}} of the present area 36 bore wells were located covering the whole study area more or less uniformly (Fig.  1). Ground water samples were collected from all 36 locations in the field in both pre-monsoon (April 2012) and post-monsoon (October 2012) time. The bore wells were pumped for some time before collecting water samples so as to eliminate the residual water in the <b>casing</b> <b>tube</b> of the well and to obtain fresh water directly from the aquifer. Dry, clean and sterilized plastic bottles were used to get fresh aquifer water for sampling. Water samples were collected in air tight preconditioned high-density polythene bottles of 500  ml capacity. All bottles were thoroughly washed and rinsed with water before collecting ground water samples. The polythene bottles were completely filled without any air bubble before sealing the cap. The locations from where water samples have been collected are marked on the study area map by hand held portable Global Positioning System (GPS) device. GPS provides us with longitude, latitude and elevation with respect to mean sea level (MSL) of the location.

30|$|Recently, {{efforts have}} been taken to study the sealing {{properties}} of packer rubber through theoretical calculation, numerical simulation and experimental methods. The materials and the structure are the important factors that affect the sealing properties of the packer rubber. Zhu et al. (2017) made comparisons on the mechanical performances and morphology of three kinds of rubber materials (NBR, HNBR and FKM) before and after corrosion experiments, and the results showed that the tensile properties decreased significantly and the hardness also reduced after corrosion. He et al. (2016) investigated hydrogenated nitrile–butadiene rubber (HNBR) with a Rubber Processing Analyzer RPA- 2000 and conducted stress–strain tests in both elongation and compression modes. In order to reflect the applications of packers, all the mechanical properties were tested at both room temperature (RT) and 150  °C. Zeng et al. (2012) carried out tests on AFLAS rubber (a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and propylene) using a HPHT autoclave in harsh environments (60  MPa, 175  °C, test period 7  days and different corrosive gases) and analyzed the changes in properties. Atkinson et al. (2001) and Guo et al. (2011) analyzed the touch stress and pressure in the inner wall of the rubber part with nonlinear finite element analysis and optimized the rubber wall thickness through some advantaged plans to bear much stronger stress. Ma et al. (2014) and Qu (2016) constructed a finite element simulation model of double elastomeric packing elements in a packer using ANSYS software and analyzed the influences of different friction coefficients, the loading model and the different angles of the tilted end of the packing element on the varying patterns of contact stress between the packing element and the casing pipe. Polonsky and Tyurin (2015) came up with a new structure design for packers after discussing several designs aiming at enhancing sealing reliability and considering the packers’ working conditions. In order to solve the technical problems of deep wells and complex formations, James et al. (2013) improved the temperature resistance and the pressure resistance of the permanent production packer from 69  MPa and 121  °C to 138  MPa and 132  °C after many years of studies. Zhang et al. (2011) and Wang et al.

The goal of this project was to develop a detailed computer simulation tool for GSHP (ground source heat pump) heating and cooling systems. Two such tools were developed as part of this DOE (Department of Energy) grant; the first is a two-dimensional computer program called GEO 2 D and the second is a three-dimensional computer program called GEO 3 D. Both of these simulation tools provide an extensive array of results to the user. A unique aspect of both these simulation tools is the complete temperature profile information calculated and presented. Complete temperature profiles throughout the ground, <b>casing,</b> <b>tube</b> wall, and fluid are provided as a function of time. The fluid temperatures from and to the heat pump, as a function of time, are also provided. In addition to temperature information, detailed heat rate information at several locations as a function of time is determined. Heat rates between the heat pump and the building indoor environment, between the working fluid and the heat pump, and between the working fluid and the ground are computed. The heat rates between the ground and the working fluid are calculated as a function time and position along the ground loop. The heating and cooling loads of the building being fitted with a GSHP are determined with the computer program developed by DOE called ENERGYPLUS. Lastly COP (coefficient of performance) results as a function of time are provided. Both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional computer programs developed as part of this work are based upon a detailed finite volume solution of the energy equation for the ground and ground loop. Real heat pump characteristics are entered into the program and used to model the heat pump performance. Thus these computer tools simulate the coupled performance of the ground loop and the heat pump. The price paid for the three-dimensional detail is the large computational times required with GEO 3 D. The computational times required for GEO 2 D are reasonable, a few minutes for a 20 year simulation. For a similar simulation, GEO 3 D takes days of computational time. Because of the small simulation times with GEO 2 D, a number of attractive features have been added to it. GEO 2 D has a user friendly interface where inputs and outputs are all handled with GUI (graphical user interface) screens. These GUI screens make the program exceptionally easy to use. To make the program even easier to use a number of standard input options for the most common GSHP situations are provided to the user. For the expert user, the option still exists to enter their own detailed information. To further help designers and GSHP customers make decisions about a GSHP heating and cooling system, cost estimates are made by the program. These cost estimates include a payback period graph to show the user where their GSHP system pays for itself. These GSHP simulation tools should be a benefit to the advancement of GSHP systems...|$|R

40|$|Thermo-mechanical {{processing}} is used {{to produce}} anisotropic Nd 2 Fe 14 B based permanent magnets having high energy products. Among thermo-mechanical processing methods, equal channel angular pressing has a potential to be an alternative method to die-upsetting which is most commonly used owing to its effectiveness in grain alignment. Moreover, ECAP allows virtually unlimited strain and manipulation of texture by processing route since the cross-section of the sample does not change during pressing. For the first time, a detailed investigation was done {{on the effect of}} ECAP-BP process on the magnetic properties and macrotexture of the Nd 2 Fe 14 B based permanent magnets. The relationship between texture formation and alignment of the easy axis is established by studying the texture and magnetic properties of the sample after pressed by ECAP-BP. ECAP-BP process was performed on MQP 13 - 9, MQP 15 - 7 and MQU-F 1 (Nd 13. 5 Fe 73. 8 Co 6. 7 B 5. 6 Ga 0. 4) commercial melt-spun isotropic alloys. The effectiveness of ECAP-BP was more dominant in MQU-F 1 product since it`s almost stoichiometric Nd 2 Fe 14 B whereas MQP products are sub-stoichiometric. The best magnetic properties and texture formation was observed when the MQU-F 1 powders were pressed at 773 K with a fixed back pressure of 0. 5 GPa. The (001) pole figure for this sample shows a high intensity of 5. 5 located at about 30 ° from PD towards the pole which corresponds to the exit direction of ECAP. Hence, the c axis of the Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains appears to align about 60 ° from ED towards PD, this direction of the c axis alignment is approximately right angles away from the shear band associated with the ECAP process. Following the identification of the easy axis direction by the macrotexture analysis, a cube specimen was cut from the exit channel section with one of the cube edge directions parallel to the c axis texture direction. The highest remanent magnetization (107. 3 Am 2 /kg) is obtained when the field is applied along the c axis texture direction and the maximum energy product [(BH) max] measured along this axis is 156. 7 kJ/m 3 while the (BH) max value is 99. 6 kJ/m 3 for the isotropic powder sample, demonstrating the benefit of the texture development upon equal-channel angular pressing. After confirming the effectiveness of ECAP-BP on the Nd 13. 5 Fe 73. 8 Ga 0. 4 Co 6. 7 B 5. 6 powders, different processing parameters effect on the magnetic properties and macrotexture were investigated. Temperature and back pressure were changed systematically. Temperature effect was studied with pressings at 723 K, 773 K and 823 K with a fixed back pressure of 0. 5 GPa. The die used in this project was made of tool steel, so the upper limit for the maximum processing temperature was 823 K. Back pressure effect was tested at 773 K and 823 K by changing it from 0. 3 GPa to 1. 3 GPa. The upper limit was determined by the upper punch used as the punch cannot carry pressures higher than 5. 0 GPa. It is observed that rather than back pressure, the difference between forward and back pressures is more effective on the magnetic properties and texture of the MQU-F 1 sample pressed by ECAP. Moreover, the change in processing temperature is more influential to the magnetic properties when the effect of these two processing parameters is compared. Multiple passes were studied by following Route A and Route C at 823 K with a back pressure of 0. 5 GPa. After the second passage of the sample following Route A, due to no rotation of the sample between each pass, the shear band was elongated and the 001 pole figure of this sample shows an extended texture formation about 60 °- 900 from ED towards PD. The coercivity measured along the PD was smaller than that of single pressed sample, indicating the grain refinement after each pass with ECAP process. Sample pressed twice with Route C, 1800 rotation of the sample after each pass around its axis, lost the extent of the texture imposed after the first pass as shear band restores itself at every even numbered passage with Route C. This yields to a lower remanence magnetization and maximum energy product of the sample. Route A has a potential to increase the grain alignment if tried more than twice. Copper <b>tube</b> <b>casing</b> was studied by sealing powders in the copper tubes prior to press. As a result of decreased friction when using copper <b>tube</b> <b>casing,</b> much higher back pressures, 2. 3 GPa was tried. Still, a compaction problem was observed with copper <b>tube</b> <b>casing</b> as the pressures were not enough and copper was filling the dead zone which is the channels intersection part. As a result, the intersection angle was not anymore 900 for the actual powder. The effect of ECAP-BP was lost when using copper <b>tube</b> <b>casing,</b> the remanence measured along PD was around 82 Am 2 /kg whereas it is around 104 Am 2 /kg for the sample pressed by conventional ECAP-BP. More studies should be done with increasing temperature, or doing multiple passes and increasing the strain imposed into the sample. To apply suggested work, firstly computer controlled ECAP die in which it is possible to control not only the forward and back pressures but also the speed of the upper and back punches should be used. ...|$|R
2500|$|On 17 August 1985, Reyat {{became a}} third suspect once the receipt for the tuner {{was found with}} his name. On 6 November 1985, the RCMP raided the homes of {{suspected}} Sikh separatists Parmar, Reyat, Gill and Johal. [...] In a 4 1/2-hour interview, Reyat denied all knowledge of the test blast or even Parmar. After he was told the CSIS had seen both of them, he changed his story that Parmar really {{wanted to build a}} device powerful enough so that he could take the device back to India to destroy a bridge. He explained that the gunpowder in the test was a failure as the device fizzled. The search of Reyat's house produced a carton with an unusual green tape also found in the Narita blast and a can of Liquid Fire-brand starting fluid matching fragments found at the blast site, along with blasting caps and dynamite, including a pound of dynamite in a bag taken out its original <b>tube</b> <b>casing,</b> though none was consistent with blast residue. Reyat insisted only the clock, relays and tuner had been purchased for other than [...] "benign purposes". There was insufficient evidence to hold Parmar as charges were dropped days later.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{downhole}} {{heat exchangers}} (DHE) in {{the exploitation of}} geothermal resources is characterized by an absence of mass withdrawal from the aquifer. Although this peculiarity reduces installation costs it also imposes limits on the heat ¯ow withdrawable (generally less than 100 kW), and, therefore, {{on the use of}} DHEs in small applications such as greenhouses, small buildings or thermal baths. For this reason DHEs are mainly used in super®cial geothermal aquifers (up to 30 mdepth), usually with liquid-phase water at temperatures greater than 60 °C. A study has been made of the influence of the position of the casing slotted section within an aquifer on the heat withdrawal rates using DHEs. This study numerically simulates an aquifer using the finite-element method to determine the heat flow that can be withdrawn by the DHE when the slotted section position is varied within a geothermal aquifer. The simulations carried out also enable us to determine the influence of the main characteristics of the aquifer and the extraction plant on the design of the <b>tube</b> <b>casing</b> slotted section. On the basis of the numerical results obtained, a particular configuration of slotted section is proposed where this is subdivided into different sections, one placed in {{the lower part of the}} aquifer and the other in the upper part. The results obtained have shown that this configuration optimizes the heat flow drawn by the DHE from the geothermal aquifer. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|By far {{the most}} {{innovative}} feature aboard the Columbia were her Edison incandescent light bulbs. If a passenger wanted his or her light turned off, a steward had to be summoned, who would unlock a rosewood box outside the cabin and turn the light off. All the lights {{were placed in the}} main salons and staterooms only. The passenger accommodations and luxuries aboard Columbia were designed to greatly surpass anything seen on previous liners along the Pacific coastline. Scientific American later published a large article describing the Edison lighting system aboard Columbia. All 120 light bulbs were connected via separate circuits to four 6 kilowatt Edison A Type [...] "long legged Mary-Ann" [...] dynamos, producing power via a belt drive connection to the main engines. The fourth dynamo was used to boost the magnetic fields of the other three and operated at a lower voltage. All four dynamos included two bipolar magnets along with lead wires that produced the multiple circuits. Each dynamo was capable of powering 60 light bulbs. Due to the lack of instrumentation, adjusting the voltage was judged by the brightness of light bulbs in the engine room. The wiring insulation was molten parafin and cotton mix inside a rubber <b>tube</b> <b>casing.</b> The wires were also painted two separate colors to differentiate the negative and positive charges. Overall, the electrical systems aboard the Columbia held little difference from its Menlo Park counterparts. Oil lamps were readily available throughout the vessel in case of a power outage.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the distribution of leakage radiation from two unshielded diagnostic-type X-ray tube housings. This information was used to determine the shielding required in the housings to bring them into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing, as set forth by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements in Report No. 33. Two special diagnostic X-ray tube units were used, one containing a rotating anode tube and the other a stationary anode tube. The only shielding supplied was that provided by the steel, oil-containing <b>tube</b> <b>casing</b> which surrounds the X-ray tube. A measurement of the distribution of leakage radiation on a sphere of one meter radius about the focal spot of the X-ray tube was made on each tube when the tube was operated at its maximum rated continuous current for its maximum rated operating voltage. From the leakage radiation measured, the thickness of lead shielding required to bring the X-ray tube housing into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing was calculated. Lead shielding was placed on each of the X-ray tube housings, and measurements were made to determine if each housing was then in compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing. As a result of this study, it was found that the distribution of leakage radiation from an unshielded diagnostic-type tube housing is non-uniform. The amount and location of shielding required in the housing is dependent upon the distribution of the leakage radiation, and is, therefore, a function of the design and rating of the X-ray tube used in the housing...|$|R
40|$|Hydropower is a {{versatile}} renewable {{source of power}} generation able to change rapidly operating conditions. Hydropower plants may today work over a larger operating range than designed for due {{to the introduction of}} renewable sources of energy and the deregulation of the electricity market. Such operating conditions may involve large stresses and losses due to complex unsteady and transient flow phenomena, which have {{to be taken into account}} under design or refurbishment phase. The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the design and refurbishment process is becoming increasingly popular due to its flexibility, detailed flow description and cost-effectiveness comparing to model testing used since a century in the development of turbines. However, issues have still to be resolved due to the combined flow physics involved in hydropower machines such as partly separated flow at curved surfaces, vortices, unsteadiness, swirl flow, strong adverse pressure gradients, convoluted geometry as well as numerical artefacts. Therefore, experimental data in such complicated systems are required to validate numerical simulations and develop more accurate models. The first part of this thesis is a numerical investigation of the three-dimensional flow of the axial Hölleforsen model spiral casing and distributor, where the influence of the penstock on the flow is analysed using different turbulence models and inlet boundary conditions. Comparisons with experimental results indicate the importance of the penstock to perform accurate simulation in the present case. Therefore, detailed inlet boundary conditions are necessary to simulate accurately the spiral casing flows if the penstock is not included in the simulation. The second part of the thesis focuses on an experimental investigation of an axial hydropower turbine model known as Porjus U 9. The measurements are part of a project aiming to investigate experimentally the flow in different regions of the machine to build a data bank in order to validate numerical simulations and study scale-up efficiency between model and prototype, since the corresponding prototype is available for similar experiments. The investigation was performed at 3 different working points: part load, best efficiency point and high load. The inlet flow of the spiral casing as well as some sections in the spiral <b>casing</b> and draft <b>tube</b> are investigated with a two components laser Doppler anemometer (LDA). To improve the signal quality and measurement accuracy refractive index matching optical box was mounted on the circular pipe of the spiral casing inlet. LDA result of the mean velocities and corresponding RMS are presented to investigate the flow before the runner and at the inlet of the spiral casing, since the flow is influenced by the existence of a bend before the inlet. The results of the draft tube measurements are also presented. Good quality data are obtained for initial boundary conditions at the inlet of the casing and drafttube cone to perform numerical simulations.
