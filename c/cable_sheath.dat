The {{purpose of this}} paper is to find an optimal configuration of the power cable system, taking into account electric shock hazard and ability of the system to transfer maximal power. A computer simulations on a computer model of the local power system, comprising high voltage power cables, were carried out. This model enables to analyse various configurations of the metallic <b>cable</b> <b>sheaths</b> bonding and earthing (single-point bonding, both-ends bonding, cross-bonding) and their impact on induced voltages in the <b>cable</b> <b>sheaths.</b> The analysis presented in the paper shows, that it is possible to find an optimal configuration of the complicated power cable system, in terms of electric shock hazard, maximal power transfer as well as economic aspects...|$|R
40|$|Single-core {{underground}} {{power cables}} with two-points bonding induce currents in their metallic sheaths. The sheath induced currents are undesirable and generate power losses {{and reduce the}} cable ampacity. This paper {{has shown that the}} values of the sheath losses in some cases could be greater than conductor losses, depending on various factors. Such these factors are type of cable layouts, cable parameters, <b>cable</b> spacing, <b>sheath</b> resistance, phase rotation, conductor current and cable armoring. In this paper the above factors have been investigated. The calculations are carried out depending mainly on IEC 60287 by a proposed computer program using MATLAB.

50|$|Traditional {{underground}} high-tension cables {{are constructed}} either with internal oil ducts or channels {{or by the}} use of a pipe through which the insulated conductor is installed. In either design the system is then filled with pressurised, de-gassed oil. The oils primary function is to improve the insulating properties of the cable but occasionally leaks can occur through cable joints, oil system fittings or <b>cable</b> <b>sheath</b> damage. The leak is initially identified by the loss of liquid from the system, but its location used to involve engineers digging up the road, freezing a section of cable and seeing if the level was still going down, then choosing a new point to dig and re-freeze. It could take several holes to isolate the leak. If a PFT is injected into the oil, there will be a relatively high concentration of PFT above the leak, which can be pin-pointed to within a few feet, requiring only a single hole to be dug right where the leak is.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWire {{and cable}} fire {{has become the}} major cause of fire {{disaster}} in China. Effective evaluation {{and analysis of the}} flammability of cables are critical for developing new flame retardant cable materials by the industry and testing cables which have already been used in the market. Due to the complex internal structure of cable, it is difficult to investigate the complete pyrolysis and combustion of the <b>cable</b> <b>sheath</b> by using the Cone calorimeter and full-scale experiment. The recently developed pyrolysis combustion flow calorimeter (PCFC) is able to measure the vital information for evaluating the flammability of <b>cable</b> <b>sheath</b> using samples of milligram size. The current study aims to assess the flammability of eight samples of seven kinds of cables that are widely used in China using PCFC. The three important parameters related to fire hazard of materials, namely the heat release rate (HRR), ignition temperature (IT) and total heat release (THR), were measured and analyzed. Detailed differences in flammability among the eight samples were differentiated by PCFC...|$|E

40|$|When a {{substation}} is fed {{by a combined}} overheadcable transmission line, {{a significant part of}} the ground fault current flows through <b>cable</b> <b>sheaths</b> and is discharged into the soil at the transition station where cables are connected to the overhead line. Such a phenomenon, known as “fault application transfer,” may result in high ground potentials at the transition station which may cause shocks and equipment damage. The scope of this paper is to present new analytic formulas which can be used for the direct calculation of the fault current transferred at the transition station and its ground potential rise as well as the substation earth current. The proposed formulas allow evaluating the influence of the main factors to the fault application transfer phenomenon and can be employed, at the preliminary design stage, to easily assess the most appropriate safety conditions to avoid dangerous effects...|$|R
40|$|Sheath voltage {{limiters}} (SVL) are {{a critical}} component of an underground cable's protection system. SVLs must be sized such that, under steady state fault conditions, no conduction through the arrester occurs. This could otherwise lead to a catastrophic failure. A SVL failure [1] under steady state fault conditions prompted an investigation into the adequacy of traditional approaches used to model <b>cable</b> <b>sheaths</b> and underground <b>cable</b> networks. Injection tests have demonstrated that the type of sheath used has a large influence over the sheath voltage profile under faulted conditions. This is particularly evident with corrugated sheaths. In this paper, two common types of corrugated sheaths are investigated - the helically corrugated sheath (HCS) and the annularly corrugated sheath (ACS). The paper establishes improved models for each type of sheath and compares these models to sheath voltage profiles obtained from injection tests on three different types of underground cable systems...|$|R

40|$|In {{case of a}} {{substation}} supplied by a combined overhead-cable line, most of the ground fault current flows through the <b>cable</b> <b>sheaths</b> and discharges into the soil surrounding the point of discontinuity, where cables {{are connected to the}} overhead line.

Besides the calculation of the earth current at the fault location, the leakage current at the transit/transition stations {{as well as at the}} overhead line towers can be evaluated, in order to ensure proper safety conditions. Based on the two-port theory, the method allows to take into account all the relevant conductively and inductively coupled parameters which take part to the fault current distribution.

40|$|The {{development}} of in-core detectors for Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactors (LMFBRs) {{is still in}} an early stage, and little operation experience is available. Therefore self-powered neutron and gamma detectors and neutron sensitive ionization chambers -especially developed for LMFBRs- have been tested in the Fast Sodium Cooled Test Reactor KNK II. Seven flux detectors have been installed {{in the core of}} KNK II by means of a special test rig. Five of them failed already within the first week during operation in the reactor. Due to measurements of electrical resistances and capacities, sodium penetrating into the detectors or cables probably seems to be the cause. As tests prior to the installation in the core proved the tightness of all detectors, it is suspected that small cracks have developed in the detector casings or in the outer <b>cable</b> <b>sheaths</b> during their exposure to the hot coolant. Two ionization chambers did not show these faults. However, one of them failed because the saturation current plateau disappeared and the other one's sensitivity decreased by a factor of five during the test period.

40|$|In {{order to}} address the {{detection}} and localization of partial discharge (PD) in cross-bonded (CB) high voltage (HV) cables, this paper investigates the characteristics of PD propagation in CB HV cables. On-line PD detection and location in power cables has been a research topic for many years. The issue has not been solved due to surrounding interference and complicated propagation modes in cable joints. It becomes even more complex with CB cables. The main challenge to PD monitoring of CB cables is {{as a result of}} the interconnectedness of the sheaths of the three single phase cables. The cross-bonding of the sheaths makes it difficult to localize which of the three phases a PD signal has emanated from. Co-axial cables are used to connect <b>cable</b> <b>sheaths</b> to <b>cable</b> link boxes, for ease of installation and protection against moisture. A second challenge is, therefore, the coupling characteristic when a PD pulse propagates in HV cable joints and the co-axial cables, making PD detection and localization more complex. The paper presents experimental investigations into PD pulse coupling characteristic between the cable center conductor and the sheath and the behavior of PD pulse propagation in CB HV cables, which can be used for PD localization in CB HV cable system...|$|R
