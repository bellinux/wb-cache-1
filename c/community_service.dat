First, in order to establish the functions of a <b>community</b> <b>services</b> office, a survey was done. Forty-six {{community colleges in}} Southern California were surveyed by letter and/or by visitation. A study was then done on the history of Antelope College to determine what activities or courses have been offered that would qualify for a <b>community</b> <b>services</b> function. Finally, a socio-economic profile of the community was drawn and a questionnaire was sent out to members of the community to determine needs that might be met by a <b>community</b> <b>services</b> office at Antelope Valley College. The findings indicated there were community needs, particulary in the areas of unemployment, isolated ethnic groups, inadequate transportation, an information referral service, arts appreciation, and a senior citizens' program. It was therefore concluded that a <b>community</b> <b>services</b> office was needed at Antelope Valley College, and recommendations were made to implement a <b>community</b> <b>services</b> program...|$|R
