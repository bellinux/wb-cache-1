5|$|Gjirokastër is {{situated}} between the lowlands of western Albania and the highlands of the interior, and has thus a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, though, (as is normal for Albania), much heavier rainfall than usual for this <b>climate</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main climates in the state. The {{lowlands}} are hot with temperatures rising {{as high as}} 44C in the summer {{in places such as}} the municipality of Pisaflores. Temperate regions can have hot days but often the temperature is moderated by cooler winds and clouds. Cold climates dominate the highest altitudes where freezing temperatures at night are not uncommon. Rainfall varies widely from as low as 250mm per year to as high as 2,800mm per year. The main indicator of <b>climate</b> <b>type</b> is altitude.|$|E
25|$|Slovenia {{is located}} in {{temperate}} latitudes. The climate is also influenced by the variety of relief, {{and the influence of}} the Alps and the Adriatic Sea. In the northeast, the continental <b>climate</b> <b>type</b> with greatest difference between winter and summer temperatures prevails. In the coastal region, there is sub-Mediterranean climate. The effect of the sea on the temperature rates is visible also up the Soča valley, while a severe Alpine climate is present in the high mountain regions. There is a strong interaction between these three climatic systems across most of the country.|$|E
50|$|There {{two methods}} for {{defining}} climate classification. Coronas <b>Climate</b> <b>Types</b> were described by 1920 by Coronas, who {{was chief of}} Manila Observatory. He devised the classification which described all of the Philippines (only) into one of four <b>climate</b> <b>types,</b> depending mostly on distribution of rainfall.|$|R

25|$|Belmopan {{features}} a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the Köppen climate classification. The {{city has a}} lengthy wet season that runs from May through February and a short dry season covering the remaining two months. As is the characteristic of several cities with a tropical monsoon climate, Belmopan sees some precipitation during its dry season. March and April are Belmopan's driest months with roughly 45mm of rainfall observed on average during those months. Like Belize City, these are somewhat unusual months for {{a city with a}} tropical monsoon climate to have its driest months of the year. Typically the driest month for a city with this <b>climate</b> <b>type</b> is the month after the winter solstice, which in Belmopan would be January. Average monthly temperatures are somewhat constant throughout the course of the year, ranging from 23°C to 28°C.|$|E

500|$|The {{climate of}} South Florida is located across the broad {{transition}} zone between subtropical and tropical climates (Koppen Cfa and Aw). Like most regions with this <b>climate</b> <b>type,</b> {{there are two}} basic seasons – a [...] "dry season" [...] (winter) which runs from November through April, and a [...] "wet season" [...] (summer) which runs from May through October. About 70% of the annual [...] rainfall in south Florida occurs in the wet season – often as brief but intense tropical downpours. The dry season sees little rainfall and dew points and humidity are often quite low. The dry season can be severe at times, as wildfires and water restrictions are often in place.|$|E
500|$|Like much of Metro Vancouver, Coquitlam has an {{oceanic climate}} (Köppen <b>climate</b> <b>type</b> Cfb), enjoying mild {{temperatures}} and sufficient precipitation; warm/dry summers and wet/cool winters. However, unlike {{other cities in}} the area, precipitation is especially heavy in Coquitlam due to its proximity to the mountain slopes. With westward air moving off the Pacific Ocean, the air is forced to flow up the Coast Mountains causing it to cool and condense and fall as precipitation, this process is known as orographic precipitation. The orographic effect is mainly responsible for the massive [...] annual average precipitation that Coquitlam receives each year, with most falling as rainfall {{in the fall and}} winter months, with [...] in November; the summer is usually sunny with minimal precipitation with [...] in July. Although the mild temperatures allow for mostly rain to fall during the winter months, occasionally snow will fall. With a slightly higher elevation compared to the rest of Metro Vancouver, Coquitlam receives an average of [...] of snow each year, with it rarely staying on the ground for more than a day or two, adding to a very intermittent snow cover during the winter season. On 29 December 1996 over 45cm of snow fell in just 24 hours.|$|E

40|$|The Köppen-Geiger climate {{classification}} {{has been}} used for over a century to delineate <b>climate</b> <b>types</b> across the globe. As it was developed to mimic the distribution of vegetation it may provide a useful surrogate for making projections of the future distribution of vegetation, and hence resultant hydrological implications, under climate change scenarios. This paper developed projections of the Köppen-Geiger <b>climate</b> <b>types</b> covering the Australian continent for a 2030 and 2050 climate relative to a 1990 historical baseline climate using 17 Global Climate Models (GCMs) and five global warming scenarios. At the highest level of classification for a + 2. 4 °C future climate (the upper limit projected for 2050) relative to the historical baseline, it was projected that the area of the continent covered by: &ndash; Tropical <b>climate</b> <b>types</b> would increase from 8. 8 % to 9. 1 % &ndash; Arid <b>climate</b> <b>types</b> would increase from 76. 5 % to 81. 7 % &ndash; Temperate <b>climate</b> <b>types</b> would decrease from 14. 7 % to 9. 2 % &ndash; Cold <b>climate</b> <b>types</b> would decrease from 0. 016 % to 0. 001 %. Previous climate change impact studies on water resources in Australia have assumed a static vegetation distribution. If the change in projected <b>climate</b> <b>types</b> is used as a surrogate for a change in vegetation, then the major transition in climate from Temperate to Arid in parts of Australia under a drier future climate could cause indirect effects on water resources. For a transition from annual cropping to perennial grassland this would have a compounding effect on the projected reduction in recharge. In contrast, a transition from forest to grassland would have a mitigating effect on the projected reduction in runoff...|$|R
