50|$|The Philips CD-i (an {{abbreviation}} of <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Interactive)</b> is {{an interactive}} multimedia CD player developed and marketed by Royal Philips Electronics N.V. It {{was created to}} provide more functionality than an audio CD player or game console, but {{at a lower price}} than a personal computer with a CD-ROM drive at the time. The cost savings were {{due to the lack of}} a floppy drive, keyboard, mouse, monitor (a standard television is used), and less operating system software. CD-i also refers to the multimedia Compact Disc standard used by the CD-i console, also known as Green Book, which was developed by Philips and Sony.|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the advantages of}} various forms of optical disc systems for the storage and dissemination of patent and trademark information. It analyses the storage and transmission requirements and outlines the development of optical disc technologies, covering video <b>disc,</b> <b>compact</b> audio <b>disc,</b> CD-ROM (<b>compact</b> <b>Disc</b> [...] Read Only Memory), CD-I (<b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> [...] <b>Interactive),</b> LV-ROM (Laservision [...] Read Only Memory), Digital Optical Discs and Digitalization and Vectorization. The article concludes that recent improvements in data storage and transmission open new opportunities for vendors and users of patent databases. One problem, however, is that patents are seen only as a specialized information source {{and not as a}} part of the overall body of scientific and technical information, and international coordination and cooperation are essential if the best use is to be made of optical disc technologies. ...|$|R

40|$|Various {{histories}} of consumer technologies, both new and old, have employed if not directly {{the idea of}} paradigms then at least something akin to it. Sometimes the researchers concerned have talked of analogies, concepts, doubles lives or constructs, perhaps due to coming from different intellectual traditions or else wanting to avoid {{some of the other}} intellectual baggage that has come {{to be associated with the}} word ‘paradigm’. Nevertheless, the examples given below suggest that something like that concept of a paradigm has repeatedly proved to be useful and attractive in accounting for technological development. The aim of this paper is explore and sometimes problematise the nature of this concept and its utility as a research tool based on involvement in several projects which have tried to grapple this and related terms. This has been by no means an easy process and goal here is to share some of issues with which a researcher might have to cope. The first half of the paper examines the examples of the telephone, radio and then more recently the VCR and home computer in order to illustrate and investigate how the ‘same’ technologies can be seen as developing according to different paradigms. The second half of the paper explores how a something related to a paradigm can be occupied by different product configurations. However, in recent research the paradigm that has been referred to as a ‘product space’, which can be sometimes a little less clearly defined than some of the historical paradigms discussed below - the exact functionalities and role of any products filling this space can be a little vaguer and subject to negotiation. The issues around these product spaces are exemplified through case studies of home automation, <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> based <b>interactive</b> multimedia and electronic messaging...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the ability}} of PCs to play full-screen, full-motion, digital video was {{somewhat}} limited in the early ‘90s, the first release of this software was on the now defunct CD-i (<b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Interactive)</b> format. CD-i was a format developed by Philips of Eindhoven, and {{was known as the}} Green Book standard (CD-DA format was the Red Book standard; the CD-ROM standard was known as the Yellow Book; the less common VCD format was the White Book, and so on). CD-i used a consumer player and a television set for display, not a computer. Although very useful and easy to use, and widely accepted in the automotive training industry, CD-i was a commercial flop, and subsequent releases of DVP’s automotive training products were on CD-ROM, and more recently, DVD-ROM, DVD, and online via the web.|$|E
50|$|The Philips CD-i (<b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Interactive),</b> first {{released}} in 1991, is an interactive multimedia CD player developed and marketed by the Dutch electronics manufacturer Royal Philips Electronics N.V. This category of device {{was created to}} provide more functionality than an audio CD player or game console, but {{at a lower price}} than a personal computer with a CD-ROM drive at the time.Earlier CD-i games included entries in popular Nintendo franchises, such as Hotel Mario, Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Zeldas Adventure, although those games were not developed by Nintendo. In addition to games, a lot of educational and multimedia reference titles were produced for the system, such as interactive encyclopedias, museum tours, etc. The CD-i was a commercial failure, selling 1 million units across all manufactures in 7 years, and losing Phillips $1 billion.|$|E
5000|$|From 1988-92 Bastiaens {{was general}} manager and {{director}} of the Multimedia Division of Philips Consumer Electronics. Jan Timmer, then Philips' head of Consumer Electronics, gave him four months to make or break the <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Interactive</b> (CD-I) project, a joint effort between Sony and Philips to enhance the CD standard with multi-media technology. This so-called [...] "Green Book" [...] standard had been in development since 1985 but was still in the concept phase when Bastiaens took charge. He started out by changing the project to [...] "full motion video", which would enable a CD-I disc to hold a full-length feature movie but was rather ambitious at the time, as the compression and decoding hard- and software had yet to be developed. The success of the project also hinged on the creation of software and tools to create the content which would be essential in driving the market. Bastiaens moved the project into the MPEG standard, getting Philips more actively involved in that technology. By the time the first CD-I products where launched in 1992, using the MPEG-1 standard for video, development of MPEG-2 technology was well under way for the upcoming DVD technology, which used a red laser for encoding more than eleven times as much information on a disk of the same size as a CD, which used a yellow laser.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two of the}} usability laboratories at Philips, discusses {{practical issues}} arising from our experience using the facilities, gives {{an example of a}} typical usability evaluation, and briefly outlines our vision {{for the future of the}} laboratories. Usability tests at Philips can involve any product from a portfolio ranging from <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Interactive</b> (CD-I) to electron microscopes. Performing usability tests for consumer electronic products poses a number of specific problems: our user group is broad and diverse, the context in which our products are used is highly variable, and it is difficult to determine the importance of usability relative to other design goals. In the further development of our facilities, the efficient planning and the execution of usability test is of particular concern since we are driven by demanding time schedules. In the future, we expect a shift in focus towards testing more products and product concepts in their actual context of use...|$|E
