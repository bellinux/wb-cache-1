That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training <b>completely</b> <b>free</b> of charge.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be <b>completely</b> <b>free</b> of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E

The Klickitat and White Salmon rivers are nearly <b>completely</b> <b>free</b> flowing, with only small barriers to aid irrigation (White Salmon) and erosion control (Klickitat).

5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first <b>completely</b> <b>free</b> flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when the flap was positioned in order to provide control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E
5|$|According to {{director}} Hajime Tanigawa, its gameplay {{was based}} around prevalent South Korean online role-playing games for PC. Tanigawa joined when the title shifted {{to being an}} MMORPG, and he estimated development time in this form at ten months. At the beginning of development, the team decided to release a working form of the game within a year. This was managed by narrowing {{the amount of time}} spent on the early concept work, instead taking inspiration directly from other titles, including titles within the Megami Tensei series: Tanigawa said that without this, development might have lasted up to three years. When the closed beta began, many of the game's final functions had yet to be implemented. A free-to-play model was adopted as the team wanted to bring in the maximum number of players into the game. While making the game <b>completely</b> <b>free</b> and using in-game advertising as a means of earning money was an option, this had yet to become commercially viable in Japan at the time. In early 2007, CAVE partnered with Gung Ho Online Entertainment, a Japanese company experienced with online games who could co-manage the game with CAVE. According to Tanigawa, the partnership with Gung Ho Online opened up the possibility of expansion into Asian and Western markets.|$|E

5|$|God of War: Ascension is a third-person action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Santa Monica Studio {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). The game was first released on March 12, 2013, for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) console. It is the seventh installment in the God of War series and prequel to the entire series. Loosely based on Greek mythology, the game is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist Kratos, the former servant of the God of War Ares, who tricked Kratos into killing his wife and daughter. In response to this tragedy, Kratos renounced Ares, breaking his blood oath to the god. Kratos was therefore imprisoned and tortured by the three Furies, guardians of honor and enforcers of punishment. Helped by the oath keeper Orkos, Kratos escapes his imprisonment and confronts the Furies to be <b>completely</b> <b>free</b> of his bond to Ares.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: As of January 2014, 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico {{have laws}} in effect {{requiring}} non-hospitality workplaces, bars and/or restaurants to be 100 % smoke free. In addition to tobacco taxes, graphic {{public service announcements}} have been airing frequently to encourage smokers to kick the habit. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine if a no smoking law in the state resulted in lower number of reported smokers. SUBJECTS: Adults 18 years or older (n= 50, 569) who participated in the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Survey smoking question. METHODS: Data was obtained from 2011 BRFS and relationships were calculated using SPSS. ANALYSES: The number of reported smokers was cross tabulated with state tobacco taxes as well as smoking restrictions, which were categorized into three levels ranging from none, some and <b>completely</b> smoke <b>free.</b> RESULTS: States that had no smoking restrictions in place accounted for 80. 2 % of former/nonsmokers, states that had some smoking restrictions accounted for 82. 5 % and <b>completely</b> smoke <b>free</b> states accounted for 84. 0 % of former/nonsmokers. Of the states with tobacco taxes at $ 2. 00 per pack of cigarettes or higher, 88. 2 % were <b>completely</b> smoke <b>free.</b> CONCLUSION: Results show that states with higher tobacco taxes are more likely to be <b>completely</b> smoke <b>free</b> as well as have fewer smokers. States with some restrictions or <b>completely</b> smoke <b>free</b> laws in place have a higher incidence of former/nonsmokers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCompletely {{iterative}} {{theories of}} Calvin Elgot formalize (potentially infinite) computations as solutions of recursive equations. One {{of the main}} results of Elgot and his coauthors is that infinite trees form a <b>free</b> <b>completely</b> iterative theory. Their algebraic proof of this result is extremely complicated. We present completely iterative algebras as {{a new approach to}} the description of <b>free</b> <b>completely</b> iterative theories. Examples of completely iterative algebras include algebras on complete metric spaces. It is shown that a functor admits an initial completely iterative algebra iff it has a final coalgebra. The monad given by <b>free</b> <b>completely</b> iterative algebras is proved to be the <b>free</b> <b>completely</b> iterative monad on the given endofunctor. This simplifies substantially all previous descriptions of these monads. Moreover, the new approach is much more general than the classical one of Elgot et al. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a <b>free</b> <b>completely</b> iterative monad is proved...|$|R
