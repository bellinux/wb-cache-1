40|$|Abstract: Since the {{development}} of manufacturing products {{is very similar to}} the evolution of living beings, genetic engineering techniques have been applied by the present authors to develop a bionic design theory and methodology for product innovation. This design method is totally different from the conventional method and innovates products via the reform of virtual genes of products. It provides a logically structured method, which can reduce blindness to innovation and can even clone a product with the <b>aid</b> of advanced <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> design/computer <b>aided</b> <b>manufacture</b> technology. Since products have no physical chromosomes and genes, their virtual chromosomes must be disclosed and their virtual genes must be identied from their virtual chromosomes so that the related genes can be reformed for product innovation. The method for deducing the virtual chromosomes has been initiated by the authors. This paper denes virtual genes, develops the methods for identifying virtual genes from their virtual chromosome, creating virtual genome maps and deriving mapping networks between the virtual genes and the performances of a product, and develops the method for reforming virtual genes for product innovation using genetic engineering techniques. As an example, the virtual genes of an engine lathe and their reform are introduced according to the theory and methodology developed in the paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Predicting {{the actual}} tool {{path of a}} machine tool prior to {{machining}} a part provides useful data {{in order to ensure}} or improve the dimensional accuracy of the part. The actual tool path can be estimated by accounting for the eVect of the machine tool geometric error parameters. In <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> design/computer <b>aided</b> <b>manufacture</b> (CAD/CAM) systems, the nominal tool path [or CL (cutter location) data] is directly generated from the curves and surfaces to be machined and the errors of the machine tool are not considered. In order to take these errors into consideration, they must Â®rst be identiÂ®ed and then used in the machine tool forward kinematic model. In this paper a method is presented to identify the geometric errors of machine tools and predict their eVect on the tool-tip position. Both the link errors (position-independent geometric error parameters) and the motion errors (position-dependent geometric error parameters) are considered. The nominal and predicted tool paths are compared and an assessment is made of the resulting surfaces with respect to the desired part proÂ®le tolerance. A methodology is also suggested to integrate this tool within a CAD/CAPP (<b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> process planning) /CAM environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), the {{application}} of computers {{in the broadest sense}} including Computer Aided Design (CAD) and <b>Computer</b> <b>Aided</b> <b>Manufacture</b> (CAM), is expected to affect virtually every aspect of engineering. With the introduction of a new engineering degree in 1984, the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education (DDIAE) recognised that the time was opportune and indeed that it was vital that CAE and all its facets be embraced. Computer facilities must include appropriate hardware, integrated software and staff training as essential components to enable institutions to graduate students able to use these new techniques effectively and promote their use in the Australian context. This paper examines these aspects of CAE and relates details of the computer system eventually purchased by the DDIAE, staff development activities, current and proposed, and the courses and units in which these facilities are currently used...|$|E

40|$|In {{what ways}} does Computer Aided Design (CAD) {{software}} and manufacture affect âmaterialâ 1 and process in sculptural methods as evidenced in outcomes? For this paper the dual reading of materiality is taken. The word matter âcame into English {{from the old}} French materie,â referring to âa building material usually timberâ (Hong, 2003). Material however is not solely defined as being made of matter; it can be, for example, information used for writing a book. The latter terminology applies to digital artefacts substantially being information. Leonardi writes about âdigital artefacts as having âmaterialâ properties, aspects, or features, we might safely say that what makes them 'material' is that they provide capabilities that afford or constrain action. â He further proposes, âin the case of digital artefacts, what may matter most about 'materiality' is that artefacts and their consequences are created and shaped through interaction" (Leonardi, 2010). This research aims to investigate processes through utilising CAD and <b>Computer</b> <b>Aided</b> <b>Manufacture</b> (CAM) to inform specific historical sculptural methods based upon traditional sculptural processes (reductive, additive, fusion of material and reproduction) {{such as those of}} carving wood, modelling in clay, joining of metals, mould making and casting for reproducing form...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{collagen}} scaffolds possessing predefined and reproducible internal channels with widths of 135 microm {{and greater}} have been produced. The process employed {{to make the}} collagen scaffold utilises a sacrificial mould, manufactured using solid freeform fabrication technology, and critical point drying technique.

The effect of processing on the tertiary structure of collagen is assessed by monitoring the wavenumber of the N-H stretching vibration peak using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and {{it is found that}} processing does not denature the collagen.

40|$|Successful robotic {{exploration}} of near-Earth asteroids necessitates {{a method of}} securely anchoring {{to the surface of}} these bodies without gravitational assistance. Microspine grip- per arrays that can grasp rock faces are a potential solution to this problem.
