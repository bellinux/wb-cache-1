25|$|A barge full {{of prisoners}} was washed ashore at Klintholm Havn in Denmark where 351 of the 370 on board were saved on 5 May 1945. Shortly before the German surrender, some prisoners were {{transferred}} to Malmö, Sweden, and released into the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> neutral country. It {{has been estimated that}} over 25,000 prisoners, one in two, died during the evacuation from Stutthof and its subcamps.|$|E

Aaron Perez kicked two punts for more than 50 yards for the Bruins and they were downed inside the two-yard line.|$|E

25|$|In late April 1945, the {{remaining}} prisoners {{were removed from}} Stutthof by sea, since it was completely encircled by Soviet forces. Again, hundreds of prisoners were forced into the sea and shot. Over 4,000 were sent by small boat to Germany, some to the Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg, and some to camps along the Baltic coast. Many drowned along the way. Shortly before the German surrender, some prisoners were transferred to Malmö, Sweden, and released to the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> neutral country. It {{has been estimated that}} over 25,000 prisoners, one in two, died during the evacuation from Stutthof and its subcamps. One hundred prisoners were liberated from Stutthof on May 9, 1945.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Rykodisc {{released}} , {{billed as}} a Badfinger live recording from 1974. The album underwent substantial re-recording, and a rearranged track order by the album's producer, Molland, and had a mixed critical reaction. The album's release then sparked {{a lawsuit filed by}} Molland. The band's accounting firm, collecting for a 1985 court order settlement, had re-adjusted against Molland's Apple royalty income by deducting away the percentage amounts of that court order, then reimbursing those amounts to the other Badfinger parties. The Rykodisc contract did not include artist royalty payments, because Molland had advised Rykodisc he would take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> distribution himself under another company name. Molland subsequently sued the other members and their estates to recoup his expenses plus a producer's royalty. He was awarded a partial settlement, as the judge stated the evidence against Molland was insufficient to justify a severe penalty, also noting that since both parties had conceded the original tapes were of a poor quality, Molland's salvaging of them to a commercial level merited consideration.|$|E
25|$|Despite rain {{washing out}} {{parts of the}} first day at New Road, England took their first Test victory over Australia since December 1984, and their first Ashes series win since 1963. Having won the toss, England captain Clare Connor opted to bowl, and after Belinda Clark had slashed 18 runs she was trapped lbw by pacer Katherine Brunt. Wickets were shared out among the entire England team, no Australian passed 40, {{and by the end of}} the day they had crashed to 126 for 7. It took 33 {{deliveries}} for Australia to be all out on the second morning - for 131, as the efforts from the last Test, when the last three wickets outscored the rest of the batting line-up, were not repeated. Brunt took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> having Nitschke and Price caught behind to complete her five-wicket-haul. Batting was clearly difficult, but Jenny Gunn, Clare Connor and Claire Taylor all dug in to make scores above 30, before a vital partnership between Taylor and Beth Morgan took England to a relatively comfortable lead, as they moved to 196 for 6 before Emma Liddell struck twice and Cathryn Fitzpatrick once to leave England at 222 for 9 at close of play of day two. Liddell and Fitzpatrick bowled 59 overs between them on the second day, out of a total of 101, and although they shared seven wickets, they failed to remove either of Brunt or Isa Guha, and the last English pair added 18 before the end of day two.|$|E

The poll was divided into three categories: The first category asked fans to choose between [...] "Marilyn Monroe", [...] "Fire Burns", [...] "Young Forever", and [...] "Gun Shot". [...] "Marilyn Monroe" [...] had the most votes and won the poll; [...] "Young Forever" [...] came in second, [...] "Fire Burns" [...] came in third, and [...] "Gun Shot" [...] came in fourth. When asked whether [...] "Marilyn Monroe" [...] would become a single during an interview with The Guardian, Minaj replied: [...] "It has to be. It will be. We {{wanted to do it}} now, but then UK radio started playing 'Va Va Voom'. We're definitely going to have 'Marilyn Monroe' top of , and we're going to spend quality time on the video.

500|$|Richard Johnson, under {{contract}} to MGM, was cast as Dr. Markway. Wise saw Johnson in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of The Devils. Impressed with his acting, he offered him the role. Johnson later said he received invaluable film acting advice from Wise. Wise told {{him to keep his}} eyes steady, to blink less, and to try not to time his acting (Wise said he would take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> in the editing room). Johnson also credited Wise with helping him to craft a much more natural acting performance. Russ Tamblyn, also {{under contract}} with MGM, initially turned down the role as Luke because he felt that the character was [...] "a jerk", although he thought that the script was very good. The studio forced him to reconsider, threatening him with suspension. Tamblyn told the British cinema magazine Film Review in 1995 that while reading the script a second time, he realised the character was much more interesting. [...] "This is the ironic part," [...] he said, [...] "it {{turned out to be one}} of my favourite films that I've been in!" ...|$|E
500|$|When {{football}} season {{arrived in the}} fall, Chappuis {{was one of many}} veterans who returned to college and the gridiron after serving in the war. Many of the returning veterans were not in prime football condition {{at the start of the}} 1946 season, and Coach Fritz Crisler [...] "predicted it might be November before ex-servicemen were adjusted physically and mentally to play their top game." [...] Chappuis later recalled that he was 23years old when he returned to school, and some of the returning veterans [...] "didn't know if they could get back into the rah-rah of college football, but Fritz took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> He really whipped us into shape." [...] Despite any difficulties in re-adjusting to civilian life and football, Chappuis broke Otto Graham's Big Nine Conference record for total offensive yards during the 1946 {{football season}}. Though reports differ as to Chappuis' total yards gained, University of Michigan records show that Chappuis gained 1,284yards in 1946—734yards passing, 501yards rushing and 49yards receiving. Chappuis set the new offensive mark in 1946 with a fractured bone in his wrist that he did not report until after the season had ended, at which time an operation was performed. Chappuis later said he knew the x-ray would reveal a fracture, and he would be benched before he even began. He delayed the examination until the season was over because [...] "the time to break into the lineup is prior to the first game. If I hadn't, there were so many capable candidates around who could have made good behind our front wall that I'd never have become a first-stringer by returning in the middle of the season." [...] Accordingly, Chappuis played the 1946 season with a fractured wrist and without even bothering to tape the wrist.|$|E

When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared at me with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn’t know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer.

[...] In 1885, St. John starred in The Lady of the Locket at the Empire Theatre but fell ill after three months. At {{the end of the}} year, she created the title role in Erminie, but she was pregnant and soon had to leave the cast, and the role was taken over by Marie Tempest.

2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less.
