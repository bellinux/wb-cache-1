5|$|Peking opera was {{denounced as}} 'feudalistic' and 'bourgeois' during the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Revolution</b> of the 1960s, and {{replaced}} with the eight revolutionary model operas {{as a means of}} propaganda and indoctrination.

These reforms, which include improving performance quality, adapting new performance elements, and performing new and original plays, have met with mixed success.|$|E

50|$|An {{overriding}} goal of Li Zehou’s {{work has}} been to promote a philosophy {{of the human being}} that was not only based on the materialistic and historical realities as analyzed and posited by Karl Marx, but which also supported the view of Immanuel Kant as to the individual's intellectual, moral and aesthetic capacities. As a core element in his analysis, he incorporates the thinking of the greats of Chinese philosophy as well. This blended and fundamentally optimistic view of humankind was a counterbalance to the views of humans during and after the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Revolutions.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{assesses the}} potentials {{and the limits}} of the two major streams of historiography of Islamic law - the 'scripturalist' and the 'new historian' stream - in order to account for many significant yet often overlooked factors that have shaped the course and contents of Islamic legal tradition, including those of (cyclical) globalisation(s), vernacular knowledge systems, <b>cultural</b> <b>revolutions,</b> crude periodisations and modernist re-configurations. The paper looks into historical narratives of Islamic law from various temporal and cultural contexts, in an attempt to challenge the mainstream, non-vernacular periodisations and generalisations of certain long-lasting historical phenomena. ...|$|R

50|$|India's {{antecedent}} composite cultural catalytic {{formation is}} suggestively sketched out by Dinkar {{as a product}} of four <b>cultural</b> <b>revolutions</b> and acculturative tendencies: (a) Aryan-Dravidian (Mongoloid) racial aggregations and admixures and Indo-European/Dravidian/(Tibeto-Burman) linguistic agglomerations and transitions; (b) Vedic or Brahmanical foundational worldview and Jain, Buddhist, Bhakti, Sikh, Sufi, and a variety of neo-Hindu reform movements; (c) Hindu-Muslim encounter, coexistence, and osmosis; and (d) Indo-European contact and British colonial conquest of India. The vast panoramic overview of Dinkar's historiography of India's composite culture verges on a kind of Darwinist evolutionism. The idea of India of Dinkar's imagination is reminiscent of the American 'melting pot' model of assimilative nationalism.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cultural</b> <b>Revolutions</b> {{argues that}} reason itself is cultural, {{but no less}} {{reasonable}} for it. Lawrence Cahoone systematically defines culture and gauges {{the consequences of the}} ineradicably cultural nature of cognition and action, yet argues that none of this implies relativism. Cahoone offers a definition of culture as teleologically organized practices, artifacts, and narratives and analyzes the notion of cultural membership in relation to race, ethnicity, and “primordialism. ” He provides a theory of culture’s role in how we form our sense of reality and argues that the proper conception of culture dissolves “the problem” of cultural relativism. Applying this perspective to Islamic fundamentalism, Cahoone identifies its conflict with the West as representing the break between two of three historically distinctive forms of reason. Rather than being “irrational,” he shows, fundamentalism embodies a rationality only recently devalued—but not entirely abandoned—by the West...|$|R

40|$|Western {{civilization is}} {{succumbing to the}} false fruits of <b>cultural</b> <b>{{revolutions}}</b> to which it has consented at each stage of their development. Why do revolutions succeed? They succeed {{in part because the}} passing of a single generation is all it takes to wipe the slate and in part because the guardians let down their guard. First, the public memory fades or, as is often the case, is subtly reinterpreted. Then, citizens forget to convey the wealth of their experience and tradition to their children through nurturing, teaching, and testing. Finally, they even neglect to produce the heirs they should be preparing to carry on. These sins of omission may in some cases be absent-minded, given modernity’s capacity for producing endless distraction, but they are never less than deadly. If indeed we have sold our birthright, it will take character and courage to repent and return...|$|R
40|$|This book {{contains}} {{the proceedings of}} the first International Colloquium on Property Law ever, which took place on 28 - 10 August 1995, Maastricht, The Netherlands. Major economic, social and <b>cultural</b> <b>revolutions</b> all over the world demand attention of property lawyers, and it is clear that we cannot hope to provide answers to questions that have been raised by our time unless we enrich our considerations, debates and discussions on property doctrine, property rules and property practices by serious reflection on property theory. Although the conference was {{a direct result of the}} renewed interest and the restored co-operation between South Africa and the Netherlands, its scope was much broader: the historical background of the concept of property in both the common-law and the continental system. Furthermore the philosophical aspects of the concept of property, comparative law, Intellectual and cultural property, customary law and constitutional protection of property are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The 'long nineteenth century' (1776 – 1914) was {{a period}} of political, economic, {{military}} and <b>cultural</b> <b>revolutions</b> that re-forged both domestic and international societies. Neither existing international histories nor international relations texts sufficiently register the scale and impact of this 'global transformation', yet it is the consequences of these multiple revolutions that provide the material and ideational foundations of modern international relations. Global modernity reconstituted the mode of power that underpinned international order and opened a power gap between those who harnessed the revolutions of modernity and those who were denied access to them. This gap dominated international relations for two centuries and is only now being closed. By taking the global transformation as the starting point for international relations, this book repositions the roots of the discipline and establishes a new way of both understanding and teaching the relationship between world history and international relations...|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} Mizoram {{basically}} encompasses {{the account of}} transition in the occupation of Mizoram which lies in the remotest part of northeast India. It is a conglomerate history of several ethnic groups of Chin people who migrated from Chin State of Burma. But information of their patterns of westward migration are based on oral history and archaeological inferences, hence nothing definite can be said. The recorded history started relatively recently around the mid-19th century when the adjoining regions were occupied by the British monarchy. The land is now inhabited by a mixture of people from Chin Hills and Bangladesh and its history is therefore largely reflected by those of Lusei, Hmar, Lai, Mara and Chakmas tribes. Following religious, political and <b>cultural</b> <b>revolutions</b> in the mid-20th century {{majority of the people}} agglomerated into a super tribe, Mizo. Hence the officially recognised settlement of the Mizos became Mizoram.|$|R

40|$|Human {{history is}} punctuated by periods of rapid {{cultural}} change. Although archeologists {{have developed a}} range of models to describe cultural transitions, in most real examples {{we do not know}} whether the processes involved the movement of people or the movement of culture only. With a series of relatively well defined cultural transitions, the British Isles present an ideal opportunity to assess the demographic context of cultural change. Important transitions after the first Paleolithic settlements include the Neolithic, the development of Iron Age cultures, and various historical invasions from continental Europe. Here we show that patterns of Y-chromosome variation indicate that the Neolithic and Iron Age transitions in the British Isles occurred without large-scale male movements. The more recent invasions from Scandinavia, on the other hand, appear to have left a significant paternal genetic legacy. In contrast, patterns of mtDNA and X-chromosome variation indicate that {{one or more of these}} pre-Anglo-Saxon <b>cultural</b> <b>revolutions</b> had a major effect on the maternal genetic heritage of the British Isles...|$|R
