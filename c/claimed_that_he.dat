5|$|In France {{the battle}} was {{represented}} as a victory, largely based on a report sent to Paris by Dumanoir le Pelley {{on the strength of}} a letter written by Captain Troude, which <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had fought not only Venerable and Thames, but also Caesar and Spencer (misidentified in the report as Superb). Troude <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not only driven all of these ships off and completely destroyed Venerable by driving the ship ashore by 07:00, but that he had then waited nearby until 10:00 in the hope of resuming the action. In reward for his services as represented, Troude was promoted and highly praised, later holding a number of important active commands in the French Navy.|$|E

50|$|After he was drafted, {{a dispute}} arose about his {{concussion}} history {{during his time}} with the Broncos, triggered by an NFL Network report <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had three concussions during his college career and McClellin <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> only had one. When asked about this, McClellin stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had concussion-like symptoms, rather than a concussion.|$|R
5|$|Nash himself <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{could have}} ended Bodyline in two overs without needing {{to resort to}} a leg field, as he {{believed}} that the English batsman could not hook and a few overs of sustained, fast short pitched bowling would have caused England to abandon their Bodyline tactics.|$|E
5|$|The second {{spirit to}} be {{contacted}} {{identified himself as}} Sunex Amures, and <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would {{set fire to the}} rectory at nine o'clock that night, 27 March 1938. He also said that, at that time, the bones of a murdered person would be revealed.|$|E
5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, {{but most of}} the Australian team were watching the match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room from where they {{would have been able to}} hear the confrontation.

5|$|After {{suffering}} {{chest pains}} while filming The Drew Carey Show in August 2001, Carey {{went to the}} hospital, where he underwent a coronary angioplasty. Although his weight was a comedic topic throughout his sitcom and improv shows, in 2010 he began a diet and exercise plan, resulting in an extensive weight loss (similar to former TPIR announcer Rod Roddy). He also <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> cured his Type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|Berger later <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had come}} {{up with the idea of}} SS combat troops wearing {{camouflage}} jackets from his own hunting days, and had suggested it to SS-Obergruppenführer Sepp Dietrich, commander of the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Regiment (LSSAH). From 1938, various forms of Flecktarn camouflage were issued. The author Adrian Weale doubts Berger's account.|$|E

50|$|As {{active in}} the GMO debate, Stymne has {{received}} a lot of criticism from predominantly opponents who, among other things, <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is biased in his opinion while <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is receieving financial support from the plant biotechnology industry ("being bought by"). Stymne has then responded by publicly reporting hus past and current industrial connections.|$|R
5|$|Carroll {{travelled}} to England {{to press}} his case, although Hart later <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had been promised}} no such lobbying would take place. Carroll convinced the proprietor's officials to appoint him as the proprietor's chief agent in the colony. He was further appointed to the positions of receiver general, escheator, and naval officer. These positions together effectively gave Carroll the power to oversee all money in the colony that was collected by the government or by Calvert's private organization.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige perhaps {{came from}} Rutland, as {{he owned the}} manor of Tinwell there later in life. The Liber Eliensis <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been born by Caesarian section, but this is most likely a later {{accretion}} to his lifestory, added after his death because of efforts to have him declared a saint. The belief was that for an infant to survive a caesarian section was a miracle, and thus a fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{increasing}} dissatisfaction with Everman {{over the course}} of the Bleach tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and drove back to Washington. No one told Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> actually quit the group. Although Sub Pop did not promote Bleach as much as other releases, it was a steady seller. However, Cobain was upset by the label's lack of promotion and distribution for the album.|$|E

5|$|He {{retired from}} his {{university}} posts in 2004, but continued working on Time Team until 2011 and in 2006 commenced writing regular articles for British Archaeology magazine until his death.

5|$|In 1980, {{while in}} South Africa filming Safari 3000 (also known as Rally), which co-starred Stockard Channing, Carradine {{was arrested for}} {{possession}} of marijuana.

50|$|The medieval {{biographies of}} Prithviraj suggest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was educated well. The Prithviraja Vijaya states <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{mastered}} 6 languages; the Prithviraj Raso <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> learned 14 languages, {{which appears to}} be an exaggeration. The Raso goes on to <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became well-versed in a number of subjects, including history, mathematics, medicine, military, painting, philosophy (mimamsa), and theology. Both the texts state <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was particularly proficient in archery.|$|R

Eighty-five of them read it; of those, thirty-eight rejected it outright, thirty-three generally recognized it (but only eight specifically as Casablanca), three declared it commercially viable, and one suggested turning it into a novel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Berry bought the Southern Air, a {{restaurant}} in Wentzville, Missouri. In 1990 he was sued by several women who <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had installed a video camera in the bathroom. Berry <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had the camera installed to catch a worker who was suspected of stealing from the restaurant. Though his guilt was never proved in court, Berry opted for a class action settlement. (One of the biographers, Bruce Pegg, estimated that, with 59 women, it cost Berry over $1.2 million plus legal fees.). His lawyers {{said he had been}} the victim of a conspiracy to profit from his wealth. During this time Berry began using Wayne T. Schoeneberg as his legal counsel. Reportedly, a police raid on his house found intimate videotapes of women, one of whom being apparently a minor. Also found in the raid were 62grams of marijuana. Felony drug and child-abuse charges were filed. As the child-abuse charges were dropped, Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence and two years' unsupervised probation and was ordered to donate $5,000 to a local hospital.|$|E
5|$|Konnan {{returned}} to TNA on February 12, 2003 {{and formed a}} short-lived villainous alliance, the Authentic Luchadores, with fellow Hispanic wrestlers Juventud Guerrera, Super Crazy and The S.A.T.(Spanish Announce Team). The stable feuded with Jerry Lynn until April 2, 2003, when Lynn <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been heavily influenced by lucha libre and that he respected his Mexican opponents, thus earning the friendship of Konnan.|$|E
