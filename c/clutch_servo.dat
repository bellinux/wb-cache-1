50|$|A <b>clutch</b> <b>servo</b> {{powered by}} the vacuum at the {{induction}} manifold operated the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the gear lever operated a solenoid valve {{so that when the}} gear lever was moved the clutch was disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.|$|E
40|$|Managers often {{experience}} {{problems with}} quantifying {{the value of}} reducing or extending lead time when assessing different sourcing alternatives. In practice, these decisions are often made considering only unit procurement cost, transportation cost, capital cost and storage cost. However, the lead time of suppliers highly influences a business' exposure to demand uncertainty. This can yield large monetary values that should be accounted for. This Master's Thesis presents a case study within the automotive industry to show the effects of exposure to demand risk when assessing different sourcing alternatives. Building on the work done in ProjectThesis 2013, the computer program is further developed to better fit real life applications. Extending the existing geometric Brownian motion and mean reverting process, a discrete ARMA model is incorporated allowing for more flexibility in connecting demand to demand risk. Additionally, new case specific variables are added to give a more holistic view of the sourcing decision. Kongsberg Automotive's plant in Hvittingfoss, Norway (KA), and their <b>clutch</b> <b>servo</b> produced for Scania is analyzed. A thorough assessment of KA's demand structure shows that the demand is stationary, normally distributed and best described by an ARMA(1, 3) model. However, due to the similarity between ARMA(1, 3) and the mean reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the latter {{is used for the}} case study because of its continuous nature. The mean reversion rate and demand volatility is found to be high. Utilizing the expected supply-demand mismatch cost and real options theory enables for calculation of the cost curve - an indifference curve showing the costs at which you are indifferent between lead times. Three components of the <b>clutch</b> <b>servo</b> is evaluated - the piston, piston rod and aluminum casting. Based on the cost curve, this thesis concludes whether KA should change their supplier for each of them. The cost curves show that the majority of demand risk develops the last week prior to delivery, and little risk is added at longer lead times. Therefore, KA should either acquire a short lead time to mitigate this uncertainty, or choose a long lead time to benefit from the low obtained procurement cost. An assessment of other sources of risk that potentially could alter this conclusion is also presented...|$|E
5000|$|Cars with a Saxomat clutch did {{not have}} a clutch pedal. The Saxomat {{consisted}} of two independent systems: the centrifugal <b>clutch,</b> and the <b>servo</b> <b>clutch.</b> The centrifugal clutch was engaged above certain engine speed by centrifugal force acting on spinning weights inside the clutch, similar to a centrifugal governor.|$|R
50|$|In some modern cars, {{computers}} use sensors on {{the engine}} to detect throttle position, vehicle speed, engine speed, engine load, etc. to control the exact shift point. The computer transmits the information via solenoids that redirect the fluid the appropriate <b>clutch</b> or <b>servo</b> to control shifting.|$|R
50|$|The <b>servo</b> <b>clutch</b> used an {{electric}} switch that supplied manifold vacuum via an actuator valve to a reservoir that disengaged the clutch. The clutch is disengaged automatically whenever the gear-shift lever was touched.|$|R
50|$|The 500 cc Meteor and Comet singles were introduced, {{along with}} a 500 cc racer, the Vincent Grey Flash. The Grey Flash racer used Albion gears, for the greater choice of ratios available. The 500 cc bikes used a wet multiplate clutch, while the 998 cc V-twins used a dry, drum-type <b>servo</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Citroën {{produced}} {{a number of}} variants on semi-automatic transmission. The Citroën DS, introduced in 1955, used a hydraulic system to select gears and operate the conventional <b>clutch</b> using hydraulic <b>servos.</b> There was also a speed controller and idle speed step-up device, all hydraulically operated. This allowed clutchless shifting with a single selector mounted behind the steering wheel. This system was nicknamed 'Citro-Matic' in the U.S.|$|R
