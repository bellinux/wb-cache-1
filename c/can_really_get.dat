The school uses several extracurricular projects, such as a [...] "Big Brother, Little Brother" [...] program and a [...] "Social Justice" [...] program. Jennifer Glover, the school's director of admission, said in 2008 that [...] "The social justice program is essentially a program being built around rule number three, social awareness which impels to action.

6000|$|Reading is made {{too easy}} nowadays, with cheap paper editions and free libraries. A {{man does not}} {{appreciate}} at its full worth the {{thing that comes to}} him without effort.

6000|$|Lilly was a {{peculiar}} bird. Clever and attractive as he undoubtedly was, he {{was perhaps the}} most objectionable person to know. It was stamped on his peculiar face. Aaron thought of Lilly's dark, ugly face, which had something that lurked in it as a creature under leaves. Then he thought of the wide-apart eyes, with their curious candour and surety. The peculiar, half-veiled surety, as if nothing, nothing could overcome him. It made people angry, this look of silent, indifferent assurance. [...] "Nothing can touch him on the quick, nothing <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>GET</b> at him," [...] they felt at last. And they felt it with resentment, almost with hate. They {{wanted to be able to}} get at him. For he was so open-seeming, so very outspoken. He gave himself away so much. And he had no money to fall back on. Yet he gave himself away so easily, paid such attention, almost deference to any chance friend. So they all thought: Here is a wise person who finds me the wonder which I really am.--And lo and behold, after he had given them the trial, and found their inevitable limitations, he departed and ceased to heed their wonderful existence. Which, to say the least of it, was fraudulent and damnable. It was then, after his departure, that they realised his basic indifference to them, and his silent arrogance. A silent arrogance that knew all their wisdom, and left them to it.|$|E

50|$|That video {{definitely}} {{was a big}} turning point for me as I discovered something in myself. You know when you do something and the piece is far bigger than you are. Just by luck or unconscious something pops out and you're like 'whoa, what was that?'. And with that piece it was a willingness to be totally sincere and borderline maudlin but hopefully not. Emotional without being maudlin. I had always been sort of afraid of that and hidden before behind maybe a little irony or a just little distance. But that piece kinda showed me that I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>really</b> emotional, I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>really</b> sincere and actually I really loved the way the audience really reacted to it.

The course is designed for MIT sophomores, juniors, and seniors who want to understand the fundamental laws and physical processes that govern the sources, extraction, transmission, storage, degradation, and end uses of energy. Special note about this course: The Physics of Energy is a new subject at MIT, offered {{for the first time in}} the Fall of 2008. The materials for the course, as such, are not yet ready for wider distribution. However, given the relevance of this topic worldwide, OCW is presenting a basic version of the course now to provide insight into how this subject is being developed at MIT. We expect to add more content after it is taught again in the Fall of 2009...|$|R
