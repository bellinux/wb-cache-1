25|$|Where many <b>calculations</b> <b>are</b> <b>done</b> in sequence, {{the choice}} of {{rounding}} method can have a very {{significant effect on the}} result. A famous instance involved a new index set up by the Vancouver Stock Exchange in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000 (three decimal places of accuracy), and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 — whereas stock prices had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, {{in such a way that}} the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.|$|E

2500|$|The Rhind Papyrus, {{also known}} as the Ahmes Papyrus, is an ancient Egyptian papyrus written c. 1650BCE by Ahmes, who {{transcribed}} it from an earlier work that he dated to between 2000 and 1800BCE. It is the most extensive ancient Egyptian mathematical document known to historians. The Rhind Papyrus contains problems where linear equations of the form [...] and [...] are solved, where a, b, and c are known and x, which is referred to as [...] "aha" [...] or heap, is the unknown. or , where a and b and c are known and x is unknown. The unknown is referred to as [...] "aha," [...] or heap. [...] The solution given by Ahmes is not that of modern textbooks, but one proposed characteristic of a procedure now known as the [...] "method of false position," [...] or the [...] "rule of false." [...] A specific false value has been proposed by 1920s scholars and the operations indicated on the left hand side of the equality sign are performed on this assumed number. Recent scholarship shows that scribes had not guessed in these situations. Exact rational number answers written in Egyptian fraction series had confused the 1920s scholars. The attested result shows that Ahmes [...] "checked" [...] result by showing that 16 + 1/2 + 1/8 exactly added to a seventh of this (which is 2 + 1/4 + 1/8), does obtain 19. Here we see another significant step in the development of mathematics, for the check is a simple instance of a proof."
