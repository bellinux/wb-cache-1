We suggest a new way of reading Mills, the manner in which he exemplifies a certain way of leading a critical scholarly life. Mills’s debt to a Socratic tradition of critique is highlighted. We focus on the tentative and provisional elements in his project as he constitutes himself as both political theorist and actor.

Despite esthetic of zirconia abutments, machining accuracy of these abutments {{has always been}} a question. Any misfit in the abutment-implant interface connection can lead to detorque and screw loosening. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare torque loss value of manually aided design/manually aided manufacture (MAD/MAM) zirconia abutments with prefabricated titanium abutments. Materials and Methods: Seven titanium abutments (Branemark RP, Easy abutment) and seven <b>copy</b> <b>milled</b> abutments which were duplicated from the prefabricated Zirkonzhan (ZirkonZahn, Sand in Taufers, Italy) were prepared.

Materials and Methods: One in vitro prepared abutment from one mandibular molar model served as a template for replication of 40 epoxy resin (highly filled) dies, which had been taken by polyvinyl siloxane impression material. Copings were manufactured on epoxy replicas by two processes: the CAD/CAM (Cercon; Degudent) (n = 20) and the Copy-Milling (Dentium) (n = 20) processes. Four measurements were performed for each surface coping (Buccal, Lingual, Mesial, and Distal). Data were analyzed by SPSS 16 statistical software using independent t-test. Results: There was {{a significant difference in the}} marginal gap values between CAD/CAM and Copy-Milling groups (P < 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractHard-to-cut {{materials}} such as stainless steels and nickel-based super alloys are widely applied in different critical areas, e. g., aerospace and automotive components and chemical plants. Complex parts used in these areas are machined by indexable <b>copy</b> face <b>mills</b> with round inserts. This work aims to apply such inserts for studying machinability and process cost optimization during face milling of several hard alloys including stainless steel SS 403 cb+, Inconel 718, and Inconel 625 with indexable <b>copy</b> face <b>mills.</b> Machining experiments on these alloys are performed at different cutting speed and feed rate combinations, and machinability is studied in terms of tool life and wear, material removal rate, cutting forces, and force coefficients. The extended Taylor's tool life model that includes both the cutting speed and feed rate are {{used to determine the}} model coefficients. Using standard cost optimization model, process parameters are optimized considering the trade-off between material removal rate and tool life. The coefficients estimated for the extended Taylor's tool life model are also validated. Findings reveal that machinability of Inconel 625 is poorest among the three alloy materials considered. Also, machining cost is found to be about 5 and 6 folds for Inconel 718 and Inconel 625, respectively, as compared to that for SS 403 cb+ when considering a fixed volume to be removed at the optimized speed and feed combinations of each material...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. Fracture {{toughness}} determines functional crown strenght {{and prevents}} damages on ceramics during mastication. There {{is a lack}} of relevant literature data about fracture toughness of crowns made by feather-edge preparation. Mechanical testing of ceramic samples is supposed to show if feather-edge tooth preparation is a successful method for making ceramic crowns without any risk of reduction of their mechanical properties. This research was done to establish effects of feather-edge tooth preparation on fracture toughness of single zirconia ceramic crowns. Methods. The research was performed as an experimental study. Sixty (60) ceramic crowns were made on non-carious extracted human premolars. Thirty (30) crowns were {{made on the basis of}} feather-edge preparation (experimental group I). The group II included 30 crowns made on 1 mm rounded shoulder. Crowns fabrication was executed on a <b>copy</b> <b>mill</b> production system “Zirkonzahn” (Zirkonzahn GMBH, Gais, Germany). The spherical compression test was used to determine fracture toughness, using 6 mm diameter ceramic ball. Fracture load for damaging ceramic crown was recorded on a universal testing machine - Zwick, type 1464, with the speed of 0. 05 mm/min. Results. The results of this research introduced significant differences between fracture toughness of ceramic samples in every examined group. However, fracture toughness of crowns from both group was above 2 000 N, what was double beyond a recommended value. The mean value of fracture toughness in the feather-edge group was 2 090 N, and in shoulder group it was 2 214 N. Conclusion. This research showed a high fracture toughness of zirconia crowns made on feather-edge preparation. The examined crowns showed a fracture resistance at a sufficient distance in relation to the minimum values of functional loads. Further research of functional loads of these crown is necessary, as well as research of marginal adaptation of cemented crowns and gingival inflammatory response...|$|R

40|$|Dental CAD/CAM {{has become}} {{clinical}} reality. The number of commercially available dental CAD/CAM-systems is growing.

40|$|The {{end milling}} process is used {{extensively}} in a gamut of manufacturing areas. It accounts {{for up to}} 40 % {{of the cost of}} fabrication of non-electrical parts for a high performance aircraft. This economically justifies the effort to find ways to reduce inaccuracy caused in milling by workpiece deformation, fixture deflection and cutter deflection {{to improve the quality of}} parts. The process is also used extensively for roughing and finishing of dies. However, the conventional die manufacturing process, which uses the milling process, is too time consuming because of the extensive CNC programming involved. Furthermore skilled labor required for CNC programming accounts for the high cost of die manufacturing. Therefore new processes need to be developed that will eliminate CNC programming and possibly reduce the usage of the milling process thereby reducing the cost and time required to produce parts;An analytical non-linear optimization model has been developed which can determine the maximum inaccuracy due to workpiece deformation and the optimal clamping forces that are required to minimize work piece deformation while ensuring that the workpiece will not slip during machining. However, this model assumes rigid fixturing elements and is only suitable for simple workpiece shapes;A finite element model and a simple novel algorithm has been developed which has the same objective as the analytical non-linear optimization model. This model can be used for any complex shaped workpiece or fixture. The model also takes into account the flexibility of fixtures;Inaccuracy in machining is also caused by deflection of the tool. A study of the deflection of a milling cutter due to the action of the cutting forces was performed. An analytical equation was developed to determine the deflection of an end mill under a cutting force. The equation was verified by modeling the complete geometry of a four flute milling cutter using the finite element analysis module of I-DEAS software. The deflections obtained by the finite element model were exactly the same as those obtained by using the analytical equation. Previous researchers modeled the milling cutter as a simple cylinder which resulted in some error in the result;Three die manufacturing processes are proposed, namely, the casting prototype process, the EDM milling process and the <b>copy</b> <b>milling</b> process. All three processes use rapid prototyping to eliminate costly and time consuming CNC programming. All the three processes are economical compared to conventional processes provided there are large number of surfaces on the part. If the part has very few surfaces the conventional process will require less time for CNC programming making it more efficient. The Casting prototype process does not use milling whereas the EDM milling uses milling for rough machining. These two process would minimize inaccuracy in parts by eliminating milling or using milling to remove the rough stock only. The <b>copy</b> <b>milling</b> process uses milling but the models developed here can be used to minimize error in this process. All three processes have the additional advantage that they are more time efficient and economical than the conventional process of making dies...|$|E
40|$|High {{costs and}} long {{machining}} times are characteristical features of die and mold manufacturing processes in general. At the same time, the tendency in decreasing product cycle time demands fast response and high flexibility in die production. Currently, manufacturing of pressure casting dies is mainly covered by conventional processes, such as {{electrical discharge machining}} EDM, <b>copy</b> <b>milling</b> {{or a combination of}} both. Because of extreme material properties and surface complexity of typical casting dies, these processes are always associated with long machining times and high production costs. In addition, undesired influences on the material properties, as well as geometrical inaccuracy, result in low surface quality and, thus, demands additional manual rework. In order to reduce machining time and costs, the application of NC-milling gains more and more significance in die and mold manufacturing. The availability of highly developed CAD/CAM sytems, together with high performance tooli ng and machinary, leads to maximum flexibility. At the same time, it offers the benefits of directly milling hardened steel with wear-resistant cutting tools (e. g. coated carbides, CBN), while maintaining a sufficient process reliability. However, utilizing optimum cutting parameters and applying specific milling strategies are essential issues, particularily for critical tool engagement conditions, which mainly occure in deep slots and small curvatures. Considering those geometrical features, the use of small non-rigid cutting tools is often necessary. Consequently, dynamic effects like tool vibrations and chatter have to be taken into account. The aim of this contribution is to discuss the potentials of NC-milling for casting die manufacturing, concerning machining time, surface quality and costs, in comparison to conventional machining processes. Results of tool wear investigations, determining optimum cutting conditions for different cutting materials and various milling strategie s are presented, as well as dynamic effects, influencing the milling process and the surface quality. The manufacture of a sample part for verification purposes finally produces relevant data to evaluate the efficiency of NC-milling...|$|E
