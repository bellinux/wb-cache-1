500|$|Greek {{fire was}} one of the most {{effective}} thermal devices, although it was extremely dangerous for the users. A <b>combustible</b> <b>liquid,</b> it could be shot from siphons or catapults, and it burst into flames on impact. First developed by the Byzantines in the 7th century, it was later used by the Turks during the Crusades, and was probably first used in Western Europe in the 12th century. Early experiments by the Byzantines in the 6th century used a mixture of sulfur and oil, which would have been terrifying if not destructive. Various versions seem to have existed, and the recipes were frequently kept secret; experts today still debate the exact composition, although some recipes are known. It probably had regional variations; the Islamic derivative was known as [...] "naft" [...] and had a petroleum base, with sulfur; the Persian word for [...] "petroleum" [...] is [...] (naft).|$|E

50|$|All liquids have a {{specific}} vapor pressure, which {{is a function of}} that liquid's temperature and is subject to Boyle's Law. As temperature increases, vapor pressure increases. As vapor pressure increases, the concentration of vapor of a flammable or <b>combustible</b> <b>liquid</b> in the air increases. Hence, temperature determines the concentration of vapor of the flammable liquid in the air. A certain concentration of a flammable or combustible vapor is necessary to sustain combustion in air, the lower flammable limit, and that concentration is different and is specific to each flammable or <b>combustible</b> <b>liquid.</b> The flash point is the lowest temperature at which there will be enough flammable vapor to induce ignition when an ignition source is applied.|$|E

5000|$|Flammable is {{used for}} {{materials}} which ignite more easily than other materials thus are more dangerous and more highly regulated. Less easily ignited or which burn less vigorously are combustible. For example, in the United States flammable liquids by definition have a flash point below 100 F where <b>combustible</b> <b>liquids</b> have a flash point above 100 F. [...] "Flammable solids are solids that are readily combustible, or may cause or contribute to fire through friction. Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous {{if they can be}} easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly." [...] The technical definitions vary between countries so the United Nations created the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals which defines the flash point temperature of flammable liquids to be between 0 and 140 F and <b>combustible</b> <b>liquids</b> between 140 F and 200 F.|$|R
50|$|Generally, a {{flammable}} liquid is a <b>combustible</b> <b>liquid</b> {{that can easily}} catch fire. However, {{it is not the}} liquid itself that burns, but the vapor cloud above the liquid that will burn if the vapor's concentration in air is between the lower flammable limit (LFL) and upper flammable limit (UFL) of the liquid.|$|E

50|$|A {{flash fire}} is a sudden, intense fire caused by {{ignition}} of {{a mixture of}} air and a dispersed flammable substance such as a solid (including dust), flammable or <b>combustible</b> <b>liquid</b> (such as an aerosol or fine mist), or a flammable gas.

30|$|Fire {{patterns}} {{identified on}} the floor have been a common theme within fire investigation as being a possible indicator that flammable or <b>combustible</b> <b>liquids</b> were used within the fire (Smith 1983; Beyler 2009). In fact, a recent sentinel event analysis of wrongful convictions found that this one misconception {{is the most common}} factor in wrongful arson convictions (Bieber 2014). This misconception persists despite the warnings from both the fire science and fire investigation communities (Shanley et al. 1997; NFPA 2014; Gottuk and White 2008).|$|R
50|$|Flammability of <b>combustible</b> <b>liquids</b> {{are defined}} by their {{flash-point}}. The flash-point is the temperature at which the material will generate sufficient quantity of vapor to form an ignitable mixture. The flash point determines if an area needs to be classified. A material may have a relatively low autoignition temperature yet if its flash-point is above the ambient temperature, then the area may {{not need to be}} classified. Conversely if the same material is heated and handled above its flash-point, the area must be classified.|$|R

However, when operating on fuels other than liquid hydrogen, KITT's fuel efficiency and power output may be lowered.|$|E
