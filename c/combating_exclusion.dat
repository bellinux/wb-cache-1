40|$|France in a Multipolar World, by Jacques Chirac The end of {{the century}} is {{characterized}} not only by irréversible globalization of human activities and constant accélération of scientific and technological progress, but also by incipient global management of interdependencies. The international System in the 21 st century must be better organized, notably by progressing towards a multipolar world consisting of several régional pôles — in particular the European Union, which must act as a major pôle of global equilibrium. It is also necessary to reinforce the international institutions by giving an expanded Security Council an increased rôle. Progress must also be made in stepping up the campaign against prolifération, stabilization of the international financial System, the rules of world trade and global environ-mental protection. Finally, the 21 st century must be the century of ethics centred on two main thèmes : <b>combating</b> <b>exclusion</b> and affirming a universal ethic, more specifically, preserving cultural and linguistic diversity.

40|$|Poverty {{research}} {{has a long}} history in both Australia and Britain, but its influence on policy remains hostage to political priorities and ideology. This can partly be explained by the acknowledged limitations of defining poverty as low-income and measuring it using an income poverty line. This paper examines two new data sets that allow the income poverty profile to be compared with, and enriched by, the incidence of deprivation and social exclusion, measured using data that directly reflect experience. Although a degree of care must be applied when interpreting these new measures across countries, a validated poverty measure is developed that reflects both low-income and the experience of deprivation and exclusion. When results for the two countries are compared, they reveal stark differences between the alternative indicators. Britain has the higher income poverty rate, yet the incidence of both deprivation and exclusion are higher in Australia, while validated poverty is higher in Britain. The distributional profiles of deprivation and exclusion are shown to be very different in the two countries. These differences are explained by the very low incomes of low-income households in Britain, relative to other British households and relative to their Australian counterparts. In overall terms, the results suggest that the three groups facing the greatest risk in both countries are lone parents, single non-aged people and large (couple) families. This suggests that policies designed to improve low incomes would be targeted very differently from those aimed at alleviating deprivation or <b>combating</b> <b>exclusion...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{theoretical}} concept {{of social capital}} as its framework to examine festivals {{in the context of}} social and cultural policy. Government policies have cited the arts as a tool for <b>combating</b> social <b>exclusion,</b> overcoming barriers between people and fostering community cohesion. Social capital theorist Robert Putnam specifically suggests that cultural events can bring together diverse social groups. To investigate these claims in practice, this study collected empirical data at three festivals: a pop festival, an opera festival and a folk festival. The empirical data, comprising observations, screening questionnaires and in-depth interviews, was analysed using critical discourse analysis to bring out styles and discourses relating to social interactions. It was found that the reinforcement of existing relationships, termed bonding social capital by Putnam, was {{an important part of the}} festival experience. The formation of bridging social capital: that is, new and enduring social connections with previously unconnected attendees was not, however, found to be a feature of festivals, despite a sense of general friendliness and trust identified by some. Furthermore, drawing on Bourdieu???s conceptualisation of social capital, festival attendees were found to be remarkably similar in their demographic make-up, also throwing doubt on policy-related suggestions that festivals could be sites of inter-connections between people from diverse backgrounds. This study therefore suggests that music festivals are not valuable sites for social and cultural policy aims of <b>combating</b> social <b>exclusion,</b> bridging barriers between groups and fostering wider community cohesion...|$|R

The inquiry presents the main points of Hungarian public debate around integrative education, in which the Roma population plays an absolutely central role. Beyond the Roma issue, these debates concern other integrative measures dealing with other disadvantaged groups. The Roma political debate is concerned with growing segregation, xenophobia and exclusion, presenting the views of integrationists and segregationists, educational modernists, conservatives and beyond – or above them, a “hybrid ” state inclusionist program drawing on national and European sources and mixing liberal and interventionist principles...|$|R

This report focuses on social exclusion among the elderly (defined as the 55 + age group) in the EU’s member states. Social exclusion has been conceptualised as a state of individuals in relation to four dimensions. Two of these dimensions – material deprivation and social rights – are of a structural nature. The other two – social participation and normative integration – pertain to social settings and subcultural factors. Theoretically and empirically, the dimensions refer to one latent underlying social exclusion variable.

In this study, the measuring instrument has been extended to EU member states, performing secondary analyses of various surveys...|$|R
40|$|The social {{exclusion}} agenda has been enthusastically embraced by policymakers across Europe. A key {{feature of this}} agenda is the emphasis on paid work as a mechanism of social inclusion. However, the UK government is about to implement the Police Act (1997) which will increase the access of employers to the criminal records of job applicants. The author investigates how employers currently respond to job applications from offenders, and examines the likely impact of this new legislation on their recruitment. The key findings are that the Police Act will heighten discrimination against offenders, undermining the policy focus on <b>combating</b> social <b>exclusion.</b> This contradiction reflects the increasingly punitive response of successive UK governments to those committing criminal acts, and the narrow way in which {{social exclusion}} has been defined. ...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{exclusion}} and debt redemption This article deals {{with issues of}} financial exclusion. It reports upon the growing scale of such exclusion in contemporary Britain, explores its causes and considers the policies currently pursued by government. The authors suggest that present policies concentrate upon supply-side solutions, looking to improve the provision of mainstream financial services to impoverished individuals and communities. These supply-side solutions rely upon exhortation and the mobilization of good-will among providing institutions, rather than the enforcement of legal obligation. The article then outlines a particular initiative designed to tackle financial exclusion from a demand-side perspective, {{that is to say}} through the improvement of the financial circumstances of indebted individuals themselves. It concludes by emphasizing the contribution which such ‘bottom-up’, rather than ‘top-down’, solutions can make to <b>combating</b> financial <b>exclusion.</b> Key words: credit unions, poverty, social exclusion...|$|R

40|$|Although {{social tourism}} {{has been seen}} {{in a number of}} {{countries}} as having potential to counter social exclusion, formulating a definition for the term is difficult. "Social tourism" is used to describe a variety of initiatives for a variety of different social groups. These range from holidays for children from low-income backgrounds, through improving accessibility in hotels, to offering ecological holidays. This article discusses the definitions of "social tourism," distinguishing host-related and visitor-related forms, and aims to clarify its potential value in <b>combating</b> social <b>exclusion.</b> It does so by examining the ethical values underlying the way social tourism is defined and suggesting a theoretical framework for the effects of social tourism. Some ethical views of society place an a priori moral duty on the stronger strata to support the weaker. Others do not judge the support of the weaker strata as an a priori dominant ethical principle, and judge the welfare of the state by the opportunity of all its strata. Ethical positions that see stronger strata as having a moral duty to support the weaker {{are more likely to be}} supportive toward both host-related and visitor-related social tourism. Those that do not will probably support host-related social tourism, but will support visitor-related social tourism, if publicly funded, only if it can demonstrate benefits for the whole of society. In Western liberal democracies where this is a prevailing view, visitor-related social tourism might justify public expenditure as a potential tool to combat social exclusion. It can be seen as a merit good if it improves excluded peoples' handicapping characteristics, through, for example, beneficial effects in health, self-esteem, and improvement of family relationships. However, there is little research to test its effectiveness in achieving these outcomes. Further research is required to evaluate whether social tourism can have a significant role in <b>combating</b> social <b>exclusion,</b> and thus justify support from public expenditure.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} current perception that being ‘NEET’ (not in employment, education or training) presents a major risk for young people of becoming socially excluded. One of the key foci for <b>combating</b> social <b>exclusion</b> thus aims at reducing the numbers {{of young people who}} are NEET. This is reflected in the ‘programme theories’ of the Connexions service, whose effectiveness is measured in relation to targets for reducing the numbers of NEET young people. This paper argues, however, that ‘NEET’ is a problematic concept that defines young people by what they are not, and subsumes under a negatively-perceived label a heterogeneous mix of young people whose varied situations and difficulties are not conceptualised. Additionally, research evidence suggests that adherence to NEET-reduction targets encourages a ‘fire-fighting’ approach to working with young people rather than focusing support and intervention on areas where they may be most productive...|$|R

The paper then goes on to consider the policy implications of area effects and suggests that accepting them offers a strong challenge to conventional thinking about area regeneration and that less inward-looking policy programmes need to be developed.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} analyses {{a nationwide}} school-building programme in England: Building Schools for the Future (BSF). It is argued that, between 2003 and 2010, the UK Government’s policy guidance for BSF represented a (re) turn to utopian discourse in governmental policy-making, mobilised {{in order to}} justify a massive programme of new school building in the UK. In doing so, BSF connected with the promise of three further discourses: school(-children), community and architectural practice. It anticipated that new school buildings would instil transformative change—modernising English schooling, <b>combating</b> social <b>exclusion</b> and leaving an architectural “legacy”. However, it is argued that BSF constituted an allegorical utopia: whilst suggesting a “radical” vision for schooling and society, its ultimate effect was to preserve a conventional (neo-liberal) model of schooling. The paper highlights the critical role that notions of utopia might have in negotiating—and challenging—promise-laden mega-building policies like BSF. In doing so, it develops recent geographical research on utopia, education and architecture. Peer-reviewedPost-print 11251...|$|R

It considers the philosophy and political economy underpinning New Labour policy, and explains {{the economic and}} social policy prescriptions that follow from these principles. The government's social exclusion agenda has provoked a wide range of controversies and debates in the academic and political communities. In addition to putting a perspective on the government's political economy of social exclusion, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to explore key debates. The story of New Labour‟s political economy of social exclusion therefore pauses at key junctures to discuss eight controversies and dilemmas representing a range of critical responses to third way thinking about social inclusion. It is concluded that New Labour's approach to social exclusion is contractarian, offering conditional access to the mainstream to outsiders. The individual pledges to take responsibility across the full spectrum of social life, from enhancing her employability to maintaining a healthy life style. The state is re-shaped to bear part of the risk that such responsible individuals face, but in ways that minimise dependency and the social wage...|$|R
40|$|With {{the setting}} {{up of the}} Social Exclusion Unit (SEU) in December 1997, the {{question}} of social exclusion has become central to the social policies of the new Labour government. The SEU itself is initially concerned with truancy and school exclusions and their contribution to crime and with reducing the numbers of rough sleepers. It is also concerned with, for example, the exclusion of sections of the population from access to financial services such as banks. Exclusion is seen to afflict areas, rather than simply individuals. The guiding principle of the SEU is that the multi-dimensional problems of poverty and social exclusion (presumed to be connected but not identical) require co-ordinated policy initiatives. The remit of the unit also includes developing indicators of success in <b>combating</b> social <b>exclusion.</b> Over the coming years, establishing appropriate measures of social exclusion and monitoring their movement will be a key issue in social policy.

40|$|In modern {{societies}} like Ireland, {{every citizen}} {{needs to have}} appropriate access to a current account, a debit card or credit in order to lead a normal life. However, Ireland has {{the lowest level of}} access to a current account in Western Europe, some of its population relies on moneylenders to access credit, and an increasing number of borrowers are facing overindebtedness. Therefore, financial inclusion is a key social policy issue for a cohesive Ireland.

This paper, Understanding and <b>Combating</b> Financial <b>Exclusion</b> and Overindebtedness in Ireland: a European Perspective, looks at how Ireland could promote financial inclusion. It does this by developing an in-depth analysis of the responses implemented in the United Kingdom, France and Belgium.

40|$|It {{is evident}} {{that the concept of}} 'social capital' has {{recently}} come to the forefront of many governmental strategies aimed at <b>combating</b> social <b>exclusion.</b> In particular the interpretation of social capital used by many authors and agencies is one that emphasises the importance of not only social networks and contacts, but also a social responsibility to one's local community and wider society. Most notably it is poor people and poorer neighbourhoods that are seen to be lacking in these forms of social capital, and therefore emphasis is placed upon individual and community responsibility for tackling their own (and other's) exclusion. Drawing on in-depth interviews with women living on a deprived inner-city housing estate in the north of England, this research considers existing practices, forms and gendered nature of social capital for these women. The paper concludes that contrary to popular beliefs, many of these women already possessed forms of social capital, and specifically, that this was beneficial in helping them cope and 'get by' within their everyday experiences of social exclusion. This research highlights the potential exclusionary nature of social capital for certain individuals and the limitations of social capital in helping excluded women to escape their poverty.

40|$|From the Introduction]. As the {{conclusions}} from the Lisbon Council in 2000 make clear, 2 {{the search for}} increased levels of employment with higher skills and increased economic growth has supplanted inflation as the key macroeconomic policy issue in the EU. This {{is part of a}} 10 -year action programme to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. Increased employment participation is central for the wider goal of improving welfare by reducing social exclusion and hence increasing social inclusion. One of three principal action areas is modernising the European social model, investing in people and <b>combating</b> social <b>exclusion.</b> In implementing this, the Council decided to apply a new open method of coordination. There is potential conflict between achievement of the wider social objective and pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policy (Gold and Mayes 1993). Trying to improve the growth rate, investment and R&D tends to increase public spending. Tackling unemployment, deprivation and other forms of exclusion involves increased transfers through the tax/benefit system. Although the consequent ‘inflation bias’ is addressed by the monetary policy framework in the Maastricht Treaty, problems remain. At some point, below current levels in the EU, such increases {{in the role of the}} public sector can be counterproductive and by reducing incentives actually diminish the overall growth in GDP and employment (Koskela and Viren 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a review of the {{literature}} within the fields of public librarianship, social exclusion and empathy. Design/methodology/approach – The cross-disciplinary review involved the consultation of material from disciplines including library and information management, politics, social policy and social sciences, cultural studies, psychology, management and organizational theory. It was structured according to the following themes: exclusion, inclusion and social policy, social inclusion in public services and the cultural sector, the role of public libraries in social inclusion and professional empathy and the public library service. Findings –The concept of social inclusion remains at the core of public library policy and strategy, and is embedded in contemporary social theory. Conflicting views have emerged as to the perceived and actual role of the public library in <b>combating</b> social <b>exclusion,</b> with a need expressed for research to be conducted that bridges the gap between the “philosophical” interpretations of community librarianship and the more practical, “real world” studies, in order to fully understand the concept of community librarianship. A critical link is made between social inclusion and public librarianship to professional empathy. Research limitations/implications – The paper provides an edited version of the overall literature review, yet it is felt that it would be of theoretical and practical relevance and value to the professional and academic communities. Originality/value – Empathy is a relatively new concept in librarianship research, and prior to the study of which this review forms a part only limited findings have been available. ...|$|R

The study highlights how the discourse on networks tends to offer a partial and simplitic view on the functioning of the networked forms of coordination and self-organising, eliciting those analytical dimensions that could be related to the issue of power. On the contrary it is crucial, it is argued, to take seriously into account the issue of power, if the dynamics of networks are to be understood. The study will also highlight and address the tension and the clash bewteen two different and conflicting representations of innovation. The prevailing of one or another understanding in the enactment of innovation policies can be regarded as strongly influencing, it is argued, the possibility to effectively pursue the development of a bottom-up innovation and the embedding of the innovations themselves in local contexts...|$|R

This paper brings together critical perspectives on both the nature of risk and ethical decision making in the context of social work admissions of applicants with criminal convictions. It locates the concepts of risk and risk assessment within General Social Care Council (GSCC) guidance. The epistemological assumptions underpinning risk assessments are explored and the differences in psychological and sociological approaches to understanding risk are outlined. However, decisions to admit or reject an ex-offender involve ethical and moral judgements. The contribution of ethical thinking to decision making, in relation the admission of ex-offenders, to social work training is described. The paper concludes by suggesting that social work admissions procedures need to be informed by: an explicit epistemological standpoint, transparent risk assessment procedures and clearly articulated ethical thinking...|$|R
