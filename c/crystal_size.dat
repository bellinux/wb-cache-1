25|$|Roughly {{three-quarters of}} all Martian meteorites can be {{classified}} as shergottites. They are named after the Shergotty meteorite, which fell at Sherghati, India in 1865. Shergottites are igneous rocks of mafic to ultramafic lithology. They fall into three main groups, the basaltic, olivine-phyric (such as the Tissint group found in Morocco in 2011) and lherzolitic shergottites, based on their <b>crystal</b> <b>size</b> and mineral content. They can be categorised alternatively into three or four groups based on their rare-earth element content. These two classification systems do not line up with each other, hinting at complex relationships between the various source rocks and magmas that the shergottites formed from.|$|E

Cation ordering and particle sizes were determined as a function of annealing temperature with subsequent electrochemical performance monitored by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge–discharge testing. With increasing annealing temperature, L 333 exhibits a greater cation ordering, which subsequently benefitted cell performance. However, higher annealing temperatures yielded larger <b>crystal</b> <b>sizes,</b> which resulted in a decrease in high rate discharge capacity and a significant capacity fade. This is attributed to an increase in lattice parameter and volume expansion during cycling, with the largest <b>crystal</b> <b>sizes</b> displaying the most significant structural changes due to the lower strain accommodation.

500|$|There {{are three}} types of natural graphite—amorphous, flake or {{crystalline}} flake, and vein or lump. Amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant. Contrary to science, in industry [...] "amorphous" [...] refers to very small <b>crystal</b> <b>size</b> rather than complete lack of crystal structure. Amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite. Large amorphous graphite deposits are found in China, Europe, Mexico and the United States. Flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous; it occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock. Flake graphite can be four times the price of amorphous. Good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses, such as flame retardants. The foremost deposits are found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and Madagascar. Vein or lump graphite is the rarest, most valuable, and highest quality type of natural graphite. It occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps, {{and it is only}} commercially mined in Sri Lanka.|$|E

2500|$|A 2005 {{work has}} shown that the slip is a matrix of mainly silicon and {{aluminium}} oxides, within which are suspended sub-microscopic crystals of haematite and corundum. The matrix itself does not contain any metallic ions, the haematite is substituted in aluminium and titanium while the corundum is substituted in iron. The two crystal populations are homogenously dispersed within the matrix. [...] The colour of haematite depends on the <b>crystal</b> <b>size.</b> Large crystals of this mineral are black but as the size decreases to sub-micron the colour shifts to red. The fraction of aluminium has a similar effect. It was formerly thought that the difference between 'red' and 'black' samian was due to the presence (black) or absence (red) of reducing gases from the kiln and that the construction of the kiln was so arranged as to prevent the reducing gases from the fuel from coming into contact with the pottery. The presence of iron oxides in the clay/slip was thought to be reflected in the colour according to the oxidation state of the iron (Fe for the red and Fe for the black, the latter produced by the reducing gases coming into contact with the pottery during firing). It now appears {{as a result of this}} recent work that this is not the case and that the colour of the glossy slip is in fact due to no more than the <b>crystal</b> <b>size</b> of the minerals dispersed within the matrix glass.|$|E
2500|$|Solubility (metastable, at {{concentrations}} approaching saturation) {{also depends}} on the physical size of the crystal or droplet of solute (or, strictly speaking, on the specific surface area or molar surface area of the solute). For quantification, see the equation in the article on solubility equilibrium. For highly defective crystals, solubility may increase with the increasing degree of disorder. Both of these effects occur because of the dependence of solubility constant on the Gibbs energy of the crystal. The last two effects, although often difficult to measure, are of practical importance. [...] For example, they provide the driving force for precipitate aging (the <b>crystal</b> <b>size</b> spontaneously increasing with time).|$|E
2500|$|Elemental boron {{has been}} found in star dust and meteorites but does not exist in the high oxygen {{environment}} of Earth. It is difficult to extract from its compounds. The earliest methods involved reduction of boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However, the product is almost always contaminated with metal borides. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Very pure boron, for use in semiconductor industry, is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures, followed by purification via zone melting or the Czochralski process. Even more difficult to prepare are single crystals of pure boron phases, due to polymorphism and the tendency [...] of boron to react with impurities; typical <b>crystal</b> <b>size</b> is ~0.1mm.|$|E
30|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the tooth enamel <b>crystal</b> domain <b>size</b> was associated with its optical properties; when the enamel <b>crystal</b> domain <b>size</b> is larger, its lightness is lower (Eimar et al. 2011).

Among other findings, this study confirmed that the two halves of the map were entirely separate, though they might have been joined in the past. A few months earlier, Kirsten Seaver had suggested that a forger could have found two separate blank leaves in the original [...] "Speculum Historiale" [...] volume, from which the first few dozen pages appeared to be missing, and joined them together with the binding strip. On the other hand, at the International Conference on the History of Cartography in July 2009, Larsen revealed that his team had continued their investigation after publishing their original report, and he told the press that [...] "All the tests that we have done {{over the past five years}} — on the materials and other aspects — do not show any signs of forgery". The formal report of his presentation shows that his work ignores rather than contradicts earlier studies. For example, he experimented only with artificial wormholes, and did not follow up the observation made at the 1966 Conference, that live bookworms were a known tool of the fake antiquities trade. Similarly, he claimed that the anatase in the ink could have come from sand used to dry it (the hypothetical source of the sand being gneiss from the Binnenthal area of Switzerland) but his team had not examined the crystals microscopically, and Kenneth Towe responded that this was an essential test, given that <b>crystal</b> <b>size</b> and shape should clearly distinguish commercial anatase from anatase found in sand.|$|E
