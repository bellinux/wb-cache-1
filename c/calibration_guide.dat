40|$|Measuring soil {{moisture}} with cosmic-ray neutrons is a promising technique for intermediate spatial scales. To convert neutron counts to average volumetric soil water content a simple calibration function {{can be used}} (the N 0 -calibration of Desilets et al., 2010). The calibration is based on soil water content derived directly from soil samples taken within the footprint of the sensor. We installed a cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRS) in a mixed forest in the lowlands of north-eastern Germany and calibrated it 10  times throughout one calendar year. Each calibration with the N 0 -calibration function resulted in a different CRS {{soil moisture}} time series, with deviations of up to 0. 1  m 3  m − 3 (24  % of the total range) for individual values of soil water content. Also, many of the calibration efforts resulted in time series {{that could not be}} matched with independent in situ measurements of soil water content. We therefore suggest a modified calibration function with a different shape that can vary from one location to another. A two-point calibration was found to effectively define the shape of the modified calibration function if the calibration points were taken during both dry and wet conditions spanning {{at least half of the}} total range of soil moisture. The best results were obtained when the soil samples used for calibration were linearly weighted as a function of depth in the soil profile and nonlinearly weighted as a function of distance from the CRS, and when the depth-specific amount of soil organic matter and lattice water content was explicitly considered. The annual cycle of tree foliation was found to be a negligible factor for calibration because the variable hydrogen mass in the leaves was small compared to the hydrogen mass changes by soil moisture variations. As a final point, we provide a <b>calibration</b> <b>guide</b> for a CRS in forested environments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} move away from more formal route-choice models and to avoid <b>calibration</b> issues, {{visually}} <b>guided</b> agent-based models have recently been introduced to microscopic urban models of pedestrian behavior. Although the new models produce good correlation between the agents and observed pedestrian movement, there are two problems with them. Firstly, the implementations have lacked an origin-destination matrix, and so the models work best in situations where undirected exploratory movement is likely to occur. Secondly, the models rely on precalculated visibility graphs to store visual data from locations within the system; these graphs use a large amount of computer memory. Here we show that a line of sight model using reduced visual information compares well with the destination selection method, and further, that the addition of a simple origin-destination matrix can lead to better agent correlation with pedestrian movement...|$|R

40|$|Time-to-contact (TTC) {{is defined}} as the {{remaining}} time for an object to reach the observer. This is an important quantity for timing an action such as hitting or catching a ball. This thesis deals with learning processes in TTC perception when binocular vision is available. Chapter 1 studies the learning of TTC in relative discrimination tasks. We did not find learning in this task, but we found that simple correlates of TTC explained the judgments made by the participants. Chapter 2 studies the learning of TTC in absolute estimation tasks. We found that the variable and constant error of the responses reduced with training. Chapter 3 studied the use of feedback in calibrating the timing of TTC estimates. We found that biased timing produced changes in the constant error, suggesting that TTC <b>calibration</b> is <b>guided</b> by feedback. Chapter 4 studied if the reduction of variable error was due to an increased perceptual sensitivity to TTC. However, we failed to find transfer from the absolute estimation tasks to relative discrimination tasks, suggesting that the learning found in Chapter 2 might not be of perceptual origin. In Chapter 5 we studied a large group of participants in laboratory tasks and a natural hitting task. We found that the performance in relative discrimination and absolute estimation tasks could be used to predict hitting skill. This suggests that the perception of TTC can be linked with interceptive timing. Taken together, these results suggest that perceptual sensitivity to TTC changes slightly -if at all- with training, but changes in perceptuo-motor mapping and calibration of the estimates that increase interceptive performance do take place.

40|$|Abstract:- Camera {{calibration}} is {{an indispensable}} step for augmented reality or image guided applications. In {{the context of}} three-dimensional machine vision, camera calibration is the process to determine the internal camera geometry and optical characteristics and/or the 3 -D position and orientation of the camera frame relative to a certain world coordinate system. Usually, a camera calibration procedure exhibits typical steps, including feature point location in the acquired images, camera model fitting, correction of distortion introduced by the optics and finally an optimization of the model’s parameters. Thus, the components required for designing new calibration procedures show {{a high degree of}} similarity, so that reuse of the processing steps plays an important role. For this reason, we present fundamental design issues of a component-based <b>calibration</b> framework, which <b>guides</b> and supports the researcher in writing reusable software components and therefore, improves the efficiency of his work.

However, the effective design, construction {{and operation of}} naturally ventilated buildings require {{a good understanding of}} complex airflow patterns caused by the buoyancy and wind effects. The work presented in this article employed a 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis in order to investigate environmental conditions and thermal comfort of the occupants of a highly-glazed naturally ventilated meeting room. This analysis was facilitated by the real-time field measurements performed in an operating building, and previously developed formal calibration methodology for reliable CFD models of indoor environments. Since, creating an accurate CFD model of an occupied space in a real-life scenario requires a high level of CFD expertise, trusted experimental data and an ability to interpret model input parameters; the <b>calibration</b> methodology <b>guided</b> towards a robust and reliable CFD model of the indoor environment. This calibrated CFD model was then used to investigate indoor environmental conditions and to evaluate thermal comfort indices for the occupants of the room. Thermal comfort expresses occupants 2 ̆ 7 satisfaction with thermal environment in buildings by defining the range of indoor thermal environmental conditions acceptable to a majority of occupants.

40|$|An {{electro-optical}} infrared (EO-IR) sensor’s Operational Envelope is the {{parameter space}} where the sensor can physically operate. The Valid Operating Region (VOR) is {{a subset of the}} Operational Envelope and is the parameter {{space where the}} sensor can return calibratable data. The traditional VOR (TVOR) is a small subset of the VOR that is the intended on-orbit operating range for each parameter. Usually, sensors are calibrated only over their TVOR. We describe a method to produce radiometric and Line-of-Sight (LOS) calibrations over the entire VOR, enabling a sensor to perform its mission and return calibrated data through changing operating conditions, such as are experienced early on-orbit or during spacecraft anomalies. This method expands the calibration to compensate for all known input variations, rather than the traditional approach of minimizing input variations. The ground test method described builds a statistical calibration model as ground test data is collected, where the model determines if there is sufficient data in a particular region of the parameter space and where additional data may need to be collected to meet mission LOS and radiometric accuracy requirements.

To derive recommendations for best practice when using such systems. Background: Computer enhancement algorithms allow better visualization of intracoronary stents to assist in ensuring adequate stent deployment. Factors that affect the accuracy of measurements taken on such systems are yet to be fully understood. Methods: We analysed stent deployment of 43 stents in 33 patients measuring minimum stent diameter and cross sectional area (CSA) using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), SB enhanced x-ray images, and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). We investigated if the use of two projections and method of calibration influenced correlation between IVUS and SB measurements. Results: Using two views and performing <b>calibration</b> via the <b>guide</b> catheter improved agreement between SB and IVUS measurements. For example, minimum stent diameter assessed with SB using one view and balloon markers for calibration produced a correlation coefficient, r, of 0. 21, whereas using two views and the <b>guide</b> catheter for <b>calibration</b> increased agreement to r = 0. 62. Relative measures of stent deployment, such as the ratio of minimum to maximum CSA, produced good correlation between IVUS and SB (r = 0. 74). Conclusions: When using the SB system, two projection angles {{should be used to}} image the stent. For absolute measurements, the guide catheter should be used for calibration purposes. Relative measures of stent size, which are probably sufficient for assessment of deployment, also give good agreement with similar measures on IVUS, and require no calibration...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Numerical {{simulation}} models of hydrologic processes {{can be effective}} tools for inferring the consequences of environmental change for water resource systems. In river basins that originate in partially glacierized catchments traditional widely used hydrological modeling approaches are not suitable for prediction of these consequences as they lack {{a representation of the}} storage and movement of glacier ice reservoirs on the land surface. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, a framework for applying a recently developed complex glacio-hydrological model suitable for these predictions is described. This methodology was applied to a well instrumented heavily glacierized watershed in the Bolivia Andes. Using long-term projections of climate change constructed from CMIP 5 Global Climate Model (GCM) outputs using a stochastic weather generator the model framework was applied to predict evolving hydrological processes from 1987 - 2100. These predictions served as a baseline for testing sensitivities of hydrological response to model structure and parameter selection. The importance of local insitu data to <b>guide</b> <b>calibration</b> and parameter selection of complex glacio-hydrological models is demonstrated. Debris cover on glaciers can retard ablation on the surface of glaciers, significantly affecting the rate of response to warming temperatures. In the second part of this work, algorithms that represent the storage and conductance of heat through supraglacial debris on glacier surfaces were developed into the glacio-hydrological model described in part 1. These model developments were tested against point measurement of ablation underneath debris. Model simulations indicate the relative role of debris cover on the evolution of glacier area and summer discharge in upland drainages in the Hood River Basin, OR. Furthermore, this work is used to demonstrate strong inter-decadal patterns of glacio-hydrological processes that are superimposed on the response to a longer term trend from a warming climate. This highlights the timescales of analysis required to evaluate hydrological response to glacier recession. The third and last topic of this dissertation focuses on regional patterns of glacio-hydrological response in the Pacific Northwest United States. This chapter describes a modeling study with specific emphasis on the following research objectives: (1) characterize how hydrological response to glacier recession varies within the region; (2) identify vulnerable downstream locations in space and time; and (3) quantify at which spatial scales glacier melt is a significant contributor to discharge patterns. The long-term coupled glacio-hydrological response for a sample of watersheds that span sharp climatic gradients (maritime to continental), a range of temperate northern latitudes (45 - 49 °), and varying local physiological attributes (e. g., range of elevations, wind/leeward) in the Pacific Northwestern United States (PNW) is predicted...|$|R
