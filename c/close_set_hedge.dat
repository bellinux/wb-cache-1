40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} {{enumeration}} problem for essential <b>closed</b> <b>sets</b> {{of a formal}} context. Essential <b>closed</b> <b>sets</b> are sets that can be writ-ten as the closure of a pseudo-intent. The results for enumeration of essential <b>closed</b> <b>sets</b> are similar to existing results for pseudo-intents, al-beit some differences exist. For example, while {{it is possible to}} compute the lectically first pseudo-intent in polynomial time, we show that {{it is not possible to}} compute the lectically first essential <b>closed</b> <b>set</b> in poly-nomial time unless P = NP. This also proves that essential <b>closed</b> <b>sets</b> cannot be enumerated in the lectic order with polynomial delay unless P = NP.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{address the problem}} of pricing options in the {{presence}} of transaction costs. A known approach to this problem is a so-called superhedging approach. I suggest an idea of <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> and, based on it, a new algorithm to implement the superhedging approach. As far as I know, only European options were discussed in the literature on pricing derivatives when there are transaction costs. The proposed algorithm, however, can be applied to price American options as well. It is also more efficient compared with the previous methods. The superhedging approach is based on the problem of finding the cheapest portfolio now for which there is a trading strategy with consumption such that for every possible outcome the value of the portfolio {{at the time of the}} option exercise is not less than the value of the option (when the short position in the option is considered). A notion of a <b>hedging</b> <b>set</b> is introduced in the article to help to solve this problem. A discrete time economy is considered with price movements of an underlying asset being modeled by a recombining tree. At the current tree node a <b>hedging</b> <b>set</b> is defined as a set of portfolios that can hedge the considered option in the sense of superhedging. It is easy to build <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> for every tree node at the time of the option exercise. I also show how to build <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> for the current tree nodes given <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> of the next tree nodes when there are proportional transaction costs. Thus the solution to the stated problem comes from building <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> backward the tree and then finding the cheapest portfolio in the first <b>hedging</b> <b>set.</b> I discuss in detail the idea of <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> and how to price European and American options under the presence of proportional transaction costs. Appropriate numerical examples are also given. I believe that the idea of <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> is versatile as it allows using a tree of any type to model price movements of an underlying asset when pricing and hedging derivatives using the superhedging approach. Also, multidimensional <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> may allow pricing and hedging derivatives that depend on several random factors...|$|R
