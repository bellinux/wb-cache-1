The breed scored an average of 5 points, with a score of 0 being low, while 106 is high. In a 2006 breed specific survey conducted by The Kennel Club and the British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee, responses highlighted several health issues. The primary <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> identified was that of cancer, being responsible for 35.6% of deaths, with the most common forms being that of liver cancer or lymphoma. The secondary <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> was cardiac related, with forms such as heart failure, or unspecified heart defects.

Neurological assessments were performed according to the American Spinal Injury Association scale. Data on <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were analyzed using the ICD- 10 classifications.

No significant differences in <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were identified between these two groups. In patients surviving >/= 10 years, paraplegia {{was associated with a}} higher life expectancy compared with tetraplegia, 34 and 25 years (p = 0. 008), respectively, and the leading <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were septicemia (n = 14), ischemic heart disease (n = 10), neoplasms (n = 9), cerebrovascular diseases (n = 5), and other forms of heart diseases (n = 5).

This thesis also focuses on risk factors and prevention of considered groups <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> again primarily with regard to gender differences. Indicators used for this purposes consist of standardized mortality rate, the age-specific probability <b>of</b> <b>death</b> from a given cause, temporary life expectancy and decomposition of the difference of temporary life expectancy between men and women by age groups.

5|$|If the {{compressed}} {{air in a}} diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, particularly a rapid one, then the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The air may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Although AGE may occur {{as a result of}} other causes, it is most often secondary to PBT. AGE is the second most common <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> while diving (drowning being the most common stated <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death).</b> Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. The following table presents those signs and symptoms which have been observed in more than ten percent of cases diagnosed as AGE, with approximate estimates of frequency.|$|E
5|$|In fatal {{cases of}} {{ordinary}} smallpox, death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth {{days of the}} illness. The <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> from smallpox is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs.

In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. <b>Cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema. In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained viremia, severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death.

5|$|Taphonomy is {{the study}} of the {{processes}} an organism’s body undergoes after it dies, which includes a study of preservation, the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> and the circumstances of burial. The large, monospecific assemblage of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group of dinosaurs that was killed by a volcanic ashfall. This assemblage is considered autochthonous, meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the same spot where the individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis- an actual life assemblage of animals. The <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in a volcanic ashfall is suffocation by the ash and by the gases released from volcanic eruptions.
