40|$|This {{research}} utilizes the repetitive control {{approach in}} morphing a high-speed cam mechanism {{so that its}} output displacement tracks the desired output trajectory. The main objective {{is to reduce the}} output tracking error, which is the difference between the actual and desired output displacements of the output mass. A 3 -degree of freedom mathematical model is used to analyze and represent the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> system. The output tracking error in <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> systems is generally caused by errors in cam profile manufacturing, variation in the speed of the driving motor and the dynamics of the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> system. Theoretical and experimental results show that the output tracking error is greatly reduced after repetitive control has been applied to the system. As a result, the actual output displacement tracks the desired output displacement very closely...|$|R

50|$|While roller <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> {{are similar}} to roller {{bearings}}, {{there are quite a}} few differences. Standard ball and roller bearings are designed to be pressed into a rigid housing, which provides circumferential support. This keeps the outer race from deforming, so the race cross-section is relatively thin. In the case of <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> the outer race is loaded at a single point, so the outer race needs a thicker cross-section to reduce deformation. However, in order to facilitate this the roller diameter must be decreased, which also decreases the dynamic bearing capacity.|$|E

2500|$|Sliding {{friction}} between {{the surface of the}} cam and the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> which rides upon it can be considerable. In order to reduce wear at this point, the <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> are both surface hardened, and modern lubricant motor oils contain additives specifically to reduce sliding friction. The lobes of the camshaft are usually slightly tapered and the faces of the valve lifters slightly domed, causing the lifters to rotate to distribute wear on the parts. The surfaces of the <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> are designed to [...] "wear in" [...] together, and therefore each follower should stay with its original cam lobe and never be moved to a different lobe. You can put new lifters on an old cam but never old lifters on a new cam. In some engines the followers have rollers which eliminate the sliding friction and wear but add mass to the valvetrain.|$|R
