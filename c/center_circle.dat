The <b>center</b> <b>circle</b> is the dance arena, outside of which is a larger circle {{consisting}} of the MC's table, drum groups, and sitting areas for dancers and their families. Beyond these two circles for participants is an area for spectators, while outside of all are designated areas with vendor's booths, where one can buy food (including frybread and Indian tacos), music, jewelry, souvenirs, arts and crafts, beadwork, leather, and regalia supplies.|$|E
500|$|For all archery {{events at}} the Olympics, archers stand 70 metres from their target. The target {{consists}} of concentric circles, and has a total diameter of 122 cm. Archers earn points based on which circle their arrow landed in, with ten points awarded for hitting the <b>center</b> <b>circle,</b> and one point awarded for hitting the outermost circle. During the ranking rounds, each archer shot twelve ends, or groups, of six arrows per end. The score from that round determined the match-ups in the elimination rounds, with high-ranking archers facing low-ranking archers. The first three rounds of elimination used six ends of three arrows, narrowing the field of archers from 64 to 8. The three final rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and medal matches) each used four ends of three arrows.|$|E
500|$|The game {{began with}} a tipoff between Kansas' seven foot tall Wilt Chamberlain and North Carolina's Tommy Kearns, who was not even six feet tall. Coach Frank McGuire sent out Kearns {{after he had been}} talking down Chamberlain the night before. The rest of the North Carolina squad set up in their zone defense rather than around the <b>center</b> <b>circle</b> per McGuire's request to [...] "show them the zone we were going to use." [...] The Jayhawks were unable to score on their opening {{possession}} and set up in their defense as the Tar Heels came down the court with the ball. Kansas' initial defense was a boxandone, which consisted of four players in a box around a basket while one player, Maurice King, played defense on North Carolina's Lennie Rosenbluth. Kearns received a pass along the baseline and was fouled in the act of shooting. Kearns missed the shot, but made both free throws to give Carolina the early 20 lead. Kansas missed a jump shot, and North Carolina's Joe Quigg converted a 12-foot baseline shot. Kansas scored their first points off of two free throws.|$|E

50|$|The lines {{joining the}} <b>centers</b> of the <b>circles</b> in Fig. 2 are {{perpendicular}} to the line segments AP, BQ and CR. For example, the line joining the <b>center</b> of the <b>circle</b> containing ARB and the <b>center</b> of the <b>circle</b> containing AQC, is {{perpendicular to the}} segment AP. So, the lines joining the <b>centers</b> of the <b>circles</b> also intersect at 60° angles. Therefore the <b>centers</b> of the <b>circles</b> form an equilateral triangle.
