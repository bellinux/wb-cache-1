5|$|Fourteen radioisotopes {{have been}} characterized. The most stable are 15O with a {{half-life}} of 122.24seconds and 14O with a half-life of 70.606seconds. All {{of the remaining}} radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 27s {{and the majority of}} these have half-lives that are less than 83milliseconds. The most common decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 16O is β+ decay to yield nitrogen, and the most <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> for the isotopes heavier than 18O is beta decay to yield fluorine.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{was formerly}} the second-most <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> of transmission for Chagas disease, but {{the development and}} implementation of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century. Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} bidirectional data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> component of the pair.|$|E

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} vanadium {{is composed}} of one stable isotope, 51V, and one radioactive isotope, 50V. The latter has a half-life of 1.5×1017 years and a natural abundance of 0.25%. 51V has a nuclear spin of , which is useful for NMR spectroscopy. Twenty-four artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, ranging in mass number from 40 to 65. The most stable of these isotopes are 49V with a half-life of 330 days, and 48V with a half-life of 16.0 days. The remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than an hour, most below 10 seconds. At least four isotopes have metastable excited states. Electron capture is the main decay mode for isotopes lighter than 51V. For the heavier ones, the most <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> is beta decay. The electron capture reactions lead {{to the formation of}} element 22 (titanium) isotopes, while beta decay leads to element 24 (chromium) isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-speed}} trains {{have successfully}} out-competed planes: by August 2008, {{half of the}} air routes between Taipei and the country's western cities had been discontinued, including all connections between cities with THSR stations except for a single daily connection between Taipei and Kaohsiung. Total domestic air traffic {{was expected to be}} halved from 2006 to 2008, and actually fell from 8.6 to 4.9million. In June 2012, officials announced the discontinuation of the last remaining commercial flight between Taipei and Kaohsiung. The share for conventional rail between Taipei and Kaohsiung fell from 9.71% in 2006 to 2.5% in 2008, while high-speed rail became the most <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> of transport at 50% of all trips by 2008. The opening of THSR led to a 10% reduction of traffic on the parallel expressway in 2007. Despite cheaper ticket prices, long-distance bus companies reported that passenger volumes had fallen by 20 to 30 percent by 2008.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} {{mode of transmission}} of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person. Globally, the most <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of ozone, only a few materials may be used like stainless steel (quality 316L), titanium, aluminium (as long as no moisture is present), glass, polytetrafluorethylene, or polyvinylidene fluoride. Viton may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). Hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water {{come in contact with}} it, except for normal atmospheric levels. Embrittlement or shrinkage is the <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> of failure of elastomer seals like O-rings.|$|E

25|$|Along with epimorphosis, some polychaetes like Sabella pavonina {{experience}} morphallactic regeneration. Morphallaxis {{involves the}} de-differentiation, transformation, and re-differentation of cells to regenerate tissues. How prominent morphallactic regeneration is in oligochaetes is currently not well understood. Although relatively under-reported, {{it is possible}} that morphallaxis is a <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> of inter-segment regeneration in annelids. Following regeneration in L. variegatus, past posterior segments sometimes become anterior in the new body orientation, consistent with morphallaxis.|$|E
