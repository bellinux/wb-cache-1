40|$|Most image {{analysis}} systems (IAS) use black-and-white cameras. However, true color IASs {{are considered to}} be useful for quantification of immunohistologically stained structures. Using a true color IAS, we evaluated two methods of segmentation for quantification of area percentage of staining: one using fixed, preset thresholds and one using thresholds interactively set per image. Furthermore, the effect of shading <b>correction</b> <b>pens</b> evaluated, and measurements in both color and black-and-white mode were compared. The results of segmentation with fixed thresholds did not differ significantly from those of control percentages, established by interactive morphometry using a grid, which served as reference. Interactive segmentation was significantly different from the reference (t test, P =. 0002). The effect of shading correction teas negligible. Measurements with and without this procedure correlated highly (r =. 99,...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Standard {{clinical}} documentation {{is an integral}} part of quality patient care. This study aimed to explore compliance of two Iranian teaching hospitals with the {{clinical documentation}} standards. Methods: A total of 400 records were surveyed. Data were collected using a checklist of standard measures. The checklist comprised 15 items selected from relevant guidelines from either the American Health Informa­tion Management Association or Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Findings: On average, 50. 2 % of medical records were provided in high compliance with standard measures, 26. 4 % in moderate compliance, and 23. 4 % in non-compliance. The average highest frequency of compliance with documentation standard was received by “Only blue ink is used for writing” (92 %), followed by “Consent forms are completed” (79 %) and “Highlighter pen or <b>correction</b> <b>pen</b> is avoided” (71 %). The average lowest frequency of compliance with standards was identified for “Admission form is typed and inserted as first page” (0. 5 %) followed by “Unusable elements for patient are mentioned” (0. 75 %), and both “Error corrections (if any) are signed and dated by the editor. ” (2. 52 %), and “Cause of error reporting (if any) is mentioned. ” (2. 52 %). Conclusions: Our results indicated an unsatisfactory level of compliance with clinical documentation standards in the studied hospitals. In addition, some of the lowest rated measures were related to documentation of errors in data re­cording and their subsequent correction, which can potentially lead to adverse patient outcome or legal consequences. Hence, our study provides further evidence for the urgency of developing strategies to improve commitment of Iranian hospitals to clinical documentation standards...|$|E

2500|$|The Mission School {{is closely}} {{aligned with the}} larger lowbrow art movement, and can be {{considered}} to be a regional expression of that movement. Artists of the Mission School take their inspiration from the urban, bohemian, [...] "street" [...] culture of the Mission District and are strongly influenced by mural and graffiti art, comic and cartoon art, and folk art forms such as sign painting and hobo art. These artists are also noted for use of non-traditional artistic materials, such as house paint, spray paint, <b>correction</b> fluid, ballpoint <b>pens,</b> scrapboard, and found objects. Gallery work by these artists is often displayed using the [...] "cluster method", in which a number of individual works (sometimes by different artists) are clustered closely together on a gallery wall, rather than the traditional gallery display method of widely separating individual works.|$|R
