Four of the fertilizers used were organic: two were hydrolyzed fur, one {{was made by}} hydrolyzed fur, farmyard manure, horn, and hoofs (Endurance), and one contained synthetic organic N [isobutylidendiurea (IBDU) ]. The fifth, on the contrary, was a mineral fertilizer (Entec 26) containing both nitrate (NO 3 2) and ammonium (NH 4 þ) and a nitrification inhibitor (3, 4 DMPP). The two soils used were a sandy loam (SL) and a clay loam (CL). The fertilizer-N release was conditioned by both the fertilizers and the soil characteristics. The highest accumulation of mineral N as NO 3 2 was observed in the SL soil for all the treatments. The lowest net N release was observed in both soils with End, which {{was found to be}} the most resistant to microbial attack and degradation. The two fur-based fertilizers released similar amounts of N, which was higher in the SL soil than in the <b>CL</b> <b>soil.</b> The highest accumulation of fertilizer-derived N in the <b>CL</b> <b>soil</b> resulted from IBDU; however, the net accumulation of N in the SL soil with this fertilizer was even higher than the amount of N initially added. This fact was attributed to an increase in mineralization of the soil’s native organic N. A real positive “priming effect ” was also observed in the SL soil with E 26. On the contrary, E 26 caused a low level of N accumulation in the <b>CL</b> <b>soil...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate soil biological and chemical factors that give rise to cereal yield enhancing effects of legume rotations on sandy, nutrient poor West African soils. The aim was not only to gain more information on the role of legume residues and microorganisms in the soil nutrient cycle. But the study aimed at evaluating if differences in substrate qualities (e. g. root residues) cause changes in the microbial community structure due to specific and highly complex microbe-root-soil interactions. Site and system specific reactions of microorganisms towards rewetting, simulating the onset of rainy season, were observed. Higher respiration rates, higher amounts of microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic) as well as higher ergosterol, muramic acid, glucosamine and adenylate concentrations were measured in <b>CL</b> <b>soils</b> of Koukombo and in both soils from Fada. The immediate increase in ATP concentrations after rewetting was likely caused by rehydration of microbial cells where N was not immobilized and, thus, available for plants facilitating their rapid development. Legume root residues led only to slightly better plant performances compared to the control, while the application of cereal roots reduced seedling growth. In contrast to sorghum seedlings, the microbial community did not react to the mineral treatment. Thus the energy supply in form of organic amendments increased microbial indices compared to mineral P application and the control. The results of basal respiration rates, Cmic and Corg levels indicate that the microbial community in the soil from Koukombo is less efficient in substrate use compared to microorganisms in the soil from Fada. However, the continuous carbon input by legume root residues might have contributed to these differences in soil fertility. With the 33 P isotopic exchange method a low buffering capacity was detected in both soils irrespective of treatments. Calculated E values (E 1 min to E 1 min- 1 d and E 1 d- 3 m) indicated a slowly release of P due to root turnover while applied mineral P is taken up by plants or fixed to the soil. Due to the fact that sorghum growth reacted mainly to the application of mineral P and the microorganisms solely to the organic inputs, the combination of both amendments seems to be the best approach to a sustainable increase of crop production on many nutrient-poor, sandy West African soils. In a pot experiment, were CC and <b>CL</b> <b>soils</b> from Fada and Koukombo were adjusted to the same level of P and N concentrations, crop growth was significantly higher on <b>CL</b> <b>soils,</b> compared to the respective treatments on CC soils. Mycorrhizal infection of roots was increased and the number of nematodes, predominantly free living nematodes, was almost halfed on rotation soils. In conclusion, increased nutrient availability (especially P and N) through the introduction of legumes is not the only reason for the observed yield increasing effects. Soil biological factors seem to also play an important role. In a root chamber experiment the pH gradient along the root-soil-interface was measured at three times using an antimony microelectrode. For Fada soils, pH values were higher on <b>CL</b> than CC <b>soils</b> while the opposite was true for the Koukombo soils. Site-specific differences between Fada and Koukombo soils in N content and microbial community structures might have created varying crop performances leading to the contrasting pH findings. However, the mechanisms involved in this highly complex microbe-root-soil interaction remain unclear. This study was financed by the German Research Foundation (DFG, BU 1308 / 4 - 1...|$|R

A loss of efficacy had {{been observed in}} two (LM and MS) of the three (CL) field soils as measured by R. reniformis population development {{and a lack of}} cotton yield response. Two soils were compared for the first test—one where aldicarb had been effective (CL) and the second where aldicarb had lost its efficacy (LM). The second test included all three soils: autoclaved, non-autoclaved and treated with aldicarb at 0. 59 kg a. i. /ha, or not treated with aldicarb.

Experimental investigation classified the untreated soil as A- 7 - 6 and <b>CL</b> <b>soil</b> according to AASHTO and USCS classification respectively.

40|$|A pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} test the hypothesis that decomposition of organic matter in sewage sludge and the consequent formation of dissolved organic compounds (DOC) would lead to an increase in the bioavailability of the heavy metals. Two Brown Earth soils, one with clayey loam texture (CL) and the other a loamy sand (LS) were mixed with sewage sludge at rates equivalent to 0, 10 and 50 1 dry sludge ha(- 1) and the pots were sown with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The organic matter content and heavy metal availability assessed with soil extractions with 0. 05 M CaCl 2 were monitored over a residual time of two years, while plant uptake over one year, after addition of the sludge. It was found that the concentrations of Cd and Ni in both the ryegrass and the soil extracts increased slightly but significantly during the first year. In most cases, this increase was most evident especially at the higher sludge application rate (50 t ha(- 1)). However, in the second year metal availability reached a plateau. Zinc concentrations in the ryegrass did not show an increase but the CaCl 2 extracts increased during the first year. In contrast, organic matter content decreased rapidly in the first months of the first year and much more slowly in the second (total decrease of 16 %). The concentrations of DOC increased significantly in the more organic rich <b>CL</b> <b>soil</b> in the course of two years.

40|$|Single or {{multiple}} factors implicated in subsoil constraints including salinity, sodicity, and phytotoxic concentrations of chloride (Cl) {{are present in}} many Vertosols including those occurring in Queensland, Australia. The variable distribution and the complex interactions that exist between these constraints limit the agronomic or management options available to manage the soil with these subsoil constraints. The identification of crops and cultivars adapted to these adverse subsoil conditions and/or able to exploit subsoil water may be an option to maintain productivity of these soils. We evaluated relative performance of 5 winter crop species, in terms of grain yields, nutrient concentration, and ability to extract soil water, grown on soils with various levels and combinations of subsoil constraints in 19 field experiments over 2 years. Subsoil constraints were measured by levels of <b>soil</b> <b>Cl,</b> electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (ECse), and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). Increasing levels of subsoil constraints significantly decreased maximum depth of water extraction, grain yield, and plant-available water capacity for all the 5 crops and more so for chickpea and durum wheat than bread wheat, barley, or canola. Increasing <b>soil</b> <b>Cl</b> levels had a greater restricting effect on water availability than did ECse and ESP. We developed empirical relationships between <b>soil</b> <b>Cl,</b> ECse, and ESP and crop lower limit (CLL) for estimating subsoil water extraction by 5 winter crops. However, the presence of gypsum influenced the ability to predict CLL based on the levels of ECse. Stronger relationships between apparent unused plant-available water (CLL - LL 15; LL 15 is lower limit at - 1. 5 MPa) and <b>soil</b> <b>Cl</b> concentrations than ESP or ECse suggested {{that the presence of}} high <b>Cl</b> in these <b>soils</b> most likely inhibited the subsoil water extraction by the crops.

The objective {{of this study was to}} understand how BC application modifies soil nitrogen dynamics and moderate the effects of manure application in semi-arid agricultural systems on different textured soils: the loamy sand (LS) soil, the silty loam (SL) soil, and the clay loam (<b>CL)</b> <b>soil.</b> We found the positive interaction of BC and manure with BC suppressing CO 2 emissions in manure amended soils. BC increased nitrogen mineralization in manure-amended soils towards the end of the incubation period 28 days. No significant N immobilization was observed in unamended soils. BC and manure soil additions reduced N deficiencies in all three soils. A second study focused on measuring carbon dioxide emissions from biochar-amended alkaline semi-arid soil. The objective of this study was to test if acidified and non-acidified BC released the same amount of CO 2. The results showed that the soil samples amended with acidified BC released more CO 2 than those amended with untreated BC with high alkalinity. It is postulated that untreated BC could absorb CO 2; whereas, acidified BC with no alkalinity could not. The LS soil amended with BC released less CO 2 than LS soil control perhaps due to the soil microbial activity inhibitory effects of the BC’s residual water soluble polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Thus, the interaction with BC and steer manure application could suppress the release of CO 2...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Liming {{increases}} {{crop production}} through improved soil conditions in acidic soils. Among {{the effects of}} liming, increased availabilities of alkaline and alkaline-earth cations are worth mention. These availabilities may {{be affected by the}} particle size of applied limestone, which influences lime reactivity. The effects of particle size and application schedule of magnesium limestone were investigated on extractable Ca, Mg and K in soil, their concentrations in sward plants and dry-matter yield. Magnesium limestone of various particle sizes was applied to experimental plots at a rate of 3 t ha– 1, a grass-clover sward was sown, and the plots were monitored during three years. The finest limestone (< 0. 25 mm) in a single application yielded the highest soil Ca and Mg concentrations extracted by Mehlich- 3 and NH 4 Cl. The same limestone split in three annual doses was less effective. Plots treated with the coarsest limestone (2 - 4 mm) did not differ from control plots. Liming had no effect on potassium, either in soil or plants. Soil concentrations of Ca, Mg and K extracted by Mehlich- 3 and NH 4 Cl were correlated with each other (r = 0. 76, 0. 75 and 0. 67, respectively). NH 4 Cl extracted more Ca than Mehlich- 3, while the latter extracted more Mg and K than NH 4 <b>Cl.</b> <b>Soil</b> Ca, Mg and K extracted by NH 4 Cl were also correlated to water extractions.

Italica (Broccoli), and B. oleracea var. Gemmifera (Brussels sprouts) plants, {{as well as on the}} physical and chemical properties of the clay loam (<b>CL)</b> <b>soil,</b> and its inorganic composition, in order to examine the possibility of TMWW reuse for the irrigation of the above vegetables. The transplanting was done on December 2005, and harvesting of the heads and sprouts 16 weeks later, i. e. at the end of April. Ordinary irrigation water, TMWW, soil, and plant samples, were analyzed, and the data obtained were statistically processed. The following were found: applied TMWW increased significantly, in comparison to control, the content of some macro- and micro-elements in the soil, but the concentrations of most of them were generally within the accepted critical levels, except for P and Zn and Cd whose concentration varied as follows: in Brocoli soil P 18. 36 - 41. 16 mg/kg, Zn 3. 61 - 4. 64 mg/kg, and Cd 0. 065 - 1. 20 mg/kg, while in Brussels sprouts soil P 20. 6 - 36. 32 mg/kg, Zn 2. 87 - 4. 83 mg/kg and Cd 0. 06 - 1. 45 mg/kg. These results showed that TMWW had a residual effect with respect to these elements. Similarly, the TMWW increased significantly the heavy metal content in the dry matter of the roots as follows: in Brussel sprouts Cd varied from 0. 0083 to 0. 78, Co 0. 029 to 3. 38 and Ni from 4. 83 to 7. 27  [mu]g/g, respectively, and in Broccoli Ni varied from 4. 20 to 10. 13  [mu]g/g. TMWW also increased the accumulation of Fe in the roots of Broccoli from 379. 5 to 1022. 0 mg/kg. However, the levels of the heavy metals in the edible plant parts (heads and sprouts) were very high, varying as follows: in Broccoli Ni 3. 91 - 4. 15  [mu]g/g, and Pb 9. 82 - 10. 40  [mu]g/g, while in Brussels sprouts Cd 0. 8 - 1. 17  [mu]g/g, Co 2. 35 - 2. 70  [mu]g/g, and Ni 5. 70 - 6. 17  [mu]g/g. These increased heavy metal contents in the edible plant parts, and the heavy FC and E. coli load of the TMWW, constitute a high health risk factor, and therefore the TMWW studied, cannot be used at the present time for the irrigation of these vegetables, unless it is subjected in the future, to a secondary or advanced primary treatment (APT). ...|$|E

However, previous experiments did not distinguish between the effect of Cl on biosolid-borne Cd compared with soil-borne Cd inherited from previous fertilizer history. A factorial pot experiment was conducted with biosolid application rates of 0, 20, 40, and 80 g biosolids kg– 1 and <b>Cl</b> concentration in <b>soil</b> solution ranging from 1 to 160 mM Cl. The Cd uptake of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Halberd) was measured and major cations and anions in soil solution were determined. Cadmium speciation in soil solution was calculated using GEOCHEM-PC. The Cd concentration in plant shoots and soil solution increased with biosolid application rates up to 40 g kg– 1, but decreased slightly in the 80 g kg– 1 biosolid treatment. Across biosolid application rates, the Cd concentration in soil solution and plant shoots was positively correlated with the <b>Cl</b> concentration in <b>soil</b> solution. This suggests that biosolid-borne Cd is also mobilized by chloride ligands in soil solution. The soil solution CdCl+ activity correlated best with the Cd uptake of plants, although little of the variation in plant Cd concentrations was explained by activity of CdCl+ in higher sludge treatments. It was concluded that chloro-complexation of Cd increased the phytoavailability of biosolid-borne Cd to a similar degree as soil (fertilizer) Cd. There was a nonlinear increase in plant uptake and solubility of Cd in biosolid-amended soils, with highest plant Cd found at the 40 g kg– 1 rate of biosolid application, and higher rates (80 g kg– 1) producing lower plant Cd uptake and lower Cd solubility in soil. This is postulated to be a result of Cd retention by CaCO 3 formed {{as a result of the}} high alkalinity induced by biosolid application. Karin Weggler, Michael J. McLaughlin and Robin D.

40|$|Sub-surface soil {{pollution}} by various processes with {{high concentration of}} contaminants can significantly alter geotechnical properties of soils causing unexpected failures of structures founded on them. The changes can occur due to alteration in soil water interaction processes and/or by intense chemical interactions leading to mineralogical and microstructural changes. Behaviour of soil upon contamination with alkali pollutant {{is one of the}} major concerns faced by the geotechnical researchers in recent years. In the present study an attempt has been made to understand the role of mineralogical and morphological changes on the volume change (swelling and compressibility) behaviour of soils by prolonged interaction with caustic alkali pollutant. Based on the results it has been proposed to develop remedial measures to nullify and/or control the detrimental effects. A comprehensive experimental program has been planned to achieve these objectives. The experimental investigations carried out and results obtained are presented in eight chapters as follows. The broad outline of thesis is given in Chapter 1. A detailed review of literature on the type of phyllosilicate minerals present in various soils is presented in Chapter 2 with a view to select most common soils for the study. Various sources of contaminants and their effect on the properties of soils have been summarised. Present understanding on the mechanisms leading to changes in the soil properties has been elucidated. The occurrence of alkali contamination has been reviewed in this chapter which enabled to select the ranges of alkali concentration for the study. Based on the review of various methods employed to improve the soil behaviour, the use of salt solutions such as potassium chloride (KCl) and magnesium chloride (MgClB 2 B) and pozzolanic fly ash has been considered to counteract the alkali effects. Based on this detailed survey, the scope of the present investigation has been elaborated at the end of the chapter. Chapter 3 presents different materials used and various methods adapted in the current study. Three soils having different mineralogy have been used in this study to bring out the effect of alkali solutions on their volume change behaviour. While two soils were classified as CH, the third one was of CL. The CH soils used in this study are called Black Cotton Soils in India. One soil contained predominantly mixed layer illite-smectite mineral (BCS I) and the other contained predominantly montmorillonite mineral (BCS M). The locally available <b>CL</b> <b>soil</b> used is referred as red earth (RE) whose predominant mineral is kaolinite. Alkali solutions of concentration ranging from 1 N to 4 N are prepared using sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH). Slat solutions viz. potassium chloride and magnesium chloride and pozzolanic fly ash obtained from Neyveli thermal power plant (NFA) are used as additives. Procedures to determine the geotechnical properties of the soils such as Atterberg limits, specific gravity, grain size distribution and compaction characteristics are given in this chapter. Procedures for identifying the mineral and microstructure of the soils such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are also presented in this chapter. Standard oedometer tests with fixed ring apparatus were performed to study the volume change behaviour of soils under various conditions. Volume change behaviour of soils in the presence of alkali solutions is presented in Chapter 4. In order to assess the effect of alkali solution on the volume change behaviour of soils it is necessary to study their behaviour in water. Relatively very high swell was observed in BCS M, whereas the swell in RE and BCS I soil specimens was very low and moderate respectively. Adsorption of water to form diffuse double layer near the negative surface of clay mineral particles leads to swelling in soils. The thickness of the double layer depends on the cation exchange capacity of soil. Higher cation exchange capacity leads to development of higher thickness of double layer thereby inducing swell. The higher is the swell the higher would be the compression. The effect of different concentrations (1 N, 2 N and 4 N) of alkali solutions on volume change behaviour of three types of soil is presented in this chapter. All the three soils studied, irrespective of their mineralogical composition, exhibited high swell when contaminated with alkali solution compared to water. However, the extent and nature of swell varied both with the type of mineral present in the soil and concentration of sodium hydroxide solution. The swell in BCS I increases with increase in the concentration of the alkali solution. In 1 N alkali solution the high swell occurred is due to the breaking up of interstratified mineral into constituent minerals initiated by the leaching of potassium from soil due to high pH. In 2 N and 4 N alkali solutions, the observed high swell occurs in two stages: the first stage of swelling is due to breaking up of interstratified mineral into constituent minerals initiated by the leaching of potassium from soil due to high pH, and the second stage of swelling is due to the formation of new minerals (Zeolite P in case of 2 N NaOH and Sodalite in case of 4 N NaOH). The nature of swell is influenced by the formation of minerals depending on the concentration of alkali solution. Thus the studies clearly indicate that the swelling is due to the release of potassium from soil at higher pH and due to mineralogical changes depending upon the concentration of alkali solution. Confirmative tests were conducted to support the release of potassium during first stage of swelling and mineralogical alteration after second stage of swelling. The high swell in BCS M becomes higher in 1 N alkali solution. The increased swell in the soil with 1 N alkali solution is due to increase in the ion exchange capacity of soil at higher pH. The swell which is very high with 1 N alkali solution decreases with 2 N alkali solution. With increase in concentration of alkali solution to 2 N, the increase in the negative charges due to alkalinity becomes less and the swell decreases due to dominant influence of electrolyte effect. With increase in the concentration of alkali solution to 4 N, both these influences become less and the amount of swell remains the same. Significant increase in the amount of swell is observed with alkali solution even in non-swelling red earth. The nature of swell as well as the formation of minerals is not altered by the change in the concentration of alkali solution. At any concentrations of alkali solution the observed swell is noticed in two stages – very small first stage of swell due to lower ion exchange capacity and considerable second stage of swell due to the formation of new mineral (Sodalite) with any concentration of alkali solution. It has been observed that the normal hyperbolic swell – compression relationship does not apply for the alkali contaminated soils. The higher swell does not result in higher compression, as the swollen soil remains fairly incompressible. Analysis of the results and detailed studies on micro-structure and mineralogy of soils bring out mechanism of alkali effects. Comparing the swell behaviour of soils with alkali solutions brings out the relative importance of various mechanisms proposed for induced heave. The effect of salt solutions used viz., potassium chloride and magnesium chloride to restrict the influence of alkali solution on the volume change behaviour of BCS I is presented in Chapter 5. These salts react with alkali solution to form partly soluble potassium hydroxide (KOH) and sparingly soluble magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) B 2 B) respectively. Presence of ionic potassium can bring out potassium linkages, by bridging potassium ion between the unit layers of expansive minerals reducing the swell. Magnesium ions can restrict swell, by replacing the monovalent exchangeable ions present in soil and/or by formation of magnesium hydroxide which is a weak cementing agent. The effect of potassium hydroxide on the volume change behaviour of soil has been studied and the results clearly indicate that fixation of potassium is facilitated by high pH of KOH solution. Addition of potassium chloride has partially controlled the alkali induced heave in soil. Of the two stages of swelling observed in soil in the presence of 4 N alkali solution, only the first phase of swelling is reduced which may be due to electrolyte effect and/or due to fixation of potassium. The second phase of swelling that occurs in soil due to mineralogical changes can not be controlled with the use of potassium chloride. Addition of magnesium chloride salt solution also reduced the effect of alkali solution mostly due to suppression of thickness of diffuse double layer that develops near clay surface. The nature of reduction in the swell of alkali solution during the two stages by magnesium chloride is similar to that of potassium chloride. The partial reduction in swell of soil in the presence of salt solutions leads to reduction in the compressibility of soil. Detailed data and analysis, presented in this chapter, bring out the role of microstructure and mineralogy on soil behaviour. The abnormal volume changes due to mineralogical changes affected by high concentration of sodium hydroxide could not be controlled with salt solutions, attempts are made to utilize fly ash to control the alkali induced heave. The pozzolanic compounds produced by hydration of compounds presented and/or produced by lime silica reactions can bind the soil particles controlling the swelling. The results on the effectiveness of fly ash on BCS I soil are presented in Chapter 6. The physical and chemical properties of fly ash along with the mineralogical composition and the microstructure of the fly ash are also presented in this chapter. Before studying the effect of fly ash to control the volume change behaviour of soils in presence of alkali solutions, the effect of alkali solutions on the volume change behaviour of fly ash itself has been studied. The results showed no noticeable changes in swell and compressibility of fly ash, encouraging its use for controlling the alkali induced swell. The ability of different percentages (10 %, 20 % and 50 %) of fly ash to control alkali induced volume changes in soil with varying concentrations of alkali solutions, viz., 1 N, 2 N and 4 N has been studied. The results indicate that the addition of fly ash effectively reduces alkali induced swell in BCS I. The effectiveness of fly ash increases with increase in its content. The reduction in swelling of soil is partially due to replacement of soil with fly ash and mainly due to cementation of soil particles by pozzolanic compounds produced. More than 25 % of fly ash is generally required to significantly reduce the swell in alkali solutions. The reduction in swell with addition of fly ash also leads to lower compressibility of soil. The role of microstructure and mineralogy in controlling the volume change behaviour are also presented in this chapter. The effectiveness of fly ash in controlling the volume changes in RE and BCS M due to alkali solutions are studied in Chapter 7. The addition of fly ash completely eliminates the swelling in both the soils. The reduction in swelling up on addition of fly ash is essentially due to efficient binding of particles by pozzolanic reaction compounds. Addition of even 10 % of fly ash is sufficient in completely arresting the swelling of RE and BCS M by alkali solution. Detailed data and analysis of the results to bring out the role of microstructure and mineralogy on the behaviour of soils are presented. It is clear that relatively higher amounts of fly ash is required to control the alkali induced heave in BCS I than in other soils at higher concentrations of alkali solution. The major conclusions from the study are presented in Chapter 8. The thesis demonstrates that alkali contamination alters mineralogy and morphology of soils affecting the volume change behaviour significantly. The study also brings out that fly ash can control the undesirable swell that occurs in most types of soils by cementing the soil particles to resist swelling. Though the amount of fly ash required to control the alkali induced heave varies, 25 % of fly ash is often sufficient...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} soil texture and soil water content on decomposition of organic carbon (OC), turnover of partially stabilized 14 C-labelled ryegrass residues was studied at four matric potentials in twelve differently textured soils of similar origin and cropping history. Six soils were from a naturally occurring clay gradient and had 11, 16, 21, 31, 37 and 45 % clay (termed NA 1 to NA 6). Three clay-amended <b>soils</b> (<b>CL</b> 2, CL 4, CL 6) and three silt-amended soils (SI 2, SI 4, SI 6) were prepared by adding clay or silt sized organomineral complexes extracted from the NA 2 soil to {{a portion of the}} NA 1 soil. After 14 C-labelled ryegrass had decomposed for eight months under field-like conditions, soil cores were sampled, adjusted to four matric potentials (- 30, - 100, - 500 and - 1500 hPa) and incubated at 20 °C for 15 weeks. The content of native soil organic carbon (SOC) in the NA soils was not related to texture. The SOC content increased with clay and silt in the <b>CL</b> and SI <b>soils</b> because of OC contained in the applied size separates. The relative CO 2 -evolution from <b>CL</b> and SI <b>soils</b> was lower than from the texturally corresponding NA soils, indicating a slower turnover of C supplied with the clay separate than of bulk OC. Differences in the decomposability of native SOC and residues of 14 C-ryegrass were better explained by soil moisture parameters than by soil textural composition. Within each set of soils, evolution of CO 2 from native SOC was highly correlated with the volumetric water content. The same was true for 14 CO 2 -evolution, but correlations were significantly improved when 14 CO 2 was related to water retained in soil pores with diameters > 0. 2 m. This indicated that the water available for the turnover of residues from ryegrass and of native SOC was retained in different fractions of the pore volume. Our study suggested that water was the main factor in controlling turnover of SOC. Texture effects were indirect and expressed through soil structure which in turn defined the soil pore system and thus the ability of the soils to retain water of different availability to the decomposer organisms...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Soil {{friability}} {{is defined}} as the tendency of a mass of unconfined intact soil in bulk to crumble and break up under applied stress into similar fragments, aggregates and individual soil particles with specific size range. Tensile strength is a term which defined as the stress, or force per unit area, required to cause soil to fail in tension. The stated parameters are almost considered as the key physical properties of agricultural soils, because the friable condition is a desirable feature for establishing adequate seedbeds during tillage practice. In spite of the relevance of the subject, information on the effects of intrinsic soil properties on the tensile strength and friability is limited in Iran. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify and to relate tensile strength and friability of two texturally different soils of clay loam and sandy loam under two different cropping systems of wheat and alfalfa. Materials and methods: The soil samples were collected from the 0 – 30 cm horizon of two sites of sandy loam (SL) and clay loam (<b>CL)</b> <b>soils</b> which were located inHamadan province in western Iran. Each soil had been under cultivation of either wheat (conventionally tilled) or alfalfa for 11 years. At the laboratory, the soils were gently dry-sieved to separate 8 - 10, 15 - 25 and 30 - 38 mm fractions. The tensile strength was calculated as suggested by Dexter and Kroesbergen, (1985) and the soil friability was calculated through the coefficient of variation method as proposed by Watts and Dexter (1998). The experiment was carried out at the air-dry water content and soil matric suctions of 80 and 50 kPa for three ranges of aggregate size (8 - 10 mm, 15 - 25 mm and 30 - 38 mm). Then the impacts of soil texture (clay loam and sandy loam) and cultivation types (alfalfa and wheat) were assessed in a factorial design at each water content. Regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the relationship between soil intrinsic properties (clay content and organic matter) and tensile strength and friability. Results and discussion: The considered factors in this study i. e. soil texture and cultivation, in different water content and aggregate size, have a pronounced influence on the tensile strength and friability. The soil of clay loam-alfalfa displayed a higher increase in tensile strength than clay loam-wheat (21...|$|R

A 16 -week glasshouse study com pared AMF from a 30 -year reclaimed mine soil (WL) with AMF from native Ohio tallgrass prairie <b>soil</b> (<b>CL).</b> Four native grasses were examined from seedling through 16 weeks of growth. Comparisons were made between CL and WL AMF on colonized (+AMF) and non-colonized plants (–AMF) at three levels of soil phosphorus (P). Leaves were counted at 4 week intervals. Shoot and root biomass and percent AMF root colonization were measured at termination. We found no difference between WL and <b>CL</b> AMF. Added <b>soil</b> P did not reduce AMF colonization, but did reduce AMF efficacy. Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans (L.)

Transient <b>soil</b> <b>Cl</b> mass-balance (CMB) was used for crop and pasture sites, as it is suitable for determining the long-term, low rates of drainage since clearing some 40 - 50 years ago. Steady-state CMB was used for native vegetation. Large masses of salts and Cl were stored under native vegetation (31 - 103 t/ha of Cl to 3. 2 m), and deep drainage was low (0. 10 - 0. 27 mm/year). The Cl profiles were generally of a normal shape for matrix flow (e. g. no bypass flow). <b>Soil</b> <b>Cl</b> was lost under cropping (average 65 % lost to 1. 4 m) and pasture (32 %) compared with native vegetation.

Deep drainage averaged 10 mm/year under cropping for both gilgai mounds and depressions (range 2. 7 - 25 mm/year), and 3. 3 and 5. 1 mm/year under pasture for mounds and depressions, respectively. Subsoil (depth 1. 5 - 4 +m) was generally dry under native vegetation and wetter under cropping and pasture.

A 90 Sr plume was evidenced downgradient of one of these trenches, trench T 22. Due to its conservative properties, 36 Cl is investigated here as a potential tracer to determine the maximal extent of the contamination plume from the trench in groundwater. 36 Cl/Cl ratios measured in groundwater, trench soil water and leaf leachates are 1 e 5 orders of magnitude higher than the theoretical natural 36 Cl/Cl ratio. This contamination occurred after the Chernobyl explosion and currently persists. Trench T 22 acts as an obvious modern point source of 36 Cl, however other sources have to be involved to explain such contamination. 36 Cl contamination of groundwater can be explained by dilution of trench soil water by uncontaminated water (rainwater or deep groundwater).

Plant morphology, growth, leaf conductance (<b>cL),</b> and <b>soil</b> oxygen diffusion rate (ODR) were monitored. Differential waterlogging tolerance of major fruit tree rootstocks tested from high to low was as follows: Pyrus betulaefolia > Pyrus calleryana = Cydonia oblonga cv.

Grafting 'Bartlett' scions on the 4 major pear rootstocks listed above did affect plant performance in terms of growth and cL but did not alter overall survivability. Stomatal closure for each species {{was associated with a}} specific ODR. Limitations of cL as a screening tool are discussed in the thesis. Solution culture experiments conducted in the greenhouse revealed that anaerobic-induced stomatal closure was not a function of reduced leaf water potential but was related to a reduction in root hydraulic conductivity (Lp).
