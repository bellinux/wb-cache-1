40|$|Injuries can {{counter the}} {{beneficial}} effects of sports participation {{at a young}} age if a child or adolescent is unable to continue to participate because of residual effects of injury. Independent of activity level, injuries represent a considerable problem for the athlete and can result in an increased potential for future disability and inactivity. Injuries are also referred to as one of the major reasons for athletes to drop out of sports. Systematic injury registrations at the youth and adolescent level have been performed in recreational sports to gain knowledge <b>on</b> <b>injury</b> risk, {{as well as on the}} most common and most severe sport specific <b>injuries.</b> However, information <b>on</b> <b>injury</b> risk of the young athlete competing in high level sports seems less available or unknown. This paper reviews the current knowledge <b>on</b> <b>injury</b> risk of the youth and adolescent elite athlete participating in sports presented in the Youth Olympic Games 2010. Apart from football, little is known <b>on</b> <b>injury</b> epidemiology among young elite athletes. Systematic injury surveillance of this highly competitive population is needed to monitor injuries, identify high risk sports, and ensure new knowledge <b>on</b> <b>injury</b> trends, which can form the basis for further research <b>on</b> <b>injury</b> risk factors, mechanisms, and in the final step, <b>on</b> <b>injury</b> prevention...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} OSHA inspections <b>on</b> <b>injuries</b> in manufacturing plants. The authors use the same model {{and some of the}} same plant-level data employed by several earlier studies that found large effects of OSHA inspections <b>on</b> <b>injuries</b> for 1979 – 85. These new estimates indicate that an OSHA inspection imposing a penalty reduced lost-workday injuries by about 19 % in 1979 – 85, but that this effect fell to 11 % in 1987 – 91, and to a statistically insignificant 1 % in 1992 – 98. The authors cannot fully explain this overall decline, which they find for nearly all subgroups they examine—by inspection type, establishment size, and industry, for example. Among other findings are that, across the years studied, inspections with penalties were more effective than those without, and the effects <b>on</b> <b>injury</b> rates were greater in smaller plants and nonunion plants than in large plants and union plants...|$|R
