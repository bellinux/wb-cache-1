500|$|The order Anura (from the Ancient Greek a(n)- meaning [...] "without" [...] and oura meaning [...] "tail") {{comprises}} the frogs and toads. They usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them, shorter forelimbs, webbed toes with no claws, no tails, large eyes and glandular moist skin. Members of this order with smooth skins are {{commonly referred to}} as frogs, while those with [...] skins are known as toads. The difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule. Members of the family Bufonidae are known as the [...] "true toads".

500|$|Frogs {{range in}} size from the {{recently}} discovered [...] Paedophryne amauensis of Papua New Guinea to the [...] goliath frog (<b>Conraua</b> <b>goliath)</b> of Cameroon. The skin hangs loosely on the body {{because of the lack of}} loose connective tissue. Frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is transparent to protect the eyes underwater, and two vary from translucent to opaque. They have a tympanum on each side of their heads which is involved in hearing and, in some species, is covered by skin. True toads completely lack teeth, but most frogs have them, specifically pedicellate teeth in which the crown is separated from the root by fibrous tissue. These are on the edge of the upper jaw and vomerine teeth are also on the roof of their mouths. No teeth are in the lower jaw and frogs usually swallow their food whole. The teeth are mainly used to grip the prey and keep it in place till swallowed, a process assisted by retracting the eyes into the head. The African bullfrog (Pyxicephalus), which preys on relatively large animals such as mice and other frogs, has cone shaped bony projections called odontoid processes at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth.|$|E

50|$|This genus {{includes}} the largest frog of the world, <b>Conraua</b> <b>goliath,</b> which may grow to 32 cm in snout-vent length and weigh {{as much as}} 3.3 kg. Four of the six species in this genus are threatened.|$|E
50|$|Typically, true frogs are {{smooth and}} moist-skinned, with large, {{powerful}} legs and extensively webbed feet. The true frogs vary greatly in size, ranging from small - {{such as the}} wood frog (Lithobates sylvatica) - to the largest frog in the world, the goliath frog (<b>Conraua</b> <b>goliath).</b>|$|E
50|$|Monte Alén National Park {{is located}} {{near the center of}} Equatorial Guinea. It was {{established}} in 1990. With an area of 2000 km2, it is the country's largest national park. The goliath frog (<b>Conraua</b> <b>goliath),</b> one of the prominent amphibians found in the park, is the biggest frog in the world; hunting it is prohibited.|$|E
50|$|The {{goliath frog}} or giant {{slippery}} frog (<b>Conraua</b> <b>goliath)</b> {{is the largest}} living frog on Earth. Specimens can grow up to 32 cm (12.6 in) in length from snout to vent, and weigh up to 3.25 kg (7.17 lb). This species has a relatively small habitat range in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. Its numbers are dwindling due to habitat destruction and its collection for food and the pet trade.|$|E
50|$|Conraua derooi {{are large}} frogs (though {{much smaller than}} their relative, the goliath frog <b>Conraua</b> <b>goliath),</b> with males {{measuring}} 76 - 84 mm and females about 74 - 82 mm in snout-vent length. The head is relatively large with prominent eyes and a fairly small snout. The tympanum is not visible externally. The hindlimbs are very long and robust. The toes are long and have distinct adhesive discs and webbing extending midway to the discs. The forelimbs are short but muscular with webbed fingers.|$|E
50|$|The {{smallest}} amphibian (and vertebrate) in {{the world}} is a microhylid frog from New Guinea (Paedophryne amauensis) first discovered in 2012. It has an average length of 7.7 mm and is part of a genus that contains four of the world's ten smallest frog species. The largest living amphibian is the 1.8 m Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed—the extinct 9 m Prionosuchus, a crocodile-like temnospondyl dating to 270 million years ago from the middle Permian of Brazil! The largest frog is the African Goliath frog (<b>Conraua</b> <b>goliath),</b> which can reach 32 cm and weigh 3 kg.|$|E
50|$|Frogs are {{regionally}} significant prey for small, young crocodiles in many regions, mainly {{those in}} the 0.5 to 1.5 m size range. The main amphibian prey species from Uganda and Zambia was the African common toad (Amietophrynus regularis) while in Botswana the main amphibian prey was the reed frog (Hyperolius viridiflavus). Even the largest frog in the world, the goliath frog (<b>Conraua</b> <b>goliath),</b> has reportedly been preyed on by young Nile crocodiles. In general, reptiles become relatively common only in the diet in larger juvenile specimens and subadults. Large reptiles, or armoured reptiles such as turtles were almost negligible in crocodiles under 2.5 m and most common in the stomachs of crocodiles over 3.5 m in length from Uganda and Zambia. Small species of reptiles are largely ignored as prey at this size. Freshwater turtles are often the most frequently recorded reptilian prey, unsurprisingly perhaps because most other reptiles other than a small handful of Lycodonomorphus water snakes are more terrestrial than water-based.|$|E

50|$|The largest {{member of}} the largest order of {{amphibians}} is the African Goliath frog (<b>Conraua</b> <b>goliath).</b> The maximum size this species is verified to attain is a weight of 3.8 kg and a snout-to-vent length of 39 cm. The largest of the toads, the cane toad (Rhinella marina), is also the second largest {{member of the}} frog order. This infamous, often invasive species can grow to maximum mass of 2.65 kg and measure a maximum of 33 cm from snout-to-vent. Rivaling the previous two species, the African bullfrog (Pyxicephalus adspersus) can range up to a weight of 2 kg and 25.5 cm from snout to vent. Another large frog is the largest frog in North America, the American bullfrog, which can reach weights of up to 0.8 kg and snout-to-vent-length (SVL) of 20 cm. However, the toad Beelzebufo ampinga, found in fossil from the Cretaceous era {{in what is now}} Madagascar, could grow to be 41 cm long and weigh up to 4.5 kg, making it the largest frog ever known. The largest tree frog is the Australasian white-lipped tree frog (Litoria infrafrenata), the females of which can reach a length of 14 cm from snout to vent and can weigh up to 115 g. The family Leptodactylidae, one of the most diverse anuran families, also has some very large members. The largest is the Surinam horned frog (Ceratophrys cornuta), which can reach 20 cm in length from snout to vent and weigh up to 0.48 kg. While not quite as large as Ceratophrys cornuta, Leptodactylus pentadactylus is often heavier; it can reach 18.5 cm long and weigh 0.60 kg. The largest dendrobatid is the Colombian golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), which can attain a length of 6 cm and nearly 28.3 g. Most frogs are classified under the suborder Neobatrachia, although nearly 200 species are part of the Mesobatrachia suborder, or ancient frogs. The largest of these are the little-known Brachytarsophrys or Karin Hills frogs, of South Asia, which can grow to a maximum snout-to-vent length of 17 cm and a maximum weight of 0.54 kg.|$|E
40|$|<b>Conraua</b> <b>goliath</b> is {{confined}} to the rain forest belt of Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. The total area occupied is only about 1 50 miles (240 kilometers> long and 60 miles (96 kilometers) wide. It occurs at an elevation of 300 - 2200 feet (100 - 700 meters). Within the forests it {{is limited to the}} vicinity of the larger swift-flowing rivers, especially near waterfalls and rapids (Lamotte et al., 1 959, Perret; 1 957; Sabater-Pi, 1 985).

40|$|AbstractThe {{gastro-intestinal}} helminth parasites of {{goliath frog}} (<b>Conraua</b> <b>goliath)</b> from the Littoral Region of Cameroon in the Localities of Loum, Yabassi and Nkondjock were surveyed. Out of the 30 goliath frogs examined (13 males and 17 females) between April and May 2013, 26 (85 %) contained {{at least one}} helminth parasite and yielded a total of nine hundred and seventy three (973) helminths comprising: Nematodes (90. 5 %), Trematodes (9. 4 %) and Pentastomids (0. 1 %). Nematodes included: Africana taylori (60 %), Oswaldocruzia perreti (0. 2 %), Aplectana sp. (21 %), Gendria sp. (7. 1 %), Amphibiophilus sp. (0. 2 %), Strongyluris sp. (0. 1 %), Physalopteroides sp. (1. 6 %), and Oxyuridae gen. sp. (0. 3 %). Trematodes comprised: Mesocoelium sp. (7. 3 %) and Diplodiscus subclavatus (2. 1 %). Pentastomids were represented by Sebekia sp. (0. 1 %). The mean species richness and diversity were 1. 97 ± 2. 12 and 0. 41 ± 0. 04 respectively. The intensity of parasite infection was correlated with host body weight, positively for Africana taylori, Aplectana sp., Diplodiscus subclavatus, and Mesocoeliumsp. Infection rates were influenced by land-use pattern. Thus higher prevalences were observed in Loum (intensive agricultural area) ...|$|E
