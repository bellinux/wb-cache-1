This may indicate that these carbenes are less aromatic than imidazol-2-ylidenes, as the imidazolium precursors do not react with nucleophiles due to the resultant loss of aromaticity.|$|E

25|$|Some atomic nuclei {{possess a}} {{magnetic}} moment (nuclear spin), which {{gives rise to}} different energy levels and resonance frequencies in a magnetic field. The total magnetic field experienced by a nucleus includes local magnetic fields induced by currents of electrons in the molecular orbitals (note that electrons have a magnetic moment themselves). The electron distribution of {{the same type of}} nucleus (e.g. 1H, 13C, 15N) usually varies according to the local geometry (binding partners, bond lengths, angles between bonds, and so on), and with it the local magnetic field at each nucleus.

The variations of nuclear magnetic resonance frequencies of the same kind of nucleus, due to variations in the electron distribution, is called the <b>chemical</b> <b>shift.</b> The size of the <b>chemical</b> <b>shift</b> is given with respect to a reference frequency or reference sample (see also <b>chemical</b> <b>shift</b> referencing), usually a molecule with a barely distorted electron distribution.|$|E

In this work, we report simultaneous measurements of ¹⁵N and ¹H <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts</b> and N–H bond lengths by solid-state NMR in ¹⁵N-labeled 1, 8 -bis(dimethylamino) naphthalene (DMAN), which contains a well-known strong NHN H-bond. We complexed DMAN with three different counteranions {{to examine the effects of}} the chemical environment on the H-bond lengths and <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts.</b> All three DMAN compounds exhibit significantly elongated N–H distances compared to the covalent bond length, and the ¹H[superscript N] <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts</b> are larger than ∼ 17 ppm, consistent with strong NHN H-bonds in the DMAN cation. However, the ¹⁵N and ¹H <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts</b> and the precise N–H distances differ among the three compounds, and the ¹⁵N <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts</b> show opposite dependences on the proton localization from the general trend in organic compounds, indicating the significant effects of the counteranions on the electronic structure of the H-bond. These data provide useful NMR benchmarks for strong H-bonds and caution against the sole reliance on <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts</b> for identifying strong H-bonds in proteins since neighboring side chains can exert influences on <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts</b> similar to those of the bulky organic anions in DMAN.

40|$|A {{range of}} {{compounds}} forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds are studied {{by means of}} deuterium isotope effects, primarily on 13 C <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts</b> but also on i 9 F <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts.</b> Deuterium isotope effects on <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts</b> are shown to be useful descriptors of intramolecular hydrogen bonded systems, (and not only a parameter proportional to the <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts).</b> It is shown that deuterium isotope effects on 13 C <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts</b> can reveal weakening of an intramolecular hydrogen bond due to steric hindrance and strengthening due to steric compression. Two donors competing for one acceptor are shown to weaken the intramolecular hydrogen bond. Exchanging hydrogen for deuterium in an intramolecular hydrogen bond is seen to perturb the equilibrium. This is observed for both tautomeric and conformational equilibria. Solving structural problems like the conformations of the minor form of 3, 5 - diacetyltetrahydropyran- 2, 4, 6 -trione, and the dynamic of l-acetyl- 2 -hydroxy- 3 -&o- 6 - methoxybenzene is greatly helped by means of deuterium isotope effects on r 3 C <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts.</b> Deuterium isotope effects on i 3 C <b>chemical</b> <b>shifts</b> is {{shown to be a}} probe for tautomerism.
