40|$|In {{this article}} {{reference}} {{is made to}} a speech delivered by the Managing Director of CEMAT (the Italian national company for combined transport) illustrating the current outlook {{in the field of}} land intermodality in Eastern and Central Europe, as well as other issues connected to intermodal traffic relations between these countries and Western Europe. Particular attention is paid to the market for <b>Combined</b> <b>Road</b> <b>rail</b> <b>Transport,</b> both as accompanied and as non accompanied transport. These two sector are examined in an effort to detect the obstacles that are still preventing the expansion in Eastern and Central Europe of non accompanied transport techniques, now a minor phenomenon elsewhere. The analysis of the present outlook and the identification of current problems are followed by the initial steps that national governments and railway companies in these countries should make in order to upgrade transport to and from these areas. Lastly, reference is aimed to the action undertaken by national governments and transport companies of the three Western European countries having the largest share of intermodal connections with Eastern and Central Europe (Austria, Germany and Italy), particularly with reference to the Italian company CEMAT...|$|E
30|$|In general, {{primarily}} {{the port of}} Piraeus and the other main ports {{of the country are}} disadvantaged compared with other ports in the wider Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe in several points. These are essentially the lack of intermodal transport, particularly the use of containers. In most modern ports in the transport of containers allows the carriage to be <b>combined</b> with <b>road</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>transport,</b> greatly reducing the time and cost of loading and unloading. More specifically, the major disadvantages [3, 21, 22] relate to the failure to connect to the national <b>rail</b> network (combined <b>transport),</b> the poor management and limited cargo containers, the low availability storage containers at ports and in the region, the relatively limited number of positions of ships, the imbalance in the development of modern port operations and services and the absence of an organized policy of attracting new customers (strong dependence on a few activities and a limited group of customers).|$|R

40|$|The {{opportunity}} of switching from <b>road</b> to <b>rail</b> or {{to a combination}} of <b>road</b> and <b>rail</b> (intermodal) <b>transport</b> is being considered in many countries with the objective of risk reduction in the transport of dangerous goods. This work presents a quantitative approach based on risk analysis for comparing the hazards of <b>road,</b> <b>rail,</b> and intermodal <b>transport,</b> aimed at defining criteria for selecting the safest transport modality. When comparing <b>road</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>transport,</b> the risk mainly depends on the hazardous characteristics of the product. The size of the containers is generally larger for <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> than for <b>road</b> transport, and consequently the amount of product potentially released, giving rise to impact areas slightly or significantly larger for <b>rail</b> than for <b>road</b> <b>transport.</b> When comparing road and intermodal transport, route length plays the most significant role: the longer the distance, the safer the intermodal transport. ...|$|R
