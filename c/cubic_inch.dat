25|$|Pontiac's second {{generation}} V8 engines shared numerous similarities, allowing many parts to interchange from its advent in 1959 to its demise in 1979. Sizes ranged from 287 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> to 455 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch.</b> This similarity (except the 301 & 265) makes rebuilding these engines relatively easier. This feature {{also made it}} possible for Pontiac to invent the modern muscle car, by the relatively simple process of placing its second largest-displacement engine, the 389 cid, into its mid-size car, the Le Mans, creating the Pontiac LeMans GTO.|$|E
25|$|The 1948 Chief had a 74 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> engine, hand {{shift and}} foot clutch. While one {{handlebar}} grip controlled the throttle {{the other was}} a manual spark advance.|$|E

25|$|Pontiac engines {{were not}} {{available}} in Canada, however, but were replaced with Chevrolet engines of similar size and power, resulting in such interesting and unusual (at least to American car fans) models as the Beaumont SD-396 with a Chevrolet big-block 396 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> V8.|$|E
25|$|All Federal {{emissions}} and safety regulations {{were required to}} be in full effect for 1974 causing the demise {{of two of the}} three iterations of the big 455 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> engines after this year.

"Big block/small block" [...] - when {{speaking}} of Detroit's [...] "Big Three" [...] V-8 engines from the 1950s {{and up to}} the late 1990s, big blocks range customarily from just under 400 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches</b> of displacement and with larger bores and increased strokes of the crankshaft might approach 575 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches.</b> Small blocks have less room inside the engine block for such oversized crankshafts, connecting rods, and pistons, having initial unmodified sizes ranging from well under 300 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches</b> to a maximum of just over 425, with the most well-known size around 350-360 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches,</b> depending on manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|From 1967-1969, the Super Turbine 300 {{was also}} {{available}} on the sporty Pontiac Firebird with the overhead cam in-line six-cylinder (230 and 250 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches)</b> or small V8 engines (326 and 350 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches).</b>|$|R
25|$|The Plymouth Belvedere {{was also}} {{produced}} by Chrysler Australia. The first model, {{based on the}} 1953 US Plymouth, featured {{a high level of}} Australian content, with body panels pressed in Chrysler Australia's Keswick facility in South Australia and matched with a 217.8 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> (4107cc) side-valve six-cylinder engine, imported from Chrysler UK. It was produced as a four-door sedan and as a locally developed two-door coupe utility, along with similar Cranbrook and Savoy models, until it was replaced by the Chrysler Royal in 1957. The Belvedere was reintroduced to the Australian market in early 1958 when Chrysler Australia began assembling the current model Belvedere four-door hardtop which was imported from the US in knocked-down form. The 1959 model was equipped with a 318 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> V8 engine and push-button automatic transmission. Chrysler Australia replaced their Plymouth Belvedere, Dodge Custom Royal and De Soto Firesweep models with the Dodge Phoenix in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than the}} <b>cubic</b> <b>inch,</b> cubic foot and cubic yard, these units are {{differently}} sized from the {{units in the}} imperial system, although {{the names of the}} units are similar. Also, while the U.S. has separate systems for measuring the volumes of liquids and dry material, the imperial system has one set of units for both.|$|E
25|$|The {{single seat}} {{aircraft}} {{was made from}} ash and spruce wood coated with aluminum powder. It used forward mounted finlets to stabilize the aircraft. It was powered by the last six cylinder engine built by the Wright Brothers with a rubber band drive on the flywheel. The 406 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> engine ran at 1,400 to 1560rpm powering two counterrotating propellers via chains.|$|E
50|$|After {{a four-hour}} {{inspection}} of the Petty Enterprises race car, NASCAR determined the engine in Petty's car was over the limit in <b>cubic</b> <b>inches</b> as specified in the rule book. The Petty team was penalized 104 points and fined $35,000. for the rule violations involving the tires and engine.

Morton believed that the skulls of each race were so different that a wise creator from the beginning had created each race and positioned them in separate homelands to dwell in.|$|R
5000|$|The {{alternative}} approach was {{to design a}} new engine and increase the displacement from the existing 71 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches</b> to 110 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches,</b> or roughly a 50% increase. This resulted in the model 6-110, with 660 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches</b> total displacement, that produced a continuous rating of [...] at 1800 rpm. While the basic engine components (block, crankshaft, pistons, etc.) were all new, many of the additional components (injectors, governors, accessories, marine gears) were simply shared with the Series 71 engines. Since the 6-110 was designed from the outset for heavy-duty high-horsepower applications, it was never produced in a four-cylinder version (that would have displaced 440 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches,</b> {{very close to the}} 426 ci displaced by the 6-71).|$|R

The car is in running condition, and is the only Grand Sport which is original and unrestored.

25|$|In 1954, Buick reintroduced the Century {{using the}} same formula of mating the smaller, lighter Buick Special body to its largest and most {{powerful}} 322 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> V8 engine {{with the intent of}} giving Buick a performance vehicle. Included in the model lineup during this period was a station wagon model, a body style that had been unavailable during the Century's first production period of 1936 to 1942.|$|E
25|$|Power {{comes from}} {{overhead}} valve (two per cylinder), pushrod, naturally aspirated, carbureted 358 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> (5.86 L) V8 engines, producing anywhere from 850 to 875 horsepower. The minimum base weight (including driver and driver gear) for all cars is 2,780 pounds. Fuel cell capacity is 33 U.S. gallons. Current rules {{allow for the}} use of leaded gasoline, whereas all other classes must use unleaded gas. The use of Nitrous Oxide (or other similar compounds or systems), fuel additives, and/or fuel cooling, as well as supercharging or turbocharging is strictly prohibited in all classes. Automatic transmissions are prohibited, and manual transmissions must have no more than 5 forward speeds, and a functional reverse speed.|$|E
2500|$|The US Customary {{system of}} units makes use of set of dry units of {{capacity}} that have a similar set of names to those of liquid capacity, though different volumes - the dry pint having a volume of 33.6 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches</b> (550ml) against the US fluid pint's volume of 28.875 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches</b> (473ml) and the imperial pint of 34.68 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches</b> (568ml).

It had a fuel capacity of 60 US gallons (230l), a range of 125miles (201km), and a speed of 42miles per hour (68km/h). It had constant mesh transmission, 6.5â€“13.5mm (0.26â€“0.53in) of armor, one 0.5in (12.7mm) M2 machine gun and two 0.3in (7.6mm) M1919 machine guns, and crew of three with up to ten passengers.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, the {{engineers}} at Lycoming Engines {{became aware that}} the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) wanted a high performance engine that could produce at least one horsepower per <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> (46kW/L) of engine displacement and that a contract had been made with Continental Motors, Inc., Lycoming's main rival in the general aviation engine market. Lycoming's management wanted {{to be considered for}} development of the next generation engine, but no USAAC development contract was signed. Still determined to become known as a high performance engine manufacturer, Lycoming began an experimental, high-performance engine of its own. After spending US $500,000, and after many attempts to develop a successful engine, it finally came close to the USAAC specifications with the 1,200hp (895kW) O-1230 engine.|$|E
