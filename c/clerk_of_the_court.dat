5|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} alleged witches' coven in English legal history {{took place in}} Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612. Eight of those {{attending}} were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court,</b> Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, Hinde {{got a job}} {{as deputy}} clerk for the Kentucky Court of Appeals. William Kavanaugh, the husband of Hinde's older sister Hannah, {{assigned}} him to Achilles Sneed of Frankfort. He received a good legal education with Sneed, who was <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeals. During this time, Hinde became acquainted with many of the state's leading men, and acquired a knowledge of the law. He also developed {{a reputation as one of}} Kentucky's most efficient businessmen. Hinde wrote to Henry Clay that he was the first lawyer whom Hinde heard address a court. Hinde resided in a boarding house, shared with many of the leading judges and politicians of the day, where he strengthened his personal and political contacts.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln did {{not stay}} long, and soon {{returned}} to Northampton, where {{he passed the}} bar. He established a practice in Worcester in 1775, where his business flourished {{because most of the}} Worcester lawyers had been Loyalist and had fled to Boston. From 1775 to 1781, he served as <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> and probate judge of Worcester County, and served the town of Worcester in a variety of posts into the 1790s. He was elected in 1779 to the state convention that drafted the state constitution. During these years, Lincoln rose in prominence {{to become one of the}} largest landowners in Worcester. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} in the down-ballot races. Democratic city commissioners Maurice S. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry were reelected as was Republican Walter I. Davidson. William M. Lennox was reelected county sheriff and Joseph A. Scanlon was reelected <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> of quarter sessions (a court whose jurisdiction is now exercised by the court of common pleas). The Democrats also took four of the seven magisterial district judge positions up for election that year (a local court, the duties of which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court). The ballot contained two referendums authorizing the city to take loans for construction of medical facilities, streets, sewers, playgrounds, and other civic improvements. They passed with overwhelming support, each tallying 84% affirmative votes.|$|E
5|$|Colton, the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> and {{preparer}} of the writs {{and process}} of the court, had set the first session of county court {{to be held at}} his home, in Coltonville. In his attempt to make Coltonville the county seat, Colton decided to hold a new election for the status. Colton made sure that Coltonville would win the election by telling only the population of Coltonville about it. His political tactics were eventually cancelled by an act of the Illinois General Assembly, after the DeKalb County court intervened. When court convened the sheriff served a court order declaring a courthouse be built in Sycamore. Afterward, Coltonville eventually suffered the same fate as Brush Point and disappeared from the map. These events seemingly settled the issue of where the courthouse and, in turn, the DeKalb County seat was going to be located.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Collins won the Democratic {{nomination}} for Clerk of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in a five-way primary. In the general election, she defeated Republican Joseph E. Lambert {{by a vote}} of 382,528 to 233,442. During her term, an amendment to the state constitution changed the name of the Court of Appeals to the Kentucky Supreme Court; Collins was the last person to hold the office of <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeals and the first to hold the office of Clerk of the Supreme Court. As Clerk, she compiled and distributed a brochure about the new role of the Supreme Court, and worked with the state department of education to create a teacher's manual for use in the public schools, detailing the changes effected in the court system {{as a result of the}} constitutional amendment. The Woodford County chapter of Business and Professional Women chose Collins as its 1976 Woman of Achievement, and in 1977, Governor Julian Carroll named her Kentucky Executive Director of the Friendship Force.|$|E

25|$|Discretionary appeals make up {{the bulk}} of the court's docket. A {{discretionary}} appeal begins when a petition for appeal is filed with the <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court.</b> Petitions are assigned to a law clerk or staff attorney for initial research, culminating in a memorandum summarizing the pertinent facts and evaluating the legal issues raised by the petition and any brief in opposition filed in response to the petition. If the law clerk, staff attorney, or brief in opposition identify any procedural defects in the petition, it is referred to a panel of two justices who may dismiss it with or without prejudice depending {{on the nature of the}} defect. (When a petition is dismissed without prejudice, the petitioner has an opportunity to correct the procedural error and file a new petition. When a petition is dismissed with prejudice, the appeal ends and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.) Otherwise, the case is then placed on the docket for consideration by a panel of three justices.|$|E

25|$|The Oath of Citizenship must be recited by all {{citizenship}} applicants in Canada {{in order}} to obtain citizenship, save for those under the age of 14 and, at the discretion of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, those who are prevented from understanding the significance of taking the oath due to mental disabilities. However, all must sign the oath, with parents signing on behalf of any of their children who are minors. These actions are carried out {{in the context of a}} citizenship ceremony, approximately 2,500 of which take place each year, and are functions normally presided over by a citizenship judge. Further, the governor general, a lieutenant governor, territorial commissioner, a member of the Order of Canada, a member of either the Order of Military Merit (with the rank of navy captain or colonel and above) or the Royal Victorian Order authorized by the Registrar of Canadian Citizenship, or holders of the Victoria Cross may preside at a ceremony if a citizenship judge is unavailable.

The Canadian flag must be displayed, along with other national symbols, including a portrait of the reigning monarch.|$|E
