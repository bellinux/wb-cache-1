40|$|Nowadays, many {{computer}} facilities are <b>constitued</b> by {{a network of}} general-purpose workstations. The aim {{of this paper is}} to show how to combine the available resources of this network in order to deal efficiently with time-consuming image processing algorithms. It is shown how to distribute the processes, by using a specialized library, namely PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine). An example is given : the LBG algorithm for codebooks optimization has been revisited in order to distribute efficiently the process. A major point has been to minimize the required communication bandwidth between the processors. Some adaptations are proposed in order to better synchronize processors with different speeds (load balancing). An implementation giving to the process robustness against failures is also described. 1 Introduction A lot of efforts have been devoted to the design of specialized computers for digital image processing [1] : such machines are generally <b>constitued</b> by massively parallel process [...] ...|$|E

As a result of the interaction of the both factors is the posibility of cracking or not cracking into a concret case, named generaly the susceptibility at the heat cracking.
