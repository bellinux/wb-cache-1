5|$|After {{being forced}} out of his Yildirim Army Group {{headquarters}} at Nazareth {{on the morning of}} 20 September, Liman von Sanders drove via Tiberias to Samakh to organise the establishment of a strong rearguard at Samakh. The 4th Light Horse Brigade was ordered to move to Beisan from Afulah at 08:30 on 24 September and was subsequently ordered at 13:45 to advance to capture Samakh. This town was strategically important to both sides as it controlled a direct road to Damascus. On 25 September, the 11th Light Horse Regiment supported by part of the 12th Light Horse Regiment <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> the pre-dawn while the German and Australian machine–gunners conducted a firefight. After an hour-long battle the light horse forced the garrison to surrender, capturing 350 prisoners at the station and in the town, suffering 14 killed and 29 wounded.|$|E

5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|Goebel {{challenged}} the vote returns in several counties. While the challenges were being adjudicated, Goebel {{was shot by}} an unknown assassin; Goebel was ultimately declared {{the winner of the}} election, but died of his wounds two days after being sworn into office. Among those <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> Goebel's murder was Governor Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Powers employed Brown as his legal counsel during his first trial, which ended in a conviction in July 1900. Brown died January 11, 1904, in Henderson and was buried at the Fernwood Cemetery in that city. He was the namesake of, but not related to, 20th century Kentucky Congressman John Y. Brown, Sr.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's {{abrasive}} personality {{made him}} many political enemies, but his championing of populist causes, like railroad regulation, also won him many friends. This conflict of opinions {{came to a}} head in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel, a Democrat, divided his party with self-serving political tactics at a time when Kentucky Republicans were finally gaining strength, having elected the party's first governor four years previously. These dynamics led to a close contest between Goebel and William S. Taylor. In the politically chaotic climate that resulted, Goebel was assassinated. Everyone <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> connection with the murder was either acquitted or eventually pardoned, and the identity of his assassin remains uncertain.|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} local <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> ten towns of the Czech Republic.

Analysis of rates and profits <b>in</b> {{individual}} <b>charges</b> and comparison within towns is also dealt with. In this comparison are used data from 2007. The work concludes with comparison of structure of profits from local <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> the whole Czech Republic. The significance of incomes from local <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> these ten towns is also analysed. The {{result of this}} search is that the share of local <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> the total incomes in individual towns is only on a low level...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to extensive publication {{on the behavior}} of space <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> polymeric insulation materials subject to individual dc or ac voltages, space <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> the situation of composite voltages has not yet been reported. In this paper, the dynamics of space <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> polyethylene subjected to combined ac and dc voltages have been experimentally investigated using the pulsed electroacoustic technique. Results show that combined voltages could significantly enhance the space charge accumulation. The dc component voltage determines the <b>charge</b> accumulation <b>in</b> the bulk of polyethylene while ac component influences the charge density on the electrodes. The amount of <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> the bulk depends on the ratio between ac and dc voltage components. This result is important to understand the electrical performance of high voltage equipment where insulation may experience the combined ac and dc voltages...|$|R
5|$|In the primary, Rhea {{achieved}} {{a plurality of}} the votes, but not a majority. Chandler had the next highest vote total, and the two faced {{each other in a}} run-off on September 7, 1935. In the run-off, Chandler defeated Rhea, securing the nomination for governor. President Roosevelt, not wanting Democratic factionalism to cost him votes in the 1936 presidential election, attempted to bring together the Laffoon and Chandler factions, but to little avail. Laffoon and Rhea, along with most of Laffoon's administration, bolted the party and supported Republican nominee King Swope. Despite losing the support of his predecessor, Chandler {{went on to win the}} general election. In his last days in office, Laffoon issued pardons for Denhardt and others <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> connection with the National Guard's interference with the primary in Harlan County. These were among a record 560 pardons issued by Laffoon, most of which were to relieve prison crowding.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Governor J. C. W. Beckham {{ascended to}} the office of governor, and he and Taylor waged a {{protracted}} court battle over the governorship. Beckham won the case on appeal, and Taylor fled to Indiana to escape prosecution as an accomplice in Goebel's murder. A total of sixteen people were <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> connection with the assassination. Five went to trial; two of those were acquitted. Each of the remaining three were convicted in trials fraught with irregularities and were eventually pardoned by subsequent governors. The identity of Goebel's assassin remains a mystery.|$|E
5|$|Mark Pennant, aged 15, {{was arrested}} on 9 October 1985 and charged with murder two days later, the first person <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> {{connection}} with the killing. Born in England to West Indian parents, Pennant had been raised in the West Indies until he was nine, after which {{he returned to the}} UK; he was diagnosed with learning difficulties and was attending a special school. He was arrested and handcuffed at school, taken to Wood Green Police Station, and interviewed six times over the course of two days with a teacher in attendance. He told the police that he had cut Blakelock and kicked him twice, and named Winston Silcott as the ringleader and several others, including another juvenile, Mark Lambie.|$|E
