40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{the physical}} characterization of three graft copolymers (PES/PAA) obtained from <b>chlorosulphonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (PECS) and three different secondary amino end-capped poly(amido-amine) s are reported. The properties of these heparinizable materials appear to be suitable for constructing prosthetic devices for biomedical use. The heparin adsorbing ability and {{the stability of the}} complex with heparin of the three copolymers have been evaluated, by means of biological tests, as activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) and Thrombin Time (TT) ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the curing}} and {{mechanical}} properties of two series of prepared blends, i. e., <b>chlorosulphonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (CSM) /isobutylene-co-isoprene (IIR) rubber blends and <b>chlorosulphonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (CSM) /chlorinated isobutylene-co-isoprene (CIIR) rubber blends were carried out. Blends were prepared using a two-roll mill at {{a temperature of}} 40 - 50 °C. The curing was assessed using a Monsanto oscillating disc rheometer R- 100. The process of vulcanization accelerated sulfur of pure rubbers and their blends {{was carried out in}} an electrically heated laboratory hydraulic press under a pressure of about 4 MPa and 160 °C. The stress-strain experiments were performed using a tensile tester machine (Zwick 1425). Results indicate that the scorch time, ts 2, and optimum cure time, tc 90, increase with increasing CSM content in both blends. The value of modulus at 100 and 300 % elongation and tensile strength increases with increasing CSM content, whereas elongation at break shows a decreasing trend. The enhancement in mechanical properties was supported by data of crosslink density in these samples obtained from swelling measurement and scanning electron microscopy studies of the rubber blends fractured surface...|$|E
40|$|Highly polar rubbers {{interact}} with each other through their active functional groups via condensation or substitution reactions at high temperature. <b>Chlorosulphonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (CSM) rubber is a highly reactive rubber, the reactivity of with is due to the -SO 2 CI groups. When CSM reacts with nit rile rubber (NBR), a chemical reaction takes place between the two rubbers at high temperature. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies support that CSM/NBR (50 / 50 w/w) isothermally induces a self cross-linking blend, when cross-linking takes place via the acrylonitrile groups of NBR and the SO 2 CI groups or the insitu generated allyl chloride moieties of CSM. There is a loss of some -CN groups during cross-linking. This may be due to an attack on the -CN groups by HCI (produced during the heating of CSM) in the presence of inherent moisture in the polymers. Amid type of linkage is formed due to cross-linking...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} nano- and micro- {{particle}} size of SiO 2 on dry and swollen parameter network of the polymer matrix blends of acrylontrile-butadiene (NBR) and <b>chlorosulphonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (CSM) such as: volume and mass degree of swelling Rv and Rw; volume fraction of NBR-CSM polymer matrix in swollen gel V 2 elasticity modulus G; interaction parameter between NBR-CSM polymer matrix and solvent λ and crossiinking density ν, was tested. The influence of nano-and micro- particle size of SiO 2 on physical and mechanical properties, {{as well as}} effectiveness volume ratio of filiers in NBR-CSM polymer matrix at 300 % elongation was tested using Einstein-Quth-Gold equation. The Kraus equation for swelling test of NBR-CSM polymer matrix containing nano- and micro- particle size of SiO 2. Test results have shown that a greater interaction of nano-particie size of SiO 2 with NBR-CSM polymer matrix, and possible chemical bonding, than the one of micro-silica was a consequence of a greater contact area. This results in better physical and mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The purpose of this research project is to model the rheological behaviour of elastomers and elastomer compounds. Two elastomers (natural rubber, SMR 20 and <b>chlorosulphonated</b> <b>polyethylene,</b> Hypalon 40) and three different grades of carbon black at three different levels of loading were chosen for this study. Mixing was carried out with a Farrel Bridge BR Banbury mixer, followed by subsequent milling on a two-roll mill. Rheological measurements were made with parallel plate, cone and plate and Negretti biconical rotor TMS rheometers.. The effect of temperature on viscosity was investigated by determining the activation energy of viscous flow in terms of concentration and surface area of carbon black. Computer programs were developed to evaluate various parameters in the models by non-linear optimisation technique. The steady state flow behaviour of gum elastomers was fitted by the Bird-Carreau model and a thixotropic model. The thixotropic model was modified to non- Newtonian flow but proved to be intractable for fitting the rheological properties of mixed rubber compounds. Two new models for the viscosity and stress relaxation of filled compounds were then developed, which give very promising results...|$|E
40|$|Acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), {{polychloroprene}} rubber (CR), <b>chlorosulphonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> rubber (CSM) {{and their}} blends were cross-linked with sulphur, ethylene-thiourea, magnesium oxide or their combination. The effect of nano- and micro- particle sized of 35 pphr SiO 2 on the thermostability and surface morphology {{of all the}} crosslinked systems was investigated. Identification {{of the structure of}} nano- and micro- particle sized SiO 2 filled NBR/CSM and CR/CSM crosslinked systems was carried out by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) extension. The thermal stability of the nano- and micro- particle sized SiO 2 filled NBR/CSM and CR/CSM crosslinked systems were carried out by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the samples was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The morphology of the fracture surface of the crosslinked systems was carried out by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show when filled with nano-particle sized of SiO 2 NBR/CSM and CR/CSM polymer matrix have a strong peak from SiOC at 1079 cm- 1. This suggests the an interaction between the SiO 2, which should lead to an increased thermal stability, higher values of Tg, better dispersion the nano-SiO 2 and more polish, without cracks than micro-filled NBR/CSM and CR/CSM crosslinked systems...|$|E
