We identify {{the main dimensions}} along which different systems can be characterized, and investigate the formal relationships among granularities in these systems. The paper also introduces {{the notion of a}} network of temporal constraints with (multiple) granularities emphasizing the semantic and computational differences from constraint networks with a single granularity. Consistency of networks with multiple granularities is shown to be NP-hard in general and approximate solutions for this problem and for the minimal network problem are proposed. 1 Introduction Human activities heavily relate to <b>calendar</b> <b>units</b> and clock units (e. g., weeks, months, hours and seconds).

40|$|Automaticity in sequence-space {{synaesthesia}} 2 For many people, {{thinking about}} {{certain types of}} common sequence – for example <b>calendar</b> <b>units</b> or numerals – elicits a vivid experience that the sequence members occupy spatial locations which are in turn {{part of a larger}} spatial pattern of sequence members. Recent research on these visuospatial experiences has usually considered them to be a variety of synaesthesia, and many studies have argued that this sequence-space synaesthesia is an automatic process, consistent with a traditional view that automaticity is a key property of synaesthesia. In this review we present a critical discussion of data from the three main paradigms that have been used to argue for automaticity in sequence-space synaesthesia, namely SNARC-like effects (Spatial-Numerical-Association-of-Response-Codes), spatial cueing, and perceptual incongruity effects.

This extends from the formation of image-based representations of verbal material in childhood to the later maturation of dynamic control of imagery.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Although it is {{estimated}} that as many as 4 % of people experience some form of enhanced cross talk be-tween (or within) the senses, known as synaesthesia, very little is understood about the level of information pro-cessing required to induce a synaesthetic experience. In work presented here, we used a well-known multisensory illusion called the McGurk effect to show that synaesthesia is driven by late, perceptual processing, rather than early, unisensory processing. Specifically, we tested 9 linguistic-color synaesthetes and found that the colors induced by spoken words are related to what is perceived (i. e., the illusory combination of audio and visual inputs) and not to the auditory component alone. Our findings indicate that color-speech synaesthesia is triggered only when a signifi-cant amount of information processing has occurred and that early sensory activation is not directly linked to the synaesthetic experience. Synaesthesia occurs when a stimulus triggers an anomalous percept in the same or different modality as the normal percept. Reported synaesthetic experiences have ranged from tasting words (Ward & Simner, 2003) and sounds (Beeli, Esslen, & Jäncke, 2005) to seeing <b>calendar</b> <b>units</b> (Smilek, Callejas, Dixon, & Merikle, 2006), but by far the most studied form of syn-aesthesia is induction of color by letters, words, or digits (Rich & Mattingley, 2002). This latter type of synaesthesia is diversely referred to as colored speech (Baron-Cohen, Harrison, Gold-stein, & Wyke, 1993), colored hearing (Marks, 1975), or lin-guistic-color (Simner, Glover, & Mowat, 2006), lexical-colo...|$|R

This lack of strong evidence for automaticity reduces the temptation to seek explanations of sequence-space synaesthesia in terms of processes mediated by qualitatively abnormal brain organization or mechanisms. Instead, more parsimonious explanations in terms of extensively rehearsed associations, established for example via normal processes of visuospatial imagery, are convergent with arguments that synaesthetic phenomena are on a continuum with normal cognition.

40|$|The aim {{of man to}} {{lengthen}} the duration of life {{is about to be}} achieved although not directly by increasing the number of years, but indirectly by intensifying the annual rhythm of life. Although it is true that such an increase in the volume of life shortens its length, it must be taken into consideration that whilst the shortening takes phase in an arithmetic progression, the rhythm of life increases in geometric progression. Consequently the final result is positive: life today is longer than before. This consideration leads to the obvious conclusion that our <b>calendar</b> <b>units,</b> day and year, are unsuitable measures for the volume of life and we have to find some other kind of scales. The system of measuring the social phenomena by dividing the time in periods is an optical error. It is not possible to judge chronologically different phenomena by the same standard, once the changes in the rhythm are considered. In the historical vision which the new temporal optics suggests, a calendar period appears as very long in the past, whereas in the future it is short and full of life. Would these conclusions be taken into consideration, many anomalies of our social system would be avoided. A proof of its discordant with these dynamic ideas, is the social incomprehension of the increasing claims of labour for less working hours and higher wages.

40|$|BACKGROUND Calendar time, age and {{duration}} are chronological objects. They represent an instant or a time period. Age {{and duration}} are usually expressed in units with varying lengths. The {{number of days}} {{in a month or}} a year depends on the position on the <b>calendar.</b> The <b>units</b> are also not homogeneous and the structure influences measurement. One solution, common in demography, is to use units that are large enough for the results not to be seriously affected by differences in length and structure. Another approach is to take the idiosyncrasy of calendars into account and to work directly with calendar dates. The technology that enables logical and arithmetic operations on dates is available. OBJECTIVE To illustrate logical and arithmetic operations on dates and conversions between time measurements. METHODS Software packages include utilities to process dates. I use existing and a few new utilities in R to illustrate operations on dates and conversions between calendar dates and elapsed time since a reference moment or a reference event. Three demographic applications are presented. The first is the impact of preferences for dates and days on demographic indicators. The second is event history analysis with time-varying covariates. The third is microsimulation of life histories in continuous time. CONCLUSIONS The technology exists to perform operations directly on dates, enabling more precise calculations of duration and elapsed time in demographic analysis. It eliminates the need for (a) approximations and (b) transformations of dates, such as Century Month Code, that are convenient for computing durations but are a barrier to interpretation. Operations on dates, such as the computation of age, should consider time units of varying length...|$|R
