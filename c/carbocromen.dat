40|$|AbstractIncreased ‘oxidative stress’ {{resulting}} in the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is thought to {{play a crucial role}} in the cytokine-mediated expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in different cell types. Therefore, the effects of four different antioxidants, <b>carbocromen,</b> chrysin, 3, 4 -dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) and N-acetylserotonin (NAS), on iNOS expression were investigated in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). All antioxidants strongly reduced the phorbol ester-stimulated superoxide anion formation in native VSMC. <b>Carbocromen</b> (200 μM) and chrysin (50 μM) had no effect, while NAS (1 mM) abolished the increase in nitrine production and iNOS protein abundance in cultured VSMC exposed to interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β, 60 U/ml) or the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (10 μM). DCI also revealed a marked inhibitory effect in IL- 1 β-stimulated VSMC, but was less effective in cells treated with forskolin. DCI, but not NAS, also suppressed the activation of NF-κB in VSMC exposed to IL- 1 β, while no significant NF-κB activation was detected in forskolin-treated cells. These findings demonstrate that antioxidants differentially affect iNOS expression in VSMC both at the transcriptional level by preventing the activation of NF-κB and at the post-transcriptional level, presumably by promoting iNOS mRNA or protein degradation. They also suggest that reactive oxygen intermediates do not play a role in the activation of NF-κB by IL- 1 β in VSMC, and that transcripton factors other than NF-κB mediate the induction of iNOS expression by elevating the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the "vascular waterfall " hypothesis, which proposes that coronary flow is unaffected by elevations in outflow pressure until the latter reaches a critical threshold level, in 29 isolated canine hearts. In fibrillating hearts vasodilated with adenosine or <b>carbocromen,</b> coronary flow and the coronary pressure-flow relation were {{not affected by}} changes in great cardiac vein pressure (PGCV) below a threshold value of 11 + 0. 9 (mean+SEM) mm Hg. Further elevations of PGCV reduced flow and shifted the pressure-flow relation to the right, increasing its pressure-axis intercept (Pf=o). When vasomotor tone was augmented with vasopressin, threshold PGCV increased to 25 ± 2. 7 mm Hg (p < 0. 001). Once again, the pressure-flow relation was unaffected by changes in PGCV below the threshold value and shifted to the right when this value was exceeded. The amount by which spontaneous values of Pf= 0 exceeded threshold values of PGCV was greater when vasomotor tone was augmented than during vasodilation. Pf= 0 continued to exceed PGCV when the latter was raised above the threshold level. Both Pf= 0 and threshold values of PGCV were less during a long diastole than during ventricular fibrillation. We reached the following conclusions. 1) During changes in PGCV below a threshold value, the coronary circulation exhibits traditional waterfall behavior. 2) The threshold pressure fo...|$|E
