5|$|In 2005, after {{retiring}} from business {{to focus on}} his horse racing career, Borislow set forth {{plans for a new}} voice-over-IP business, with an initial name of Talk4free. He created YMAX Communications Corporation in April 2006 as a communications and equipment service. YMAX's profits come from the production of the magicJack, a small device which can be plugged into a computer's USB port and allows for unlimited <b>calling</b> <b>from</b> regular telephones.|$|E
5|$|In {{his brief}} retirement, {{he focused on}} his horse racing career, sending Talk is Money to the 2001 Kentucky Derby {{although}} the thoroughbred did not complete the race. Borislow's most successful horse yet has been Toccet, who won four graded stakes, among which are the Champagne and Hollywood Futurity in 2002. After selling most of his horses in 2004, Borislow set forth {{plans for a new}} voice-over-IP business which became the magicJack. Invented in 2007, the magicJack is a small product which can be plugged into a computer's USB port and allows for unlimited <b>calling</b> <b>from</b> regular telephones. In 2010, YMAX, the company behind the magicJack, merged with an Israeli company and became a publicly traded corporation.|$|E

She decides to move to New Caledonia, leaving a note for Tono {{as well as a}} record with a song recorded especially for him as a way of saying goodbye. On the way to New Caledonia, Yah pines for Tono and hears his voice <b>calling</b> <b>from</b> afar, giving a speech on the radio. Tono, now alone, dedicates himself to his work in an attempt to fill the void left in his heart.|$|E

25|$|When a {{subscriber}} {{dialed the}} number of a manual station, an operator at the destination office answered the call after seeing the number on an indicator, and connected the call by plugging a cord into the outgoing circuit and ringing the destination station. For example, if a dial customer <b>calling</b> <b>from</b> TAylor 4725 dialed a number served by a manual exchange, e.g., ADams 1383-W, the call was completed, from the subscriber’s perspective, exactly as a call to LEnnox 5813, in an automated exchange. The party line letters W, R, J, and M were only used in manual exchanges with jack-per-line party lines.|$|E

25|$|SNV <b>calling</b> <b>from</b> NGS data {{refers to}} a range of methods for {{identifying}} the existence of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from the results of next generation sequencing (NGS) experiments. These are computational techniques, and are in contrast to special experimental methods based on known population-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (see SNP genotyping). Due to the increasing abundance of NGS data, these techniques are becoming increasingly popular for performing SNP genotyping, {{with a wide variety of}} algorithms designed for specific experimental designs and applications. In addition to the usual application domain of SNP genotyping, these techniques have been successfully adapted to identify rare SNPs within a population, as well as detecting somatic SNVs within an individual using multiple tissue samples.|$|E
25|$|In {{an ideal}} error free world with high read coverage, {{the task of}} variant <b>calling</b> <b>from</b> {{the results of a}} NGS data {{alignment}} would be simple; at each locus (position on the genome) the number of occurrences of each distinct nucleotide among the reads aligned at that position can be counted, and the true genotype would be obvious; either AA if all nucleotides match allele A, BB if they match allele B, or AB if there is a mixture. However, when working with real NGS data this sort of naive approach is not used, as it cannot account for the noise in the input data. The nucleotide counts used for base calling contain errors and bias, both due do the sequenced reads themselves, and the alignment process. This issue can be mitigated to some extent by sequencing to a greater depth of read coverage, however this is often expensive, and many practical studies require making inferences on low coverage data.|$|E
25|$|Though a rookie, Sister Shannon {{training}} was completed and she {{reported to the}} New York City archdiocese. There, she patrolled two sectors from her assigned parish, Saint Thomas Church in Manhattan {{on the grounds that}} she was assigned to an area where there had not been demonic activity since the Purge of 1985. Replacing Sisters Sanguine and Hannah, she soon saw a sustained surge in New York City's demonic activity after her arrival. (A stock situation in comic books wherein the supervillains can appear only after a hero shows up.) She soon received her <b>calling</b> <b>from</b> the first Sister Areala after she was nearly killed in a battle with minions of Satanist and arms dealer Julius Salvius. On recognizing her as the Chosen One of that generation, the original Sister Areala gave Sister Shannon her name and awakened her latent power.

25|$|As the {{greatest}} concentrations of Japanese troops in North Borneo {{during the war}} was in fact in the interior areas, repatriation of the soldiers and civilians following the surrender takes several months as it was delayed {{due to the lack}} of shipping. An estimate of around 29,500 remaining Japanese troops spread across the island in both north and southern part. Of the total, 18,600 belong to the IJA while 10,900 to the IJN. Though there were also some Japanese who were unaware over their surrender and moved far further to the inland despite the <b>calling</b> <b>from</b> their supreme commander. Only after more repeated callings from both Allied and Japanese forces did these forces return. The repatriation are mostly been supervised by the Australian as Borneo along with New Guinea, Papua and Solomon Islands were under their responsibility during the liberation mission. In addition to organising repatriation, the Australian forces also involved in supervising the destroying of Japanese weapons and ammunition as well evacuating internees and Allied POWs from Japanese camps that were established around the island.|$|E
25|$|At {{any time}} of the year, but {{especially}} when the rains commence, a male will spend hours <b>calling</b> <b>from</b> a conspicuous perch. A clear, somewhat variable, whistled phrase of three to five syllables is typical, which may be rendered as tseep-tseeoo, teeoo-teewee or chiwiki-chiwi. The song may be changed after each 20 or so repetitions. During some intermissions the wings are audibly fluttered in the few seconds between phrases. This results in a quick prrrrt or phrrrp rattle, and may lift the bird off its perch. The crest is also lifted during display. It may alternatively sing a rudimentary song consisting of whistles, tweets and trills (distinguishable as imitated calls), during short flights over the grass or during an upward spiraling flight, before it planes down. Race malbranti in particular, may sing during a straight and direct display flight and clap its wings above its back. Perched males may also string together fragments of the songs of various grassland birds. It utters peewit, tweekiree or pree, pree notes in alarm.|$|E
25|$|A {{computer}} then instructs {{the user}} {{to go to a}} certain teletext page which has been assigned to the customer for that session. Usually the page initially contains a menu with options and the user chooses among the options using the buttons on the telephone. When a choice has been made, the selected page is immediately broadcast and can be viewed by the user. This is in contrast with usual teletext where the customer has to wait for the selected page to be broadcast, because the pages are broadcast sequentially. This technology enables teletext to be used for games, chat, access to databases etc. It allows one to overcome the limitations on the number of available pages. On the other hand, {{only a limited number of}} users can use the service at the same time, since one page is allocated per user. Some channels solve this by taking into account where the user is geographically <b>calling</b> <b>from</b> and by broadcasting different teletext pages in different geographical regions. In that way, two different users can be assigned the same page number at the same time as long as they do not receive the TV signals from the same source. Another drawback to the technology is the privacy concerns in that many users can see what a user is doing because the interactive pages are received by all viewers. Also, the user usually has to pay for the telephone call to the TV station. For these reasons, these services have since been superseded by the World Wide Web.|$|E
