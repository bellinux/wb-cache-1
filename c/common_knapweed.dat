25|$|The nearby meadows at Plaster's Green Meadows are {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest {{because it is an}} area of unimproved and traditionally managed species-rich meadows which support a neutral grassland community of a type which is now rare throughout Britain. The site is situated on the slopes fringing the Lias Tablelands and is underlain by Rhaetic clays and, lower down the slope Keuper Red Marl. The slowly permeable clay soils are slightly calcareous in nature and this is reflected in elements of the flora. The site is characterised by the nationally rare <b>Common</b> <b>Knapweed</b> (Centaurea nigra) and Crested Dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and dominant grasses include Sweet Vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus), while Quaking Grass (Briza media) and Yellow Oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) are also frequent. There is a high component of herb species throughout the meadows including Saw-wort (Serratuta tinctoria), Dyer’s Greenweed (Genista tinctoria), <b>Common</b> <b>Knapweed,</b> Pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), Devil’s-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), Betony (Stachys officinalis) and Spiny Restharrow (Ononis spinosa). The calcareous nature of the soil is reflected by the presence of Cowslip (Primula veris), Fairy Flax (Linum catharticum), Glaucous Sedge (Carex flacca), Lady’s Bedstraw (Galium verum) and occasional Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor). The meadows are bounded by hedges supporting numerous species including Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), English Elm (Ulmus procera), Hazel (Corylus avellana) and Field Maple (Acer campestre). Hedgerow trees include Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa), Holly (Ilex aquifolium) and Oak (Quercus sp).|$|E

50|$|The <b>common</b> name spotted <b>knapweed</b> {{most often}} refers to Centaurea maculosa; however, {{inconsistencies}} {{exist in the}} scientific community. Two cytotypes of the plant exist which have been named as either different species or subspecies. Centaurea maculosa {{has been used to}} describe the diploid and tetraploid form, however the diploid form has been called Centaurea stoebe which, having been published before C. maculosa, is the correct name for the species and the tetraploid form Centaurea biebersteinii.|$|R
50|$|Rhaponticum repens, synonym Acroptilon repens, {{with the}} <b>common</b> name Russian <b>knapweed,</b> is a bushy rhizomatous perennial, up to 8 dm tall. Stems and leaves are finely arachnoid-tomentose {{becoming}} glabrous and green with age. The rosette leaves are oblanceolate, pinnately lobed to entire, 2-3 cm wide by 3-8 cm long. The lower cauline leaves are smaller, pinnately lobed; the upper leaves become much reduced, sessile, serrate to entire. The heads are numerous terminating the branches. Flowers are pink to purplish, the marginal ones not enlarged. The outer and middle involucral bracts are broad, striate, smooth with broadly rounded tips; the inner bracts are narrower with hairy tips. Pappus present with bristles 6-11 mm long. Fruit is a whitish, slightly ridged achene.|$|R
40|$|While weed {{biological}} control success is typically achieved with one agent, multiple agents are invariably introduced. Biological control agents that share a host-plant may interact {{either directly or}} indirectly through changes in host-plant quality. Negative interactions could reduce the impacts of the agents on the density of their host-plant while positive interactions (facilitation) could improve {{biological control}} success. In the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada, initial declines in the invasive rangeland weed, diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa) were attributed to the introduction of the weevil Larinus minutus. A second weevil, Cyphocleonus achates has recently become <b>common</b> on diffuse <b>knapweed.</b> We sought to determine if the recent increase of C. achates could threaten the success of L. minutus. We considered whether L. minutus colonisation or performance remained the same when C. achates was present, and whether the two agents acted independently to reduce plant performance. Neither changes in colonisation rates nor competitive interactions were apparent between C. achates and L. minutus. Both insects reduced plant performance and, for all metrics, the reduction in plant performance by one species was independent of the second. The two agents appear to be compatible and both should contribute to the control of diffuse knapweed. To assess how biological control agents interact requires understanding both their competitive interactions and their joint effects on the shared host. 6 page(s...|$|R
