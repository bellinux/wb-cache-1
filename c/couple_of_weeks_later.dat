5|$|In 1860 Berkeley and Curtis {{described}} the species Agaricus cyanophos from material also {{collected from the}} Bonin Islands. This material was found near the location that the original specimens of M.chlorophos were found, but a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>later.</b> Japanese mycologists Seiya Ito and Sanshi Imai studied these collections in the late 1930s, and concluded that Agaricus cyanophos was the same species as M.chlorophos, despite differences in cap shape, gill attachment, {{and the color of}} emitted light. Desjardin and colleagues agreed with this determination after examining the type material of both taxa. M.chlorophos is classified in the section Exornatae of the genus Mycena. Other luminescent species in this section are M.discobasis and M.marginata. Some authors have considered M.illuminans to be synonymous with M.chlorophos due to their morphological similarity, but molecular analysis has shown that they are distinct species.|$|E
5|$|A <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>later</b> in late June in the Wimbledon singles {{he again}} {{suffered}} a surprise loss to Ian Collins {{in the second}} round. In the mixed event Cochet and Whittingstall lost in semifinal stage, this time to Enrique Maier and Elizabeth Ryan. The singles competition was won by Ellsworth Vines, his first non-American title. The American Davis Cup team traveled back to France to challenge the reigning holder at the Stade Roland Garros. The French Musketeers secured the cup for the sixth and final time after four rubbers, losing only the doubles match. Cochet and Vines met in the dead fifth rubber. The face-off between the two {{was one of the}} few encounters that later had a decisive effect on the rankings. Vines ameliorated his team's result by defeating Cochet in five sets. The two European major champions then met in the final of the U.S. National Championships final in September. Vines kept the national title home with his second win, a straight sets 6–4 victory over Cochet. Vines and Keith Gledhill subsequently beat Cochet and Marcel Bernard in the doubles final. Cochet and Virginia Rice were dropped out in the mixed semifinal while Vines reached the finals. These losses sealed the fate of the year-end rankings.|$|E
5|$|Becky confronts Kylie after a bad {{reference}} {{that she}} provided to an adoption agency. At first Kylie pretends {{that she has}} a privileged life in order to impress Becky but it soon emerges that she is on the streets. She then moves into the Rovers Return Inn and instantaneously sparks a conflict with Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Becky and Steve soon discover {{that she has a}} four-year-old son called Max, whose custody she seeks. She sells Steve's motorbike and tries to sleep with him. After visiting Max at the foster parents' home, she takes him home. She sleeps with Gary Windass (Mikey North). Kylie is awarded custody of her son. Later she steals money from the till at Roy's Rolls, and jets off to Cyprus on holiday and leaves Max in Becky's care. She returns a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>later</b> with a new boyfriend, Demetri. She tells Becky that she has come back to take Max to live in Cyprus, leaving Becky heartbroken. Kylie sees Becky's desperation as she cannot have children and offers to give Max to her in exchange for 20,000 pounds. Becky complies and Kylie leaves.|$|E
50|$|As {{the graph}} above indicates, films {{that had never}} before been shown on {{television}} proliferated during The CBS Late Movies first <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b> But <b>later</b> on in this period, older films that had been run previously on local stations began to increase in number.

5000|$|The film {{turned out}} to be a sleeper-hit with young working people and sold out; the Buddhist {{community}} filled only a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> rows. Three <b>weeks</b> <b>later,</b> Tulku played again, in a bigger theater, and all three shows were packed. So clearly this film has something to say to young adults, whatever their station in life. Perhaps this points to the fact that it’s not only Tulkus who have a hard time figuring out who they are. Those who have to deal with famous parents, high family expectations, or just trying to establish life-goals based on their inner being rather than on outside propaganda, clearly find this a universal theme.|$|R
50|$|The North American roundup was {{an iconic}} {{image of the}} American Old West: the {{gathering}} of cattle in the open range, followed by them being driven vast distances from ranches to distant railheads over a period <b>of</b> several <b>weeks.</b> Due to the time and distance involved, not only did livestock and cowboys have to endure rough terrain and extreme weather, herds were also at risk from theft, hunger and disease. As railroads expanded, the time and distance travelled became shorter until railroads expanded into most communities, requiring cattle drives of {{a few days or}} a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> at most. <b>Later,</b> as motorised transport for livestock became common, rounded-up animals were often driven to the nearest road, herded into holding corrals, then loaded onto trucks for further transport. The modern American roundup now generally encompasses the gathering of animals from grazing lands in outlying sections of a large private ranch or from public lands leased from the Bureau of Land Management or US Forest Service. This process may still take many days and at times may require cowboys to camp out in remote areas, though most often this will be at a base camp near the holding corrals. The animals are gathered in holding corrals near a developed road, loaded into a livestock trailer or semi-trailer and transported to their ultimate destination.|$|R
5|$|Ginóbili {{was to play}} an {{even bigger}} role for the Spurs the {{following}} season, reaching career high averages in points, rebounds, assists, and three-point field goal percentage. With this improvement, Ginobili was named an NBA All-Star {{for the second time}} in his career. On 11 February 2008, Ginóbili scored 34 points and recorded 15 rebounds in a 93–88 win over the Toronto Raptors, becoming the first guard in Spurs' history to have at least 15 points and 15 rebounds in a game. On 21 April 2008, the NBA announced that Ginóbili had won the 2008 Sixth Man Award; only a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>later,</b> the Argentine was also named to the All-NBA Third Team. In the playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Suns 4–1 in the first round, Ginóbili was moved to the starting lineup in the second round against the New Orleans Hornets after the Spurs lost the first two road games. San Antonio eventually prevailed in seven games, the Argentine played another strong series, leading the Spurs in points and assists per game (21.3 and 6.0 respectively). However, San Antonio lost to arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals in five games, and once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.|$|E

40|$|We {{took a look}} at the {{irrigation}} methods of strawberry farmers in the Pajaro Valley and ways that they could reduce the amount of water that it takes to produce their strawberries. In many areas the limited amount of water is effecting the production of crops.

The use of sprinklers during the first <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> seemed like an obvious place to start with reducing the water used.
