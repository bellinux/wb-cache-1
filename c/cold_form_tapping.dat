The {{aim of this study}} is to present the surface properties of the threads resulting from form tapping. Geometrical characterization, surface texture, mechanical and metallurgical observations are investigated. The results obtained are discussed according to the input parameters of theprocess, and are compared to those obtained from cut tapping. The strength of the work material and the influence of the lubricant are the two main parameters affecting the process, and a correlation with the tapping torque is proposed. Finally, the characteristics of the thread surface depend on the parameters of the tapping operation, thus it has to be taken into account in the design approach when this tapping process is chosen...|$|E
40|$|While {{threaded}} holes made by cutting taps result in material removal, in <b>form</b> <b>tapping,</b> the tap displaces the work material by plastic flow {{to form the}} thread section. The aim of the present work is to study, both experimentally and analytically, the 3 D-plastic flow in <b>form</b> <b>tapping</b> of low-alloy steels. An experimental technique for producing and measuring the 3 D displacement is proposed. Experimental results of displacements {{are used in the}} analytical analysis. The Green-Lagrange strain tensor is determined from the measurements obtained. The deviator stress tensor is calculated by using the constitutive law of the work material. The stress equilibrium allows the stress distribution resulting from the <b>form</b> <b>tapping</b> process. The results obtained show the quantification of the 3 D-plastic flow, demonstrating that the external layer of the thread is strongly deformed.

The principal advantage of <b>cold</b> <b>form</b> foil blisters is that the use of aluminum offers a near complete barrier for water and oxygen, allowing an extended product expiry date. The principal disadvantages of <b>cold</b> <b>form</b> foil blisters are: the slower speed of production compared to thermoforming; the lack of transparency of the package (a therapy compliance disadvantage); and the larger size of the blister card (aluminum can not be formed with near 90 degree angles).In <b>cold</b> <b>forming</b> aluminium is offering a near complete barrier for water and oxygen, allowing an extended product expiry date.|$|R

50|$|Forming tap: A quite {{different}} kind of <b>tap</b> is a <b>Forming</b> <b>Tap.</b> A <b>forming</b> <b>tap,</b> aka a fluteless tap or roll tap, simply forcefully displaces the metal into a thread shape upon being turned into the hole, instead of cutting metal {{from the sides of}} the hole as cutting <b>taps</b> do. A <b>forming</b> <b>tap</b> closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes, or very nearly just like a plain thread. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread <b>forming</b> as the <b>tap</b> is advanced into a properly sized hole. The threads behind the lobes are slightly recessed to reduce contact friction. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need to}} periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the <b>tap.</b> Thus thread <b>forming</b> is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with a cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. <b>Forming</b> <b>taps</b> only work in malleable materials such as mild steel or aluminum. Formed threads are typically stronger than cut threads. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for a cutting tap as shown in most tap drill tables, and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|R

The stress concentration in <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> sections {{is due to the}} corner radii and notches present at inside corners of <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> members. These investigations has been done by performing two-dimensional linear static analysis by modeling <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> rectangular hollow section (CFRHS) with different notch shapes and sizes in Ansys software. Three different kinds of notches with two notch sizes i. e. n 1 =t/ 5 and n 2 = 2 t/ 5 have been modeled while the outer radius to thickness (r o/t) ratios of 3, 4 and 5 have been used. As a result of this work, stress concentration factors (K t) have been computed for all kinds of notches and results have been compared and reported in this paper.
