Standard Checks are carried out by a supervising examiner from the Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). During this test ADIs' will be tested against the ‘National standard for driver and rider training’ criteria. They are designed to ensure that ADIs are keeping up the proper standards of instruction. The tests normally take place during working hours from Mondays to Fridays. The <b>check</b> <b>test</b> lasts for about an hour, with a 15-minute debrief afterwards without the pupil being present.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{condition}} of the ADI register that ADIs' make themselves available for check tests when requested. A <b>check</b> <b>test</b> usually involves the examiner assessing the ADIs instructional ability by observing a lesson given to a real pupil. If the ADI doesn't have a pupil available, they may give instruction to someone who holds a full driving licence this must not be another ADI or a PDI who has passed the ADI part 2 exam. During the test they must ensure that their level of instruction is correct for the driver's ability. The ADI {{will be given a}} grading {{at the end of the}} test - grade B being the lower grade and grade A the higher. If the ADI is assesed as un-satisfactory, they will be asked to retake the <b>check</b> <b>test</b> again within a short period of time. If the ADI displays a lower than acceptable level of instruction on three consecutive occasions, steps will be taken to remove him/her from the ADI register.|$|E

40|$|Spacecraft {{optoelectronic}} modules {{traditionally have}} aluminum alloy or titanium alloy casing which substantial weight increases fuel consumption required {{to put them}} into orbit and, consequently, {{total cost of the}} project. Carbon fiber reinforced polymer based composite constructive materials is an efficient solution that allows reducing weight and dimensions of large optoelectronic modules 1, 5 – 3 times and the coefficient of linear thermal expansion 15 – 20 times if compared with metals. Optical characteristic is a crucial feature of carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer that determines composite material interaction with electromagnetic emission within the optical range. This work was intended to develop a method to evaluate Carbon fiber reinforced polymer optoelectronic modules casing effect on lens scattering by computer simulation with Zemax application software package.
