He asked us what it was we were discussing. We {{said it was the}} Day of Judgment. He said: 'It will not be called until ten signs have appeared: Smoke, Dajjal (the Antichrist), the creature (that will wound the people), the rising of the sun in the West, the Second Coming of Jesus, the emergence of Gog and Magog, and three sinkings (or <b>cavings</b> in of the earth): one in the East, another in the West and a third in the Arabian Peninsula.'"

5000|$|Well {{cuttings}} examination is {{a learned}} skill. During drilling, chips of rock, usually less than about 1/8 inch (6 mm) across, are {{cut from the}} bottom of the hole by the bit. Mud, jetting out of holes in the bit under high pressure, washes the cuttings away and up the hole. During their trip to the surface they may circulate around the turning drillpipe, mix with cuttings falling back down the hole, mix with fragments caving from the hole walls and mix with cuttings travelling faster and slower in the same upward direction. They then are screened out of the mudstream by the shale shaker and fall on a pile at its base. Determining the type of rock being drilled at any one time is a matter of knowing the 'lag time' between a chip being cut by the bit and the time it reaches the surface where it is then examined by the wellsite geologist (or mudlogger as they are sometimes called). A sample of the cuttings taken at the proper time will contain the current cuttings in a mixture of previously drilled material. Recognizing them can be very difficult at times, for example after a [...] "bit trip" [...] when a couple of miles of drill pipe has been extracted and returned to the hole in order to replace a dull bit. At such a time there is a flood of foreign material knocked from the borehole walls (<b>cavings),</b> making the mudloggers task all the more difficult.|$|E

(2) uncertainty and sensitivity analysis results arising from subjective (i. e., epistemic) uncertainty for individual releases, (3) construction of complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs) arising from stochastic (i. e., aleatory) uncertainty, and (4) uncertainty and sensitivity analysis results for CCDFs. The presented results indicate that direct releases due to cuttings, <b>cavings</b> and spallings do not constitute a serious threat to the effectiveness of the WIPP as a disposal facility for transuranic waste. Even when the effects of uncertain analysis inputs are taken into account, the CCDFs for cuttings, <b>cavings</b> and spallings releases fall substantially {{to the left of the}} boundary line specified in the US Environmental Protection Agency standard for the geologic disposal of radioactive waste (40 CFR 191, 40 CFR 194) ...|$|E
30|$|During the {{drilling}} of these slim-hole wells, well-bore instability and erratic mud rheological properties were observed. The main challenges thus experienced were well-bore <b>cavings,</b> stuck pipe, improper hole cleaning, ballooning, fracturing, shale sloughing and hole enlargement. It is suspected that these problems {{stem from the}} highly reactive nature of immature clays present in the area as well as mud compatibility.|$|E

Rock mass movements often reach hundreds of metres and significantly change their original shape. Failure mechanics can be studied experimentally. We can observe the onset of failure on nonhomogeneous models (prior to and during the failure, during the increase of deformations on sliding surfaces), the chronology of various stages of failure (<b>cavings,</b> slides), and the final shape of the rock mass. We can also observe influences, exerted by modelled joints, adits and other features, upon the failure history and shapes of <b>cavings</b> and slides. Research will be concentrated on the stability of internal tailings of Northern Bohemia open coal mines. There is a very smooth plane between the tailings and the bedrock.

30|$|It is also {{important}} to examine a drilling fluid not only for its rheological control but also to independently examine its efficacy in preventing hydration of consolidated shales. Lal (1999) indicated that over 75 % of the drilled sedimentary type formations are comprised of shale and over 70 % of the borehole problems are linked to shale instability. Shale instability problems are often caused by incompatibilities between drilling fluid and shale formations which can result in washouts, low rates of penetration, higher drilling costs and shale sloughing. Friedheim et al. (2011) suggested that shale samples for testing can be derived from field-specific, troublesome formations, outcrop samples with similar mineralogy, or synthetic shale; properly preserved shale cores would be ideal and provide the most accurate results. Cores, however, are indicated to be difficult and expensive to obtain but a good substitute may be <b>cavings</b> or cuttings from a drilled well, that are large enough and with minimal drilling fluid exposure. Laboratory studies such as clay hydration and swelling tests are conducted; however, fluid–shale interaction is complex and sometimes not well understood.|$|E

40|$|Withdrawal Boundary. Culebra {{transport}} releases had an inconsequential {{contribution to}} total normalized releases in the PABC- 2009. By definition, transuranic waste is not emplaced in non-waste containing repository regions. Consequently, a drilling intrusion into a non-waste region will (at most) result in negligible releases due to cuttings and <b>cavings</b> or spallings {{as there is}} no solid waste present at the time of intrusion. Sufficient pressure and brine saturation in the non-waste region at the time of intrusion could result in a nonzero volume of brine being released to the ground surface, however. In order for this released volume of brine to be contaminated with waste, it is necessary that contaminated brine in the waste area migrate to the non-waste area prior to intrusion. Waste panels in the repository are separated from non-waste containing regions by at least one panel closure. This is also true of the SDI and PABC- 2009 repository representations implemented in BRAGFLO, as seen in Figures 6 - 1 and 6 - 2 of Camphouse et al (2011). For the sake of clarity in what follows, waste areas of the SDI and PABC- 2009 BRAGFLO repository representations are shown in Figure 1. Intact Salado halite, with very low permeability, lies below and above the repository subregion shown in that figure, while non-waste containing repository areas are located to the north.

The hole penetrated 503 m of Cretaceous (Maestrichtian to Albian) and bottomed in basalt at 1121 m. No other hole of Leg 75 was drilled below the Neogene. Most of the 10 -cm** 3 samples from Hole 530 A were barren of foraminifers. Most of the foraminiferal populations recovered were barren of planktonic specimens. Consequently, no correlation with established planktonic biozones was possible, and correlation with European stages was limited to Maestrichtian-Campanian, Santonian-Coniacian, ?lower Turonian, and Albian. Most of the benthic species were interpreted to be displaced - not reworked nor redrilled <b>cavings.</b> Recognition of the displaced faunas helped in recognizing indigenous benthic faunas and in interpreting their paleodepth and provincial implications. Displaced faunas have temporal and paleogeographical value but not Paleobathymetric value. The prevalent general properties at Site 530 of sparsity of specimens, rarity of planktonic specimens, low taxonomic diversity of indigenous benthic faunas, and etched, worn, and broken specimens combined to indicate deposition well below the lysocline and near to, if not below, the carbonate compensation depth (CCD), or in the abyssal realm, during most of the Maestrichtian to Albian. Such a depositional environment is also implied by the primitive, quartzose, agglutinated faunas from noncalcareous red and green claystones, which occur with increasing prominence from {{the lower part of the}} Maestrichtian-Campanian interval to the bottom of the sedimentary section. The prominence, persistence, and physical condition of the displaced faunas suggest transport by a submarine fan system at some distance from the continental margin. The faunas of Hole 530 A resemble those of other paleoabyssal sites of the South Atlantic and Indian oceans and belong to the Austral Bioprovince. Latitudinal and provincial properties seem to diminish with depth, and the Albian indigenous benthic fauna is cosmopolitan. It is quite different from the Albian planktonic fauna of Hole 530 A, which is definitely midlatitudinal and Austral, and from the Albian fauna reported from nearby Sites 363 and 364. The principal event of the sedimentary record is a medial Cretaceous lacuna, which includes most of the Turonian and Cenomanian and some of the Albian.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a model to}} estimate the spallings releases for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Performance Assessment (WIPP PA). A spallings release {{in the context of}} WIPP PA refers to a portion of the solid waste transported from the subsurface repository to the ground surface due to inadvertent oil or gas drilling into the WIPP repository at some time after site closure. Some solid waste will be removed by the action of the drillbit and drilling fluid; this waste is referred to as cuttings and <b>cavings.</b> If the repository is pressurized above hydrostatic at the time of intrusion, solid waste material local to the borehole may be subject to mechanical failure and entrainment in high-velocity gases as the repository pressure is released to the borehole. Solid material that fails and is transported into the wellbore and thus to the surface comprise the spallings releases. The spallings mechanism is analogous to a well blowout in the modern oil and gas drilling industry. The current spallings conceptual model and associated computer code, DRSPALL, were developed for the 2004 recertification because the prior spallings model used in the 1996 WIPP Compliance Certification Application (CCA) was judged by an independent peer review panel as inadequate (DOE 1996, 9. 3. 1). The current conceptual model for spallings addresses processes that take place several minutes before and after a borehole intrusion of a WIPP waste room. The model couples a pipe-flow wellbore model with a porous flow repository model, allowing high-pressure gas to flow from the repository to the wellbore through a growing cavity region at the well bottom. An elastic stress model is applied to the porous solid domain that allows for mechanical failure of repository solids if local tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the waste. Tensile-failed solids may be entrained into the wellbore flow stream by a fluidized bed model, in which case they are ultimately transported to the land surface comprising a release. In July 2003, DOE/SNL presented the spallings conceptual model to a independent peer review panel in accordance with NUREG 1297 guidelines (NRC, 1988). The panel ultimately judged the model as adequate for implementation in WIPP PA (Yew et al., 2003). This report documents the spallings model history from 1997 to the implementation of DRSPALL in the 2004 Compliance Recertification Application (CRA) (DOE, 2004).

In order to help quantifi parameters for the calculated releases, radionuclide transport experiments have been carried out using five intact-core columns obtained from the Culebra dolomite member of the Rustler Formation within the Waste Isolation Pilot Pknt (WIPP) site in southeastern New Mexico. This report deals primarily with results of analyses for 241 Pu and 241 Am distributions developed during transport experiments in one of these cores. All intact-core column transport experiments were done using Culebra-simukmt brine relevant to the core recovery location (the WIPP air-intake shaft - AK). Hydraulic characteristics (i. e., apparent porosity and apparent dispersion coefficient) for intact-core columns were obtained via experiments using conservative tracer `Na.

This report deals primarily with results of mathematical analyses related to the retardation of %J%, 24 %, and 24 'Am in two of these cores (B-Core - VPX 26 - 11 A and C-Core - VPX 28 - 6 C). All B-Core transport experiments were done using Culebra-simukmt brine relevant to the core recovery location (the WIPP air-intake shaft - AIS). Most experiments with C-Core were done with AIS brine with some admixture of a brine composition (ERDA- 6) that simulated deeper formation brines. No significant changes in transport behavior were observed for changes in brine. Hydraulic characteristics (i. e., apparent porosity and apparent dispersion coefficient) for the cores were obtained via experiments using conservative tracer `Na. Elution experiments carried out over periods of a few days with tracers `*U and %Np indicated that these tracers were weakly retarded as indicated by delayed elution of these species.

Moreover, the fact of non- elution for 24 *Pu and 24 'Am after more than two years brine flow through C-Core can be coupled with the minimum detectable activity for each of these species to compute minimum retardation factors in C-Core.

40|$|This {{survey of}} {{literature}} was undertaken by ARTEP- the French Research Association for Oil Exploration and Production Techniques- {{at the beginning}} of STAR (=STabilité des ARgiles), a project on the influence of clays on borehole stability. Knowledge of theories and laboratory experiments was indeed felt very necessary to help understanding, and thus becoming able to prevent, quite damaging phenomena. During the time spent on this project, ideas and interpretations of all participants underwent some evolution due to the comparison between theories and experiment, and new procedures and interpretations are being proposed elsewhere. The survey is divided in four sections :The first section recalls the specific problems caused by the occurrence of shales during drilling operations for oil or gas : about 90 % of the problems, for about 70 % of the drilled formations. The behaviour of the shales leads to a classification in four different classes : dispersive, swelling, heaving and brittle. They are spread all over the world, not only on the Gulf Coast of the USA and in the North Sea, where they have been more extensively studied, but also in former USSR, in Asia and Africa. Due to deposit conditions and diagenetic history, they occur at different depths, with different properties : reactive shales, at shallow depths, under-, over- or normally-compacted formations, and reservoir caps. Besides their mineralogical and textural properties, due to the large proportion of clays, they have damaging properties as the low permeability (10 to the power of (- 6) to 10 to the power of (- 12) D). The variety of reactions with water extends from a complete dispersion in mud to <b>cavings</b> or swelling of the borehole, with cuttings ranging from less than 1 mm to more than several cm. This has led to use of various empirical solutions to protect the borehole, with mainly mechanical or chemical objectives. However, it is felt that the general solutions can arise only from a synergistic effort of both rock mechanics and physico-chemistry, hence the STAR program. The second section is devoted to a survey of physico-chemical reactions between clays and water. It begins with some definitions of the clays as solids, from the rock to the atomic level. All clays are characterised by their small size, in the range of 1 µm, and thus, their high surface area : from one to several hundred M²/g. Existence of a layer charge, and of compensating cations is the key of the behaviour of the swelling clays (i. e. smectites) versus water, pure or with cations, which deserve particular attention. Description of the various kinds of water associated, more or less energetically, with clays, as a function of relative humidity RH, or water activity a index (w), helps to distinguish their effect on porosity and texture. Hydration and dehydration behaviour, with a particular hysteresis, is described, in solid-gas systems as well as in solid-liquid, closer to field conditions. Two main domains are distinguished : crystalline swelling, up to a water content of circa 50 vol. -%, inducing swelling pressures in the range of several thousand atmospheres, and osmotic swelling, for higher water contents, inducing pressures in the range of several atmospheres. Influence of nature and amount of cations is examined, mainly for calcium, which induces limited swelling, and for potassium which is both less hydratable and proner to irreversible fixation on clay. Little work has already been performed on the influence of temperature and pressure. Mechanisms of water and/or ionic species transport are reviewed: diffusion and osmosis, without applied pressure, and effect of pressure. Behaviour on compaction, always showing hysteresis, depends {{on the nature of the}} clays, and of the cations, but also on the composition of the solution. It is described using suction pressures or mechanical stresses, which induce different properties of the final solid. Experiments in soil literature, generally performed in the presence of a gas phase, cannot be readily compared to the in situ behaviour of the shales, but give insights on the possible artefacts of laboratory experiments. Caution is thus necessary before any application of literature results to real samples, all preliminary conditioning (initial state and composition of the clay and the water, way of hydration/dehydration, or compaction) being able to modify the behaviour of the clay-water system. The third section sets the problem of describing the mechanical behaviour of the rock formation on drilling. This behaviour depends on initial in situ stresses, pore pressure and temperature, and on the constitutive law of the rock, i. e. the relation between stress and strain. As an example, the Cam Clay elasto-plastic law is developed. Then the laboratory experimental sets used to identify mechanical properties are described : triaxial tests, drained or undrained, oedometric tests, and hollow cylinder tests, the first ones being used to calibrate borehole stability, while the latter simulate drilled boreholes. Specific aspects of shales are then recalled : dependence of mechanical properties on the water content, anisotropy and influence of time. Coupling between physico-chemistry and mechanics arises from the lack of chemical equilibrium between the solid and the liquid. This desequilibrium induces a transfer of water and chemical species in solution, modifying the pore pressure, thus the stress on the rock, and leading to chemical reactions, which have been described in section III. Follows a description of stability models, which should be able to predict mud characteristics for the drilling as well as evolution of the borehole with time. Stability models intend to calculate the maximum/minimum mud weight, from a relevant instability criterion, drawn from well data, mechanical data and fluid properties. The choice of the constitutive law is thus important, and elasto-plastic ones seem the more relevant. Taking into account physico-chemistry has been done generally using an osmoticpressure, with the assumption that the shales behave as a semi-permeable membrane. Even if this assumption is too simplistic, it is still used, but more refined models are being studied, which take into account variations in pore pressures and salinities. The fourth section deals with what actually occurs on application to real wellbore. Improvement of mud formulation tries to prevent any problem occurring during drilling. Evolution of formulation is described, from lime, oil, KCI to polymers additions, and to nowadays constraints brought by environment concerns : requirements may be opposite, and thus compromises must be found. Mud monitoring seems a good prospect. In a second part, availability of representative samples, artefacts related to the recovery and storage of samples as well as choice of experimental conditions are reviewed. It is recalled that downhole conditions are rarely taken into account, and problems like drying of the samples, which induces a suction pressure, anisotropy and cohesion of the samples are rarely considered. The conclusion emphasises that if swelling pressures can now be more precisely defined in hydration domains, the effects of physicochemistry on mechanical properties are still to be investigated more thoroughly. Further experiments should be set in conditions closer to downhole ones, and teams must work together to get all the data needed. This will allow proper stability modelling, with coupling of physico-chemistry and mechanics, to become a predictive tool. Cette revue bibliographique a été réalisée dans le cadre du programme STAR (STabilité des ARgiles) entrepris par l'ARTEP (Association de Recherche sur les Techniques d'Exploitation du Pétrole). Elle se divise en quatre sections: La première section rappelle les problèmes spécifiques rencontrés lors du forage des argiles, qui représentent environ 70 % des formations traversées, et sont répandues dans le monde entier, à diverses profondeurs, donc dans des états de compaction et d'évolution diagénétique différents. Leur comportement a conduit à une classification opérationnelle. Des solutions empiriques, destinées à protéger les parois de puits, ont été mises en oeuvre. Toutefois, il apparaît évident que des solutions de caractère général ne peuvent résulter que d'un effort conjoint en mécanique des roches et en physico-chimie : tel est l'objectif du programme STAR. La seconde section est consacrée à la description des réactions physico-chimiques entre les argiles et l'eau. Après avoir décrit les argiles en tant que solides, et plus particulièrement les argiles gonflantesqui ont une charge structurale faible compensée par un cation interfoliaire échangeable, on s'attache au comportement de l'eau qui leur est associée en fonction du degré d'humidité et de la nature et de la concentration des sels dans l'eau. Le gonflement cristallin, limité à une teneur en eau de 50 % environ, et correspondant à des pressions de gonflement de milliers d'atmosphères, est distingué du gonflement osmotique, qui intervient à de plus fortes hydratations, et induit des pressions de l'ordre de la dizaine d'atmosphères au maximum. L'influence spécifique des cations comme le potassium et le calcium est décrite. Des exemples de comportement à la compaction, fonction de la nature des argiles et des cations sont décrits. Il apparaît qu'une description très précise des conditions de départ et du déroulement des phénomènes est indispensable pour l'interprétation, et qu'elle est malheureusement absente dans nombre de publications. La troisième section traite de la description mécanique du comportement des roches argileuses lors du forage. La possibilité de modéliser ce comportement dépend de l'acquisition des paramètres pertinents, et du choix du modèle : le modèle Cam Clay, qui utilise une loi élasto-plastique est donné en exemple. Les tests de laboratoire sont décrits. Dans les argilites, les déséquilibres chimiques entre solide et fluide induisent des transferts d'eau et d'espèces chimiques, modifiant la pression de pore, donc la contrainte à laquelle est soumise la roche, et conduisant à des réactions chimiques décrites dans la deuxième section. Les modèles de stabilité prennent en compte ce couplage par l'usage d'une pression osmotique, avec l'hypothèse simpliste que les argilites se comportent comme des membranes semi-perméables. Des modèles plus affinés sont en cours d'élaboration pour prendre en compte les variations de pression de pore et de salinité. La quatrième section traite des pratiques de terrain, en particulier des améliorations apportées par une formulation de plus en plus élaborée des boues, pour répondre à la fois aux problèmes de forage, et aux exigences de préservation de l'environnement. La question de représentativité des échantillons destinés au laboratoire, et des artefacts liés à la récupération et au stockage est traitée : en particulier les variations de pression capillaire lors du séchage et de la réhydratation imposent des protocoles stricts. Des conditions expérimentales proches des conditions de fond sont rarement employées. En conclusion, si la notion de gonflement, et les conditions dans lesquelles il peut intervenir, apparaissent plus précisément, l'effet sur les propriétés mécaniques reste encore largement à étudier. Une approche multidisciplinaire est indispensable à l'élaboration de modèles de stabilité qui se veulent prédictifs...|$|E
