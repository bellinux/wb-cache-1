500|$|Catching Fire {{received}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Publishers Weekly wrote, [...] "If this second installment spends {{too much time}} recapping events from book one, it doesn't disappoint when it segues into the pulse-pounding action readers have come to expect." [...] Booklist commented on how the [...] "unadorned prose provides an open window to perfect pacing and electrifying world building". The New York Times also gave a positive review, writing, [...] "Collins has done that rare thing. She has written a sequel that improves upon the first book. As a reader, I felt excited and even hopeful: <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> this series and its characters were actually going somewhere?" [...] The review also praised Collins' development {{of the character of}} Katniss. The Plain Dealer wrote, [...] "The very last sentence of Catching Fire will leave readers gasping. Not to mention primed for part three." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics, used to more {{prescriptive}} cookery writers, {{thought her}} approach assumed too much knowledge {{on the part}} of the reader. In her view, [...] "The ideal cookery writer is one who makes his readers want to cook as well as telling them how it is done; he should leave something, not too much perhaps, but a little, unsaid: people must make their own discoveries, use their own intelligence, otherwise they will be deprived of part of the fun." [...] In The New York Times Craig Claiborne wrote admiringly of David, but remarked that because she assumed her readers already knew the basics of cooking she would be [...] "valued more by those with a serious regard for food than by those with a casual interest". [...] The writer Julian Barnes commented that as an amateur cook he found David's terse instructions intimidating: of a recipe in Italian Food [...] he wrote, [...] "E.D.'s first sentence reads like this: 'Melt 1½ lbs (675 g) chopped and skinned tomatoes in olive oil'... Melt? Melt a tomato?... <b>Could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Elizabeth David was too good a writer to be a food writer?". A later cook, Tom Parker Bowles, observes, [...] "You don't turn to Elizabeth David for nannying, step-by-step instruction, or precise amounts and timing. She assumes you know the basics, and is a writer who offers inspiration, and wonderful, opinionated prose. Her recipes are timeless, and all her books wonderful works of reference (and tirelessly researched) as well as beautiful reads." ...|$|E

In their walk they had come exactly to the spot in which Eleanor had been provoked into slapping Mr. Slope's face. <b>Could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> possible <b>that</b> this place <b>was</b> peculiarly unpropitious to her comfort? <b>Could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> possible <b>that</b> she should here have to encounter yet another amorous swain? ...|$|R

2500|$|Stravinsky was not {{the only}} {{composer}} whose modernist tendencies Glazunov disliked. Shostakovich mentioned Glazunov's attacks against the [...] "recherché cacophonists"—the elder composer's term for the newer generation of Western composers, beginning with Debussy. When Franz Schreker's opera Der ferne Klang was staged in Leningrad, Glazunov pronounced the opera [...] "Schreckliche Musik!"—Horrible Music. He also may have wondered occasionally whether he had played a role in spawning musical chaos. Once, while looking at a score of Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, he commented, [...] "It's orchestrated with great taste.... And he knows his work.... <b>Could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Rimsky and I influenced the orchestration of all these contemporary degenerates?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Thus, the Court {{pretended that}} “the {{problems}} of blacks” were “already solved”. Karlan's article, {{published in a}} journal issue dedicated to Lochner v. New York, speculates about the apparent divergence between Hodges and Lochner. She asks: “How <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> freedom of [...] contract [...] was [...] so [...] fundamental [...] a [...] liberty [...] that [...] it [...] was [...] protected against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment but was not a right of free [...] persons [...] that [...] could [...] be [...] protected [...] against [...] private [...] impairment by the Thirteenth?” The Court ruled on Fourteenth Amendment grounds in Lochner that New York could not constitutionally prevent workers from making contracts to work for more than 10 hours per day. Karlan argues that the difference results from the different treatment of formal rights and practical rights—i.e., de jure versus de facto realities.|$|E
2500|$|In its Confirmation exegesis, the Minnehaha United Methodist Church of Minneapolis, Minnesota notes,Metanoia is used {{to refer}} to the change of mind which is brought about in repentance. Repentance is {{necessary}} and valuable because it brings about change of mind or metanoia. This change of mind will make the changed person hate sin and love God. The two terms (repentance and metanoia) are often used interchangeably. [...] "Meta-" [...] is additionally used to imply [...] "beyond" [...] and [...] "outside of." [...] E.g., ...metaphysics as outside the limits of physics. The word metanoia has taken on an in-vogue usage among interfaith dialogues as simply meaning [...] "a change of heart." [...] Though this is close to its Christian theological meaning, perhaps one may conclude that metanoia is [...] "taking one's mind/thoughts beyond and outside of one's habituations." [...] Yes, English translators of the Christian Scriptures fail to find a proper corresponding word for metanoia, so they fall back upon the comfort and ease of the word repent. Yet repent carries with it a negative tone, almost an inhibition caused by guilt; metanoia forces a positive, proactive life-affirming response. When Jesus calls people to [...] "repent," [...] to [...] "metanoia," [...] <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> he means: [...] "Change your thought processes and go beyond your mind's present state of limitations"? Does this not mandate self-assessment and interpersonal acceptance? ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the church}} began to collide and meld with {{cultures}} outside of Utah and the United States, the church began to jettison {{some of the}} parochialisms and prejudices that had become part of Latter-day Saint culture, but were not essential to Mormonism. In 1971, LDS General Authority and scholar Bruce R. McConkie drew parallels between the LDS Church and the New Testament church, who had difficulty embracing the Gentiles within Christianity, and encouraged members {{not to be so}} indoctrinated with social customs that they fail to engage other cultures in Mormonism. Other peoples, he stated, [...] "have a different background than we have, which is of no moment to the Lord.... It is no different to have different social customs than it is to have different languages.... And the Lord knows all languages". In 1987, Boyd K. Packer, another Latter-day Saint Apostle, stated, [...] "We can't move [...] with a 1947 Utah Church! <b>Could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> we are not prepared to take the gospel because we are not prepared to take (and they are not prepared to receive) all of the things we have wrapped up with it as extra baggage?" [...] During and after the Civil Rights Movement, the church faced a critical point in its history, where its previous attitudes toward other cultures and people of color, which had once been shared by much of the white American mainstream, began to appear racist and neocolonial. The church came under intense fire for its stances on blacks and Native Americans issues.|$|E
