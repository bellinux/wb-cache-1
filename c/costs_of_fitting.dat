40|$|The {{locus of}} value {{creation}} and {{innovation in the}} software industry is shifting {{more and more to}} platform ecosystems on which numerous developers create extensions with additional functionalities based on the platforms core architecture. While such complementors may strongly profit from platforms, there are considerable costs. Recent studies therefore examined the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> apps to the specifications of certain platforms; however, these works largely neglect costs arising from the transactional relationship between platform and complementor. In order to shed light on this, our work examines how design choices of platform governance and app architecture impact the emergence of four types of cost-inducing hazards within the transactional context of the ecosystem. By using a configurational approach based on fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (FsQCA), we display complex interactional effects of the causal conditions on complementors’ perception of hazardous environments and thus provide valuable insights for both practice and theory on platform ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the envisaged role for {{domestic}} metering in conserving and reducing the demands placed upon water resources {{should be subject to}} more open and critical debate. Such debate is central to ensuring that related financial resources are targeted in the most effective and efficient way possible. The paper challenges the ability of metering to regulate water demand in an effective, ethical, and equitable manner. In particular, attention is drawn to: the disproportional impact metered charging can have upon lower income groups; the long-term effects of domestic metering being poorly understood; the vacuous bubble within which the economic rationale underpinning metering exists, and how this bubble in turn ignores the reality of daily politics; the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> and then renewing meters; and the inaccessibility of meters being such that they do not readily remind the consumer of their usage levels. It is concluded that policy makers should reflect carefully on the use of metering, particularly when financial resources are subject to competing demands in relation to the need to improve the quality, access, and availability of water resources within society. While it is not suggested that domestic metering is abandoned altogether, it is argued that more careful consideration should be given to when and where households are metered. Instead, it is asserted that the consumers of water services should have their water usage controlled by stealth and lower cost methods. They should also be exposed to increased education in relation to the benefits of using water efficiently. Stealth measures are interpreted as referring to a more assertive role for government regulation in relation to the water efficiency of households, and the development of new water resources...|$|E

The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> HA <b>fitting</b> were examined at two hospitals, Kainuu Central Hospital and Oulu University Hospital. The patients were visited and interviewed {{at their home}} and use of HAs was charted. The benefit of HAs was evaluated using generic and disease-specific questionnaires. The effect of follow-up counselling of HA users on HA use and on the benefit of HAs was studied. The proportion of all HA possessors that are regular users has clearly increased during the past twenty years, {{and the number of}} non-users, in particular, has decreased significantly. Only 5. 3 % of first fitted HAs were not in use in 2001. The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> HA <b>fitting</b> in 2000 were approximately € 900.

The price of a HA accounted for somewhat {{less than half of the}} total hospital costs, and the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the audiology personnel made up roughly a third <b>of</b> the overall <b>costs.</b> Emotional problems <b>of</b> HA users were significant before HA fitting, but six months after HA <b>fitting</b> the number <b>of</b> patients who felt handicapped by their hearing problems had decreased significantly.

40|$|In this document, we {{consider}} coreset and total sensitivity for shape fitting problems. The shape fitting {{problems that are}} of considerable interest include: (1) (j, k) projective clustering problem, and (2) circle fitting problem on the plane. In (j, k) projective clustering, we are given a finite set of points P in d-dimensional Euclidean space, and {{the goal is to}} find a shape, which is a k-tuple j-flats (affine j-subspace), that best fits P. In circle fitting problem, given an input point set P ⊂ ℝ 2, the goal is to find a circle that best fits P. In L 1 -fitting, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> P to a shape F is defined as Σp∈p dist(p, F), where dist(p, F) is the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> assigning P to F, while in F∞-fitting, maxp∈p dist(pF). We focus on L 1 -fitting. A coreset is a compact representation of the input point set. For a shape fitting problem, a coreset for a point set P is a weighted point set, with the property that the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> the coreset to a shape F approximates the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> P to F, for every shape in the family of shapes. Coreset of small (e. g., constant) cardinality is of interest, because one can afford to use off-shelf, perhaps computationally expensive algorithms to solve the geometric optimization problem for the coreset, and a good solution for the coreset is guaranteed to be also good for the original input. Depending on whether the fitting problem is L 1 fitting or L∞ fitting, the coreset is L 1 coreset or L∞ coreset, respectively. One way to obtain small coreset is via non-uniform sampling, using the framework by [30]. Given a point set P, the “importance 2 ̆ 2 of each point p∈P is quantified by its sensitivity σp(p), and the total sensitivity of P is the summation of sensitivities at every point, Σp∈PσP(p). It is shown that if one samples the point set P according to the probability distribution imposed by the sensitivities, one obtains coresets of size roughly O(� 2 P). Total sensitivity <b>of</b> a shape <b>fitting</b> problem quantifies the complexity of the shapes, which is the main object being studied in this thesis. We briefly summarize the main results below. We establish the connection between L∞ coreset and L 1 coreset. In particular, we show that shape fitting problems with small L∞ coreset also have small L 1 coreset. This connection allows us to use existing work on L∞ coreset to obtain small L 1 coreset for the aforementioned shape <b>fitting</b> problems (variants <b>of</b> (j,k) projective clustering, and circle fitting). Consequently, we obtain the first near-linear algorithm for integer (j,k) projective clustering in high dimension. We show that the total sensitivity <b>of</b> shape <b>fitting</b> problem in ℝd depends on the intrinsic dimension of the shapes. For many shape fitting problems, the shapes are low-dimensional: for example, in (j,k) projective clustering, each shape is a union of k j-flats, and each k-tuple of j-flats is contained in a subspace of dimension O(jk). This fact allows us to get a dimension-reduction type result for the (j,k) -projective clustering problems. Specifically, for integer (j,k) projective clustering, the upper bounds of the total sensitivity is improved from O((log n) f(d,j,k)) to O((log n) f(j,k)), where f (j, k) is a function depending on only j, and k, and no longer on the possibly large d. We obtain coreset of size O((log n) 2), using the connection between L∞ coreset and L 1 coreset. We show that circle fitting problem does not admit coreset of size o((log n). In particular, we show a construction of a point set, such that any 1 / 100 -coreset of P has size at least Ω(log n) ...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{interest}} recently in the modeling and simulation of dynamic networks, i. e., networks that change over time. One promising model is the separable temporal exponential-family random graph model (ERGM) of Krivitsky and Handcock, which treats the formation and dissolution of ties in parallel at each time step as independent ERGMs. However, the computational <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> these models can be substantial, particularly for large, sparse networks. Fitting cross-sectional models for observations of a network at a single point in time, while still a non-negligible computational burden, is much easier. This paper examines model fitting when the available data consist of independent measures of cross-sectional network structure and the duration of relationships under the assumption of stationarity. We introduce a simple approximation to the dynamic parameters for sparse networks with relationships of moderate or long duration and show that the approximation method works best in precisely those cases where parameter estimation is most likely to fail—networks with very little change at each time step. We consider a variety of cases: Bernoulli formation and dissolution of ties, independent-tie formation and Bernoulli dissolution, independent-tie formation and dissolution, and dependent-tie formation models...|$|R

However, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> an accurate response surface increases exponentially {{as the number}} of model inputs increases, which leaves response surface construction intractable for high-dimensional, nonlinear models. We describe ridge approximation for fitting response surfaces in several variables. A ridge function is constant along several directions in its domain, so fitting occurs on the coordinates of a low-dimensional subspace of the input space. We review essential theory for ridge approximation [...] -e. g., the best mean-squared approximation and an optimal low-dimensional subspace [...] -and we prove that the gradient-based active subspace is near-stationary for the least-squares problem that defines an optimal subspace. Motivated by the theory, we propose a computational heuristic that uses an estimated active subspace as an initial guess for a ridge approximation fitting problem. We show a simple example where the heuristic fails, which reveals a type of function for which the proposed approach is inappropriate. We then propose a simple alternating heuristic for fitting a ridge function, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the active subspace initial guess applied to an airfoil model of drag as a function of its 18 shape parameters...|$|R
40|$|Robotic milking affects {{factors that}} {{determine}} the barn layout, such as cow behaviour, farm routine, feeding procedure and management practices. As {{there is hardly}} any experience with robotic barns, and each farmer has his own management attitude, depending on his personality and local conditions; the optimal layout, therefore, is specific to each case. A new integrated design approach is needed, in order to overcome lack of experience {{and to be able}} to design the optimal layout for the robotic milking barn suitable for any farmer or site. A behaviour-based simulation model, which enables a designer to optimize facility allocation in a barn, has been developed as a design tool. The proposed approach overcomes difficulties of characterizing robotic milking barn design. Simulation experiments allow equipment and layouts to be evaluated jointly, an initial design can be fine-tuned to produce a balanced system (an 'optimal layout'), specific to the farm in question, within a reasonable time. Executing the suggested methodology, step by step, an optimal robotic milking barn has been designed, meeting both economic and animal welfare needs. If a simulation study had not been performed and if a bottleneck in the cow-traffic had been discovered after installation, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> retrospectively extra capacity could have been significant.

40|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} living cells {{is the ability to}} respond dynamically to external stimuli while maintaining homeostasis under resting conditions. Capturing both of these features in a single kinetic model is difficult because the model must be able to reproduce both behaviors using the same set of molecular components. Here, we show how combining small, well-defined steady-state networks provides an efficient means of constructing large-scale kinetic models that exhibit realistic resting and dynamic behaviors. By requiring each kinetic module to be homeostatic (at steady state under resting conditions), the method proceeds by (i) computing steady-state solutions to a system of ordinary differential equations for each module, (ii) applying principal component analysis to each set of solutions to capture the steady-state solution space of each module network, and (iii) combining optimal search directions from all modules to form a global steady-state space that is searched for accurate simulation of the time-dependent behavior of the whole system upon perturbation. Importantly, this stepwise approach retains the nonlinear rate expressions that govern each reaction in the system and enforces constraints on the range of allowable concentration states for the full-scale model. These constraints not only reduce the computational <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> experimental time-series data but can also provide insight into limitations on system concentrations and architecture. To demonstrate application of the method, we show how small kinetic perturbations in a modular model of platelet P 2 Y 1 signaling can cause widespread compensatory effects on cellular resting states...|$|R
