2500|$|Working {{the evening}} or night shift, or working at home, makes DSPD {{less of an}} {{obstacle}} for some. Many of these people do not describe their pattern as a [...] "disorder". Some DSPD individuals nap, even taking 4–5 hours of sleep {{in the morning and}} 4–5 in the evening. DSPD-friendly careers can include security work, the entertainment industry, hospitality work in restaurants, theaters, hotels or bars, call <b>center</b> <b>work,</b> manufacturing, emergency medicine, commercial cleaning, taxi or truck driving, the media, and freelance writing, translation, IT work, or medical transcription. [...] Some other careers that have an emphasis on early morning work hours, such as bakers, coffee baristas, pilots and flight crews, teachers, mail carriers, waste collection, and farming, can be particularly difficult for people who naturally sleep later than is typical. [...] Some careers, such as over-the-road truck drivers, firefighters, law enforcement, nursing, can be suitable for both people with delayed sleep phase syndrome and people with the opposite condition, advanced sleep phase disorder, as these workers are needed both very {{early in the morning and}} also late at night.|$|E
