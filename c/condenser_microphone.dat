25|$|An {{electret}} microphone {{is a type}} of <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone,</b> which eliminates the need for a power supply by using a permanently charged material. Electret materials have been known since the 1920s, and were proposed as <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone</b> elements several times, but were considered impractical until the foil electret type was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1962 by Jim West, using a thin metallized Teflon foil. This became the most common type, used in many applications from high-quality recording and lavalier use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones.|$|E
25|$|A <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone,</b> {{also called}} a {{capacitor}} microphone or electrostatic microphone, is a microphone containing a capacitor that has two plates with a voltage between them. In the <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone,</b> {{one of these}} plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing {{the distance between the}} two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power. The <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone</b> was invented in 1916 at Bell Laboratories by Edward Christopher 'E.C.' Wente, which became possible {{with the advent of the}} vacuum tube (valve) to act as an amplifier of the low signal output.|$|E

25|$|NASA Langley has {{designed}} and developed an infrasonic detection {{system that can}} be used to make useful infrasound measurements at a location where it was not possible previously. The system comprises an electret <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone</b> PCB Model 377M06, having a 3-inch membrane diameter, and a small, compact windscreen. Electret-based technology offers the lowest possible background noise, because Johnson noise generated in the supporting electronics (preamplifier) is minimized.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Shure and {{engineer}} Ralph Glover {{began development}} of the first Shure microphone, and the following year, the Model 33N Two-Button Carbon Microphone was introduced, making Shure one of only four microphone manufacturers in the U.S. Shure's first <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone,</b> crystal microphone, and microphone suspension support system (for which they received their first patent) were all introduced that same decade. In 1939, Shure introduced the Model 55 Unidyne Microphone, which {{went on to become}} one of the world's most recognized microphones.|$|E
25|$|Shure {{first began}} {{manufacturing}} their own products in 1932 {{with the introduction}} of the 33N two-button carbon microphone. The Model 40D, Shure's first <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone,</b> was introduced the next year, and the first of a line of crystal microphone, the Model 70, was introduced in 1935. With the introduction of the 55 Unidyne microphone in 1939, the company's offerings included carbon, condenser, crystal, and dynamic microphones. Wired and wireless microphones together represent the largest category of Shure's overall business. Shure currently produces numerous series of microphones for various applications, including the SM, Beta, KSM, and PG series, as well as specialty consumer microphones, Microflex, and Easyflex (conferencing systems for commercially installed applications).|$|E
25|$|Only {{the best}} {{electret}} microphones rival good DC-polarized units {{in terms of}} noise level and quality; electret microphones lend themselves to inexpensive mass-production, while inherently expensive non-electret <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones</b> are made to higher quality.|$|R
50|$|Schalltechnik Dr.-Ing. Schoeps GmbH, {{known as}} Schoeps, is a German {{manufacturer}} of professional studio <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones</b> for recording and broadcast. The privately owned company {{is based in}} Karlsruhe, south-west Germany, and was founded in 1948.|$|R
5000|$|Phantom power {{supplies}} are often built into mixing consoles, microphone preamplifiers and similar equipment. In addition to powering the circuitry of a <b>microphone,</b> traditional <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones</b> also use phantom power for polarizing the microphone's transducer element.|$|R
25|$|Electric {{recording}} {{which developed}} {{during the time that}} early radio was becoming popular (1925) benefited from the microphones and amplifiers used in radio studios. The early electric recordings were reminiscent tonally of acoustic recordings, except there was more recorded bass and treble as well as delicate sounds and overtones cut on the records. This was in spite of some carbon microphones used, which had resonances that colored the recorded tone. The double button carbon microphone with stretched diaphragm was a marked improvement. Alternatively, the Wente style <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone</b> used with the Western Electric licensed recording method had a brilliant midrange and was prone to overloading from sibilants in speech, but generally it gave more accurate reproduction than carbon microphones.|$|E
500|$|RCA's Studio B had {{recently}} been equipped with a new three-track recorder. To further improve the recording of Presley's voice, Porter had Telefunken U-47 microphones placed in the studio. The U-47 was the first <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone</b> that could switch between omnidirectional and cardioid patterns. The microphone {{could be used for}} vocals, instruments and full area coverage. The first song recorded was Otis Blackwell's [...] "Make Me Know It", which was mastered in nineteen takes. [...] "Soldier Boy" [...] was later recorded in fifteen takes, followed by the non-album cuts [...] "Stuck on You" [...] and [...] "Fame and Fortune". The last song recorded during the March session was a non-album cut, [...] "A Mess of Blues". A new session was arranged for April. Presley then left for Miami, Florida, where he taped [...]|$|E
500|$|Motolla {{selected}} Cory Rooney as {{the executive}} producer of Irresistible. Most of the recording and mixing works were done at Sony Music Studios, New York City and was completed over a time span of eight months. Rooney also coordinated the recording process while Robert Williams miked the vocals. Sony's C-800G Tube <b>Condenser</b> <b>Microphone,</b> equipped with a dual large diaphragm and electronically selectable pick-up pattern, was used to record the vocals. In an interview with Sony's SoundByte magazine in 2002, Williams said of his choice: [...] "In the studio, it comes down to what you hear. [...] She has such a big range, from a whisper to really belting it out, and you need a microphone that can handle the range without distortion." [...] He had used the microphone for Simpson's first album and felt that it suited her well. He also noted that on ballads, [...] "the S's and wet sounds of lips" [...] are important to the texture of the song. According to him, as Simpson's vocals tended to be [...] "bright", he edited the lower ends of her voice to equalize the track.|$|E
25|$|As many mixers are {{equipped}} with phantom power in order to enable the use of <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones,</b> care should be taken when using <b>condenser</b> and ribbon <b>microphones</b> at the same time. If the ribbon microphone is improperly wired, which is not unheard of with older microphones, this capacity can damage some ribbon elements; however, improvements in designs and materials have made those concerns largely inconsequential in modern ribbon microphones.|$|R
50|$|Although taping {{is usually}} done with microphones, often bands will allow {{plugging}} into the soundboard for a direct patch. Taping setups are generally portable, operating on high quality <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones,</b> phantom power, a microphone preamplifier and a recording device {{all of which}} are battery powered.|$|R
25|$|Decca in Britain {{utilised}} high-quality {{wide range}} <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones</b> for the Full Frequency Range Recording (FFRR) system c. 1949. Wax mastering {{was employed to}} produce Decca/London LPs. This created considerable interest in the United States, and served to raise the customer's overall expectations of quality in microgroove records.|$|R
2500|$|In 1916, E.C. Wente of Western Electric {{developed}} the next breakthrough {{with the first}} <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone.</b> In 1923, the first practical moving coil microphone was built. [...] "The Marconi Skykes" [...] or [...] "magnetophon", developed by Captain H. J. Round, was the standard for BBC studios in London. This was improved in 1930 by Alan Blumlein and Herbert Holman who released the HB1A and was the best standard of the day.|$|E
2500|$|Acoustic {{amplifiers}} {{produce an}} uncolored, [...] "acoustic" [...] sound when used with acoustic instruments with built-in transducer pickups or microphones. The amplifiers often {{come with a}} simple mixer, so that the signals from a pickup and <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone</b> can be blended. Since the early 2000s, {{it has become increasingly}} common for acoustic amplifiers to provide a range of digital effects, such as reverb and compression. As well, these amplifiers often contain feedback-suppressing devices, such as notch filters or parametric equalizers.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{different}} types of microphone are in use, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a sound wave to an electrical signal. [...] The most common are the dynamic microphone, which uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone,</b> which uses the vibrating diaphragm as a capacitor plate, and the piezoelectric microphone, which uses a crystal of piezoelectric material. [...] Microphones typically need {{to be connected to}} a preamplifier before the signal can be recorded or reproduced.|$|E
50|$|As a {{practical}} matter, phantom powering allows the same two-conductor shielded cables {{to be used}} for both dynamic <b>microphones</b> and <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones,</b> while being harmless to balanced microphones that aren't designed to consume it, since the circuit balance prevents any substantial DC from flowing through the output circuit of those microphones.|$|R
25|$|The first {{cassette}} machines (e.g. the Philips EL 3300, {{introduced in}} August 1963) were simple mono-record and -playback units. Early machines required attaching an external dynamic microphone. Most units from the 1980s onwards also incorporated built-in <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones,</b> which have extended high-frequency response, {{but may also}} pick up noises from the recorder motor.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} {{balanced}} lines is {{the connection of}} microphones to a mixer in professional systems. Classically, both dynamic and <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones</b> used transformers to provide a differential-mode signal. While transformers are still used in {{the large majority of}} modern dynamic <b>microphones,</b> more recent <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones</b> are more likely to use electronic drive circuitry. Each leg, irrespective of any signal, should have an identical impedance to ground. Pair cable (or a pair-derivative such as star quad) is used to maintain the balanced impedances and close twisting of the cores ensures that any interference is common to both conductors. Providing that the receiving end (usually a mixing console) does not disturb the line balance, and is able to ignore common-mode (noise) signals, and can extract differential ones, then the system will have excellent immunity to induced interference.|$|R
2500|$|The MEMS (MicroElectrical-Mechanical System) {{microphone}} is {{also called}} a microphone chip or silicon microphone. A pressure-sensitive diaphragm is etched {{directly into a}} silicon wafer by MEMS processing techniques, and is usually accompanied with integrated preamplifier. Most MEMS microphones are variants of the <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone</b> design. Digital MEMS microphones have built in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits on the same CMOS chip making the chip a digital microphone and so more readily integrated with modern digital products. Major manufacturers producing MEMS silicon microphones are Wolfson Microelectronics (WM7xxx) now Cirrus Logic, InvenSense (product line sold by Analog Devices [...] ), Akustica (AKU200x), Infineon (SMM310 product), Knowles Electronics, Memstech (MSMx), NXP Semiconductors (division bought by Knowles [...] ), Sonion MEMS, Vesper, AAC Acoustic Technologies, and Omron.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone,</b> invented at Western Electric in 1916 by E. C. Wente, is {{also called}} a {{capacitor}} microphone or electrostatic microphone—capacitors were historically called condensers. Here, the diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and the vibrations produce {{changes in the}} distance between the plates. There are two types, depending on the method of extracting the audio signal from the transducer: DC-biased microphones, and radio frequency (RF) or high frequency (HF) condenser microphones. With a DC-biased microphone, the plates are biased with a fixed charge (Q). The voltage maintained across the capacitor plates changes with the vibrations in the air, according to the capacitance equation (C = [...] ), where Q = charge in coulombs, C = capacitance in farads and V = potential difference in volts. [...] The capacitance of the plates is inversely proportional to {{the distance between the}}m for a parallel-plate capacitor. The assembly of fixed and movable plates is called an [...] "element" [...] or [...] "capsule".|$|E
5000|$|Rupert Neve {{partnered with}} sE {{to design a}} [...] "Rupert Neve Signature Series" [...] of microphones. As of April 2015, three models have been introduced: the RNR1 active ribbon microphone, the RN17 small-diaphragm <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone,</b> and the RNT large-diaphragm vacuum tube <b>condenser</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tape {{recording}} with <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones</b> {{became a}} long used {{standard operating procedure}} in mastering lacquer–aluminium cuts. This improved the overall pickup of high quality sound and enabled tape editing. Over the years there were variations {{in the kinds of}} tape recorders used, such as the width and number of tracks employed, including 35mm magnetic film technology.|$|R
50|$|Electronic formats used {{by journalists}} have {{included}} DAT, MiniDisc, CD and DVD. Minidisc has digital indexing and is re-recordable, reusable medium; while DAT has SMPTE timecode and other synchronization features. In recent years, {{more and more}} journalists have used smartphones or iPod-like devices for recording short interviews. The other alternative is using small field recorders with two <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The rugged {{elements}} of moving-coil microphones {{can have a}} dynamic range of up to 140 dB (at increased distortion), while <b>condenser</b> <b>microphones</b> are limited by the overloading of their associated electronic circuitry. Practical considerations of acceptable distortion levels in microphones combined with typical practices in a recording studio result in a useful operating range of 125 dB.|$|R
