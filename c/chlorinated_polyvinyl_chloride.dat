Many of the workers had been exposed to vinyl chloride, as well as to <b>chlorinated</b> solvents, <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>chloride)</b> (PVC) dust, acrylates and acrylonitrile. To evaluate the association between lung cancer and occupational chemical exposures, detailed work histories for each cohort member were combined with exposure ratings for each of 19 chemicals for each job for each calendar year since 1942. A serially additive expected dose model was then constructed which compared the doses of the chemicals observed for the lung cancer cases to the doses expected based on subcohorts without lung cancer individually matched to the cases. PVC dust appeared to be the most likely etiologic agent (p = 0. 037). Time trends of PVC dust exposure indicated a potential latent period of 5 - 16 years before death...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{behaviour}} of blends of <b>chlorinated</b> polyethylene, <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> (PVC) and <b>chlorinated</b> PVC with random copolymers of caprolactone and caprolactam {{has been}} investigated and the results correlated with a binary interaction model. The known miscibility of polycaprolactone i the chlorinated polymers is not compromised until a relatively high lactam content in the copolymer isattained. The incorporation of segmental interaction parameters, derived from separate studies involving polyamides, polyesters and their copolymers, has provided {{an estimate of the}} unknown parameters. Using only six parameters to account for experimental data has provided moderate success; however, {{it is clear that the}} representation of the chlorinated polymers, as pure copolymers of methylene (-CH 2 -) and chlorine containing (-CHC 1) segments, i not sufficient to describe those blends. The reasons for this have been discussed in terms of the influence of configuration of species upon segmental interactions.

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need for green {{technologies}} to remove halogens from halogenated polymers {{at the end of}} their lifetime. Ionic liquids (ILs) were used to dehydrochlorinate and/or dissolve the <b>chlorinated</b> polymers <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>chloride)</b> (PVC) and <b>chlorinated</b> polyethylene (CPE). The dehydrochlorination activity of an IL depends mainly on its anion and is related to the high hydrogen-bond-accepting ability (beta value) of the anion. Different phosphonium ILs successfully dissolve and dehydrochlorinate PVC and CPE at temperatures from 808 C. PVC is dehydrochlorinated up to 98 % after 60 min in tetrabutylphosphonium chloride ([P 4444][Cl]) at 180 8 C. PVC pieces stabilized by calcium stearate (4 mm 3) are dehydrochlorinated more slowly; conversions of 85 and 96 % are reached after 1 and 8 h, respectively. Smaller pieces are dehydrochlorinated faster. High loadings, for example, 0. 3 g stabilized PVC in 0. 5 g IL, can be applied with only a minor loss of conversion. [P 4444][Cl] proved to be stable during several consecutive reactions; after each run more than 99 % of the IL can be recovered. The structure of the dehydrochlorinated PVC was studied by 13 C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning NMR and FTIR spectroscopy; the removal of Cl and the formation of double bonds were confirmed. Carefully dehydrochlorinated CPE was processed further by acyclic diene metathesis depolymerization with ethylene and the Hoveyda–Grubbs second-generation catalyst to yield alpha,gamma-dienes such as 1, 5 -hexadiene and 1, 6 -heptadiene. status: publishe...|$|R

There are two stages of degradation in these four polymers. The first stage is the loss of hydrogen chloride, and is complete around 250 °C. This first step occurs at lower temperatures for the polymers containing more chlorine (<b>chlorinated</b> <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> chlorinated rubber, and polyvinylidene chloride), implying that these chloride groupings are less stable than in polyvinyl chloride.|$|E

40|$|In {{structurally}} participating formworks, a new forming {{technique for}} reinforced concrete, {{referred to as}} stay-in-place formwork has recently emerged as a viable technique. This permanent new formwork system simplifies the construction process and reduces construction time. Two materials that are well-suited for this technique are fiber reinforced polymer and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride.</b> This research presents a non-linear and three-dimensional finite element model for reinforced concrete walls with and without <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork. There is a variety of commercial programs for three-dimensional finite element modelling, but they lack the ability to model a complex composite material such as reinforced concrete encased in a <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place forming system. For its high performance and extensive range of material modelling capabilities, the ABAQUS finite element package {{was used in the}} current study. Concrete was modelled using a concrete damage plasticity model, and steel bars were modelled using an elastic and perfectly plastic material. Perfect bond was assumed between concrete and steel. The <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork was modelled using an elasto-plastic material. As with the concrete and steel, perfect bond was assumed between the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> panels and the concrete. Finite element results were validated using experimental results reported by Scott (2014). It was observed from the comparison that the proposed non-linear fine element model is capable of predicting the load capacity for the reinforced concrete walls with and without the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork. Predicted yield loads were in good agreement with the experimental data, with an average error of 6 % for control walls, 7 % for the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> encased reinforced concrete walls with flat panels, and 3 % for the walls encased with hollow panels. In addition, finite element ultimate (peak) loads showed good correlation with the experimental data. The average error for the control, flat panel and hollow panel encased walls were 3 %, 3 % and 13 %, respectively. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of concrete compressive strength, thickness of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork, and the strength of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> used in stay-in-place formworks. It was observed that the concrete compressive strength has a significant effect on the flexural strength of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> encased reinforced concrete walls. As expected, the thickness and strength of the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> used have a proportional effect on the behaviour of the encased reinforced concrete walls...|$|R

Cyclic olefin copolymer is shown to have properties which result in fewer environmental concerns and also can provide the added benefit of an improved barrier to moisture permeation when compared to <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> film. This paper documents a summary of the data on both sides of the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> environmental debate. It also documents cyclic olefin copolymer 2 ̆ 7 s mechanical properties, small and large scale manufacturing data, and potential future developments which will improve the manufacturing of many new film opportunities for cyclic olefin copolymer as well as reduce the manufacturing costs.
