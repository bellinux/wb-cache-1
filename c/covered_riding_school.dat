50|$|Hovingham {{has been}} home to the Worsley family since 1563 and was the {{childhood}} home of the Duchess of Kent. The sixth Thomas Worsley (1710-1778) designed and built the current Hovingham Hall.

50|$|The barracks {{were opened}} on Saturday 7 December 1907 by Laurence Oliphant Commander-in-Chief of Northern Command. The West York Royal Engineers {{ownership}} of the new building was brief, as the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 had been passed by Parliament {{earlier in the year}} and came into effect on 1 April 1908. Under the new act all volunteer forces would become part of the new Territorial Army and their drill halls would be taken over by the War Office. The War Office paid {{only a fraction of the}} true value of the barracks when they took it over in 1908. In 1910 a <b>covered</b> <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> was constructed at the barracks, again financed by the men of the corps.|$|E

5000|$|The Royal Andalusian <b>School</b> is a <b>riding</b> <b>school</b> {{comparable}} to the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> in Vienna, Austria. Like the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School,</b> the Royal Andalusian School {{is well known for}} its [...] "dancing stallions" [...] shows for the tourists.

5|$|The world-famous Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> uses {{highly trained}} Lipizzan stallions in public {{performances}} that demonstrate classical dressage movements and training. In 1572 the first Spanish Riding Hall was built, during the Austrian Empire, {{and is the}} oldest {{of its kind in}} the world. The Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School,</b> though located in Vienna, Austria, takes its name from the original Spanish heritage of its horses. In 1729 Charles VI commissioned the building of the Winter <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> in Vienna and in 1735, the building was completed that remains the home of the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> today.|$|R
50|$|The Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> in Vienna, {{as well as}} the Cadre Noir in Saumur, still {{practice}} and teach the Haute Ecole. The Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> exclusively uses Lipizzan stallions for their work.|$|R

40|$|Swedish <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> are {{characterized}} by a traditional stable culture that originated in army practices. The riding instructors reinforce these military traditions. Nevertheless, riding instructors and <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> cannot be isolated and unaffected by society. This thesis identifies and highlights perceptions of the riding instructor’s role and the historical and contemporary conditions that govern and affect this role. Constructions of perceptions and experiences have been central. The selection of the theoretical framework and methodology were to emerge during the process, and by using different research methods the ambition was to strengthen reliability and increase quality. The first study examines how the Swedish National Equestrian Centre at Strömsholm (SNECS) trains riding instructors {{with a focus on}} content and the educational environment to understand the educational culture that exists at Swedish <b>riding</b> <b>schools.</b> The second study explored how ten riding instructors perceive and experience their professional role. The third study explored, through focus group interviews, young riders’ perception of the <b>riding</b> <b>school.</b> This thesis has contributed to {{a deeper understanding of the}} role of the riding instructor. The result explains why <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> are still characterized by military norms. The contemporary perspective highlighted how the riding instructors perceived a change based on economic challenges and how these challenges affected their way of teaching. Young rider's perceptions of <b>riding</b> <b>school</b> showed how they develop social skills by participating in the <b>riding</b> <b>school’s</b> community of practice. In conclusion, these results can help strengthen the riding instructor profession and develop the <b>riding</b> <b>school</b> as a centre of knowledge and resources. To encourage further development, the profession should consider current stable culture, how learning takes place in the <b>riding</b> <b>school,</b> and the needs for further education...|$|R
50|$|The Hollandsche Manege in Amsterdam is {{the oldest}} <b>riding</b> <b>school</b> in the Netherlands, dating back to 1744.

50|$|In 1919, Lindenbauer {{was posted}} to a {{position}} at the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School.</b> He was then promoted to Chief Rider (Oberbereiter) in 1926. In that position, he played a substantial role in {{the preservation of the}} Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> in the difficult interwar period as Central Europe changed from a monarchy to a republic. Although he was a quiet and introverted individual, {{he was one of the}} mainstays of the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> in his time.|$|R
500|$|Although the Piber Stud trains mares {{for driving}} and under saddle, the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> {{exclusively}} uses stallions in its performances. [...] Worldwide, the Lipizzan today competes in dressage and driving, {{as well as}} retaining their classic position at the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> {{is located}} between Michaelerplatz and Josefsplatz inside the Hofburg in central Vienna. Performances {{take place in}} the Winter <b>Riding</b> <b>School,</b> built between 1729-1735. The Winter <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> is a sunlight- flooded hall, mainly white with some beige and light grey, with a {{portrait}} of Emperor Charles VI above the royal box and opposite the entrance (to which the riders always salute before they ride), which measures 55 by 18 m and is 17 m in height.|$|R
40|$|There {{are around}} 600 <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> in Sweden {{and the horse}} manure must be managed in some way. To see {{the extent to which}} the {{handling}} of horse manure can be regarded as a problem both for the environment and for the <b>riding</b> <b>school</b> the purpose of this study has been to investigate how <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> handle horse manure that is produced, the factors that influence the choice of handling option, and the businesses’ satisfaction with the chosen handling option. A mixed design using both quantitative and qualitative methods was used in order to answer the research questions. Data was collected through interviews and the content of the interviews was subject to analysis and interpretation. Most <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> argued that the selection of handling options was either based on environmental/recycling aspects, or economic aspects. However, the availability of spreading areas was found to be the underlying factor that determined the handling of horse manure. The results revealed that about half of the <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> did not have access to their own spreading areas. These <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> were mainly large businesses located in urban areas. They showed a tendency to be dissatisfied with handing over horse manure to farmers and/or entrepreneurs, and were interested in alternative solutions. There is potential for <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> to take advantage of the opportunity to transform manure into a renewable resource. By doing so, they can dispose of horse manure and at the same time get energy to their own benefit...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to examine how two <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> work with their safety. Riding {{is one of the}} most popular sports in Sweden but also very dangerous. Sweden has a lot of <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> and almost half a million that rides. Therefore it’s very {{important}} that riding, and especially <b>riding</b> at <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> has the highest level of safety with regards to harmful events. The purpose leads to the overarching research question for this essay, which is: How does the Safety work look at two <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> in the area of Karlstad? Out of this question, seven specified research questions have been constructed. They are: 1. Do the pupils get education and informed about the safety? 2. Is there one staff educated in safety questions and that have the main responsibility for the safety? 3. Do the parents consider that they get enough information about the safety? 4. Is there demands on reporting if there has been an accident and for insurance purpose? 5. Is there access to safety equipments (helmet and vest) and does the pupil use them? 6. Have the <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> taken part in Konsumentverkets work on safety? 7. Do the <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> use Ridsportförbundets safety directives? The conclusion is that both Kil and Färjestad have a good safety work at their <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> overall. There are although some deficiencies when it comes to the information about safety to parents and pupils...|$|R
