5|$|Adult coconut crabs have {{no known}} predators {{apart from other}} coconut crabs and humans. Its large size {{and the quality of}} its meat means that the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> is {{extensively}} hunted and is very rare on islands with a human population. The <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> itself is not innately poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango Cerbera manghas by the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> may make the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> toxic due to the presence of cardiac cardenolides.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the branchiostegal lung, the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> has an additional rudimentary set of gills. Although these gills are comparable in number to aquatic species from the families Paguridae and the Diogenidae, they are reduced in size and have comparatively less surface area.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{of coconut}} crabs {{consists}} primarily of fleshy fruits (particularly Ochrosia ackeringae, Arenga listeri, Pandanus elatus, P. christmatensis); nuts (Aleurites moluccanus), drupes (Cocos nucifera) and seeds (Annona reticulata); and the pith of fallen trees. However, {{as they are}} omnivores, they will consume other organic materials such as tortoise hatchlings and dead animals. They have been observed to prey upon crabs like Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax hirtipes, as well as scavenge on the carcasses of other coconut crabs. During a tagging experiment, one <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> was observed killing and eating a Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans). In 2016, a large <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> was observed climbing a tree in order to disable and consume a red-footed booby on the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E
30|$|The {{level of}} {{cultural}} taboo associated with <b>coconut</b> <b>crabs</b> is relatively low in comparison {{than those of}} the Elegant Scops owls and Birdwing butterflies; however, the level of impact of tourism activities on <b>coconut</b> <b>crabs</b> is higher than the impact on either of the other two species. The impact of tourism activities on <b>coconut</b> <b>crabs</b> primarily comes from road construction and roadkill. The construction and widening of the around-the-island highway cut and removed many Pandanus trees, which greatly decreased the food source of the <b>coconut</b> <b>crabs.</b> Road construction also separates the habitats of the <b>coconut</b> <b>crabs,</b> causing habitat fragmentation. Cement guardrails along the road significantly hinder the catadromous migration of the <b>coconut</b> <b>crabs</b> during breeding seasons, which worsens the future survival problems of the <b>coconut</b> <b>crabs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{chickens}} {{were kept}} {{on the island and}} locals produced their own pickled eggs and Chinese century eggs. Dishes that made use of the chickens themselves were popular along with dishes that included local <b>Coconut</b> <b>crabs.</b> However, <b>Coconut</b> <b>crabs</b> are now a protected species.|$|R
50|$|Crabs include hermit <b>crabs,</b> and <b>coconut</b> <b>crabs.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> is {{terrestrial}} {{and uses}} structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air. They cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they possess a rudimentary set of gills. They can breathe {{on land and}} hold their breath underwater. The branchiostegal lungs {{are seen as a}} developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.|$|E
5|$|The <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The smells of rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. Research has shown that the olfactory system in the coconut crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E
5|$|Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean has {{the largest}} and densest {{population}} of coconut crabs in the world, although it is outnumbered there by more than 50 times by the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. Other Indian Ocean populations exist on the Seychelles, including Aldabra and Cosmoledo, but the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> is extinct on the central islands. Coconut crabs occur on several of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. They occur {{on most of the}} islands, and the northern atolls, of the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E

30|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>coconut</b> <b>crabs</b> is primarily on tropical islands from the Eastern Indian Ocean to the Western Pacific Ocean, including islands such as Fiji, Nauru, Okinawa of Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan. IUCN listed <b>coconut</b> <b>crabs</b> as endangered {{species in the}} Red list categories in 1996. Taiwan also announced in 1996 that they are protected crustaceans according to the “Wildlife Conservation Act”.|$|R

5|$|First sighted by Europeans in 1606, {{claimed by}} the United Kingdom in 1868, {{and part of the}} Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's {{independence}} in 1979, Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and {{is considered one of the}} world's most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|Coconut crabs {{live in the}} Indian Ocean and {{the central}} Pacific Ocean, with a {{distribution}} that closely matches that of the coconut palm. The western limit {{of the range of}} B. latro is Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania, while the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn mark the northern and southern limits, respectively, with very few population in the subtropics, such as the Ryukyu Islands. There is evidence that the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> once lived on the mainlands of Australia and Madagascar and on the island of Mauritius, but it no longer occurs in any of these places. As they cannot swim as adults, coconut crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae.|$|E
5|$|The <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> is {{the only}} species of the genus Birgus, and {{is related to the}} {{terrestrial}} hermit crabs of the genus Coenobita. It shows a number of adaptations to life on land. Like hermit crabs, juvenile coconut crabs use empty gastropod shells for protection, but the adults develop a tough exoskeleton on their abdomen and stop carrying a shell. Coconut crabs have organs known as branchiostegal lungs, which are used instead of the vestigial gills for breathing and they will drown if immersed in water for long. They have an acute sense of smell, which has developed convergently with that of insects, and which they use to find potential food sources.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E
5|$|Coconut crabs mate {{frequently}} and quickly {{on dry land}} in the period from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Male coconut crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the abdomen of the female; the abdomen opens {{at the base of}} the third pereiopods, and fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of the abdomen as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass. The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. Shortly thereafter, the female lays her eggs and glues them to the underside of her abdomen, carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> releases the eggs into the ocean. This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high tide. The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{float in}} the pelagic zone of the ocean with other {{plankton}} {{for three to four}} weeks, during which a large number of them are eaten by predators. The larvae pass through three to five zoea stages before moulting into the post-larval glaucothoe stage; this process takes from 25 to 33 days. Upon reaching the glaucothoe stage of development, they settle to the bottom, find and wear a suitably sized gastropod shell, and migrate to the shoreline with other terrestrial hermit crabs. At that time, they sometimes visit dry land. Afterwards, they leave the ocean permanently and lose the ability to breathe in water. As with all hermit crabs, they change their shells as they grow. Young coconut crabs that cannot find a seashell of the right size often use broken coconut pieces. When they outgrow their shells, they develop a hardened abdomen. The <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> reaches sexual maturity around five years after hatching. They reach their maximum size only after 40 to 60 years.|$|E

50|$|Makatea Island forms a commune associée of Rangiroa commune with 93 {{inhabitants}} (2002 census). The main {{village is}} called Moumu. The islanders live off agriculture, culture of copra, some fishing {{and the trade}} of <b>coconut</b> <b>crabs.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{body of the}} <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> is, {{like that}} of all decapods, divided into a front section (cephalothorax), which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair of legs has large chelae (claws), with the left being larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, {{powerful}} walking legs with pointed tips, which allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end, allowing young coconut crabs to grip {{the inside of a}} shell or coconut husk to carry for protection; adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. There is some difference in color between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.|$|E

Tuvaluans also eat seafood, including <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> and fish from the lagoon and ocean. A traditional food source is seabirds (taketake or black noddy and akiaki or white tern), with pork being eaten mostly at fateles (or parties with dancing to celebrate events).|$|E

500|$|The pincers of the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> are {{powerful}} enough to cause noticeable pain to a human; furthermore, the <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> will often keep its hold for extended periods of time. Thomas Hale Streets reports a trick used by Micronesians of the Line Islands to get a <b>coconut</b> <b>crab</b> to loosen its grip: [...] "It may be interesting to know that in such a dilemma a gentle titillation of the under soft {{parts of the body}} with any light material will cause the crab to loosen its hold." ...|$|E
