2500|$|The {{constitutional}} convention took up {{the compromise}} amendment approved in 2004. It failed on a vote of 157-39 on September 14, after many moderate legislators who had initially supported it refused to and most legislators opposed to same-sex marriage abandoned its <b>compromise</b> <b>language.</b> State Senator Brian Lees, a Republican who co-sponsored the amendment in the previous convention, explained why he withdrew his support: [...] "Gay marriage has begun, and life has not changed for {{the citizens of the}} commonwealth, with the exception of those who can now marry. This amendment which was an appropriate measure or compromise a year ago, is no longer, I feel, a compromise today." [...] Opponents turned instead to an alternative method of amending the constitution that they thought would allow them to present an uncompromising ban on same-sex marriage to the voters. This method would require the collection of thousands of signatures on petitions but would need the support of only a quarter of the legislators to become a referendum.

Treatment of attention, working memory and executive control may elicit reading comprehension improvements in PWA, particularly those with mild reading problems. This study evaluated the efficacy of Attention Process Training- 3 (APT- 3), an intervention combining direct attention training and metacognitive facilitation, for improving reading comprehension in individuals with mild aphasia and concomitant reading comprehension difficulties. A multiple-baseline design across six participants was used to evaluate treatment effects. The primary outcome measure was a maze reading task. Pre- and post-treatment evaluation included cognitive and reading measures. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to evaluate participant-perceived changes in cognition and reading. Visual inspection of graphed maze reading performance data indicated a basic effect between APT- 3 and improved maze reading for three of the six participants. Quantitative analyses, using Tau-U, corroborated findings identified through visual analysis. The results suggest that the use of APT- 3 has the potential to improve reading in PWA but that it may be more efficacious under certain conditions. Treatment and participant variables, including intensity of treatment and metacognitive strategy usage, are discussed as potential influences on participants' responsiveness to APT- 3...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} the developmental continuity from prelinguistic communication to kindergarten age {{in language and}} working memory capacity. Method: Following our work outlining six groups of children with different trajectories of Early Communication Development (ECD, Määttä et al., 2012), we examined their later development by psychometric assessment. Ninety-one children first assessed at age 12 to 21 months completed a battery of language and working memory tests at age 5; 3 (years; months). Results: Two of the ECD groups previously identified as being at risk for language difficulties continued to show weaker performance at follow-up. The majority (79 %) of the children with <b>compromised</b> <b>language</b> skills at follow-up were identified {{on the basis of}} the ECD groups, but the number of false positives was high. The two at-risk groups also differed significantly from the typically developing groups in the measures tapping working memory capacity. Conclusions: In line with the dimensional view of language impairment, the accumulation of early delays predicted the amount of later difficulties; however, at the individual level the prediction had rather low specificity. The results imply a strong link between language and working memory and call for further studies examining the early developmental interaction between language and memory...|$|R

40|$|Background: Gestures play an {{important}} role in everyday communication. They provide additional information to conversation partners about the meaning of verbal utterances and help to clarify even abstract concepts. There is evidence that gestures are not simply produced for the benefit of the listener but also support the speaker. The relationship between speech and gesture is of great theoretical interest. Indeed the strong ties between speech and gesture have stimulated discussions about the neurological links between the modalities and the possible gestural origins of language. Because of the importance of gesture in communication, several studies have investigated the use of gestures in aphasia. Aphasia is a speech and language disorder caused by damage to the language areas of the brain e. g. because of stroke. It is important to know how people with aphasia (PWA) use gesture as both an accompaniment to speech and as a compensatory modality. Such knowledge can contribute to potential treatment regimes and may point to strategies that can assist everyday communication. Studying gesture use in people with <b>compromised</b> <b>language</b> can also contribute to the theoretical debate about the relationship between the modalities. Most studies to date have focused on the effects of gesture in structured naming tasks, rather than in more natural conversation...|$|R

50|$|Opponents of {{same-sex}} marriage sought {{to reverse the}} Goodridge decision by amending the state constitution, an extended process in Massachusetts requiring repeated approval by the legislature before being put to a popular vote.

50|$|The conference {{agreed to}} a few {{different}} issues. First, they agreed to form a regional political alliance between many of their different movements.

Thus they created a Committee of Co-Ordination to be tasked with selecting which party in each colony would be the representative of the RDA party and named Houphouët-Boigny as chairman and Sissoko, Apithy, Tchicaya, d'Arboussier, and Mamadou Konate (the key Malian politician who convinced Sissoko to join the meeting) as vice-chairmen. Second, as the parties main activity would be in the National Assembly, there were active discussions about what coalitions to form with French political parties. The debate largely focused on whether to form a permanent coalition with the Communist party or to align with them while they served RDA interests. The group agreed to <b>compromise</b> <b>language</b> that the party would form coalitions with whichever party was most useful for African issues. Third, although it was briefly mentioned, the conference agreed not to call for complete independence of the colonies, but instead {{for an end to the}} unequal colonial relationship with France.

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that attentional processes {{play a significant}} role in language and communication in healthy adults. When attentional systems are <b>compromised,</b> <b>language</b> errors ensue. Studies in healthy adults indicate that manipulating visual attention assists with visual target detection and linguistic tasks. Aphasia is a language disorder, usually caused by stroke, affecting both expressive and receptive language abilities. Adults with aphasia have significant delays in reaction times compared to healthy controls. However, no research has yet examined the beneficial effects of attentional manipulation on linguistic performance in this population. The aim of this study is therefore to further define the cognitive underpinnings of language performance in healthy adults and to investigate how attention may be positively manipulated in adults with aphasia. Valid, invalid and neutral visual cues will direct attention either covertly or overtly to the appropriate visual field. In one condition, a target will be presented and response time recorded, and in another condition, a picture will be presented to be named. The performance of healthy adults, healthy adults under attentional duress and adults with aphasia will be compared. Whilst undertaking the tasks, electrical changes in the brain will be monitored using electroencephalography. This will allow us to compare brain areas and the temporal processes involved in naming during the various cueing and loaded/unloaded attention conditions. The expected outcomes of this project are behavioural and electrophysiological details of the relationship between language and attention in healthy adults/adults with aphasia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Comprehension {{difficulties}} are commonly reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but {{the causes of}} these {{difficulties are}} poorly understood. This study investigates how children with ASD access and select meanings of ambiguous words to test four hypotheses regarding {{the nature of their}} comprehension difficulties: semantic deficit, weak central coherence, reduced top-down control and inhibition deficit. METHODS: The cross-modal semantic priming paradigm was used. Children heard homonym primes in isolation or as final words in sentences biased towards the subordinate meaning and then named picture targets depicting dominant or subordinate associates of homonyms. RESULTS: When homonyms were presented in isolation, children with ASD and controls showed priming for dominant and subordinate pictures at 250 ms ISI. At 1, 000 ms ISI, the controls showed dominant (but not subordinate) priming whilst the ASD group did not show any priming. When homonyms were presented in subordinate sentence contexts, both groups only showed priming for context-appropriate (subordinate) meanings at 250 ms ISI, suggesting that context has an early influence on meaning selection. At 1, 000 ms ISI the controls showed context-appropriate (but not inappropriate) priming whereas the ASD group showed both appropriate and inappropriate priming. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ASD showed intact access to semantic information early in the time course of processing; however, they showed impairments in the selection of semantic representations later in processing. These findings suggest that a difficulty with initiating top-down strategies to modulate online semantic processing may <b>compromise</b> <b>language</b> comprehension in ASD.
