The dielectric constants of the composites with filler concentrations 0 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 vol. % were measured. Effect of temperature and frequency variations on dielectric constant (ε′), dissipation factor (tanδ) and a. c. conductivity (σa. c.) was also determined. The frequency dependent dielectric and conductivity behaviour of flyash <b>cenosphere</b> filled low density polyethylene (LDPE) polymer composites have been studied. Appearance of peak in the dielectric loss curves for all the concentrations confirms the presence of relaxing dipoles in the cenosphere/LDPE composites. The effect of filler distribution on the dielectric constant is examined and the observed differences are attributed to the differences in two kinds of interfaces present: one formed between the touching <b>cenosphere</b> particles and the other formed between LDPE and <b>cenosphere.</b> With the increase of <b>cenosphere</b> content dielectric constant decreased gradually.

40|$|Heavy {{fuel oil}} (HFO) as a fuel in {{industrial}} and power generation plants ensures {{the availability of}} energy at economy. Coke and <b>cenosphere</b> emissions from HFO combustion need {{to be controlled by}} particulate control equipment such as electrostatic precipitators, and collection effectiveness is impacted by the properties of these particulates. The <b>cenosphere</b> formation is a function of HFO composition, which varies depending on the source of the HFO. Numerical modelling of the <b>cenosphere</b> formation mechanism presented in this paper is an economical method of characterising <b>cenosphere</b> formation potential for HFO in comparison to experimental analysis of individual HFO samples, leading to better control and collection. In the present work, a novel numerical model is developed for understanding the global <b>cenosphere</b> formation mechanism. The critical diameter of the <b>cenosphere</b> is modelled based on the balance between two pressures developed in an HFO droplet. First is the pressure (Prpf) developed at the interface of the liquid surface and the inner surface of the accumulated coke due to the flow restriction of volatile components from the interior of the droplet. Second is the pressure due to the outer shell strength (PrC) gained from van der Walls energy of the coke layers and surface energy. In this present study it is considered that when PrC ≥ Prpf the outer shell starts to harden. The internal motion in the shell layer ceases and the outer diameter (DSOut) of the shell is then fixed. The entire process of <b>cenosphere</b> formation in this study is analysed in three phases: regression, shell formation and hardening, and post shell hardening. Variations in pressures during shell formation are analysed. Shell (<b>cenosphere)</b> dimensions are evaluated at the completion of droplet evaporation.

In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded particle boards have higher capacity than cement fibre boards. Cement particle boards can be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement fibre boards are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness.

Metal oxides can be present when metal-containing fuels are burned, e.g. solid rocket fuels containing aluminium. Depleted uranium projectiles after impacting the target ignite, producing particles of uranium oxides. Magnetic particles, spherules of magnetite-like ferrous ferric oxide, are present in coal smoke; their increase in deposits after 1860 marks the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. (Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles can be also produced in the smoke from meteorites burning in the atmosphere.)

Amorphous silica particles are present in smokes from burning silicones; small proportion of silicon nitride particles can be formed in fires with insufficient oxygen.
