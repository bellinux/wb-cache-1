25|$|By 1873, {{the year}} of the inaugural Intercolonial Coast Lighthouse Conference in Sydney, Queensland had 39 lights along its coastline. The conference was the first attempt to {{coordinate}} <b>coastal</b> <b>lights</b> and signals around Australia. Recommendations included the need for more <b>coastal</b> <b>lights</b> in Queensland. Although there was general agreement on the recommendations, there were no moves by any of the colonies to cede their control of lighthouses and other coastal signals to a centralised body or to adopt standardised designs for <b>coastal</b> <b>lights.</b> Lighthouse design continued to take into account local conditions and readily available building materials. Often the local materials were augmented with specialised fittings such as stairways, lantern rooms, lenses, and clock work mechanisms from overseas companies.|$|R

50|$|Old Caloundra Light, {{construction}} in 1896, {{was the first}} to serve the purpose of marking the entrance to the North West Channel. Changes in the shipping industry in the 1960s necessitated the construction of a modern signal and radar station, and thus New Caloundra Light was erected in 1967. However, New Caloundra Light was to have a short lifespan as a <b>coastal</b> <b>light.</b> By 1978 the buildings in Caloundra had grown in height, obscuring it from some angles.|$|E
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was first}} proposed in 1886 {{to ensure the}} safety of the increasing coastal traffic on the northern seaboard of New South Wales, and was completed in 1891. The contract to build it was won by William Frank Oakes but he died during construction and the work was completed by his executors.As a result of the Commonwealth Lighthouses Act of 1911, management of the lighthouse was transferred in 1915 to Federal control because of its status as a <b>coastal</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

In 1978 Point Cartwright Light was constructed, and the New Caloundra Light was downgraded to a harbour light. The harbour light remained there until 1992, when it was moved to Wickham Point, together with a radar/microwave link replacing the signal station, and the station was demanned. New Caloundra Light remained as backup, until it was finally shut off in 1997.|$|E

Lit on 18 June 1935, it replaced the light at Pencarrow Head, which was decommissioned later that year. The lighthouse was initially powered by a diesel generator but was converted to mains electricity in 1950. The 1000 W light was fully automated in 1989 and demanned. In February 2005, the original lens was replaced by a flashing LED beacon visible from up to 18 km.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{pollution}} on biodiversity by studying the effect of <b>coastal</b> <b>light</b> pollution on the sea turtle population in the Caribbean. To this end we assemble a data set of sea turtle nesting activity and satellite derived measures of nightlights. Controlling for surveyor effort, local economic infrastructure and spatial spillovers, we find that nightlights significantly reduce the number of sea turtle nests. Using data on replacement costs of turtles raised in captivity, our result suggests that the increase in lighting over the last 20 years has resulted in the loss of close to 2, 000 sea turtles in the Caribbean, worth up to $ 312 million. Incorporating our empirical estimate into a stage-structured population model we discover that the generational effects in the future are likely much larger. More generally, our study provides a new approach to valuing the cost of environmental pollution associated with species extinction...|$|E

Because of disputes over ownership of the land, construction did not proceed until 1868. The original light was a two-story wooden structure, with a lantern housing a fifth-order fresnel lens. Erosion of Point Santa Cruz required the lighthouse to be moved back 300 ft in 1879.|$|R
40|$|This solo {{exhibition}} of forty new works {{was held at}} Thompsons Gallery, London, who produced the accompanying catalogue. The directors and selection panel curate {{a relatively small number}} of annual exhibitions of the work of UK artists. The outputs extended Healey’s theoretical research on the impact of specific geo-locus on the work of the Colourists and consisted of visual experiments undertaken in coastal regions of the West Coast of Scotland, which were linked to ongoing experiments undertaken in Brazil. The work produced for this exhibition deepened Healey’s visual research in peripheral and <b>coastal</b> <b>light</b> conditions and enabled him to produce larger scale works based on new experimental depictions. Research undertaken in Ardnamurichan facilitated a departure in theme and resonance. The new large scale paintings relied on extensive on-site research in the Inner Hebrides, an area so remote that little recorded painting is currently accessible as antecedent. The rationale underpinning the project was that new larger scale visual research methods undertaken on shifting light effects in ‘peripheral reaches’, such as the Hebrides could be combined as a cohesive whole with the continued new paintings of experimental light effects in the more tropical coastal areas of Brazil, Australia and North America. This invited {{solo exhibition}} at Thompson’s Gallery, London followed several earlier shows since 2001 and extended Healey’s longer term research in experimental depictions of evanescent <b>coastal</b> <b>light</b> conditions. This was further extended through Healey’s continued investigations into the impact of Redpath and the particular qualities of Mediterranean light as exemplified in the work of several of the Scottish Colourists following their sojourn to Southern Europe. Despite differences in location, genre, colour saturation and experimental light affects, a cohesive synthesis that brought together disparate yet resonant themes and visual enquiry was a primary objective. These visual experiments continued an extensive iterative process that included a smaller selection of works being presented to and selected by the gallery selection panel. Of these, new paintings were subsequently re-made and extended. A catalogue was published by the gallery. The focus of this research is also part of an ongoing dialogue with ‘capturing the moment’ that has been explored in several exhibitions. An appraisal of this approach has been featured over four pages of the British Magazine, ‘The Artist’, which featured eight of Healey’s paintings...|$|E
40|$|Many ecologically and {{economically}} important marine fish species worldwide spend {{portions of their}} lives in coastal regions that are increasingly inundated by artificial light at night. However, while extensive research illustrates the harmful effects of inappropriate light exposure on biological timing in humans, rodents and birds, comparable studies on marine fish are virtually nonexistent. This study aimed to assess the effects of light on biological clock function in the marine fish retina using the Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) as a model. Using anti-opsin immunofluorescence, we observed robust rhythms of photoreceptor outer segment position (retinomotor movement) {{over the course of the}} daily light–dark cycle: cone outer segments were contracted toward the inner retina and rods were elongated during the day; the opposite occurred at night. Phase shifting the daily light–dark cycle caused a corresponding shift of retinomotor movement timing, and cone retinomotor movement persisted in constant darkness, indicating control by a circadian clock. Constant light abolished retinomotor movements of both photoreceptor types. Thus, abnormally-timed light exposure may disrupt normal M. atlanticus clock function and harm vision, which in turn may affect prey capture and predator avoidance. These results should help inform efforts to mitigate the effects of <b>coastal</b> <b>light</b> pollution on organisms in marine ecosystems...|$|E

Previous investigations in Lake Superior uncovered a metal-rich “halo” around the Keweenaw Peninsula, related to past copper mining practices. For over a century, waste rock migrating from shoreline tailing piles has moved along extensive stretches of coastline, compromising critical fish breeding grounds, damming stream outlets, transgressing into wetlands and along recreational beaches and suppressing benthic invertebrate communities. In Grand (Big) Traverse Bay, Buffalo Reef is an important spawning area for lake trout and whitefish threatened by drifting tailings. The movement of tailings into Buffalo Reef cobble fields may interfere with the hatching of fish eggs and fry survival, either by filling in crevices where eggs are deposited or by toxic effects on eggs, newly hatched larvae or benthic communities. Here, we show that the coastal tailing migration is not “out of sight, out of mind”, but clearly revealed by using a combination of LiDAR and MSS techniques...|$|E

40|$|Australia {{supports}} globally {{the largest}} remaining populations of marine turtles, and {{six of the}} world’s seven species are found in Queensland and Western Australian waters. However, Australia's human population is heavily concentrated in coastal regions {{with an increase in}} residential and commercial development and therefore an increase in artificial lighting. Since breeding marine turtles and hatchlings are vulnerable to disorientation from artificial lighting adjacent to nesting areas, it is important that good planning and management strategies are applied to the location and design of proposals that could potentially disrupt turtle breeding success. The purpose of this report is to establish the type of regulations that are in place in Queensland to protect vulnerable and endangered nesting marine turtles and hatchlings from artificial lighting and to recommend possible legislative changes or modification to avoid, reduce, mitigate and manage the negative impact. Research for this project included an in depth review of the current literature on the risk of <b>coastal</b> <b>light</b> pollution on marine turtles from residential and commercial development and interviews with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds. The assessment indicates that currently there is no legislation governing light pollution near turtle breeding areas on state level in Queensland and any concerns are addressed via arrangements directly with individual councils. Therefore it is recommended that the Queensland Government develops and implements legislations with the aim to protect the endangered marine turtle species along the Queensland coast. ...|$|E
40|$|Light {{pollution}} {{has significant}} adverse biological effects on humans, animals, and plants and {{has resulted in}} the loss of our ability to view the stars and planets of the universe. Over half of the U. S. population resides in coastal regions where it is no longer possible to see the stars and planets in the night sky. Forty percent of the entire U. S. population is never exposed to conditions dark enough for their eyes to convert to night vision capabilities. In coastal regions, urban lights shine far out to sea where they are augmented by the output from fishing boat, cruise ship and oil platform floodlights. The proposed candidate solution suggests using HSCs (high sensitivity cameras) onboard the SAC-C and Aquarius/SAC-D satellites to quantitatively evaluate light pollution at high spatial resolution. New products modeled after pre-existing, radiance-calibrated, global nighttime lights products would be integrated into a modified Garstang model where elevation, mountain screening, Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering by aerosols, and atmospheric extinction along light paths and curvature of the Earth would be taken into account. Because the spatial resolution of the HSCs on SAC-C and the future Aquarius/SAC-D missions is greater than that provided by the DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) OLS (Operational Linescan System) or VIIRS (Visible/Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite), {{it may be possible to}} obtain more precise light intensity data for analytical DSSs and the subsequent reduction in <b>coastal</b> <b>light</b> pollution...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{artificial}} lighting on nesting female sea turtles and their offspring {{have been well}} documented in Florida for years. While federal and state regulatory agencies have pursued dark beaches to protect sea turtle habitat, Florida’s coastline has continued to develop and degrade nesting beaches with artificial light. Currently, Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Design Standards do {{not take into account}} the biological conditions of adjacent properties. Transportation-related impacts caused by <b>coastal</b> roadway <b>lighting</b> affect sea turtle behavior by deterring nesting females from utilizing an otherwise suitable beach for nesting and incubation purposes. <b>Coastal</b> roadway <b>lighting</b> affects sea turtle habitat by forcing the nesting female to utilize inferior beaches that may not provide the best environment for hatching and emergence success of the clutch. Lastly, <b>coastal</b> roadway <b>lighting</b> impacts sea turtle populations when emerging hatchlings are attracted landward toward light sources. These ‘disoriented’ hatchlings usually die from predation, dehydration, heat exposure after sunrise, or getting crushed by vehicles. Hatchlings depend on visual cues from the beach in order to find their way to the ocean. With fewer hatchlings successfully making it to the ocean, fewer hatchlings make it to adulthood. This paper will discuss the development of Sea Turtle Lighting Zones, the proposed changes to the FDOT Lighting Standards for these zones, and the use of innovative lighting technology to illuminate the road for the traveling public and at the same time reduce impacts to adjacent sea turtle nesting beaches...|$|R
