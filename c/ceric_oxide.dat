It is a pale yellow-white powder with the {{chemical}} formula CeO2. It is an important commercial product and an intermediate in the purification of the element from the ores. The distinctive property of this material is its reversible conversion to a nonstoichiometric oxide.|$|E
40|$|The {{immobilization}} of cadmium-(II) following {{nuclear reaction}} of 114 Cd (n,γ) 115 Cd → 115 mIn or 112 Cd (p, 2 n) 111 In is absolutely needed concerning {{to the quality}} of resulting radioisotope products and the efficiency of enriched target utilization. This presented study is based on hypothesis that heating treatment on synthetic <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> resin will increase the binding capacity of Cd(II) over the resin. The aim of the presented study is to gain more experimental data supporting utilization of synthetic <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> resin as separating agent in production of indium radioisotopes using enriched cadmium targets. Experiments in cold system using natural cadmium, instead of high-enriched cadmium, have been carried out, wherein a method of UV-spectrophotometry was performed for quantitative determination of Cd(II). It was found that the synthesized <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> dried at 90 - 100 °C was in form of hydrate compound formulated as CeO 2. q H 2 O where q = (0. 8868 ± 0. 0026). The value of q descended to 0. 1706 and to 0. 0400 as influenced by heating treatment up to 400 °C and 800 °C respectively along with a change on the crystallinity of the <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> from semi crystalline to purely crystalline. The binding capacity of Cd(II) on <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> dried at 90 – 100 °C was found to be (4. 71 ± 0. 08) × 10 - 2 mg Cd(II) /mg resin and significantly increased to (11. 71 ± 0. 24) × 10 - 2 and to (14. 70 ± 0. 17) × 10 - 2 mg Cd(II) /mg resin due to heating treatment up to 400 °C and 800 °C respectively. It can be concluded that the synthetic <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> resin enable to be exploited for immobilization of Cd(II) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{observe the}} {{anti-inflammatory}} and osteogenesis {{of the complex}} particles composed of <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> and bioglass implanted into rabbit femoral defects. Methods The bilateral penetrating femoral condylar defects of 6 mm in diameter were made in 6 adult New Zealand White rabbits,bioglass particles and complex particles composed of <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> and bioglass were randomly implanted into {{the left or right}} condylar defect. Animals were sacrificed at 2 and 4 weeks after operation(3 each),specimens from defect sites were harvested for histological examination to observe the inflammatory reaction and calculate the ratio of new bone and grafts on the defect area. Results No inflammatory reaction was found in the defect area filled with bioglass particles or complex particles composed of <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> and bioglass. New bone was observed in the defects 2 weeks after operation,and no significant difference on the bone formation rate existed between the two materials(P > 0. 05). The osteogenesis of both materials was more obvious in the 4 th week than in the 2 nd week(P 0. 05). No obvious degradation of the grafts implanted into the defect area occurred in the 4 th week compared with that in the 2 nd week(P > 0. 05). Conclusion The complex particles composed of <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> and bioglass has anti-inflammatory activity and similar osteogenesis to normal bioglass particles,and may be used in the repair of bone defects...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the {{preparation}} of tetragonal zirconia doped with yttria <b>oxide,</b> <b>ceric</b> dioxide, and magnesium oxide. In its theoretical part the thesis covers the characteristics of doped ceramics, the possible methods of powders preparation and of their further processing. The experimental part describes the precipitation synthesis of zirconia in base environment and further processing for ceramics. Also studied were the influences of dopant and of the processing technique used on the phase composition and microstructure of the resulting ceramics. To describe the powder structure, the thermal, dilatometric, surface area, and x-ray analyses were performed; as well as both the scanning and transmission electron microscopy employed. Dry processed ceramics showed the average grain size of 87 – 94 nm and the relative density {{in the range of}} 84, 0 – 99, 3 %. In comparison, the ceramics produced of hydrothermally synthesised powders proved the average grain size of 75 – 85 nm and the relative density between 92, 7 - 99, 9 %. As the next step, samples were subjected to low-temperature degradation for the time of 5 and 15 hours. Samples consisting of pure tetragonal ZrO 2 were resistant to 5 and 15 hours of low-temperature degradation at 180 °C...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} activity of cupric oxide activated with <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> in a braod interval of volumetric velocities was investigated.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{dehydrogenation}} of methyl butenes to isoprene is {{conducted in the}} presence of iron oxide catalysts whose composition may include oxides of alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals, and transition metals. Catalysts of lat-est generation can also contain oxides of rare earth elements, particularly cerium oxide. However there is no any com-mon opinion concerning its effect on catalytic properties of iron oxide catalysts. It is well known that <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> has a positive effect on the quantity and stability of active centers and can {{play a critical role in}} a redox cycle of the dehydro-genation process. By means of differential thermal analysis, dispersion analysis and X-ray phase analysis, it was found in present study that introducing of <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> promotes the decrease in hematite crystallite sizes. At the same time, it prevents potassium polyferrites formation, with the equilibrium of topochemical reaction between ferric oxide and po tassium carbonates moving predominantly to the formation of intermediate products-monoferrite systems, having greater catalytic activity. The increase in potassium monoferrite content results in dispersion of particles in the Fe 2 O 3 -K 2 CO 3 -СеО 2 system that is accompanied by modification of texture characteristics. For this catalyst composition, the optimum concentration of <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> (8. 7 wt%), leading to the formation of a certain ratio of mono- and polyferrite phases, was found. If more than 8. 7 wt % of СеО 2 is introduced, the modification of texture characteristics of catalys...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} the synthesis <b>Ceric</b> <b>Oxide,</b> Samarium Oxide and Samarium doped Cerium Oxide. The theoretical part {{is focused on}} the characteristics, applications and possibilities of the Cerium Oxide synthesis. The experimental part describes the precipitation of the Cerium Oxide powder. The synthesis of the powders were proceeded in the normal conditions or in the presence of ultrasonic field. For the purposes of description of the ready powders the x-ray diffraction (XRD) and the raster electron microscopy (SEM) were used. The ceramics were made of the selected powders where the structure was described by SEM, the density by Archimedes´Method and the grain size by grid-line intersect method. Using the precipitation synthesis, the pure powders of <b>Ceric</b> <b>Oxide,</b> Samarium Oxide and Samarium doped Cerium Oxide were prepared. The powder morphology was strongly involved by the pH level and by ageing time. The ultrasound was accelerating the ageing. At the values of pH > 11 the rodlike particles were created. The ageing time and the ultrasound supported the creation of the rodlike particles. The ceramics made of the powder with the presence of the rodlike morphology showed the density up to 97, 14 % of the theoretical density...|$|E
40|$|Removal of As(V) and As(III) {{from water}} using hydrous <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide,</b> CeO(2) center dot xH(2) O (HCO) was {{investigated}} under different pH and As loading conditions, using batch equilibrium adsorption and FTIR methods. Adsorption of both As(V) and As(III) anions was virtually independent of pH {{and up to}} 100 % removal can be achieved in the lower concentration range 0. 5 - 5. 0 mg L(- 1) As at sorbent dosage of 1. 0 g L(- 1). As the initial As concentration increased to 50, 100 or 250 mg L(- 1) for the same sorbent dosage, distinct adsorption maxima of As(V) appeared and shift to lower pH, whereas that of As(III) was found at approximately pH 8. The effect of contact time was dependent on pH but adsorption equilibriums were reached after 6 h in all cases for the studied systems. The isotherms fit well in the Langmuir model of adsorption. Both As(V) and As(III) anions were adsorbed on HCO principally by forming inner-sphere complexes as revealed by the FTIR spectra...|$|E
40|$|Various {{metal oxides}} (MOx) were {{dispersed}} onto a glassy carbon (GC) surface {{for the purpose}} of catalyzing the oxida-tion ofascorbic acid (AH 2). Of the 37 different metal oxides examined, more than 20 showed varying degrees of rate enhance-ment (henceforth referred to as activation) for AH 2 oxidation. The highest degree of activation was exhibited by those MOx's whose oxidation state of the metal was + 3 or higher, such as zirconium oxide, <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide,</b> cobaltic oxide, chromic oxide, stannic oxide, and the previously reported alumina. The double layer capacitance was also observed to increase with MOx/GC's compared to the bare GC electrode. This increase suggested that the surface area of the GC electrodes increased due to the dispersion of MOx. The pH dependence ofthe AH 2 activation at MOx/GC was considerably different from that at a bare GC electrode and suggested that the enhancement mechanism ay involve an acceleration ofa proton-transfer step via AH 2 interaction with the MOx/GC surface. A model of the physical structure of the MOx/GC surface is proposed to account for the carbon surface activation. We recent ly reported (1, 2) that a-a lumina dispersed on glassy carbon surfaces (henceforth referred to as a-A 12 OJGC) enhanced the rate of the electrode reac-tion with ascorbic acid (AH 2), 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzen...|$|E
40|$|A {{paramagnetic}} {{resonance spectrometer}} {{has been designed}} and constructed which is particularly adaptable to problems {{in the field of}} chemistry. It is a wide range, high resolution instrument suitable for investigating the spectrum of paramagnetic substances from g = 0. 7 to g = 7. 5 with resonance lines from a fraction of a gauss to 1000 gauss wide. Spectra can be observed at temperatures from room temperature to liquid helium temperature using single crystals, powders, or solutions as samples. The sensitivity is such that 10 [superscript 15] paramagnetic atoms are needed per sample. The spectrum of gadolinium ion in a micro-crystalline sample of <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> has been investigated. The observed resonance line contained structure that could not be resolved with extreme magnetic dilution (100, 000 : 1) low temperature (4. 5 [degrees]K) or both. An explanation for this structure is suggested. The value of g for the line was measured at two different magnetic field strengths, as was the zero field splitting. An anomalous shift {{in the direction of the}} free ion value of g was found when the field was changed from 3400 gauss to 8600 gauss. The spectrum of manganous ion in a micro-crystalline sample of aragonite was observed at both 3400 gauss and 8600 gauss. An isotropic hyperfine structure of 6 lines was observed. A precise comparison between theory and experiment was made showing excellent agreement. Work on other compounds is also reported...|$|E
40|$|A high- {{resolution}} {{curved crystal}} x-ray spectrometer of the Johann type and employing a proportional counter detection system, has been constructed and its design is described. An original high-intensity narrow focus x-ray source, capable of operation {{under conditions of}} ultra-high vacuum, has been designed and its performance characteristics are discussed. A preliminary investigation has been performed into {{the effect of the}} x-ray take-off angle, and the effect of variations in the tube voltage and emission current, on the intensity received at the detector. The descriptions of the experimental equipment include a method by which the metallic absorption foils could be evaporated, and subsequently cooled, under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Also described is an improved method of producing pinhole free, self-supporting aluminium windows of the order of 1000 A thick. The Mv and Miv x-ray absorption spectra of CAESIUM FLUORIDE, BARIUM METAL, BARIUM FLUORIDE, BARIUM OXIDE, LANTHANUM METAL, LANTHANUM FLUORIDE, LANTHANUM OXIDE, CERIUM METAL, CEROUS FLUORIDE, and <b>CERIC</b> <b>OXIDE</b> have been examined and the existence of true edge type absorption has been established in each of the absorbers. A suggestion is made to account for the difference between the energy positions of the observed absorptions edges and those predicted from the L-spectra data, (the L-M discrepancy). A difference has been detected between the energy positions of the Miv,v absorption edges observed in the metallic and the corresponding non-metallic absorbers. The Mv and Miv absorption lines of the lanthanide absorbers have been quantitatively measured, and as a result a model has been proposed for the electronic coupling between the 3 d and the 4 f level. The Mv and Miv absorption spectra of the metallic absorbers have been measured at low temperatures, and only that of cerium was found to change significantly upon cooling. This change in the absorption structure has been attributed to the a = y phase transformation, and as a result it has been possible to propose a model for the crystalline structure of the a-phase of cerium...|$|E
40|$|Design {{studies were}} made for the cooling, shielding, and electrical- control support systems {{required}} for the testing of the isotope-fueled 125 -w generator in a hot-cell facility. A <b>ceric</b> <b>oxide</b> fuel containing 10 wt. % SiC exhibited suitable burn-up characteristics in simulated postorbital re-entry heating conditions. Inconel X {{was selected as the}} fuelcontainment material. Negative pitch angle injections were evaluated for the injection-stage flight vehicle. The second electrically heated 125 -w generator was assembled and prepared for checkout. A successful reproducible process for bonding the p element was developed in which GeTe was furnace melted into an iron shoe and a spring-loaded element was bonded to the shoe in an induction furnace. The p element contact resistance was 0. 1 milliohm. The maximum output on the first generator was measured as 78. 2 w. Measurements were stopped when power output deteriorated to 28. 8 w. An inspection showed that oxidation due to insufficient reducing atmosphere at the hot junction contacts was the cause. Parametric thermoelectric generator performance tests were conducted in which the internal gas pressure was varied from 0 to 1. 5 atm. and the external pressure was either 1 atm. or a vacuum. The fabrication, operation, and penformance of cesium diodes were studied. The effect of a molybdenum powder film on heat transfer when placed in a molybdenum [...] tungsten interface was determined. In development studies on a low-power thermionic generator, cathode and sapphiresuppcnt creep tests were conducted up to 500 deg C, at which temperature no creep was observed. The design of Generator 2 A was completed. A heater was developed for the generators which is capable of simulating the power density of a Cm/sup 242 / heat source. A titanium alloy, A- 70, was found which possessed satisfactory properties for use as a lead-through at 1050 deg C. A method of electrically insulating the two stages of a generator was developed. Tests were performed which showed that no irteraction takes place between Ce/sub 2 /O/sub 3 / and molybdenum in an oxygen atmosphere at 1600 deg F. Methods for removing aluminum from a curium capsule by volatilizing in either bromine or chlorine gas were investigated. An analysis to determine the heltam pressure build-up in aluminum- americium capsules was conducted. Dose rates were determined for americium slugs before irradiation at distances from the slug surface up to 1 m. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the curium shipping cask was made. The power release by decay products of Pu/sup 236 / and U/sup 232 / was determined. Equations are presented concerning the reaction kinetics involved in the neutron irradiation of Am/sup 241 / with the subsequent production of Cm/sup 242 /. (For preceding period see MND-P- 3010.)
