40|$|Tm:ZBLAN fibre lasers have {{potential}} applications in many research areas, such as eye safe range detection, medical science and materials processing. In this thesis we investigate improving the laser {{performance of a}} thulium doped fluoride fibre (specifically ZBLAN) to generate laser output with wavelengths near 2 μm. Two approaches are demonstrated to investigate laser performance at 2 μm. One is 790 nm pumping in which the cross-relaxation mechanism is used for efficient operation by populating the upper laser level. Another is in-band pumping, where 1570 nm light is directly pumps the emitting laser level, reducing the quantum defect between the pump and lasing wavelengths, reducing the threshold and increasing {{the efficiency of the}} fibre laser. Tm:ZBLAN fibres fabricated in-house, we also characterized with the aim of processing towards the development of new classes of fibre laser. A Tm:ZBLAN double <b>clad</b> <b>fibre</b> laser operating at 1. 96 μm is demonstrated with a 1. 53 W maximum output power and slope efficiency of 45 % with respect to the launch pump power. Thereafter, the laser performance is analysed using cavity mirrors of various reflectivities. A laser with an operating wavelength of 1. 57 μm is demonstrated with 1 watt output power using an Er:Yb co-doped double <b>clad</b> <b>fibre.</b> The slope efficiency of this laser is measured to be 28. 3 % with respect to the diode pump power, with a measured beam quality (M²) of 1. 3. This 1. 57 μm in-band pump source is then used to pump the 2 μm Tm:ZBLAN fibre laser. In addition to the laser development, this thesis also analyses the pump absorption for different shaped double clad fibres numerically. Understanding of pump absorption is required to develop an efficient double <b>clad</b> <b>fibre</b> laser. The pump absorption is measured using cut-back method and compared with the modeled results. Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Chemistry and Physics, 201...|$|E

A range of fibre types and methods of evanescent field access is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The methods of evanescent wave access include side-polishing of all glass monomode, tapering of all glass monomode {{and the use of}} porous clad multimode optical fibre. Preparation of zirconium fluoride fibres for sensing requires great care and the polishing and tapering techniques presented are substantially different from those currently used for Silica fibre. A number of experimental systems have been employed, using both broadband and laser sources, with thermoelectrically and liquid nitrogen cooled detectors, side-polished and tapered monomode fibre sensors are shown to have very low sensitivty to gaseous analytes. The use of a novel mid-IR LED source is also reported. The effect of analyte refractive index on evanescent wave sensitivity is discussed. It is shown that the larger the refractive index difference between fibre and analyte the greater the optical mode confinement. This results in a reduced evanescent wave penetration into the analyte. Methods are presented to overcome this mode confinement by use of porous claddings and overlayers. In particular, the use of a teflon <b>clad</b> <b>fibre</b> and sol-gel porous glass structures is proposed. A viable gas sensor based on Teflon <b>clad</b> <b>fibre</b> with a LED source is presented.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{describe}} my {{work on the}} development and fabrication of fibres for beam delivery and generation. In all cases it is assumed the fibres will be suitable for high power applications. I describe the challenges of fabrication and refinements to existing techniques needed to produce and characterise the diverse fibres. Two jacketed air clad (JAC) fibres with square cores are developed. One is a passive delivery fibre that has capacity to capture a larger beam parameter product than other research and commercial fibres and was designed to deliver the output from a 1800 W diode source. The second jacketed air <b>clad</b> <b>fibre</b> has an inner core doped with Yb ions and a shaped pump core defined by a large NA air cladding. This gave reduced fibre length in an amplifier (compared to a conventional rare earth double <b>clad</b> <b>fibre)</b> providing an advantage {{with respect to the}} onset of non linear spectral broadening. Two all-solid photonic bandgap fibres (S-PBGF) for beam delivery from a fibre laser with a wavelength of 1070 nm and simultaneous rejection of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) light at a wavelength of 1126 nm are presented. The fibres gave larger MFD near 1 µm with SRS suppression than other published results {{at the time of this}} work. A new type of leakage channel fibre, called the micro-clad leakage channel fibre (micro-clad LCF), is demonstrated for the first time. This fibre type is intended for both beam delivery and in future fibres with an inner core doped with rare earth ions, for beam generation. I present the fabrication and characterisation of an exemplar fibre with mode area of 1440 µm 2. A class of simple antiresonant hollow core fibres are investigated. Various single cladding layer fiber structures are examined. I show that the spacing between core and jacket glass and the shape of the support struts can be used to optimize confinement loss. I demonstrate the detrimental effect on confinement loss of thick nodes at the strut intersections and present a fabricated hexagram fibre that mitigates this effect in both straight and bent condition by presenting radially aligned nodes. This fibre has loss comparable to published results for a first generation, multi-cladding ring, Kagome fibre with negative core curvature and has tolerable bend loss for many practical applications...|$|E

This thesis looks into the possibility for lasing at around 3 μm, where tellurite glass is transparent. To test the lasing potential of fabricated tellurite glass microstructured fibres, lasing at 1. 5 μm was demonstrated. The research contained within this thesis includes: The development and characterisation of the tellurite glass composition; including modifications made to this composition to match the refractive indices of the doped and undoped glasses, reducing the glass material loss, finding the glass crystallisation stability and density as well as measuring the temperature dependence of the glass melt viscosity, of which an understanding is required for its extrusion (Chapter 2).

40|$|Corrosion {{monitoring}} is {{an important}} aspect of increasing the safety and reliability of large structures such as aircraft, ships, submarines and bridges. In general, current non-destructive corrosion detection techniques are only able to detect local changes after significant damage has occurred. Moreover, corrosion often localises in areas that are inaccessible for inspection, especially in large structures. This implies a need for sensitive detection systems with multiple sensors in order to monitor the initial stages of corrosion over large areas. Thus, the development of a wide-area detection system for continuously monitoring structural changes, together with a capability for non-destructive evaluation and early warning, {{is an important}} task. The aim of the present research is to evaluate the feasibility of a distributed optical fibre sensor for detecting corrosion at arbitrary points of interest in a large structure. A detection method based on the estimation of water ingress into conventional optical fibre during the corrosion process was tested. This method was based on changes in the water peak absorption in a sensor made from conventional optical fibre. This did not give conclusive results. This method may be attractive for sensor designs based on hygroscopic glasses or fibres with small cladding thickness. In the method chosen for further development, the fluorescence from the complex Tris-(8 -hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq 3) produced by the reaction of Al 3 + ions with the indicator 8 -HQ was detected. A theoretical model was developed to evaluate the evanescent field interaction mechanism and critical parameters of the detection system. This suggested that fluorescent emissions generated by the evanescent field and coupled back into guided modes could be detected by means of photon counting technology. Moreover, the location of the fluorescence could be resolved by measuring the time-offlight of the fluorescent emission returned from a short excitation pulse. Two constructions of the optical fibre sensor, based on etched D-shaped fibre and declad plastic-clad fibre, were examined as sensing elements for distributed measurements. Evaluation of the results in terms of practical considerations such as cost, additional development requirements and the risks to achieving the required results, led to the choice of a plastic <b>clad</b> <b>fibre</b> that could be easily declad as a sensing element for the detection system. A system based on pulsed excitation and time-gated photon counting was used to detect a localized source of fluorescence at an arbitrary position along the fibre length. Environments examined were the complex Alq 3 excited at 405 nm and the infrared dye IR- 125, excited at 780 nm. A model to characterize the response of the sensor to a Gaussian input pulse was developed and tested. Analysis of the Alq 3 fluorescence response confirmed the validity of the model and enabled the fluorescence lifetime to be determined. The decay rate was found to be proportional to concentration, which is indicative of collisional deactivation. The intrinsic lifetime obtained (18. 2 +/- 0. 9 ns) is in good agreement with published data. The minimum Alq 3 concentration that could be detected is 5 x 10 ^- 5 M (~ 20 ppm) over an exposed length of 0. 2 m, whereas the detection limit for IR- 125 is 2 x 10 ^- 6 M (~ 1. 2 ppm). The model allows the spatial resolution of the distributed sensing system to be improved in those cases where the fluorophore lifetime is longer than the resolution of the sensing system. The absorbance and fluorescence response of the multimode optical fibre evanescent wave sensor was analysed to investigate the influence of different conditions, such as environmental refractive index, excitation wavelength, and launching conditions. Theoretical models were developed to investigate and improve the efficiency of the optical fibre detection system. The potential for using the developed detection system in practical sensing applications was successfully demonstrated in a stimulated corrosion test...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{experimental}} study of high-power, high-energy, cladding-pumped, rare-earth (Yb 3 +, Er 3 +/Yb 3 +) -doped fibre lasers. Some of the main capabilities of fibre lasers such as: High brightness and thermal properties were exploited {{for the development of}} a variety of continuous wave (CW) and Q-switched devices, whose characteristics also includes compactness. Our devices could already be considered an option for several applications. The 25 -year long scientific and commercial evolution that fibre lasers have experienced is discussed in the first two chapters. The invention of Erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFA's) and Internet were two major breakthroughs, which launched the need of WDM systems and laser sources. Fibre lasers, are now considered a flexible and powerful device whose technology has finally reached its maturity. Cladding pumping is the technique employed in these experiments in order to pump double <b>clad</b> <b>fibre</b> lasers using high power, broad stripes and bars. In this work, several inner cladding shapes have been used to overcome the normally high mismatch between diode laser beams and inner cladding areas of fibre lasers. Chapter Three consists of a review of cladding-pumped fibre lasers. It describes how inner cladding geometry and pump absorption limits the output power scalability of these devices. Nonlinear effects and amplified spontaneous emission are also studied due to their implication they have over fibre lasers performance. Results on conventional, continuous wave (CW) fibre lasers including fibre characterization and employed launching techniques are described in Chapter Four. A new method to obtain high intensity laser beam output from an Yb 3 +-doped, cladding-pumped, highly multimode fibre laser has been proposed. In this experiment, we propose the use of fibre tapers to increase intensity and improve beam quality. In CW regime, our results show an intensity increase of ~ 3. 5 times with a low power penalty of ~ 1 dB. Also, without tapering, a maximum output power of 21 -W was reached with a slope efficiency of > 80 %. Using a simple set of optic elements such as a l/ 2 waveplate, a polarizing beam-splitter and a bulk grating, we investigated the polarization characteristics of an Yb 3 + fibre laser, from which we obtained 6. 5 W of single polarization tunable output in the range of 1070 to 1106 nm. As a free running laser, the system produced 18 W at 1090 nm and showed a threshold of 1. 8 Watts. The experiment is our first approach for developing a reliable high-power Yb 3 +-doped fibre source, that could be used in conjunction with optical parametric oscillators (OPO) and amplifiers (OPA) to frequency convert to a broad band of wavelengths. Using a new design of ytterbium-doped fibre made in-house with the conventional modified chemical vapor deposition (MCVD) process, we explored the possibilities of energy storage with such a large mode area (LMA) fibre. The fibre system was capable of delivering energetic pulses of > 2 mJ, which could suggest the feasibility of a pulsed fibre laser in the region of tens of milli-Joules. The experiment is described in Chapter Six, on which the experiment that uses the tapered fibre laser in Q-Switched regime is also described and compared to LMA fibre laser. Gaussian-type pulses were obtained which reached pulse energies of 0. 6 mJ at 4 kHz using a tapered fibre laser and 1. 3 mJ at 500 Hz using conventional laser, corresponding to average powers of 2. 1 Watts for the tapered laser and 0. 8 watts for the conventional laser. Er 3 +/Yb 3 +-doped fibre lasers were part of our experimental work. This co-doping technique allows pumping of Yb 3 + ions using broad-stripe high-power pump sources to reach much higher output power levels. Efficient energy transfer from excited Ytterbium ions into Erbium is achieved. From a preliminary study, the fibre laser showed a threshold of 160 mW and a slope efficiency of 49 % with respect to absorbed pump power. The maximum output power was 6. 2 watts at 1535 nm and a linewidth of 1 nm. One of our co-doped fibre devices produced 16. 8 W of continuous wave, multimode laser power at the interesting wavelength of operation of 1550 nm. Finally, conclusions and future work are included in Chapter Eight. <br/...|$|E

50|$|Coherent Fibre OpticsIf {{a bundle}} of fibres could be {{arranged}} such that {{the ends of the}} fibres were in matching locations at either end, then focusing an image {{on one end of the}} bundle would produce a 'pixel-ated' version at the further end which could be viewed via an eyepiece or captured by a camera. A German medical student, Heinrich Lamm produced a crude coherent bundle in the 1930s of perhaps 400 fibres. Many of the fibres were misaligned and it lacked proper imaging optics. It also suffered from leakage where adjacent fibres touched; which degraded the image still further. To produce a useful image, the bundle would need to contain not a few hundred but tens of thousands of fibres all correctly aligned. In the early 1950s, Hopkins devised a way to accomplish this. He proposed winding a single continuous length of fibre in a figure-of-eight around a pair of drums. Then, when sufficient turns had been added, a short section could be sealed in resin, cut through and the whole straightened out to produce the required coherent bundle. Having polished the ends, he was then able to add the optics he had designed to provide an objective and eyepiece. Once enclosed in a protective flexible jacket the 'fibroscope' (now more commonly called a fiberscope) was born. Details of this invention were published in papers by Hopkins in Nature in 1954 and Optica Acta in 1955. However, the bare fibres still suffered from light leakage where they touched. At the same time a Dutchman, Abraham van Heel was also trying to produce coherent bundles and had been researching the idea of <b>cladding</b> each <b>fibre</b> to reduce this 'cross-talk'. In fact he published details of his work in the very same issue of Nature. Eventually a system for <b>cladding</b> <b>fibres</b> with a layer of glass of lower refractive index was developed (see Larry Curtis et al.) which reduced the leakage to such an extent that the full potential of the fiberscope was realised.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} novel optical fibres, microstructured optical fibres (MOFs), and demonstrates device applications based on these structures. A particular emphasis is made on incorporating rare-earth ions within these fibres in order to realise novel active devices. Together {{with the development of}} the fabrication technique, characterisation and applications of these radically different fibre types are presented. First, the fabrication techniques of MOFs, which heavily rely upon fibre drawing, are studied. A mathematical model developed for the capillary drawing process is experimentally examined. Good agreement is obtained whilst it is also found that the model provides useful physical insights for determining the fibre draw parameters even for MOFs with complex geometries. Details of the fabrication techniques developed to optimise fibre structures are also presented. Transmission properties of highly nonlinear MOFs are then studied experimentally. It is found that the transmission losses are strongly influenced by the core dimensions due to the high Rayleigh scattering coefficient that originates from the holey cladding. A simple model is used to explain the observations. In addition, a continuous effort towards reducing OH-induced losses of this fibres type is outlined. Rare-earth doped highly nonlinear MOFs are fabricated and characterised. Then, three device demonstrations are carried out for the first time. These include a mode-locked ytterbium doped MOF laser, a nonlinear amplifier based on an ytterbium doped MOF, and a continuous wave erbium doped MOF laser with a very low threshold and high efficiency. Using the ytterbium doped MOF, wide tunability of ultrashort pulses from 1 µm to 1. 58 µm is demonstrated using the soliton self frequency shift effect. For the erbium doped MOF, a pump power threshold of 0. 5 mW and a slope efficiency of 57 % are demonstrated. Novel <b>cladding</b> pumped <b>fibres,</b> air <b>clad</b> MOFs, which use a conventional inner cladding and a holey outer cladding, are developed aiming at improved performance of <b>cladding</b> pumped <b>fibre</b> lasers. Wide tunability over 110 nm and pure three level operation at 980 nm of ytterbium doped <b>cladding</b> pumped <b>fibre</b> lasers are demonstrated. Finally, the fabrication and characterisation of large mode area microstructured fibres (LMA-MOFs) are described, and a comparison with conventional counterparts is made in terms of bend losses and corresponding effective mode areas. The results show that a slight refractive index difference introduced in the core region of this fibre type strongly modifies its waveguide characteristics. By applying this knowledge, a novel ytterbium doped <b>cladding</b> pumped <b>fibre,</b> which uses different sizes of air holes to define the inner and outer cladding, is developed. A continuous wave output power in excess of 1 W is obtained. Results concerning various forms of pulsed laser operation using this fibre are presented and future possibilities are discussed. <br/...|$|R
50|$|During {{its more}} recent history the Walkerston shop {{has been used}} as a pizza shop, and later sold dance supplies. A skillion section <b>clad</b> in <b>fibre</b> cement {{sheeting}} has been added to the rear of the shop at some stage, resulting in the boarding over of a rear sash window. A carport is attached to the rear skillion addition, and a more recent carport structure has also been added to the west side of the shop, connecting with the neighbouring modern building. In 2016, the building is used as the Walkerston branch of Grays Chiropractic.|$|R

The <b>fibre</b> <b>cladding</b> consists of a triangular lattice formed by a periodic arrangement of Teflon dielectric tubes. Low loss and low dispersion frequencyranges can be tuned out just by changing the tubes thickness, irrespectively of their diameter...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cladding</b> pumped <b>fibre</b> lasers are {{undoubtedly}} becoming {{the most attractive}} source of high power radiation in the near IR region. The small overlap between the pump and the rare-earth-doped core leads to a small pump absorption, e. g., 1 dB/m. Larger core and absorption is often desirable, especially if (transversally) single-mode operation can be maintained. Thus, single-mode operation following selective excitation of the fundamental mode of large-core multimode fiber amplifiers was recently demonstrated in short fibres [1]. In this paper, we use a simple fiber taper inside a laser cavity with a multimode gain fiber to similarly suppress higher-order modes...|$|R

The model used is based on geometrical optics and enables the effects of depolarization, the angular distribution of the propagating beam, as well as refraction and reflection at the core-cladding interface {{to be taken into}} account. Good agreement is obtained between the theory and experiment...|$|R

The weak-guidance approximation allows the effective indices of both the <b>fibre</b> <b>cladding</b> and the defect modes to be calculated analytically. Comparison with a vectorial plane wave method shows that good accuracy is obtained...|$|R
