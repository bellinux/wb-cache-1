40|$|In both DSM-IV-TR and the ICD- 10, hair-pulling {{disorder}} (trichotillomania, or TTM) {{is described}} as hair-pulling, with a rising urge or tension prior to pulling or when attempting to resist, and pleasure, relief or gratification during or after pulling. However, it has been questioned whether all patients with hair-pulling experience these other phenomena, and whether they occur with all pulling episodes. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the DSM-IV-TR requirement of <b>criteria</b> <b>B</b> and C for a diagnosis of TTM in a sample of people with hair-pulling. A multi-site sample of adults with hair-pulling who met both DSM-IV-TR diagnostic <b>criteria</b> <b>B</b> and C (n= 82, 89. 13 %) were compared to those who failed to satisfy both B and C (n= 10, 10. 87 %) on a number of clinical variables.

40|$|Background - The {{acquisition}} of more {{data on the}} highly variable species Begonia clypeifolia Hook. f., necessitated {{a review of the}} taxonomic situation. Methods - A detailed morphological study was performed on herbarium material. Standard practices of herbarium taxonomy have been applied. Preliminary assessments of the IUCN Red List categories of threat were performed using the IUCN criteria and guidelines. Key results - The material revealed the existence of two new species and two new subspecies. All are endemic to the notoriously species-rich region between southern Cameroon and southwestern Republic of the Congo. The new taxa are: B. monte-alenensis Sosef (IUCN status Vulnerable under <b>criterion</b> D 2), <b>B.</b> puberula Sosef (IUCN status Critically Endangered under <b>criterion</b> <b>B</b> 2), B. clypeifolia subsp. mayombensis Sosef (IUCN status Endangered under <b>criterion</b> <b>B</b> 1 and B 2) and B. clypeifolia subsp. celer Sosef (IUCN status Vulnerable under <b>criterion</b> <b>B</b> 1 and B 2). The morphological distinctions between these taxa and B. clypeifolia subsp. clypeifolia (IUCN status Least Concern) are discussed, their distribution and habitat types are provided as well as a citation of all specimens studied. Conclusions - The five new hypotheses about taxonomic distinctions within the B. clypeifolia complex, now based upon a thorough morphological study, should preferably be tested using molecular methods...|$|R

5000|$|Blanchard {{noted that}} both Richard Green and William O'Donohue remarked that a {{so-called}} [...] "contended pedophile"—an individual who fantasizes about {{having sex with}} a child, but does not commit child sexual abuse, but just masturbates fantasizing it, and who does not feel subjectively distressed afterward—does not meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for pedophilia, because he does not meet <b>Criterion</b> <b>B.</b> Whereas Green proposed to solve the problem by removing pedophilia from the DSM, and O'Donohue proposed to remove <b>criterion</b> <b>B</b> for pedophilia, Blanchard proposed a general solution applicable to all paraphilias, namely a distinction between paraphilia and paraphilic disorder. The latter term is proposed to identify the diagnosable condition, which meets both <b>Criterion</b> A and <b>B,</b> whereas an individual who does not meet <b>Criterion</b> <b>B,</b> can be ascertained, but not diagnosed, as having a paraphilia. (Blanchard acknowledges Kenneth Zucker and James Cantor for discussions about this distinction). Interviewed by bioethics professor Alice Dreger, Blanchard explained: [...] "We tried to go as far as we could in depathologizing mild and harmless paraphilias, while recognizing that severe paraphilias that distress or impair people or cause them to do harm to others are validly regarded as disorders." ...|$|R

40|$|An ELISA {{test for}} {{trichinosis}} using as antigen a larvae soluble fraction from Trichinella spiralis {{was carried out}} {{for the detection of}} IgMand IgA specific antibodies in 45 serum samples from patients confirmed or suspected to have trichinosis by strong clinical and epidemiological evidences. All the patients had positive serology detected by precipitin test, bentonite floculation test, indirect hemagglutination test and ELISA IgG test. The cut-off value was determined using two criteria. Criterion A was determined in each plate, using three positive controls and two negative ones; the average of the negative controls and the weakest positive control, muliplied by a 1. 2 factor was, considered the cut-off value. <b>Criterion</b> <b>B</b> was determinated using the average plus three standard deviations from 64 apparently healthy persons serum samples. In both cases, three serum dilutions (1 : 10, 1 : 100 and 1 : 500) were used. The sensitivity of ELISA IgM was 100. 0, 93. 3 and 82. 2 % using serum dilutions of 1 : 10, 1 : 100 and 1 : 500 respectively (criterion A) and 100. 0, 97. 8 and 95. 6 % for the same dilutions (<b>criterion</b> <b>B),</b> whereas the values for ELISA IgA were: 100. 0, 91. 1 and 86. 7 % (criterion A) and 100. 0, 100. 0 and 91. 1 %(criterion B). In order to find out the specificity of ELISA IgM and ELISA IgA, additional 118 serum samples from individuals with other parasitoses, such as cysticercosis (18) hydatidosis (39), fascioliasis (12), toxocariasis (30), Chagas' disease(12) and individuals with non-specif eosinophilia (7), were also tested. ELISA IgM presented a specificity of 92. 3, 93. 4 and 97. 3 % (criterion A) and 96. 2, 97. 8 and 97. 8 % (<b>criterion</b> <b>B)</b> whereas the results for ELISA IgA were 97. 8, 98. 9 and 99. 4 % (criterion A) and 98. 4 % for the 1 : 10 and 1 : 100 dilutions and 100. 0 % for the 1 : 500 dilution (<b>criterion</b> <b>B).</b> The positive predictive values of ELISA IgM were 76. 3, 77. 8 and 88. 1 % (criterion A) and 86. 5, 91. 7 and 91. 5 % (<b>criterion</b> <b>B)</b> whereas the negative ones were 100. 0, 98. 3 and 95. 7 % (criterion A) and 100. 0, 99. 4 and 98. 9 % (<b>criterion</b> <b>B).</b> The positive predictive values of ELISA IgA were 91. 8, 95. 3 and 97. 5 % (criterion A) and 93. 8, 93. 8 and 100. 0 % (<b>criterion</b> <b>B)</b> whereas the negatives ones were: 100. 0, 97. 8 and 96. 8 % (criterion A) and 100. 0, 100. 0 and 97. 8 %(criterion B).

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{evaluate}} the usefulness of CA- 125 normalized in time area under the curve (CA- 125 AUC) to signalise epithelial ovarian cancer relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from a hundred and eleven patients were submitted to two different approaches based on CA- 125 AUC increase values to predict patient relapse. In Criterion A total CA- 125 AUC normalized in time value (AUC(i)) was compared with the immediately previous one (AUC(i- 1)) using the formulae AUC(i) > or = F * AUC(i- 1) (several F values were tested) to find the appropriate close related increment associated to patient relapse. In <b>Criterion</b> <b>B</b> total CA- 125 AUC normalised in time was calculated and several cut-off values were correlated with patient relapse prediction capacity. RESULTS: In Criterion A the best accuracy was achieved with a factor (F) of 1. 25 (increment of 25 % from the previous status), while in <b>Criterion</b> <b>B</b> the best accuracies were achieved with cut-offs of 25, 50, 75 and 100 IU/mL. The mean lead time to relapse achieved with Criterion A was 181 days, while with <b>Criterion</b> <b>B</b> they were, respectively, 131, 111, 63 and 11 days. CONCLUSION: Based on our results we believe that conjugation and sequential application of both criteria in patient relapse detection should be highly advisable. CA- 125 AUC rapid burst in asymptomatic patients should be firstly evaluated using Criterion A with a high accuracy (0. 85) and with a substantial mean lead time to relapse (181 days). If a negative answer was obtained then <b>Criterion</b> <b>B</b> should performed to confirm the absence of relapse...|$|R

We used the IUCN categories and criteria to assess the conservation status of 16 endemic plant taxa (species and subspecies) of the Tuscan Archipelago, based on data collected during field surveys over 4 years. Our data were sufficient to use <b>criteria</b> <b>B,</b> C and D in our assessment. We used <b>criterion</b> <b>B</b> in the assessment of all 16 taxa, criterion C for four taxa, criterion D for 11 taxa and <b>criteria</b> <b>B,</b> C and D for three taxa, Centaurea gymnocarpa, Limonium doriae and Silene capraria. According to our results L. doriae, Romulea insularis and S. capraria are categorized as Critically Endangered and therefore require immediate conservation measures; eight taxa are categorized as Endangered, two as Vulnerable and three as Near Threatened. Compared to earlier assessments, eight species are recategorized with a higher degree of threat, two species are recategorized with a lower degree of threat, five are unchanged, and one species is assessed for the first time. Based on the IUCN categorization our results show that all the endemic species of the Tuscan Archipelago are directly and/or indirectly threatened by human activities, such as tourism and agriculture, and invasive species of plants and animals.
