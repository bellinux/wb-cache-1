Notwithstanding the importance of the material, there has been limited research reported on the fundamental mechanism in machining of this alloy. This paper initially propounds on the properties that define a material as “difficult to cut” (DTC) in order to compare machining related properties of ASTM F 1537 CoCr with other known DTC alloys. This is followed by a brief summary of literature specifically on the chip morphology produced in turning of ASTM F 136 Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Inconel 718.

When {{the device is}} subject to thermal and mechanical loads, the corners develop intense stress and are vulnerable sites to initiate failure. This paper analyzes stress fields at corners in flip-chip packages. The stress at a corner is a linear superposition of two modes of singular fields, with one mode being more singular than the other. The amplitudes of the two modes are represented by two stress intensity factors of dissimilar dimensions. To determine the stress intensity factors, we analyze the flip-chip structures under two loading conditions: stretching of the substrate and bending of the substrate.

When one tooth of {{the cutting tool}} crosses the minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> boundary, the tool would enter into the ploughing zone with no chip formation. Therefore, it is significant to predict the ploughing volume and forces in micro-milling. In this work, the ploughing mechanism for micro-milling is proposed by considering the minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> effects. A 3 D chip geometry is developed to calculate <b>chip</b> <b>thickness,</b> ploughing volume and ploughing forces in micro 5 -axis flat-end milling with a flat-end mill. The local parallel sliced tool based method is then applied to get cutter-workpiece engagement domain where the cutting flutes entry and exit the workpiece, minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> and depth of cut are required to predict ploughing forces.

In this experiment, hard and difficult to cut materials like hard AISI 440 C stainless steel and hard SCM 440 alloy steels were discussed. However, machinability of the material is considered to be poor due to its inherent characteristics. Machinability studies on AISI 440 C stainless steel and SCM 440 alloy steels had not been carried out by researchers. Machinability indices used in such cases have the characteristics such as cutting force, surface roughness, tool wear etc. In the case of high-speed machining of said materials machinability indices such as chip thickness (RC), shear angle (Ф), surface integrity, and chip analysis are of prime importance. In this work, an experimental investigation was carried out to understand the behavior of difficult to cut materials, when machined using Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) insert tool. The results and analysis of this work indicated that the above-mentioned machinability indices are important and necessary to assess the machinability of said materials effectively.

Although significant research is performed in this field, grinding still experiences problems with burn and high forces {{which can lead to}} poor quality components and damage to equipment. This generally occurs in grinding when the process deviates from its safe working conditions. In milling, <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters are utilised to predict and maintain process outputs leading to improved control of the process. This thesis looks to further the knowledge of the relationship between <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> and the grinding process outputs to provide an increased predictive and maintenance modelling capability. Machining trials were undertaken using different <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters to understand how these affect the process outputs. The <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters were maintained at different grinding wheel diameters for a constant productivity process to determine the impact of <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> at a constant material removal rate. Additional testing using a modified pin on disc test rig was performed to provide further information on process variables. The different <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters provide control of different process outputs in the grinding process. These relationships can be described using contact layer theory and heat flux partitioning. The contact layer is defined as the immediate layer beneath the contact arc at the wheel workpiece interface. The size of the layer governs the force experienced during the process. The rate of contact layer removal directly impacts the net power required from the system. It was also found that the specific grinding energy of a process is more dependent on the productivity of a grinding process rather than the value of <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> Changes in <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> at constant material removal rate result in microscale changes in the rate of contact layer removal when compared to changes in process productivity.

In part one, the performance of commercial Kyon 2000 sialon ceramic inserts is studied when machining a hardened alloy steel under a wide range of cutting conditions. The aim is to formulate a pattern of machining behaviour in which tool wear is related to a theoretical interpretation of the temperatures and stresses generated by the chip-tool interaction. The work involves a correlation of wear measurement and metallographic examination of the wear area with the measurable cutting data. Four main tool failure modes are recognised: (a) flank and crater wear (b) grooving wear (c) deformation wear and (d) brittle failure Results indicate catastrophic edge breakdown under certain conditions. Accordingly in part two, the edge geometry is modified to give a double rake tool; a negative/positive combination. The results are reported for a range of workpiece materials under orthogonal cutting conditions. Significant improvements in the cutting performance are achieved. The improvements are explained by a study of process parameters; cutting forces, <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>ratio,</b> chip contact length, temperature distribution, stress distribution and chip formation.

The prediction of cutting forces derives from a simplified orthogonal process. A finite element (FE) model is employed to simulate two-dimensional cutting forces in orthogonal microcutting, with the ploughing and tool edge effect taken into consideration. The flow stress of workpiece material is modelled by using the Johnson–Cook constitutive material law. The FE model is used to evaluate the critical <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> and to extract the cutting force coefficients.

The technological area of interest was marked off by cutting speeds of some few meters per second and depths of cut in the magnitude of a micron typical machining parameters {{in a number of}} abrasive gear finishing processes, e. g. gear honing. The chip formation mechanisms have been investigated by single grain scratching tests. It has been shown, that low cutting speeds in combination with small <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> enhance micro-ploughing and make the chip formation less efficient. Higher values for cutting speed and larger <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> result in increasing micro-cutting. For the most efficient chip formation, the values for cutting speed and <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> have to be chosen as high as possible. Investigations of the tribological process behaviour have been carried out in grinding experiments. They were aimed at quantifying the influence of friction and tool specification on the effective material removal. Experimental findings allow to differentiate the friction influence dependent on the chosen cutting speed and (equivalent) <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> by application of the Stribeck diagram. The most efficient material removal was achieved at a boundary lubrication condition, when the cutting speed and <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> were set at their highest values.

The studies found the major advantages of VAM are come from the intermittent tool tip interaction phenomena between cutting tool and workpiece.

40|$|Large Strain Extrusion Machining (LSEM), a {{constrained}} {{chip formation}} process, is proposed and demonstrated {{as a method}} of Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) for metals and alloys. It is shown that SPD parameters such as deformation strain, macro-texture and strain rate can be controlled by varying the tool rake angle and <b>chip</b> compression (<b>thickness)</b> <b>ratio,</b> while imposing large strains in the chip in a single step of deformation. This level of parameter control is not achievable in any of the conventional SPD processes. By controlling the geometry of the chip (extrudate) a priori using a constraining tool, production of bulk material in foil, sheet and bar forms, and with nanostructured and ultrafine grained (UFG) microstructures, is demonstrated using commercially pure copper and aluminum 6061 -T 6 as model systems. The effects of secondary deformation arising from friction at the tool-chip contact and of the incipient (transient) stage of chip formation on the foil/sheet microstructure are characterized. ^ A characterization of the deformation field is carried out using the method of slip line fields (SLFs). Unlike upper-bound models, it is possible to estimate strain profiles, hydrostatic pressure and modes of deformation using an SLF model. By using an SLF model, estimates are made of SPD parameters such as strain, machining force and hydrostatic pressure, and their dependence on controllable input variables of tool rake angle and chip compression ratio. This analysis provides a theoretical framework for the use of LSEM {{as a method of}} SPD, and for its implementation as a process for making bulk nanostructured materials. ^ The experimental results and the SLF model suggest a number of exciting possibilities for the LSEM. These include creation of bulk nanostructured and UFG alloys from a variety of materials, scaling of the process to make sheet, foil, wire and bar, study and control of material texture, and the possibility of a new method for consolidation of particulates and foils. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{metal cutting}} using machine tool, the power {{required}} to perform machining operation is influenced by cutting parameters. Some of these parameters are feed, depth of cut, cutting speed and metal removal rate. Undeformed <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> is {{the thickness of the}} layer of material being removed at the selected point on the tool cutting edge. Undeformed <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> is known as a factor that significantly affects the power {{required to perform}} the machining operation. Therefor this factor can be used to predict the power required by machine tool to perform machining operation. This paper deals with simulation to approximate the power required by machine tool to perform machining operation (cylindrical turning). Abstract in Bahasa Indonesia : Pada proses pemotongan logam dengan mesin perkakas, besarnya daya pemotongan yang diperlukan dipengaruhi oleh beberapa parameter pemotongan. Beberapa parameter pemotongan diantaranya adalah: pemakanan (feed), kedalaman pemotongan (depth of cut), kecepatan potong (cutting speed) dan laju penghasilan geram (metal removal rate) Undeformed <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> adalah tebal geram (chip) sebelum terpotong, terletak di titik/daerah tertentu pada mata potong pahat. Undeformed <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> diyakini sebagai faktor yang memiliki pengaruh signifikan pada besar/kecilnya daya pemotongan.

40|$|A {{majority}} of the established systems for determination and optimization of cutting data are based on Woxén’s equivalent <b>chip</b> <b>thickness,</b> heW. In metal cutting theory and models, the equivalent <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> is of vital importance when the depth-of-cut ap {{is in the same}} order or smaller than the nose radius r. Woxén made considerable simplifications in his chip area model, that form the basis for calculations of the equivalent <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> Basic mathematical solutions, e. g. describing the chip area on circular inserts, are lacking. This article describes the geometrical implications when machining with round inserts. The error in Woxén’s equivalent <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> is largest when the depth-of-cut is less than ¼ of the nose radius and are up to 40 % wrong for some combinations of cutting data in the finishing range. The presented results explain the difficulties in getting a good validity in the models used to calculate tool life in finishing machining. The error leads to an underrating of the tool load in many machining situations...|$|R
40|$|The {{grindability}} {{of materials}} is investigated based on thermo-elastic-plastic finite element simulations of orthogonal cutting with negative rake abrasive-grits. First the cutting mechanism of steel SK- 5 with negative rake is clarified. In high speed grinding, adiabatic shear, {{which lead to}} serrated chip formation, is observed. Then the influence of material properties of SK- 5 and cutting conditions on the cutting states are analyzed. Analysis shows a critical uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness,</b> under which <b>chip</b> forms with great difficulty. The critical uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> changes complicatedly when material properties including the strain hardening exponent, yield stress, thermal conductivity, and initial temperature, are changed.

40|$|Machining along {{continuous}} circular tool-path trajectories avoids tool stoppage {{and even}} feed rate variation. This helps particularly in high-speed milling {{by reducing the}} effect of the machine tool mechanical structure and cutting process dynamics. With the increase in popularity of this machining concept, the need for detailed study of a valid chip formation in circular end milling is becoming necessary for accurate kinematic and dynamic modeling of the cutting process. In this paper, chip formation during circular end milling is studied with a major focus on feed per tooth and undeformed <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> along with their analytical derivations and numerical solutions. At first, the difference in the feed per tooth formulation for end milling along linear and circular tool-path trajectories is presented. In the next step, valid formulation of the undeformed <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> in circular end milling is derived by considering an epitrochoidal tooth trajectory {{with a wide range of}} the tool-path radius. The complex transcendental equations encountered in the derivation are dealt with, by a case-based approach to obtain closed-form analytical solutions. The analytical solutions of undeformed <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> are validated with results of numerical simulations of tool and tooth trajectories for circular end milling and also compared to the linear end milling. The close resemblance between analytical and numerical calculations of the undeformed <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> in circular end milling suggests validity of the proposed analytical formulations. As a case study, the cutting forces in circular end milling are calculated based on the derived <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> formulations and an existing mechanistic model. The calculation results reiterate the need of taking into account adjusted feed per tooth and valid <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> formulations in circular end milling, especially for small tool-path radii, for more realistic process modeling.
