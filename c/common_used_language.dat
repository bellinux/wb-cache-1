50|$|AmigaOS 1.2 and 1.3 came bundled with AmigaBASIC (and a {{complete}} manual), which other than also being a BASIC dialect, {{was not related}} to ABasic. AmigaBASIC was the only programming language (and the only tool) made by Microsoft for the Amiga computer. Its best feature was the lack of numbering lines of code, which was the first attempt in 1985/1986 to create a new kind of approach in BASIC programming. Microsoft then added this feature to all its development language tools. As AmigaBASIC was bundled with so many Amigas {{it was one of the}} most <b>common</b> <b>used</b> <b>language</b> in the early years.|$|E
