The reaction to generate carbon dioxide involves water reacting with an isocyanate first forming an unstable <b>carbamic</b> <b>acid,</b> which then decomposes into carbon dioxide and an amine. The amine reacts with more isocyanate to give a substituted urea. Water has a very low molecular weight, so even though the weight percent of water may be small, the molar proportion of water may be high and considerable amounts of urea produced.

40|$|Sixteen {{carbamate}} pesticides {{that belong}} to four chemical classes (oxime-N-methylcarbamates, aryl N-methylcarbamates, N-phenylcarbamates, and methyl esters of substituted <b>carbamic</b> <b>acids)</b> were investigated via three different commercially available thermospray interfaces and ion sources that exhibit wide differences in source geometry. Comparisons were made between the three interfaces with respect to ion formation and sensitivity of detection. Experimental parameters were standardized to obtain comparable experimental conditions. Very similar mass spectra for most carbamates were obtained that illustrate independence from the geometry of the ionization and desolvation chambers of the interfaces. These findings are {{in sharp contrast to}} several literature reports. However, thermally labile carbamates gave unsatisfactory results with regard to spectral compatibility between the interfaces. Such differences were due to thermally assisted hydrolysis reactions that occur in the vaporizer probe prior to ionization and reflect differences in the vaporizer designs. The study proves conclusively that comparable spectra can be obtained under thermospray with different interfaces and mass spectrometers. © 1995 American Society for Mass Spectrometry...|$|R

30|$|Flexible {{polyurethane}} foams {{are used}} in many applications because of their ease of handling, excellent cushioning, and tunable physical properties [1]. They {{are used in}} a variety of commercially established applications like mattresses, automotive and furniture cushions, and carpet backing, to name a few. The main reaction in polyurethane foam processing is the polycondensation of poly-hydroxy compounds (polyols) with diisocyanates. Foaming phenomenon occurs when a small amount of blowing agent and water is added during polymerization process. Water reacts with isocyanate groups giving <b>carbamic</b> <b>acids,</b> which spontaneously lose CO 2, thus generating the foam bubbles [2]. Nevertheless, flexible polyurethane foams like other plastic foams have low mechanical strength and low dimensional stability that could inhibit their use in some important applications such as shoe soles. The mechanical properties could be partly improved by modification of cellular morphology as microstructural studies on rigid polyurethane foams, which have indicated that the compressive strength and modulus of the foams increase by decreasing cell size and narrowing cell size distribution through changing blowing agent. On the other hand, in recent years, polymer nanocomposites have attracted much attention because of their high potential to achieve great improvement in properties including dimensional stability, gas permeability, flame retardancy, and mechanical properties by adding a small amount of nanoparticles in the polymer matrices [3, 4, 5]. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} incorporation of nanoparticles with their large surface area and fine dimensions as well as very close contact between particles and the polymer matrix could alter foam morphology and properties.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to explore new opportunities for the atom efficient synthesis of amines. Different amine synthesis routes were inspected and for the most sustainable processes original strategies were sought to enhance and improve these reactions or to find ways to obtain high selectivities. One strategy that was explored is the development of a heterogeneous catalyst for the most sustainable routes. Hydroamination, the direct addition of an amine to an unsaturated carbon-carbon bond, is such a pathway. It is generally recognised as one of the major challenges for catalysis research. As an alternative approach, alcohol amination is an acceptably sustainable process in which water is formed as the only by-product. Here, the major challenge is to activate the unreactive alcohol in an efficient way. The second strategy pursued is to attain a specific selectivity in the aza-Michael addition reaction by means of a protection mechanism. Unlike in hydroamination, activated double bonds are aminated and no longer activity, but selectivity to the desired products becomes a challenge. In a first part, the activity of double metal cyanide materials is explored for intermolecular hydroamination reactions. The combination of zinc and cobalt as the two metals that are connected with cyanide bridges in these materials, led to high activities for a first test reaction, the addition of 4 -isopropylaniline to phenylacetylene. The preparation of small particles via a reverse emulsion synthesis was found to have a beneficial effect on the activity. This could be attributed to catalysis taking place on the outer surface of the materials. The high activity for the test reaction and successful reactant scope expansion are ascribed to the zinc active sites, which are located in a cubic framework. Because of charge considerations in this framework, vacancies of the hexacyanocobaltate(III) anion occur throughout the lattice, which directly lower the coordination number of the zinc sites, leaving coordinative vacancies for catalysis. In a second part the use of carbon dioxide as a sustainable protecting group is explored. The reaction of sufficiently basic primary amines with carbon dioxide to form the corresponding <b>carbamic</b> <b>acids</b> is known to take place at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It can be used as protecting tool for these amines in competitive reactions. The aza-Michael addition of a less basic sulfonamide can be performed {{in the presence of the}} normally more reactive primary amines. Further, with secondary amines both an intra- and intermolecular selectivity could be obtained with respect to primary amines. The concept was also demonstrated to enable Michael over aza-Michael additions with carbon nucleophiles and selective acylations of alcohols in the presence of amines. Finally, the alcohol amination reaction was successfully accomplished using a ruthenium hydroxyapatite catalyst. A borrowing hydrogen mechanism allows for the activation of the alcohol by dehydrogenation to the corresponding carbonyl compound, which is a reactive in situ formed intermediate able to react with the nucleophilic amine. The ruthenium sites in combination with the basic support allow the transformation of a benzylic and aliphatic alcohol and do not require any additives or pretreatments. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|The word {{polyurea}} {{is derived}} from the Greek words πολυ- - poly- meaning [...] "many"; and ουρίας - oûron meaning [...] "to urinate". The latter term refers to the substance urea, found in urine, rather than urine itself. Urea or carbamide is an organic compound with the chemical formula (NH2)2CO. The molecule has two amine groups (-NH2) joined by a carbonyl functional group (C=O). In a polyurea, alternating monomer units of isocyanates and amines react with each other to form urea linkages. Ureas can also be formed from the reaction of isocyanates and water which forms a <b>carbamic</b> <b>acid</b> intermediate. This acid quickly decomposes by splitting off carbon dioxide and leaving behind an amine. This amine then reacts with another isocyanate group to form the polyurea linkage. This two step reaction is used in what is commonly but improperly called polyurethane foams. The carbon dioxide that is liberated in this reaction is the primary blowing (foaming) agent especially in many polyurethane foams which more precisely should be called polyurethane/urea foams.|$|E
50|$|Irreversible inhibitors of AChE {{may lead}} to muscular paralysis, convulsions, {{bronchial}} constriction, and death by asphyxiation. Organophosphates (OP), esters of phosphoric acid, are a class of irreversible AChE inhibitors. Cleavage of OP by AChE leaves a phosphoryl group in the esteratic site, which is slow to be hydrolyzed (on the order of days) and can become covalently bound. Irreversible AChE inhibitors {{have been used in}} insecticides (e.g., malathion) and nerve gases for chemical warfare (e.g., Sarin and Soman). Carbamates, esters of N-methyl <b>carbamic</b> <b>acid,</b> are AChE inhibitors that hydrolyze in hours and have been used for medical purposes (e.g., physostigmine for the treatment of glaucoma). Reversible inhibitors occupy the esteratic site for short periods of time (seconds to minutes) and are used to treat of a range of central nervous system diseases. Tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) and donepezil are FDA-approved to improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease. Rivastigmine is also used to treat Alzheimer's and Lewy body dementia, and pyridostigmine bromide is used to treat myasthenia gravis. An endogenous inhibitor of AChE in neurons is Mir-132 microRNA, which may limit inflammation in the brain by silencing the expression of this protein and allowing ACh to act in an anti-inflammatory capacity.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{desirable}} attributes of polyurethanes is their ability to be turned into foam. Making a foam requires {{the formation of a}} gas {{at the same time as}} the urethane polymerization (gellation) is occurring. The gas can be carbon dioxide, either generated by reacting isocyanate with water or added as a gas; it also be produced by boiling volatile liquids. In the latter case heat generated by the polymerization causes the liquids to vaporize. The liquids can be HFC-245fa (1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane) and HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), and hydrocarbons such as n-pentane.The balance between gellation and blowing is sensitive to operating parameters including the concentrations of water and catalyst.
