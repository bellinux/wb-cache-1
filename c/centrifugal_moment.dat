50|$|A {{centrifugal}} {{twisting force}} is experienced by any asymmetrical spinning object. In the propeller it acts to twist the blades {{to a fine}} pitch. The aerodynamic centre of pressure is therefore usually arranged to be slightly forward of its mechanical centreline, creating a twisting moment towards coarse pitch and counteracting the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>moment.</b> However in a high-speed dive the aerodynamic force can change significantly and the moments can become unbalanced.|$|E

The concept of 'moment' is a {{generalization}} of the statical, inertial and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>moment</b> respectively of a polygon, which as such are special moments of {{first and second}} order.

40|$|Convergence theorists explore/predict {{the fusion}} {{of a series of}} {{previously}} discrete forms, a process that might be viewed as un-problematically centripetal. This is the longstanding view of the information industry. It produces a particular outcome - there may be local difficulties, but the perceived ontology of information is towards total convergence. Focussing on the socio-cultural diffusion of information cultural theorists have offered a different account of technical convergence where the stress has been on the centrifugal as much as the centripetal, so that not only what is pushed together through information but also what is forced apart, becomes significant. Jameson?s 1980 s account of schizophrenia as the cultural logic of information capitalism is an example of this ? and is written about the same time Negroponte set about founding/defining future media at MIT. Forcing these different accounts into relation with each other is productive, revealing lacunae not only in technical accounts of convergence but in critical accounts of informational culture, and exposing a naturalized set of alignments which might be questioned; to read the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>moment</b> of convergence as the technological moment and as the enlargement of a form of social control, and the centripetal moment as the cultural moment and as a form of evasion of control, can be problematic. In this context this article (i) explores the contemporary relationship between ? 2. 0 ? (read as essentially industrial account of convergence) and Henry Jenkins? account of convergence culture as post-resistance culture and (ii) explores the potential for understanding contemporary convergence processes and the forms of participation they entail across a series of axes which together might provide a different and more multi-dimensional form of mapping...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} Lagrangian {{numerical}} simulations is performed {{to examine the}} dispersion process in open channel flows and to explain through a simple conceptual model its systematic deviations from the ideal long‐term one‐dimensional regime even {{in the case of}} straight axis and fixed impervious bed. The starting point is represented by a suitably depth‐averaged transport equation, with generally nonlocal turbulent mixing, solved in terms of particles trajectories and their first‐ and second‐order moments. Input data refer to six rivers of southern Italy, for which the irregular section morphology is known from a field survey. As the governing equation predicts, and according to experimental observations, in the case of variable cross‐sectional diffusion the tracer cloud exhibits a permanent and asymmetric peripheral drift toward the shallow boundary zones, with a remarkable deceleration along the main flow direction. Longitudinal inertia moments tend to become linear after a period equal to twice the single river diffusive time and sometimes show an early anomalous change of slope. Transverse inertia moments experience an initial very fast increment as compared to the theoretical value corresponding to the uniform transverse concentration and, after a peak, tend to stabilize about a smaller constant. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>moments</b> remain, in any case, relatively limited, indicating that longitudinal and transverse axes practically identify with the plume principal directions, no matter how irregular and asymmetric the river section is...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAnalytical and {{empirical}} investigations concerning the flow through clearances of non-contacting seals indicate {{the occurrence of}} interactions between {{the walls of the}} ducts [1]. Investigations of flows in the transverse clearance between annular front of surfaces have show {{that in the case of}} a convergence of the clearing the pressure field is asymmetrical. In the case of a forced <b>centrifugal</b> flow, the <b>moment</b> caused by the pressure forces in the transvers clearance opposes the contact of the surfaces of its walls. At centripetal flow the case has opposite effect. The results of calculations of the pressure field concerning a laminar centrifugal flow through the face clearance have been presented. Laboratory tests of such a centrifugal flow have been quoted in [2]. The effects of the pressure fields in the clearances of non-contacting seals, opposing contacts between the walls constituting longitudinal eccentric or transverse converging clearances, were utilized in patented inventions [3 – 8]. The inventions [3, 4] have been dealt with by the authors of [1]. The presented paper describes the structural solutions concerning the inventions [5, 6, 7 and 8]...|$|R
40|$|Chatter is a {{major problem}} causing poor surface finish, low {{material}} removal rate, machine tool failure, increased tool wear, excessive noise and thus increased cost for machining applications. Chatter vibrations can be avoided using stability diagrams for which tool point frequency response function (FRF) must be determined accurately. During cutting operations, due to gyroscopic <b>moments,</b> <b>centrifugal</b> forces and thermal expansions bearing dynamics change resulting in tool point FRF variations. In addition, gyroscopic moments on spindle-holder-tool assembly cause separation of modes in tool point FRF into backward and forward modes which will lead to variations in tool point FRF. Therefore, for accurate stability predictions of machining operations, effects of operational conditions on machine tool dynamics should be considered in calculations. In this study, spindle bearing dynamics are identified for various spindle rotational speeds and cutting forces. Then, for a real machining center, tool point FRFs under operating conditions are determined using the identified speed dependent bearing dynamics and the mathematical model proposed. Moreover, effects of gyroscopic moments and bearing dynamics variations on tool point FRF are examined separately. Finally, computationally determined tool point FRFs using revised bearing parameters are verified through chatter tests...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{performance}} of the high-speed running shaft-bearing system (SBS) {{is different from that}} of idle state system due to the high-speed effects (HSE), including shaft <b>centrifugal</b> force, gyroscopic <b>moment,</b> and nonlinear bearing operational stiffness. In this paper, aiming at improving the operation stability, dynamic {{performance of}} SBS operating in high-speed field is investigated based on a finite element (FE) dynamic model. Firstly, the Timoshenko beam elements are applied to develop the SBS FE model with full consideration of HSE. Secondly, idle state frequency response function at the front tip is obtained analytically and experimentally to validate that the FE model can illustrate the system dynamic behaviors in static condition. Finally, by substituting various rotational velocities into the FE model, the HSE on system natural frequencies are studied one by one as well as together. The results show that, when bearing is being extremely light preloaded, SBS frequencies are affected by the HSE of shaft more than bearing, especially where the gyroscopic moment effect of shaft is the most influential factor. Moreover, the nonmonotonic variation of bearing operational stiffness is analyzed. The “stiffen” phenomenon explained in this paper provides a more comprehensive understanding of the nonlinear bearing operational stiffness...|$|R
40|$|The {{premise of}} this {{research}} is to estimate the speed of vehicles when turning in certain radius of road, indirectly will support smart driving because the driver can be estimate how fast the vehicle should be run when turning. When vehicles turning arose <b>centrifugal</b> force and <b>moment</b> in the wheel, it can make slip angle in the wheel. The magnitude effect of slip angle wheel decided the stability movement in vehicles. Generally the greater influence of slip angle wheel will disturb the stability of vehicles. On other slip parameter, the most important consider stability is roll axis movement in a vehicle, which condition of occurrence if one in front or rear wheel lift.
