40|$|<b>Care</b> <b>programming</b> was {{introduced}} {{as a national}} system of care for all people in contact with psychiatric services from April, 1991. It requires full assessment of the individual, a nominated key worker, explicit care planning, including the measurement of unmet need, and regular reviews. This paper {{is based on the}} results of a one-year study, funded by the Department of Health, of the implementation of <b>care</b> <b>programming</b> in three contrasting health districts. It looks specifically at three questions: which client groups were included on the care programme approach, what unmet needs were identified, and how much <b>care</b> <b>programming</b> appears to cost, both at the service level, and for individual service users. We analyse findings from interviews with 60 mental health workers and 60 service users to present a portrait of <b>care</b> <b>programming.</b> Although primarily descriptive, this information can be used to guide the development of <b>care</b> <b>programming</b> and other mental health services, as well as to assist in the formulation of care packages, the allocation of budgets in mental health and, eventually, the evaluation of the effectiveness of <b>care</b> <b>programming...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The Grip on Challenging Behavior <b>care</b> <b>program</b> for {{managing}} challenging behavior was {{implemented in the}} dementia special care units of 17 Dutch nursing homes. A process evaluation of {{the implementation of the}} <b>care</b> <b>program</b> was performed to determine the quality of the implementation and the lessons to be learned for future implementation. Methods: The <b>care</b> <b>program</b> was implemented according to a stepped wedge design. First-order data (data on recruitment, reach, relevance and feasibility) were used to determine the validity of the study, and second-order data (intervention quality and the barriers and facilitators for implementing the <b>care</b> <b>program)</b> were used to describe the implementation process. Two structured questionnaires were administered to care staff and key stakeholders and semi-structured interviews were held in the units. Results: University affiliated and non-affiliated nursing homes from different parts of the Netherlands participated. The resident participation rate was over 95 % and the participation rate for the training sessions was 82 %. Respondents considered the <b>care</b> <b>program</b> relevant and feasible. The degree of implementation was not optimal. The barriers and facilitators in implementing the <b>care</b> <b>program</b> could be divided into three categories: organizational aspects, culture on the unit and aspects of the <b>care</b> <b>program</b> itself. Conclusions: The recruitment, reach, relevance and feasibility are sufficient to allow for analysis and generalization {{of the effects of the}} <b>care</b> <b>program,</b> but the degree of implementation should be taken into account in further analysis. Future projects that involve implementation should consider the specific features of the organization and the cultural orientation of the unit to better adapt to specific needs. Trial registration: The Netherlands National Trial register under number NTR 2141 registered on 11 December 2009. Randomization took place in November 2010, and the first intervention group started using the intervention in February 2011...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} is {{evaluating}} the (cost-) effectiveness of a multidisciplinary, evidence based <b>care</b> <b>program</b> to improve the management of depression in nursing home residents of somatic and dementia special care units. The <b>care</b> <b>program</b> is an evidence based standardization of the management of depression, including standardized use of measurement instruments and diagnostical methods, and protocolized psychosocial, psychological and pharmacological treatment. Methods/Design In a 19 -month longitudinal controlled study using a stepped wedge design, 14 somatic and 14 dementia special care units will implement the <b>care</b> <b>program.</b> All residents who give informed consent on the participating units will be included. Primary outcomes are the frequency of depression on the units and quality of life of residents on the units. The effect of the <b>care</b> <b>program</b> will be estimated using multilevel regression analysis. Secondary outcomes include accuracy of depression-detection in usual care, prevalence of depression-diagnosis in the intervention group, and response to treatment of depressed residents. An economic evaluation from a health care perspective will also be carried out. Discussion The <b>care</b> <b>program</b> is expected to be effective in reducing the frequency of depression and in increasing {{the quality of life of}} residents. The study will further provide insight in the cost-effectiveness of the <b>care</b> <b>program.</b> Trial registration Netherlands Trial Register (NTR) : NTR 1477 </p...|$|R

25|$|There is some {{controversy}} over who exactly should {{take responsibility for}} coordinating {{the care of the}} dual eligibles. There have been some proposals to transfer dual eligibles into existing Medicaid managed care plans, which are controlled by individual states.

Medicare has more experience managing the care of older adults, and is already expanding coordinated <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> under the ACA, though there are some questions about private Medicare plans’ capacity to manage care and achieve meaningful cost savings.|$|E
