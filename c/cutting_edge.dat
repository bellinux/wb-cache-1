5|$|The masseteric crests (crests on {{the outer}} sides of the mandibles) reach their front ends below the front border of the first molars. Usually, the capsular process (a {{projection}} {{at the back of}} the mandible housing the root of the lower incisor) is well-developed. The enamel of the upper incisors is yellowish-orange and the incisors are orthodont (with their <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> perpendicular to the plane of the toothrow) or slightly opisthodont (with the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> inclined backwards). In contrast, Akodon simulator has more proodont incisors (with the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> oriented forwards) and Akodon neocenus has more opisthodont incisors. The molars are more hypsodont (high-crowned) than in A.caenosus, but are unlike the very hypsodont molars of A.budini. The molar rows are relatively longer than in A.polopi. There are 13 or 14 thoracic (chest), 7 or 8 lumbar (abdomen), and 23 or 26 caudal (tail) vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Edge {{returned}} on the September 9, 2013, {{episode of}} Raw {{in his hometown}} of Toronto where he hosted his talk show The <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> having Daniel Bryan as his special guest after Randy Orton was scheduled to be his original guest. Edge insulted Triple H in the segment, who retaliated by labeling Edge's main event push as a complete failure and sending The Shield to attack Edge's friend Christian. When Edge went to confront Triple H, he was escorted from the building. Edge hosted The <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> on the September 13 episode of SmackDown, where he mocked Randy Orton and watched as Orton's attack on Bryan backfired.|$|E

5000|$|The {{permanent}} dental {{formula for}} Zygorhiza is , the deciduous dental formula is [...] The cingula {{at the base}} of the tooth crowns on P2-4 are strongly developed but do not meet on the medial side. P2, the largest upper tooth, has four accessory denticles on the anterior and posterior <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> P3-M2 form a closed series. P2-M2 have two widely separated roots, accessory denticles on the anterior and posterior <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> and anastomosing striae on the enamel.P1 is caniniform with a single root. P2-4 have laterally compressed crowns and accessory denticles on the anterior and posterior <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> P4 is the largest lower tooth. M1-3 have accessory denticles on the posterior <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> P2-3 are two-rooted. Outside the upper one-rooted teeth and inside the upper two-rooted teeth there are pits for reception of the lower teeth.|$|R
5|$|Most broaches {{are made}} from high speed steel (HSS) or an alloy steel; TiN {{coatings}} are common on HSS to prolong life. Except when broaching cast iron, tungsten carbide is rarely used as a tooth material because the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> will crack on the first pass.|$|E
5|$|RNC was {{the subject}} of a 2007 {{documentary}} for the Channel Four series <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge,</b> which followed three young students (Steve Markham, Daniel Angus and Selina Litt) during their first term at the college. The film examines their individual journeys towards greater independence as they encounter the unique challenges that being visually impaired presents, as well as how they deal with the everyday issues that affect all teenagers, such as sex, relationships, partying and their future plans after graduation. The documentary, Blind Young Things, was first aired on 30 April 2007, and won a Royal Television Society award for Channel Four and the <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> team in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer process and other modern production techniques, steel was expensive and was only used where no cheaper alternative existed, particularly for the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> of knives, razors, swords, and other items where a hard, sharp edge was needed. It was also used for springs, including those used in clocks and watches.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{standard}} {{twist drill}} {{is divided into}} a series of elementary cutting tools (ECT) along its major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> The natural power consumed by each ECT during free cutting is calculated {{on the basis of the}} theory of shear plane. Through optimization, the actual power consumed and the coefficient of non-free cutting of the major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> subject to the principle of minimum energy are calculated. The results indicate that although the major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> of the standard twist drill are straight lines, their cutting process is not free cutting in full sense of the term...|$|R
40|$|Sharp <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> of coated {{tools are}} often rounded to {{increase}} their stability. In the described investigations coated <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> of cemented carbide inserts were variously rounded by grinding. The coating thickness distributions in the transient region between tool flank and rake were determined by an appropriate evaluation of ball cratering tests using confocal microscopy. The cutting performance of the tools was examined in milling at different cutting speeds and chip lengths, which were adjusted based on FEM calculations. The results demonstrated that even <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> with slightly revealed substrate can effectively withstand the cutting loads...|$|R

50|$|Kronosaurus teeth exceed 7 cm {{in length}} (the largest up to 30 cm long with 12 cm crowns). However, they lack carinae (<b>cutting</b> <b>edges)</b> and the {{distinct}} trihedral (three facets) of Pliosaurus and Liopleurodon teeth. The combination of large size, conical shape {{and lack of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> allows for easy identification of Kronosaurus teeth in Cretaceous formations from Australia.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUltra-precision (UP) milling {{processes}} can be dramatically sped up, {{and thus}} made more cost-efficient, by utilizing tools with multiple <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> This, however, requires a dedicated actuating mechanism to interactively control the cutting {{radius of the}} individual <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> with nanometer precision. This paper presents recent advances in developing a tool holder for diamond fly-cutting that enables the alignment {{of two or more}} <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> via thermal elongation of the substrate material. After building a comprehensive model of the actuator and verifying it in a static test setup, a closed-loop control was developed that allows setting the elongation in a static setup with nanometer accuracy...|$|R

40|$|In the {{car body}} {{stamping}} process, trim/blank die <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> {{are subjected to}} very high tribological loads that result in loss of tool material from both the punch and die <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> According to Archard’s wear model, normal contact force and sliding distance directly affects the wear. Therefore, knowledge of the acting forces on local contact areas has a pivotal role towards the prediction of tool wear. This paper presents a finite element modelling approach to determining the contact pressure distribution on the tool <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> during a trimming/blanking process. Characteristic areas on sheared edge profile, variation of punch force and high contact pressures affected areas have also been analysed. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{machining}} with grinding, it {{is necessary}} to know the values of geometrical parameters of <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> of abrasive grains. In this paper the values of the basic parameters BP, NP are obtained experimentally for modeling <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> of abrasive grains with rotation surfaces using the generatrix as a power curve and for dividing <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> into chipping and forming achips edges,. The influence of abrasive grain sizes, the sieve-shaking procedure, mechanical properties of workpieces and the type of an abrasive material on these parameters is studied in this paper. Restrictions on this model are formulated. It is established that traditional parameters such as the corner radius r and the apex angle 2 θ can be used in microcutting with a small grain penetration depth...|$|R

5|$|The {{subspecies}} of {{this bird}} {{can usually be}} distinguished by their difference in size and plumage. The subspecies Phaethon aethereus mesonauta can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the bolder look of the black barring on the upperwing, and the more solid look of the black on the outer wing. The subspecies P. a. indicus can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with black <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Extreme Rules, Edge {{helped his}} friend Christian {{to win the}} vacant World Heavyweight Championship. At SummerSlam, Edge was in Christian's corner for his World Heavyweight Championship defense against Randy Orton but, {{disappointed}} by the cowardly tactics Christian used to win his second World Heavyweight Championship, berated him and walked out on him. Christian then lost the title to Orton for a second time. On the September 16, 2011 episode of SmackDown, {{in his hometown of}} Toronto, Edge hosted The <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> between Mark Henry and the World Heavyweight Champion, Randy Orton. After the show went off the air, they held Edge Appreciation Night to celebrate his career.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have the}} same plumage pattern as males, though with {{somewhat}} duller colouration. The female has a grey head; buff supercilium, chin, and throat; black and warm brown upperparts; and off-white underparts. The bill of the female is pale yellow with the tip and <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> of mandible dusky. Juveniles are dull grey with a brown back, a pale yellow supercilium, and a pale horn bill. Females and juveniles have hints of chestnut on their supercilium, shoulders, and throat, by which they may be distinguished from other sparrows, such as the Kenya sparrow and the other rufous sparrows, which are common {{in much of the}} chestnut sparrow's range; or the house sparrow, which also occurs in parts of its range.|$|E
