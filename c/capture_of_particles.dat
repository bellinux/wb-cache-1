40|$|Filtration in general, and {{the dead}} end depth {{filtration}} <b>of</b> solid <b>particles</b> out <b>of</b> fluid in particular, is intrinsic multiscale problem. The deposition (<b>capturing</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles)</b> essentially depends on local velocity, on microgeometry (pore scale geometry) of the filtering medium and on the diameter distribution <b>of</b> the <b>particles.</b> The deposited (captured) particles change the microstructure of the porous media what leads to change of permeability. The changed permeability directly influences the velocity field and pressure distribution inside the filter element. To close the loop, we mention that the velocity influences the transport and deposition <b>of</b> <b>particles.</b> In certain cases one can evaluate the filtration efficiency considering only microscale or only macroscale models, but in general an accurate prediction of the filtration efficiency requires multiscale models and algorithms. This paper discusses the single scale and the multiscale models, and presents a fractional time step discretization algorithm for the multiscale problem. The velocity within the filter element is computed at macroscale, and is used as input for the solution of microscale problems at selected locations of the porous medium.

A miniaturized ultrasonic transducer {{is used to}} locally excite a 4 -MHz cross-sectional resonance in the capillary, creating an acoustic field gradient for retention of cells in non-contact mode. Due to competition between fluidic drag from induced acoustic streaming and primary radiation force the smallest particle size addressable with the trapping system is limited. Here, the typical transition occurs at single-micron particle diameters. However, trapping of single- or sub-micron biological species has highly relevant applications such as enrichment or purification of bacteria or viruses.

This knowledge of chemical composition, morphology, mineralogy, and isotopics <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> cannot be provided by remote sensing. In order to acquire these detail information in the laboratories, the samples need be intact, unmelted. Such intact <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> hypervelocity <b>particles</b> has been developed in 1996.

STARDUST, the 4 th NASA Discovery mission to capture samples from 81 P/Wild 2 and contemporary interstellar dust, is the culmination of these new technologies. In early laboratory experiments of launching hypervelocity projectiles into aerogel, there was the need to cut aerogel to isolate or extract captured particles/tracks. This is especially challenging for space captures, since there will be many particles/tracks of wide ranging scales closely located, even collocated.

40|$|Computer {{simulations}} using discrete element method (DEM) {{have been}} carried out to analyse the effect of the hydrophobic force on the selectivity of capture of binary mixtures of hydrophobic particles by a stationary bubble. Two different types of systems have been considered. In the first one, particles were initially created within a maximum distance of 1 μm from the bubble surface (spherical distribution). In the second type of systems the particles were created above the bubble. In both cases, an exponential model was used to simulate the hydrophobic force between bubble and particles. Binary mixtures made of two sets of particles of 66 μm in diameter, each of them possessing a different hydrophobicity, were simulated. The <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> was investigated for values of the strength of the hydrophobic interaction in the first set ranging between 2. 0 x 10 - 3 and 2. 0 x 10 - 5 N. The strength of the hydrophobic force between the particles in the second set and the bubble was then decreased by a maximum of 5 orders of magnitude with respect to the values in the first set. The results show that the total number of collected particles was larger for the top distribution than for the spherical one. This was due to the favouring action of gravity which pulled the particles towards the bubble in the former case and away from it in the latter case. In addition, in order to recover only particles from the first set while leaving the other particles in the bulk a reduction of the hydrophobic force strength of around 50 times was needed. It is intended that a further sophistication of this model by including fluid flow around the bubble would provide a useful tool to investigate the selective <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> in froth flotation...|$|E

The capture surface in impact parameter space is a sphere for a non-rotating black hole, and is deformed for a rotating black hole.

40|$|<b>Capture</b> <b>of</b> {{suspended}} <b>particles</b> by cylindrical collectors is {{an important}} mechanism in many aquatic processes, such as larval settlement, suspension feeding, and vegetative filtration. In these processes, the collector Reynolds number (Rec), based on the collector diameter, ranges from well below 1 to 1, 000. No analytical solutions exist to describe <b>capture</b> over most <b>of</b> this range. <b>Capture</b> is typically described by the efficiency, h, defined as {{the ratio of the}} upstream span <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> that are <b>captured</b> on the collector to the collector diameter. Here, laboratory experi-ments are used to measure <b>capture</b> efficiency <b>of</b> a single cylinder as a function <b>of</b> Rec and <b>particle</b> ratio, R, which is the ratio <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> diameter to collector diameter. Rec is varied from 50 to 500 and three values of R are used: 0. 03, 0. 015, and 0. 008. The selected particles have a specific gravity of 1. 03. For smooth cylinders, capture increases with both Rec and R but is more strongly dependent on R. This result indicates that, in aquatic systems, where flow velocity and suspended particle type and size are fixed, higher capture efficiency will occur on the smallest collectors (those with largest R). Furthermore, we examine a similar experiment in which particles are collected by branched structures. We show that capture to individual cylindrical branches within a compound structure can be predicted by single-cylinder efficiencies.

40|$|Discrete Element Method {{computer}} simulations {{have been carried}} out to analyse the influence of the hydrophobic force model on the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> by a central bubble. Two hundred particles, with diameters ranging between 24 and 66 μm, were randomly positioned within a maximum distance from the surface of a bubble of 2 mm in diameter. Initial particle velocities were random in direction and value and they followed Gaussian distributions with standard deviations between 0. 0 and 1. 0 m/s. Three possible models, named A, B and C have been used in the simulations. The models correspond to different published relationships of the hydrophobic force with the distance between particle and bubble surfaces, d. Model A corresponds to a hydrophobic force that decays in the form 1 /d; the hydrophobic force given by Model B uses a relationship in the form 1 /d²; Model C predicts a force that decays in an exponential way in the form exp(−d/λ). These models have also been compared with a base case in which the hydrophobic force only acted when the particles were in contact with the bubble. Therefore, we could better discern between the influence of the initial particle velocities and the long range component of the hydrophobic force. The differences in the capture efficiency of the particles predicted by the three models were drastic. All particles were captured by the bubble in the cases simulated using Model A for any particle–bubble surface distance smaller than 1 mm. However, only 40 % and 60 % of the particles were captured even for particles located at distances of less than 50 μm from the bubble surface in the cases simulated using Models B and C (λ = 1 μm), respectively. In fact, the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> seems to be more strongly influenced by how the hydrophobic force decays with interparticle distance in the range of tens of micrometres rather than by the differences between the models in the range of micrometres. Therefore, this work should aid in the future determination of a general hydrophobic force model through an experimental comparison of the kinetics of collision of particles against bubbles in flotation cells with the simulation results...|$|E
