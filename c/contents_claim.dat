40|$|Nutrition <b>content</b> <b>claims</b> are {{statements}} {{that relate to}} {{the presence or absence of}} nutrients, energy or biologically active substances in food. Currently in Australia, food manufacturers are permitted to make nutrition <b>content</b> <b>claims</b> as long as they can substantiate that the food component is present at the claimed levels, that is, that the claim is honest and true. Nutrition <b>content</b> <b>claims</b> can be used by food manufacturers to market food products, whereby positive nutritional attributes are emphasised to exaggerate the nutritional quality or health benefit of the product. In this way, nutrition-related claims can be misleading, with manufacturers able to promote single nutritional attributes without disclosing the product’s less healthy characteristics...|$|R

40|$|What {{is already}} {{known about this}} subject Food {{marketing}} has come under scrutiny for its likely contribution to promoting unhealthy eating and obesity in children. There is limited published evidence regarding the effects of food packaging promotions on children. Nutrient <b>content</b> <b>claims</b> and sports celebrity endorsements on food packs influence adults to prefer energy-dense and nutrient-poor (EDNP) products bearing such promotions, especially among the majority who do not read the nutrition information panel. What this study adds This study experimentally tested pre-adolescent children 2 ̆ 7 s responses to three common food marketing techniques: nutrient <b>content</b> <b>claims,</b> sports celebrity endorsements and premium offers. On-pack nutrient <b>content</b> <b>claims</b> made pre-adolescents more likely to choose EDNP products and increased perceptions of their nutrient content. Sports celebrity endorsements made pre-adolescent boys more likely to choose EDNP products. Objectives To assess pre-adolescent children 2 ̆ 7 s responses to common child-oriented front-of-pack food promotions. Methods Between-subjects, web-based experiment with four front-of-pack promotion conditions on energy-dense and nutrient-poor (EDNP) foods: no promotion [control]; nutrient content claims; sports celebrity endorsements (male athletes) and premium offers. Participants were 1302 grade 5 and 6 children (mean age 11 years) from Melbourne, Australia. Participants chose their preferred product from a randomly assigned EDNP food pack and comparable healthier food pack then completed detailed product ratings. Child-oriented pack designs with colourful, cartooned graphics, fonts and promotions were used. Results Compared to the control condition, children {{were more likely to}} choose EDNP products featuring nutrient <b>content</b> <b>claims</b> (both genders) and sports celebrity endorsements (boys only). Perceptions of nutritional content were enhanced by nutrient <b>content</b> <b>claims.</b> Effects of promotions on some product ratings (but not choice) were negated when children referred to the nutrition information panel. Premium offers did not enhance children 2 ̆ 7 s product ratings or choice. Conclusions Nutrient <b>content</b> <b>claims</b> and sports celebrity endorsements influence pre-adolescent children 2 ̆ 7 s preferences towards EDNP food products displaying them. Policy interventions to reduce the impact of unhealthy food marketing to children should limit the use of these promotions...|$|R
40|$|Although {{considerable}} research {{exists on}} consumer processing of nutrition labeling and package claims, less {{is known about}} consumer interpretation of nutrient <b>content</b> <b>claims</b> in advertising. This is important because product advertising often provides a significant first step for consumers in learning new nutrition information. Yet, unlike package claims, Nutrition Facts Panels are often not available for consumers during the processing of such advertising claims. Therefore, the authors examine the following research questions: (1) Do consumers misinterpret (i. e., overgeneralize) common nutrient <b>content</b> <b>claims</b> in advertising? If so, under what conditions does this occur? and (2) Can various types of disclosure statements remedy this problem? To address these questions, the authors interview a total of 365 primary food shoppers in three geographically dispersed malls in the United States in a between-subjects experiment. Misleading generalizations, beyond those of control ad claims, are found for general and specific nutrient <b>content</b> <b>claims.</b> Ad disclosure type, ad claim type, and nutrition knowledge all separately influence nutrient content and disease risk measures.

40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, we study {{the impact of}} Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) and {{municipal}} supply uncertainty as a driver of recycled content in practice and explore the impact of recycled <b>content</b> <b>claims</b> made as an annual average vs. batch specific claims. We formulate a two stage stochastic dynamic program, consisting of a design stage, where a recycled <b>content</b> <b>claim</b> is declared, and a procurement stage where the manufacturer has recourse to self-collection to meet the commitment. Our goal is to compare manufacturer profits and recycled content levels under batch specific and time averaged claims and explore the effect of EPP and supply-side intervention i. e. moving from single stream to dual-stream collection of recyclables. ^ Our main contributions are as follows: (a) We establish conditions under which batch specific claims are larger than time averaged claims; (b) we find that variability of supply in the municipal stream of recyclables increases (decreases) the recycled <b>content</b> <b>claim</b> if the collection cost is high (low), (c) we find that simultaneously increasing recovery of recyclables through dual-stream collection and/or container deposit legislation and creating demand side incentives for recycled content can create win-win conditions; and (d) show that EPP increases (decreases) the recycled <b>content</b> <b>claim</b> if the collection cost is sufficiently low (high). Based on analytical results, we show that demand side policies like EPP should be tailored to local supply limitations to achieve Pareto-improving outcomes for manufacturers and the environment. Our model is calibrated to data from the fiberglass insulation industry and a glass recycling study conducted in the State of Ohio. ^ In the second chapter, we {{consider the case of}} a manufacturer investing production capacity in presence of R 2 ̆ 6 D updates on development of an energy efficient technology. This problem is relevant to the development of clean energy technologies like direct drive wind turbines and energy efficient lighting, where R 2 ̆ 6 D progress is tracked over a Technology Roadmap. We build a stylized model of a manufacturer adding assembly capacity based on realized R 2 ̆ 6 D progress and calibrate it to data for the wind turbine industry. We provide option value estimates for the R 2 ̆ 6 D projects along with the timing of capacity addition. ^ In the third chapter, we consider the problem of a customer that contracts with a Product Recovery Facility (PRF) to dispose of its used electronic equipment in the most environmentally friendly manner i. e, by reuse and refurbishment or disassembly and recycling. Typical disposition contracts in the IT Asset disposition industry involve a fixed upfront payment by the customer to the PRF and a rebate for each unit resold that is credited back to the customer. We optimize the optimum transfer payment and rebate fraction, under uncertainty in condition of incoming units, while accounting for the PRFs bankruptcy risk. We find that as customers become increasingly environmentally conscious they choose a lower rebate fractions and decrease the upfront fee paid to the PRF. Moreover, as uncertainty in incoming condition and refurbishing cost increases customers again choose a lower rebate fraction. Overall, our model agrees with existing best practice in the industry i. e., customers who 2 ̆ 2 refresh 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 their IT Assets frequently keep a greater fraction of the resale value.

However, despite this explosion of front-of-package (FOP) health communications, obesity and health-related problems of U. S. consumers {{continue to be a}} critical concern. Therefore, it is important for marketers, retailers, manufacturers, and public policy makers to develop a more complete understanding of consumers 2 ̆ 7 processing and utilization of health information on food packages, as well as how this information affects product evaluations and choices. Therefore, this dissertation utilizes a processing fluency theoretical framework (e. g., Zajonc 1968; Jacoby and Dallas 1981; Novemsky et al. 2007) to attempt to increase our understanding of how FOP icons that vary in nature (i. e., subjective interpretive icons, objective quantitative icons, single nutrient <b>content</b> <b>claims)</b> affect consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions, intentions, and choices when presented both independently and simultaneously on food packages.

Studies 3 and 4 provide a stronger market-based examination of how consumers process FOP health information across multiple brands and product categories in a retail setting. These controlled retail laboratory studies overcome important limitations noted in earlier nutrition labeling studies, such as data collection and evaluations in non-store environments (e. g., Keller et al. 2007; Li, Miniard, and Barone 2000), while demonstrating how different types of FOP icons vary in their effectiveness in positively affecting consumers 2 ̆ 7 choices of healthy products from consideration sets across multiple food categories...|$|R

Results. The range of products identified included probiotic-and/or prebiotic-containing supplements (capsules), food items fortified with probiotics and/or prebiotics, and fermented food containing probiotics, e. g. dairy products. Most of the health-related claims on the labels of the identified products do not comply with proposed South African regulations. However, results also indicate that the proposed South African regulations should be reconsidered to include an additional 5 claims, for which scientifically sound evidence is available. The claims regarding probiotic strains, viable cell numbers, prebiotic type and concentration stated on the labels of the products are mostly {{in line with the}} proposed South African regulations. The actual viable cell content of 3 out of 5 probiotic supplements readily available on the South African market did not comply with the <b>content</b> <b>claim</b> stated on the label.
