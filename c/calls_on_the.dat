5|$|Bosh {{is noted}} for his leadership. When {{he was the}} leader of the Raptors, he was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to {{maintain}} his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic. However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who make bad <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> court. Throughout his career, comparisons have been made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.|$|E

Frederick, a naval officer, was {{involved}} in a mutiny and he cannot return to England without risking his life. However, without telling her father, Margaret writes to her brother in Cádiz, Spain, to tell him that their mother is dying. Margaret <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Thorntons to borrow a water mattress for her mother and is trapped while mill workers riot during a strike. When the angry mob threatens John's safety as he confronts them after Margaret's goading, Margaret defends him from the rioters and is injured by a thrown stone.|$|E

5|$|In {{the most}} celebrated episode of the Vita Sancti Paternus, King Arthur tries to steal St Padarn's tunic. King Arthur covets Padarn's tunic, and when he is refused, stamps the earth, at which Padarn <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> earth to swallow him; it does so. Arthur has to beg {{forgiveness}} before he is released. This seems to borrow {{the story of a}} different Padarn, Padarn Redcoat, whose coat was one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain). This story takes place about a century before Saint Padarn; it is, however, important because of the link drawn between Saint Padarn and the Romano-British King Arthur, the legendary British leader of the late fifth and early sixth centuries.|$|E
5|$|The BS {{struggled}} {{on for a}} time, {{funding the}} construction work by making <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unpaid portion of its shares, but activity eventually {{came to a stop}} and the partly built tunnels were left derelict. Before its collapse, the L attempted to sell its interests in the BS for £500,000 to an American consortium headed by Albert L. Johnson, but was unsuccessful. However, it attracted the interest of another American consortium headed by financier Charles Yerkes. After some months of negotiations with the L's liquidator, Yerkes purchased the company for £360,000 plus interest (£ today). He was involved in the development of Chicago's tramway system in the 1880s and 1890s. He came to London in 1900 and purchased a number of the struggling underground railway companies, The BS became a subsidiary of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) which Yerkes formed to raise funds to build the tube railways and to electrify the District Railway. The UERL was capitalised at £5million with the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which raised a total of £18million by 1903 (equivalent to approximately £ today) for use across all of the UERL's projects.|$|E
5|$|The Edict on Maximum Prices (Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium) {{was issued}} {{two to three}} months after the coinage edict, somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301. The best-preserved Latin {{inscription}} surviving from the Greek East, the edict survives in many versions, on materials as varied as wood, papyrus, and stone. In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.|$|E

Brandon <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dashwoods and explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced then abandoned his young ward, Eliza Williams, who has given birth to his child. Mrs. Ferrars (Jean Marsh) learns of Edward's engagement to Lucy and threatens to disinherit him unless he calls it off, but Edward refuses. Brandon later offers him a living on his estate at Delaford, which Edward gladly accepts. While staying with Mrs. Jennings' daughter, Marianne goes walking in a storm and collapses. Brandon finds her and brings her home, where she falls seriously ill with a fever. During Marianne's recovery, Willoughby comes to talk with Elinor. He insists that he loved Marianne and would have married her, {{but he had to}} marry a rich woman because his aunt disowned him after learning of his behaviour toward Eliza. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home and Marianne begins spending time at Delaford, eventually falling in love with Brandon. Elinor learns that Lucy Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars, and assumes that Lucy and Edward have married. However, Edward arrives at the cottage and explains to the Dashwoods that Lucy has wed his brother Robert (Leo Bill). Edward then declares his love to Elinor and proposes. They marry, as do Marianne and Brandon.|$|E
5|$|The {{dreadnought}} race {{stepped up}} in 1910 and 1911, with Germany laying down four capital ships {{each year and}} the United Kingdom five. Tension {{came to a head}} following the German Naval Law of 1912. This proposed a fleet of 33 German battleships and battlecruisers, outnumbering the Royal Navy in home waters. To make matters worse for the United Kingdom, the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Navy was building four dreadnoughts, while the Italians had four and were building two more. Against such threats, the Royal Navy could no longer guarantee vital British interests. The United Kingdom was faced with a choice of building more battleships, withdrawing from the Mediterranean, or seeking an alliance with France. Further naval construction was unacceptably expensive at a time when social welfare provision was making <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> budget. Withdrawing from the Mediterranean would mean a huge loss of influence, weakening British diplomacy in the Mediterranean and shaking the stability of the British Empire. The only acceptable option, and the one recommended by First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, was to break with the policies of the past and make an arrangement with France. The French would assume responsibility for checking Italy and Austria-Hungary in the Mediterranean, while the British would protect the north coast of France. In spite of some opposition from British politicians, the Royal Navy organised itself on this basis in 1912.|$|E
