2500|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of the lamp, the filament usually consists of multiple coils of coiled fine wire, also known as a 'coiled coil'. Light bulbs using coiled coil filaments are sometimes referred to as 'double-coil bulbs'. For a 60-watt 120-volt lamp, the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually , and the filament diameter is [...] The advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil. The <b>coiled-coil</b> <b>filament</b> evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power. As a result, the filament can then run hotter, which results in a more efficient light source, while reducing the evaporation so that the filament will last longer than a straight filament at the same temperature.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA model for thermionically assisted breakdown is proposed which predicts the voltage reduction experienced in low voltage discharges. This reduction in breakdown voltage has been beneficial to numerous engineering applications of arcs and is explored herein specifically for electrostatic thrusters. Full advantage in employing thermionically assisted breakdown is attained {{by establishing a}} continuum of electron emission across the primary discharge gap. These electrons must be independent of the discharge itself, being established prior to ignition. The electron emission is therefore achieved by auxiliary emitters across the gap. Electrons amass in a space charge {{in the vicinity of}} the assisting device. The particular processes which induce charge multiplication are proposed to be multistep ionization and neutralization of the space charge by ions. Breakdown criteria and a means of estimating the reduction is breakdown voltage requirement are derived. One proposal for the thermionically assisting emission device is the <b>coiled-coil</b> <b>filament,</b> and a scheme for installing such filaments in ionization chambers for electrostatic thrusters is described. Thermionically assisted breakdown implementation should also pertain to arc applications for various primary electrode geometries as well as certain gases. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Ciliary and flagellar microtubules {{contain a}} {{specialized}} {{set of three}} protofilaments, termed ribbons, that are composed of tubulin and several associated proteins. Previous studies of sea urchin sperm flagella identified three of the ribbon proteins as tektins, which form <b>coiled-coil</b> <b>filaments</b> in doublet microtubules and which are associated with basal bodies and centrioles. To study the function of tektins and other ribbon proteins in the assembly of flagella and basal bodies, we have begun an analysis of ribbons from the unicellular biflagellate, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and report here the molecular characterization of the ribbon protein rib 43 a. Using antibodies against rib 43 a to screen an expression library, we recovered a full-length cDNA clone that encodes a 42, 657 -Da polypeptide. On Northern blots, the rib 43 a cDNA hybridized to a 1. 7 -kb transcript, which was up-regulated upon deflagellation, consistent with a role for rib 43 a in flagellar assembly. The cDNA was used to isolate RIB 43 a, an ∼ 4. 6 -kb genomic clone containing the complete rib 43 a coding region, and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis placed the RIB 43 a gene on linkage group III. Sequence analysis of the RIB 43 a gene indicates that the substantially coiled-coil rib 43 a protein shares a high degree of sequence identity with clones from Trypanosoma cruzi and Homo sapiens (genomic, normal fetal kidney, and endometrial and germ cell tumors) but little sequence similarity to other proteins including tektins. Affinity-purified antibodies against native and bacterially expressed rib 43 a stained both flagella and basal bodies by immunofluorescence microscopy and stained isolated flagellar ribbons by immuno-electron microscopy. The structure of rib 43 a and its association with the specialized protofilament ribbons and with basal bodies is relevant to the proposed role of ribbons in forming and stabilizing doublet and triplet microtubules and in organizing their three-dimensional structure...|$|R
40|$|Stiff fibers {{are used}} as {{reinforcing}} phases {{in a wide range}} of high-performance composite materials. Silk is one of the most widely studied bio-fibers, but alternative materials with specific advantages are also being explored. Among these, native hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) slime thread is an attractive protein-based polymer. These threads consist of <b>coiled-coil</b> intermediate <b>filaments</b> (IFs) as nano-scale building blocks, which can be transformed into extended [small beta]-sheet-containing chains upon draw-processing, resulting in fibers with impressive mechanical performance. Here, we report artificial hagfish threads produced by recombinant protein expression, which were subsequently self-assembled into coiled-coil nanofilaments, concentrated, and processed into [small beta]-sheet-rich fibers by a "picking-up" method. These artificial fibers experienced mechanical performance enhancement during draw-processing. We exploited the lysine content to covalently cross-link the draw-processed fibers and obtained moduli values (E) in tension as high as [similar] 20 GPa, which is stiffer than most reported artificial proteinaceous materials...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHelical {{filaments}} {{of bacterial}} flagella are built up by a self-assembly process {{from thousands of}} flagellin subunits. To clarify how the disordered terminal regions of flagellin interact upon filament formation, polymerization ability of various terminally truncated fragments was investigated. Fragments deprived of 19 N-terminal residues were able to bind {{to the end of}} filaments, however, only a single layer was formed. Removal of C-terminal segments or truncation at both ends resulted in the complete loss of binding ability. Our observations are consistent with the <b>coiled-coil</b> model of <b>filament</b> formation, which suggests that the α-helical N- and C-terminal regions of axially adjacent subunits form an interlocking pattern of helical bundles upon polymerization...|$|R
40|$|Underlying {{the nuclear}} {{envelope}} (NE) of most eukaryotic cells is the nuclear lamina, a meshwork consisting largely of <b>coiled-coil</b> nuclear intermediate <b>filament</b> proteins that {{play a critical}} role in nuclear organization and gene expression, and are vital for the structural stability of the NE/nucleus. By confocal microscopy and micromanipulation of the NE in living cells and isolated nuclei, we show that the NE undergoes deformations without large-scale rupture and maintains structural stability when exposed to mechanical stress. In conjunction with image analysis, we have developed theory for a two-dimensional elastic material to quantify NE elastic behaviour. We show that the NE is elastic and exhibits characteristics of a continuous two-dimensional solid, including connections between lamins and the embedded nuclear pore complexes. Correlating models of NE lateral organization to the experimental findings indicates a heterogeneous lateral distribution of NE components on a mesoscopic scale...|$|R
40|$|The hair is a {{filamentous}} biomaterial {{consisting of}} the cuticle, the cortex and the medulla, all held together by the cell membrane complex. The cortex mostly consists of helical keratin proteins that spiral together to form <b>coiled-coil</b> dimers, intermediate <b>filaments,</b> micro-fibrils and macro-fibrils. We used X-ray diffraction to study hair structure on the molecular level, at length scales between ∼ 3 – 90 Å, in hopes of developing a diagnostic method for diseases affecting hair structure allowing for fast and noninvasive screening. However, such an approach can only be successful if common hair treatments do not affect molecular hair structure. We found that a single use of shampoo and conditioner {{has no effect on}} packing of keratin molecules, structure of the intermediate filaments or internal lipid composition of the membrane complex. Permanent waving treatments are known to break and reform disulfide linkages in the hair. Single application of a perming product was found to deeply penetrate the hair and reduce the number of keratin coiled-coils and change the structure of the intermediate filaments. Signals related to the coiled-coil structure of the α-keratin molecules at 5 and 9. 5 Å were found to be decreased while a signal associated with the organization of the intermediate filaments at 47 Å was significantly elevated in permed hair. Both these observations are related to breaking of the bonds between two coiled-coil keratin dimers...|$|R
