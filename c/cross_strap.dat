25|$|In ancient Egypt, {{women were}} {{generally}} bare breasted. The most common items of female attire were the skirt and the sheath dress, also {{described as a}} tunic or kalasiris, a rectangular piece of cloth that was folded once and sewn down the edge to make a tube. The kalasiris might cover one or both shoulders or be worn with shoulder straps. While the top could reach anywhere from below the breast to the neck, the bottom hem generally touched the ankles. A variant was a single <b>cross</b> <b>strap,</b> partially over the left breast. The shorter kalasiris was mostly worn by common women or slaves, to be more comfortable when working.|$|E
5000|$|Fisherman sandal {{is a type}} of T-bar sandal {{originally}} for men and boys. The toes are {{enclosed by}} a number of leather bands interwoven with the central length-wise strap that lies along the instep. An adjustable <b>cross</b> <b>strap</b> or bar is fastened with a buckle. The heel may be fully enclosed or secured by a single strap joined to the <b>cross</b> <b>strap.</b> The style appears to have originated in France.|$|E
50|$|The East German Army Commandant's Service {{was called}} the Kommandantendienst or KD, in {{addition}} to traffic control and military police duties it performed courier services. The Kommandantendienst wore a white stripe on their helmet and a white <b>cross</b> <b>strap</b> and belt , handgun holster and gloves.|$|E
50|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{uniform of}} the First Company, as far as can be determined, is substantially {{the same as the}} original one, although it has picked up elements from different time periods over the years. Tradition hold that the original uniform was copied from that of the Coldstream Guards, the personal body guard of Queen Charlotte. The uniform consists of a scarlet coat, the tails of which are faced with buff, and a black velvet frond crossed with silver braid. The vest and breeches are of buff, and the leggings are black velvet. The hat, or 'bearskin' as it is known, is of bear skin with a shield in front bearing the State Coat of Arms and supports a red and black feather plume on the side. Enlisted men wear white <b>cross</b> <b>straps.</b> Sergeants dispense with the <b>cross</b> <b>straps</b> and wear a white belt, sword and shoulder scales. Officers wear a black and silver belt, fringed epaulets, and carry a saber instead of a sword.|$|R
50|$|In many actions {{during the}} latter half of the nineteenth century, the bright red tunics worn by British {{infantry}} regiments had proved to be a liability, especially when faced by enemies armed with new rifles firing smokeless cartridges (this had been exacerbated by the white carrying equipment worn by the line infantry, the <b>cross</b> <b>straps</b> of which formed an X on the soldier's chest).|$|R
50|$|One {{very common}} {{household}} item made from palm leaflets is the Milaq (معلاق), also called Mishleib (مشلعيب).It {{is a simple}} loop {{big enough to hold}} a food container. It is made from two <b>crossed</b> <b>straps</b> of plaited palm leaflets. The Milaq is hanging freely from the ceiling, from wooden beams in the courtyard or in doorways. It is a simple and effective local utensil to protect small quantities of food from animals.|$|R
5000|$|A {{dark blue}} dress blouse and {{standard}} black Clarino Sam Browne gun belt, without the <b>cross</b> <b>strap,</b> are worn for special occasions. Dark blue work jackets are utilized for colder months. Black Commando Sweaters, or [...] "wooly pullys" [...] with proper patches and rank {{can also be}} worn by Troopers in cold weather.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to its distinctive patch, worn opposite of the regular Philadelphia P.D. patch (district patrol officers wear the regular patch on the left sleeve, with no patch on the right sleeve), {{the members of the}} Highway Patrol also wear the so-called [...] "50-Mission" [...] unstiffened cap, instead of the 8-point stiff NYPD-style cap, the full Sam Browne Belt without <b>cross</b> <b>strap,</b> (<b>cross</b> <b>strap</b> added only on the Leather Coat and Blouse coat), and knee-high black [...] "cavalry" [...] boots and breeches instead of regular trousers and shoes. They also wear a double-breasted black leather coat instead of the regular nylon patrol jacket. This uniform style, which dates back to the 1920s when the Highway Patrol officers rode around on motorcycles for all patrols. Because of the mixed use of patrol cars and motorcycles today, the only [...] "non-interchangeable" [...] item is the cap, which is replaced with a safety helmet mandated for all motorcycle officers..|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} Class A Trooper uniform {{consists of}} a light gray colored button-up shirt, with long sleeves in winter and short sleeves in summer.

50|$|Celebrates the 100th {{anniversary of}} the bra. Richard and Jonny {{discover}} that 80% of women wear the wrong size bra. In particular, this is because chest diameter and maximum breast diameter rather than the volume is measured. An English engineer doctor, Tyra, has developed a bra design with <b>crossed</b> <b>straps</b> in the back. That uses the weight of one breast to lift the other, using counterbalance. Standard designs constrict chest movement during breathing. One of the tools used in the development has been a projective differential shape body analyzer for 40 000 GBP.|$|R
30|$|Individual {{shoulder}} proprioception {{assessment was}} done using “Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer” and Biodex system III Multijoint testing and Rehabilitation System (Biodex, Medical Inc., Shirly, NY). Patient weight, height, and personal data {{were introduced in}} the system. Patient was seated with a back tilt 85 °, dynamometer orientation 20 °, and tilting 50 °. Positioning of the patient was done so the axis of rotation of the fulcrum of the dynamometer is corresponding to axis of rotation of the shoulder. Two <b>crossed</b> <b>straps</b> were used to fix the patient to the chair {{in order to obtain}} isolated shoulder movement.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "review order," [...] {{the riding}} {{breeches}} (jodhpurs) are [...] "midnight blue" [...] (virtually black) which bulge at the thigh {{in keeping with}} traditional cut with a yellow strapping (stripe) down the outside seam of each leg, and laced closed beneath the boots. The breeches are worn with braces. Finishing off the Red Serge are brown leather riding boots, known as high browns or Strathcona boots, with spurs, and a brown wide-brimmed felt campaign hat with a glass-flat brim. The ever-present side-arm, currently either a Smith & Wesson model 5946 or 3953, is carried in a brown leather holster on a brown Sam Browne belt. There is a brown leather pouch for carrying handcuffs and another for two spare pistol magazines. The Cst, Cpl, Sgt, and S/Sgt Sam Browne <b>cross</b> <b>strap</b> travels over the left shoulder. A S/Maj may have a whistle and chain on the <b>cross</b> <b>strap.</b> A white pistol lanyard is worn around the neck and connected to the side arm. [...] "Review order" [...] may be worn with [...] "full" [...] Sam Browne, or [...] "stripped" [...] Sam Browne where no lanyard, pistol, holster, or pouches are worn. Female RCMP members formerly wore {{a modified version of}} the Red Serge for review order without the high collar but now wear the same pattern of tunic as their male colleagues.|$|E

50|$|After the {{war ended}} in November 1918 and the Ministry {{restrictions}} were lifted, AJS restarted motorcycle production at a new factory at Graisley Hill in Wolverhampton and the Model D was resurrected with the capacity increased to 748cc and a new design of saddle and fuel tank. The idea of detachable cylinder heads was reintroduced with a <b>cross</b> <b>strap</b> and tie bolts to help ensure that they remained oil tight. At the Graisley Hill works AJS had their own foundry, enamelling facility, frame works and press {{as well as the}} motorcycle production line. Except for a few electrical and rubber components, the whole of the Model D was made in-house and the company also supplied engines to Brough Superior, OK Supreme and the Morgan Motor Company.|$|E
30|$|Al-Kharat and Rogers (2007) tested 16 sample {{walls with}} <b>crossed</b> <b>straps</b> in cold-formed steel frames in {{laboratory}} under cyclic and monotonic loading condition. In the {{research conducted by}} these researchers, certain criteria for behavior factor have been suggested. Scrutinizing the obtained results and comparing the results to other experiments performed by the authors (Moghimi and Ronagh 2009; Zeynalian and Ronagh 2010 a, b) and other researchers show that the X-strap-braced system is considered as a ductile system with a satisfactory shear strength; and as such {{the use of this}} kind of CFS structure can be preferable particularly in low to medium seismic regions.|$|R
5000|$|Junior {{commissioned}} officers (inspectors and above) wear similar red serge tunics; however, their collars {{are solid}} blue as are their sleeve cuffs. Officers do not wear any qualification, specialist, or service badges on their tunics. Rank is worn in the British style of metal [...] "pips" [...] and [...] "crowns" [...] on the epaulettes. The yellow stripe on officers' breeches and males' overalls is finer material and wider than Cst and NCOs. Officers' [...] "high brown" [...] boots {{are different from}} the Cst and NCOs. Officers' Sam Brownes have D-rings for sword frogs, and the <b>cross</b> <b>straps</b> travel over the right shoulder.|$|R
5000|$|Another similar {{device is}} called the [...] "Busty Cleavage Creator". It uses a pair of <b>crossed</b> velcro <b>straps</b> on the front to pull the skin towards the centre, leaving an uneven surface for the breast forms to sit against.|$|R
50|$|The Service Dress uniform {{continued}} to be the field uniform of the British Army until shortly before the Second World War, although many units {{continued to}} wear it {{after the start of}} hostilities and many Home Guard personnel wore it throughout the War. Service Dress was officially replaced as the standard combat uniform of the British and Canadian Armies in 1939, with the introduction of Battle Dress. Service Dress {{continued to be}} used by officers throughout the war, as a walking out dress and for semi-formal functions. Senior officers might rarely be seen in any other uniform. The Sam Browne belt had been replaced as carrying equipment for officers by the '37 Pattern web equipment but continued to be worn with the Service Dress, usually reduced to the belt and one brace (worn as a <b>cross</b> <b>strap),</b> though a frog or pistol holster might be added as needed).|$|E

The four men are lined up at center and are facing slightly to the right. They are {{standing in front of}} the doorway to a large brick builidng. The uniforms are all dark in color and consist of pants, jackets, hats and a badge.; Four Police Officers modeling uniforms. The first uniform is not present, the uniform with the rounded hat is from 1894 to 1904, the second uniform is 1904 to approximately 1918, the third uniform had a variety of variations and was in 1918 to 1932, the fourth uniform was 1932 to approximately 1965. The <b>cross</b> <b>strap</b> was discontinued due to officer safety. You will notice that starting from the right to left there are 3 different badges. Badge # 1 was the starburst, # 2 was the 6 point star, # 3 was the square type, # 4 was the small square type with a round copper city seal, # 5 was the oval with the eagle and # 6 is our present day badge oval with sunburst and city hall.

2500|$|Slacks of covert {{material}} {{were worn}} for certain duties, although {{the most common}} work uniform was the olive-drab, cotton utility outfit, worn with high topped shoes. The trousers had a bib-front and <b>crossed</b> <b>straps,</b> and were worn over a short sleeve, matching shirt, and topped by a long-sleeve jacket. For recreation, field nights, and physical conditioning, women Marines wore the peanut suit, so called because of its colored appearance. [...] It was a tan, seersucker, one-piece bloomer outfit, with ties {{at the bottom of}} the shorts. In keeping with the propriety of the times, the women covered their legs with a front-buttoned A-lined skirt when not actively engaged in sports, exercises, or work details.|$|R
40|$|All work {{breakdown}} structure elements containing any avionics related effort were examined for pricing the life cycle costs. The analytical, testing, and integration efforts are included for the basic onboard avionics and electrical power systems. The design and procurement of special test equipment and maintenance and repair equipment are considered. Program management associated with these efforts is described. Flight test spares and labor and materials associated with the operations and maintenance of the avionics systems throughout the horizontal flight test are examined. It was determined that cost savings {{can be achieved by}} using existing hardware, maximizing orbiter-booster commonality, specifying new equipments to MIL quality standards, basing redundancy on cost effective analysis, minimizing software complexity and reducing <b>cross</b> <b>strapping</b> and computer-managed functions, utilizing compilers and floating point computers, and evolving the design as dictated by the horizontal flight test schedules...|$|R

5000|$|For many years, the Blue Stars uniform {{was quite}} {{traditional}} and easily recognized. The helmet {{was the most}} notable tradition of the Blue Stars' uniforms--- the corps holds a trademark on its specific style. Late in the 2008 season, the helmets were exchanged for blue shakos with white plumes and a silver [...] "North Star" [...] badge on the front. White <b>cross</b> <b>straps</b> and a silver buckle over a dark blue shirt {{were a part of}} the corps uniform from the beginning through 2006, when they were eliminated for a [...] "more contemporary looking" [...] uniform that features a silver North Star. With more recent uniform redesigns, the corps switched to a white shako with a white plume. In 2014 the white plume was replaced with a red plume to emulate the classic look of the helmets previously worn by the corps.|$|R

40|$|The Gamma Ray Observatory is a NASA funded three-axis {{stabilized}} spacecraft {{which will}} carry four scientific instruments to observe gamma ray phenomena. The requirement {{to protect the}} scientific mission from system failures led to the attitude control and determination system design described in this paper. The design employs nine control modes with error detection, hardware substitution, and autonomous mode switching. The system architecture evolved to eliminate cross-dependence between the primary on-board computer (OBC) and the backup control processor electronics. <b>Cross</b> <b>strapping</b> of sensors and actuators and separation of the input/output electronics ensure that a reliable set of sensors and actuators {{will be available for}} backup mode operation. The OBC software includes failure detection, hardware reconfiguration, and mode switching logic which provide the ability to autonomously transfer, upon anomaly, to a reliable backup mode. Verification of this mode transition design is done in four test programs: at the unit level, by analytical simulation, by a hybrid breadboard electronics-simulation setup, and by a flight hardware-simulation test...|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{components}} {{included a}} belt (issued in sizes Normal and Large), <b>cross</b> <b>straps,</b> cartridge pouches for [...]303 ammunition (which {{gave way to}} 'universal' pouches to carry ammunition for an array of infantry weapons then in use by the British Army, in addition to grenades), a carrier for the waterbottle and a small pack. The large (1908) pack—intended to be carried in regimental transport except when in full marching order—and entrenching tool carrier were retained from World War I issue, although the later was initially issued in modified form before being reintroduced in 1941. Frogs for the 1907 SMLE and No.4 Rifle bayonets were also issued. Different combinations of these components comprised the 'marching order' and the 'battle order' respectively. In addition various items were issued {{to be used by}} officers and often armoured crewmen, such as pouches for binoculars, pistol ammunition and compass (externally the same as that for pistol ammunition but with felt padding inside), as well as a 'valise' side pack and holster for the [...]38 revolver (a tank crew version with leg strap also existed in two versions).|$|R
