50|$|In March 2017 the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons {{said that}} {{the high cost of}} the scheme could not be {{justified}} and its participation targets remained challenging despite being significantly reduced. The total <b>expenditure</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the scheme by the government between 2011/12 and 2019/20 is £1.5 billion. £600 million of this had been spent by April 2017, with £900 million of the expenditure remaining. Research carried out in the spring of 2017 indicated that affluent individuals are less likely to attend university if they take part in NCS, while poorer individuals are more likely to do so. At that time the cost per participant of NCS was £1,863.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper has been to extend the range of {{consequences}} implied by government regulation of privately owned firms. The analytical framework of Section II concentrated on deriving the implications of alternative degrees of regulation on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s research and development (R 2 ̆ 6 D) decisions. The analysis implies that managers of stringently regulated firms have greater incentive to neglect such activities related to the search for and production of valuable market information which increases owners 2 ̆ 7 wealth. Among other things, this implies that firms subject to more restrictive regulatory climates are more likely <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> fewer <b>expenditures</b> <b>to</b> R 2 ̆ 6 D activities. Empirical evidence from the electric power industry was presented in Section III. The results indicate that the interfirm differences in R 2 ̆ 6 D expenditures in this industry can be explained to a large extent by the variability of governmentally imposed regulatory constraints. After controlling for other determinants of R 2 ̆ 6 D behavior, the evidence reveals that electric power firms subject to the most restrictive regulatory constraints do significantly (at the 5 percent level and better) less R 2 ̆ 6 D than firms operating under the weakest regulatory constraints...|$|R

40|$|Heightened {{interest}} in the aging process by the public and scientific community has occurred due {{to the increase in}} percentage of elderly in the population and the increase in health care <b>expenditures</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the elderly [1]. Due to this increased interest, current research into aging demonstrates it as a complex process that is the result of interplay between naturally occurring processes, such as changes in hormonal levels and gene transcription that occur during the biological timeline of human development, and the exposure of our body’s systems to environmental damage [2]. At a physiological level, aging is the functional decay overtime of cells, organs and tissues, specifically through chemical damage of the cellular components proteins, DNA and lipids. The problems of aging include issues such as declining muscle tone and mass, wrinkled skin and mutant mitochondria. What is noteworthy with studies done on laboratory animals {{is that it is not}} necessary to combat individuall...|$|R
40|$|The Epithermal and Mesothermal Gold Prospectivity {{modelling}} projects {{carried out}} by Crown Minerals provided explorers in New Zealand with a new compilation of historical exploration data combined with new geological information from the GNS QMap 1 : 250, 000 scale mapping project. These data were used to produce predictive mineral potential maps for gold mineralisation in New Zealand. The aim of these projects, to stimulate mineral exploration and investment in exploration, has been successful with eight new companies acquiring new tenement positions and <b>committing</b> significant exploration <b>expenditure</b> <b>to</b> exploring in New Zealand in the coming years. The projects were done at a national scale and consequently not all exploration data were compiled into the prospectivity models. Several of the new companies recognised {{the value of the}} prospectivity modelling work and committed exploration funds to continue the modelling process. They recognised a need to compile the remaining data and run the models again to allow detailed exploration targeting. Detailed data compilations including digitising historic exploration stream sediment sample, rock chip sample, soil sample and drilling data has been completed. New models have been completed in Otago for mesothermal gold mineralisation and in the Coromandel and Northland for epithermal gold. Th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Sharp {{deterioration}} in state finance {{during the last}} decade has been a matter of serious concern to policy makers in India. The {{deterioration in}} State finance is largely an outcome of {{the fact that in the}} fact of a limited resource-base the states had to cope with a significant growth in their <b>committed</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Correcting the fiscal imbalances today is the single most important object of the new economic policy in India. The crucial issue therefore is to bring out improvement in State finance with a view <b>to</b> restructuring the <b>expenditure</b> in favour of development <b>expenditure</b> in order <b>to</b> enable a higher growth. The states took policy measures which helped them to avoid further worsening of their fiscal position to some extent. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has set a target of reducing fiscal deficit to 3 % of GDP for States latest by 2014 - 15. The present study attempts to bring out the emerging trends in state finances of India in recent years...|$|R

The author identifies five basic fears in humans: fear of being rejected, abandoned, humiliated, betrayed and the victim of an injustice. The stock market investor is confronted with the following fears: the disposition effect, the hedonistic approach, the effect of the <b>committed</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the snake bite effect, the dismissal of any regret (or the no regret approach), the status quo prejudice and the endowment effect. The author shows that the stock investor’s seven fears are specific cases of the five basic fears. The first step in confronting these fears is to become aware of the mask worn...|$|R
