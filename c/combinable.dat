25|$|In {{and around}} the Hesselberg area there are many trails. The two main trails have many signs {{containing}} information for the hiker. The geological nature trail, which is 3km long, leads from its starting point near Wittelshofen to the mountain's peak. The signs along the route tell of the geological history {{and structure of the}} mountain. The Hesselberg-trail forms a round-trip of Hesselberg's heights. Both trails are well <b>combinable.</b> The Osterwiese is meeting point for model plane pilots, the launch areas for hang-gliders and paragliders can be found there too. The regional gliding airfield is in nearby Irsingen. Sporting clays was prohibited by the Nature Conservation Agency due to lead exposure. The Hesselberg Tourist Office, the Bund Naturschutz in Bayern (Bavarian Nature Conservation Alliance) (Ansbach district group), and the Landesbund für Vogelschutz in Bayern (Bavarian State Bird Conservation Alliance) (Ansbach district group) organise guided excursions and walking tours. At the mountain's foot anglers can indulge their passion at the Wörnitz and Sulzach rivers. The German Alpine Association (Hesselberg section with an office in Bechhofen) have built a small hut on the northern slope in order to support winter sports.|$|E

He then created an elaborate neon ceiling called [...] "Luce spaziale" [...] in 1951 for the Triennale in Milan. In his important series of Concetto spaziale, La Fine di Dio (1963–64), Fontana uses the egg shape. With his Pietre (stones) series, begun in 1952, Fontana fused the sculptural with painting by encrusting the surfaces of his canvases with heavy impasto and colored glass. In his Buchi (holes) cycle, begun in 1949-50, he punctured {{the surface of his}} canvases, breaking the membrane of two-dimensionality in order to highlight the space behind the picture. From 1958 he purified his paintings by creating matte, monochrome surfaces, thus focusing the viewer’s attention on the slices that rend the skin of the canvas. In 1959 Fontana exhibited cut-off paintings with multiple <b>combinable</b> elements (he named the sets quanta), and began Nature, a series of sculptures made by cutting a gash across a sphere of terracotta clay, which he subsequently cast in bronze.|$|E

In its own nature it belongs to a private aspiration; and being conditional, like all religious acts not expressed in Scripture, and therefore not <b>combinable</b> with a perfect faith, it is something between prayer and wish,--an act of natural piety sublimed by Christian hope, that shares in the light, and meets the diverging rays, of faith, though it be not contained in the focus.|$|E

It is very {{difficult}} to find cases amongst solutions or fluids which shall illustrate this point, because of the difficulty of finding two fluids which shall conduct, shall not mingle, and in which an element evolved from one shall not find a <b>combinable</b> element in the other. Solutions of acids or alkalies will not answer, because they exist by virtue of an attraction; and increasing the solubility of a body in one direction, and diminishing it in the opposite, is just as good a reason for transfer, as modifying the affinity between the acids and alkalies themselves[A]. Nevertheless the case of sulphate of magnesia is in point (494. 495.), and shows that one element or principle only has no power of transference or of passing towards either pole.|$|E

There are some, such as carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, silicon, boron, alumium, the right of which to the title of ion it is desirable to decide as soon as possible. There are also many compound bodies, and amongst them alumina and silica, which it is desirable to class immediately by unexceptionable experiments. It is also possible, that all <b>combinable</b> bodies, compound as well as simple, may enter into the class of ions; but at present {{it does not seem to}} me probable. Still the experimental evidence I have is so small in proportion to what must gradually accumulate around, and bear upon, this point, that I am afraid to give a strong opinion upon it.|$|E
6000|$|... 613. Dr. Fusinieri {{has also}} written on this subject, and given a theory which he {{considers}} as sufficient {{to account for the}} phenomena[A]. He expresses the immediate cause thus: [...] "The platina determines upon its surface a continual renovation of concrete laminæ of the combustible substance of the gases or vapours, which flowing over it are burnt, pass away, and are renewed: this combustion at the surface raises and sustains the temperature of the metal." [...] The combustible substance, thus reduced into imperceptible laminæ, of which the concrete parts are in contact with the oxygen, is presumed to be in a state <b>combinable</b> with the oxygen at a much lower temperature than when it is in the gaseous state, and more in analogy with what is called the nascent condition. That combustible gases should lose their elastic state, and become concrete, assuming the form of exceedingly attenuated but solid strata, is considered as proved by facts, some of which are quoted in the Giornale di Fisica for 1824[B]; and though the theory requires that they should assume this state at high temperatures, and though the similar films of aqueous and other matter are dissipated by the action of heat, still the facts are considered as justifying the conclusion against all opposition of reasoning.|$|E

Thus, a cultural system has been created by forced imposition of Eurocentric values that is in opposition to the existing values.|$|E

50|$|The {{characteristic}} greenish-gray {{to brown}} color of ordinary Portland cement derives {{from a number}} of transition elements in its chemical composition. These are, in decreasing order of coloring effect, chromium, manganese, iron, copper, vanadium, nickel and titanium. The amount of these in white cement is minimized as far as possible. Cr2O3 is kept below 0.003%, Mn2O3 is kept below 0.03%, and Fe2O3 is kept below 0.35% in the clinker. The other elements are usually not a significant problem. Portland cement is usually made from cheap, quarried raw materials, and these usually contain substantial amounts of Cr, Mn and Fe. For example, limestones used in cement manufacture usually contain 0.3-1% Fe2O3, whereas levels below 0.1% are sought in limestones for white manufacture. Typical clays used in gray cement rawmix may contain 5-15% Fe2O3. Levels below 0.5% are desirable, and conventional clays are usually replaced with kaolin. Kaolin is fairly low in SiO2, and so a large amount of sand is usually also included in the mix. Iron and manganese usually occur together in nature, so that selection of low-iron materials usually ensures that manganese content is also low, but chromium can arise from other sources, notably from the wear of chrome steel grinding equipment during the production of rawmix. See rawmill. This wear is exacerbated by the high sand-content of the mix, which makes it extremely abrasive. Furthermore, to make a <b>combinable</b> rawmix, the sand must be ground to below 45 μm particle diameter. Often this is achieved by grinding the sand separately, using ceramic grinding media to limit the chromium contamination.|$|E
