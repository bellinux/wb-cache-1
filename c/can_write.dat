5|$|Bell {{explained}} that he, Jed Whedon, and Tancharoen supervise {{all of the}} series' creative decisions, often consulting with Loeb. When the showrunners are writing the series, one person <b>can</b> <b>write</b> a script while the other two break stories, so that a story can be broken every few weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, {{a member of the}} series' writers room then produces an outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{data mining}} tools like a {{decision}} tree and neural net were added with version 5 {{as well as}} Linux support, which was later withdrawn in JMP 9. Later in 2005, JMP 6 was introduced. JMP began integrating with SAS in version 7.0 in 2007 and has strengthened this integration ever since. Users <b>can</b> <b>write</b> SAS code in JMP, connect to SAS servers, and retrieve and use data from SAS. Support for bubble plots was added in version 7. JMP 7 also improved data visualization and diagnostics.|$|E

It meant something to someone.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} {{does not}} place any {{limits on the}} possible dimensions of spacetime. Although the theory is typically formulated in four dimensions, one <b>can</b> <b>write</b> down the same equations for the gravitational field {{in any number of}} dimensions. Supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on the number of dimensions. In 1978, work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven. In the same year, Eugene Cremmer, Bernard Julia, and Joel Scherk of the École Normale Supérieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and {{the game}} ends {{immediately}} if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player <b>can</b> <b>write</b> down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues {{as to what the}} player should do next, features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien language.|$|E

25|$|In his introduction, Mailer details his {{conflicted}} {{attitude toward}} the short story and casts doubt on his own abilities to write a good one.

25|$|A {{transposition}} is a permutation which exchanges {{two elements}} and keeps all others fixed; for example (1 3) is a transposition. Every permutation <b>can</b> be <b>written</b> {{as a product}} of transpositions; for instance, the permutation g from above <b>can</b> be <b>written</b> as g = (1 2)(2 5)(3 4). Since g <b>can</b> be <b>written</b> {{as a product of}} an odd number of transpositions, it is then called an odd permutation, whereas f is an even permutation.|$|R
