5|$|In deposit, the spore {{color of}} Rhodotus palmatus has been {{described}} most commonly as pink, but also as cream colored. Viewed microscopically, the spores of Rhodotus have a roughly spherical shape, with dimensions of 6–7.2 by 5.6–6.5µm; the spore surface is marked with numerous wart-like projections (defined as verricose), typically 0.5–0.7µm long.

5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} white spore print. Spores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 3.5–5 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped and four-spored, with dimensions of 18–22 by 5–5.6μm. H.nidulans has a monomitic hyphal system, containing only generative hyphae with clamp connections. In the flesh, these hyphae are thick-walled and highly branched, measuring up to 10μm in diameter; hyphae comprising the pores and the subhymenium are thinner (up to 6μm wide) and less branched. A <b>chemical</b> <b>test</b> {{can be used}} to help identify H.nidulans: all parts of the fruit body will instantly stain bright violet if a drop of an alkaline solution is applied. Dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH), is often used for this purpose.|$|E

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Ramariopsis kunzei are white to whitish-yellow in color, and are highly {{branched}} structures resembling coral; the dimensions are typically up to [...] tall and [...] wide. Older specimens {{may have a}} pinkish tinge. The tips of the branches are blunt, not crested as in some other species of coral fungi, like Clavulina cristata; branches are between 1 and 5millimeters thick. The branch tips of mature specimens may be yellow. A stem, if present, may be up to [...] long and scurfy—covered with small flakes or scales. The texture of the flesh may range from pliable to brittle. This fungus does not undergo any color changes upon bruising or injury, however, a 10%solution of FeSO4 (a <b>chemical</b> <b>test</b> known as [...] "iron salts") applied to the flesh will turn it green.|$|E
500|$|The {{spore print}} is whitish. The spores are roughly spherical, {{translucent}} (hyaline), and typically measure 7.5–10.0 by 7.5–9.0µm. The spore surface is —covered with ridges that form a complete network. The ridges {{are up to}} 0.8µm high and have conspicuous projections up to 1.2µm high. The spore-bearing cells of the hymenium, the basidia, are club-shaped, hyaline, four-spored, and have dimensions of 40–62 by 7.2–10.4µm. Interspersed among the basidia are sterile cells called cystidia. The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the side of}} a gill) are roughly spindle- to club-shaped, and measure 48–145 by 5–13µm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of a gill) may be spindle-, club-, or awl-shaped (...) , or intermediate in between these forms, and measure 27–60 by 5–7µm. Additionally, there are cystidia present on both the surface of the cap and the stem. If a drop of ferric sulphate (used as a <b>chemical</b> <b>test</b> in mushroom identification) is applied to the mushroom flesh, it will immediately stain dark bluish-green.|$|E
500|$|The white stipe is [...] by [...] thick, solid (i.e., not hollow), and tapers {{slightly}} upward. The surface, {{in young}} specimens especially, is frequently floccose (covered with tufts of soft hair), fibrillose (covered with small slender fibers), or squamulose (covered with small scales); {{there may be}} fine grooves along its length. The bulb {{at the base of}} the stipe is spherical or nearly so. The delicate ring on the upper part of the stipe is a remnant of the partial veil that extends from the cap margin to the stalk and covers the gills during development. It is white, thin, membranous, and hangs like a skirt. When young, the mushrooms are enveloped in a membrane called the universal veil, which stretches from the top of the cap to the bottom of the stipe, imparting an oval, egg-like appearance. In mature fruit bodies, the veil's remnants form a membrane around the base, the volva, like an eggshell-shaped cup. On occasion, however, the volva remains underground or gets torn up during development. It is white, sometimes lobed, and may become pressed closely to the stipe. The volva is up to [...] in height (measured from the base of the bulb), and is about 2mm thick midway between the top and the base attachment. The mushroom's odor has been described as [...] "pleasant to somewhat nauseous", becoming more [...] as the fruit body ages. The cap flesh turns yellow when a solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH, 5–10%) is applied (a common <b>chemical</b> <b>test</b> used in mushroom identification). This characteristic chemical reaction is shared with A.ocreata and A.virosa, although some authors have expressed doubt about the identity of North American A.virosa, suggesting those collections may represent four-spored A.bisporigera. Tulloss suggests that reports of A.bisporigera that do not turn yellow with KOH were actually based on white forms of A.phalloides. Findings from the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona and in central Mexico, although [...] "nearly identical" [...] to A.bisporigera, do not stain yellow with KOH; their taxonomic status has not been investigated in detail.|$|E

2500|$|The word arsenic has {{its origin}} in the Syriac word [...] (al) zarniqa, from the Persian word [...] zarnikh, meaning [...] "yellow" [...] (literally [...] "gold-colored") and hence [...] "(yellow) orpiment". It was adopted into Greek as arsenikon (...) , a form that is folk etymology, being the neuter form of the Greek word arsenikos (...) , meaning [...] "male", [...] "virile". The Greek word was adopted in Latin as arsenicum, which in French became arsenic, from which the English word arsenic is taken. Arsenic sulfides (orpiment, realgar) and oxides have been known and used since ancient times. Zosimos (circa 300 AD) {{describes}} roasting sandarach (realgar) to obtain cloud of arsenic (arsenic trioxide), which he then reduces to metallic arsenic.

But I now began to perceive a reason for its failure, and for a fact which I had observed long before (315. 316.) with regard to the iodide of potassium, namely, that bodies would differ in facility of decomposition by a given electric current, according to the condition and intensity of their ordinary chemical affinities. This reason appeared in their re-action upon the affinities tending to cause the current; and it appeared probable, that many substances might be found which could be decomposed by the current of a single pair of zinc and platina plates immersed in dilute sulphuric acid, although water resisted its action. I soon found this to be the case, and as the experiments offer new and beautiful proofs of the direct relation and opposition of the chemical affinities concerned in producing and in resisting the stream of electricity, I shall briefly describe them.|$|E
60|$|They {{entered a}} region where mineral abounded, and their march became slower. Generally they took {{the course of a}} wash, one on each side, and let the burros travel leisurely along nipping at the {{bleached}} blades of scant grass, or at sage or cactus, while they searched in the canyons and under the ledges for signs of gold. When they found any rock that hinted of gold they picked off a piece and gave it a <b>chemical</b> <b>test.</b> The search was fascinating. They interspersed the work with long, restful moments when they looked afar down the vast reaches and smoky shingles to the line of dim mountains. Some impelling desire, not all the lure of gold, took them to the top of mesas and escarpments; and here, when they had dug and picked, they rested and gazed out at the wide prospect. Then, as the sun lost its heat and sank lowering to dent its red disk behind far-distant spurs, they halted in a shady canyon or likely spot in a dry wash and tried for water. When they found it they unpacked, gave drink to the tired burros, and turned them loose. Dead mesquite served for the campfire. While the strange twilight deepened into weird night they sat propped against stones, with eyes on the dying embers of the fire, and soon they lay on the sand with the light of white stars on their dark faces.|$|E

6000|$|An {{interesting}} illustration, in late years, of {{the operation}} of a [...] discriminating duty {{is to be found}} in the case of different grades [...] of sugar imported into the United States. Our tariff levied [...] certain duties on different grades of sugar classified by color, [...] on the theory that color was a test of saccharine strength. [...] Cargoes were examined and compared with graded sugars hermetically [...] sealed in glass bottles and distributed by the Dutch authorities, [...] whence came the name of “Dutch standard.” Grades from No. 1 [...] (melado) to No. 10 must go to the refiner before consumption; but [...] the grades to No. 13, although some might have gone into immediate [...] consumption, were usually sent to be manufactured into the highest [...] grades of soft and hard sugars. So long as the sugar was secured [...] by evaporation in open coppers, or by passing the molasses through [...] a layer of clay, saccharine strength and color went fairly well [...] together. But with the invention of the vacuum-pan and the [...] centrifugal wheel, by which the sugar is reduced through a shorter [...] and more effective process, sugar of a certain grade of color by [...] the Dutch standard contained a much greater degree of sweetness [...] than that produced by the old methods. Cuban planters, therefore, [...] were permitted to send sugar into this country at a duty which was [...] really levied on grades much inferior, and so paid a less duty [...] than other sugars. The products of one country were discriminated [...] against in favor of another.

The presence of the gipsies, {{and the use of}} the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any <b>chemical</b> <b>test</b> was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training.

It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.|$|E
