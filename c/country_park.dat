50|$|To {{conserve}} and, where appropriate, open up {{the countryside}} for the greater enjoyment of the population, the <b>Country</b> <b>Parks</b> Ordinance was enacted in 1976 to provide a legal framework for the designation, development and management of <b>Country</b> <b>Parks</b> and Special Areas. It provides {{for the establishment of}} a <b>Country</b> and Marine <b>Parks</b> Board to advise the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation who, as <b>Country</b> and Marine <b>Parks</b> Authority, is responsible for all matters on <b>Country</b> <b>Parks</b> and Special Areas.|$|R
40|$|Visitor {{numbers in}} Hong Kong’s <b>Country</b> <b>Parks</b> are increasing, {{but there has}} not been an {{established}} crowd-management strategy. This study intended to examine the following areas in relation to the recreational use of <b>country</b> <b>parks</b> and accessibility, namely: the relationship between visitor distribution and site accessibility; types of recreational activities performed inside Country Parks; characteristics of park visitors and the social carrying capacity of Hong Kong <b>Country</b> <b>Parks.</b> Questionnaire surveys revealed that, in general, visitors felt that Hong Kong’s <b>Country</b> <b>Parks</b> were approaching their limits of social carrying capacity. In addition, while visitors liked to travel on more comfortable grounds, some access difficulties were still preferred. Sites that are too easy to access may not be attractive to certain visitors. The current study also showed that the most popular activities performed by visitors in <b>Country</b> <b>Parks</b> were hiking, photography, barbecuing, picnicking and camping. New activities such as river trekking, rock climbing that penetrate into the remote parts of the <b>Country</b> <b>Parks</b> also received significant popularity. By comparing visitors and non-visitors, results showed that people who have visited the <b>Country</b> <b>Parks</b> were more likely to treasure the intrinsic values of the natural environment; visitors {{were also more likely to}} consider how the natural environment could serve their own recreational benefits. Results of this study might have management implications to park managers and policy-makers in the planning, design and future use of Hong Kong <b>Country</b> <b>Parks.</b> published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

5|$|Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) {{are located}} {{close to the}} banks of the Irwell, near to its {{confluence}} with the River Croal at Moses Gate <b>Country</b> <b>Park</b> near Bolton. The first is at Nob End, a 88 800 m² site which has been designated because of its biological interest, based on the predominance of flora typical of limestone grassland including some nationally rare herbs and orchids. Nob End is also designated as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR). The second site is Ashclough, which is a site of geological interest. These two SSSIs are among the 21 found in Greater Manchester. In Salford the river flows through Clifton <b>Country</b> <b>Park</b> and Kersal Dale <b>Country</b> <b>Park,</b> both of which have been designated as LNRs.|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom {{the term}} 'country park' {{has a special}} meaning. There are around 250 {{recognised}} <b>Country</b> <b>Parks</b> in England and Wales attracting some 57 million visitors a year. Most <b>country</b> <b>parks</b> were designated in the 1970s, under the Countryside Act 1968, {{with the support of}} the former Countryside Commission. In more recent times there has been no specific financial support for <b>country</b> <b>parks</b> directly, and fewer have been designated.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of environmental education is to promote environmental friendly attitudes and environmentally responsible behaviour. In this study, whether the Hong Kong <b>country</b> <b>parks</b> can fulfil one of their purposes to provide environmental education to the young people and have positive influence on their environmental attitudes was examined. This study showed that the participation pattern {{of the young people}} in <b>country</b> <b>parks</b> was very low. <b>Country</b> <b>parks</b> are not fully utilized by youth and the aim of environmental education cannot be actualized among all the young people. Therefore, more actions, with the help of non-governmental organizations and promotion of ecotourism, are needed to attract more young participants to visit <b>country</b> <b>parks.</b> Environmental attitudes of participants from two samples were measured by using the New Environmental or Ecological Paradigm (NEP) Scale. It was found that frequent visitations to <b>country</b> <b>parks</b> can lead to more, but not significantly more, endorsement to pro-ecological worldview. Participating in environmental knowledge-based field studies courses also has similar impacts on environmental attitudes; however, to a smaller extent than that of visiting <b>country</b> <b>parks.</b> The study suggests a new direction for environmental education in Hong Kong. Adding more knowledge-based environmental education elements in the current natural settings of Hong Kong <b>country</b> <b>parks</b> will be more beneficial to young people to have better environmental friendly attitudes and environmentally responsible behaviour. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R
