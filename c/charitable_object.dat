2500|$|From {{the fourteenth}} century, Bethlem had been {{referred}} to colloquially as [...] "Bedleheem", [...] "Bedleem" [...] or [...] "Bedlam". Initially [...] "Bedlam" [...] was an informal name but from approximately the Jacobean era the word entered everyday speech to signify a state of madness, chaos, and the irrational nature of the world. This development was partly due to Bedlam's staging in several plays of the Jacobean and Caroline periods, including The Honest Whore, Part I (1604); Northward Ho (1607); The Duchess of Malfi (1612); The Pilgrim (c. 1621); and The Changeling (1622). This dramatic interest in Bedlam is also evident in references to it in early seventeenth-century plays such as Epicœne, or The Silent Woman (1609), [...] (1614), and A New Way to Pay Old Debts (c. 1625). The appropriation of Bedlam as a theatrical locale for the depiction of madness probably owes no little debt to the establishment in 1576 in nearby Moorfields of The Curtain and The Theatre, two of the main London playhouses; it {{may also have been}} coincident with that other theatricalisation of madness as <b>charitable</b> <b>object,</b> the commencement of public visiting at Bethlem.|$|E

60|$|Without {{another word}} Caroline {{put on her}} bonnet and departed. It may, perhaps, appear strange that neither she nor Shirley thought of {{consulting}} Mrs. Pryor on their scheme; but they were wise in abstaining. To have consulted her--and this they knew by instinct--would only have been to involve her in painful embarrassment. She was far better informed, better read, a deeper thinker than Miss Ainley, but of administrative energy, of executive activity, she had none. She would subscribe her own modest mite to a <b>charitable</b> <b>object</b> willingly--secret almsgiving suited her; but in public plans, on a large scale, she could take no part; as to originating them, {{that was out of}} the question. This Shirley knew, and therefore she did not trouble Mrs. Pryor by unavailing conferences, which could only remind her of her own deficiencies, and do no good.|$|E

60|$|The legend now {{crosses the}} Atlantic, and {{comes down to}} our own {{immediate}} time. In a certain church of our city, not many evenings ago, there was a contribution for a <b>charitable</b> <b>object.</b> A fervid preacher had poured out his whole soul in a rich and tender discourse, which had at least excited the tears, and perhaps the more effectual sympathy, of a numerous audience. While the choristers sang sweetly, and the organ poured forth its melodious thunder, the deacons passed {{up and down the}} aisles, and along the galleries, presenting their mahogany boxes, in which each person deposited whatever sum he deemed it safe to lend to the Lord, in aid of human wretchedness. Charity became audible,--chink, chink, chink,--as it fell, drop by drop, into the common receptacle. There was a hum,--a stir,--the subdued bustle of people putting their hands into their pockets; while, ever and anon, a vagrant coin fell upon the floor, and rolled away, with long reverberation, into some inscrutable corner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ladies and gentlemen: Mrs. Westangle {{has chosen}} me, because a {{real-estate}} broker is sometimes an auctioneer, {{and may be}} supposed to have the gift of oratory, to make known the conditions on which you may interview the ghosts which {{you are going to}} see. Anybody may do it who will comply with the conditions. In the first place, you have got to be serious, and to think up something that you would really like to know about your past, present, or future. Remember, this is no joking matter, and the only difference between the ghost that you will see here and a real materialization under professional auspices is that the ghost won't charge you anything. Of course, if any lady or gentleman--especially lady--wishes to contribute to any <b>charitable</b> <b>object,</b> after a satisfactory interview with the ghost, a hat will be found at the hall-door for the purpose, and Mrs. Westangle will choose the object: I have put in a special plea for my own firm, at a season when the real-estate business is not at its best." [...] By this time Bushwick had his audience laughing, perhaps the more easily because they were all more or less in a hysterical mood, which, whether we own it or not, is always induced by an approximation to the supernatural. He frowned and said, [...] "NO laughing!" [...] and then they laughed the more. When he had waited for them to be quiet he went on gravely, [...] "The conditions are simply these: Each person who chooses may interview the ghost, keeping a respectful distance, but not so far off but that the ghost can distinctly hear a stage whisper. The question put must be seriously meant, and it must be the question which the questioner would prefer to have answered above everything else at the time being. Certain questions will be absolutely ruled out, such as, 'Does Maria love me?' or, 'Has Reuben ever been engaged before?' The laughter interrupted the speaker again, and Verrian hung his head in rage and shame; this stupid ass was spoiling the hope of anything beautiful in the spectacle and turning it into a gross burlesque. Somehow he felt that the girl who had invented it had meant, in the last analysis, something serious, and it was in her behalf that {{he would have liked to}} choke Bushwick. All the time he believed that Miss Macroyd, whose laugh sounded above the others, was somehow enjoying his indignation and divining its reason.|$|E

50|$|In 1981 the UK Association of Carers {{was formed}} by Judith Oliver, Sandra Leventon and others, aided by a grant of £9,879 from the Equal Opportunities Commission.

The group campaigned fiercely for Invalid Care Allowance to be extended to married women.
