The Gemini was assembled in Australia at Acacia Ridge in Queensland and Holden was still the highest selling brand. The Chevrolet LUV produced by Isuzu was also sold from 1973 for a couple of years, the only official Chevrolet branded model available in Australia at the time (and since). Ford sold the Taurus in Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong in 1996, but discontinued in those markets for 1999. In 1998, the Chevrolet Suburban, was marketed in Australia and New Zealand as a rebadged Holden Suburban with intentions to launch the full-sized SUV in a region that was used to having small to mid-sized SUVs, and the model was discontinued in 2001.|$|E

This study examines two <b>cobranding</b> decisions facing a firm: the <b>cobranding</b> structure and the selec-tion of a partner. Propositions rooted in the theories of attribu-tion and categorization posit (a) how the levels of <b>cobranding</b> integration, exclusivity, and duration influence brand evalua-tion and consideration and (b) how consistency with the partner brand in hedonic attributes, complementarity in functional attributes, and brand breadth moderate the effect of partnership structure. Higher integration or longer duration likely has {{a greater impact on}} evaluation and consideration; an exclusive arrangement has a greater effect on evaluation but lowers consideration. For managers, these propositions are directly applicable; the outcomes of brand evaluation and consideration map onto the strategic goals of brand development and market development, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{situation}} {{in the labor market}} is constantly changing and becoming more challenging for individuals attempting to either get employed or to advance their careers. In many fields the competition has intensified in an unprecedented manner because of difficult economic times and structural changes. Personal branding has been presented as the tool to gain competitive advantage and social media as the main channel for practical implementation. This study aims to understand how personal branding, the purpose of which is aiding one to advancing his or her career, is carried out in a niche industry where success is arbitrary and education, skills and experience have a lesser effect. Thus, the importance of personal branding on social media should amplify. The fashion industry and models in particular were chosen as the field of interest for the aforementioned reasons, and for the industry's natural incline towards the significance of branding. The chosen method for empirical research is interviewing. Five semi-structured interviews were conducted {{face to face with the}} informants, which include one model agent and four working models who are all in different stages of their career, and who are variously popular in social media. Two interview templates were created; one for the discussion with the model agent and one for the discussions with the models. Prosperous <b>cobranding</b> arrangements was found as one of the practical benefits models can obtain with the help of personal branding, thus combining personal branding theories with <b>cobranding</b> theories is a key theoretical contribution of this research.

40|$|<b>Cobranding</b> is {{a popular}} {{marketing}} strategy employed by many of today’s leading brands. It often involves two parent brands joining forces to launch a new product line. For example, Bulgari and Ritz-Carlton jointly market the Bulgari hotels and resorts. Nike and Apple brought music and exercise together when develop the Sports Kit. The choice of which company to team up with is always a concern to marketing academics and practitioners. The image consistency theory suggests that brands should collaborate with those who share similar brand personality. Little research addresses how consumers respond to cobrands with two distinct and conflicting brand personalities. Given that much of branding strategies involves creating a desired personality, which has been linked directly to consumer preference (Aaker 1999), this gap is significant...|$|E
40|$|Co-branding {{is a form}} of {{cooperation}} between two brands with significant consumer recognition that results in the creation and introduction of a new product on which both brands are visible. Although co-branding results in the creation and introduction of a new product through collaboration, the current literature on <b>cobranding</b> focuses on either the creation (i. e., NPD literature) or the introduction (i. e., marketing literature) of the product. As new product success partly depends on a properly executed brand strategy (Keller, 2008), it is relevant to better understand the interaction between these two aspects. The main aim of this doctoral thesis was to provide an integrated view of both the marketing and NPD literatures and hence to discuss both the brand partnership and the new product simultaneously in relation to the co-branding strategy. This research project had four underlying goals. First, this project provided more conceptual clarity on the co-branding strategy by examining the use of <b>cobranding</b> in the past and present (studies 1 and 2). Second, it aimed to improve our understanding of the consumer evaluation of co-branded products by explicitly taking the role of the new product into account (study 3). Third, this project examined the consumers’ perception of a new co-branded product and it showed how consumers may consider the presence of one brand on the new co-branded product to make more sense than the other brand’s presence on the new product (study 4, 5 and 6). Fourth, this project aimed to clarify the relevance of simultaneously discussing the collaboration between the brands during NPD and the perception of the new product after introduction by focusing on the influence of the new product’s visual design on new product perception and evaluation (study 6) ...|$|E

40|$|As people acquire {{knowledge}} of the world through their senses, a perceptual brand experience is the most effective and immediate source for a brand to create an impression {{in the mind of the}} consumer. A “sensory signature,” which is a unique sensory aspect of a brand, is a storehouse of brand-related information that distinguishes a brand from its competing brands. In this thesis the sensory signature of brand, because of its unique nature, is proposed as an effective brand cue that can help retrieve and activate brand meanings easily. This thesis argues that as the perceptual experience provided by a sensory signature is powerful enough to distinguish the brand from others, the sensory signature is expected to access brand memory easily and activate a wide array of brand meanings. Thus, using the Meaning Transfer Model and Grounded Cognition, this research aims to understand the efficacy of sensory signature in the transfer of brand meanings in a <b>cobranding</b> context by asking the following broad research question: Whether, and how does, a sensory signature contribute to the transfer of brand meanings in a <b>cobranding</b> context? The efficacy of sensory signature as an effective brand cue is investigated by conducting a series of five experimental studies. Using both explicit and reaction-time measures, Experiments 1 and 2 not only show that sensory signature can activate brand-relevant meanings, but they also verify sensory signature efficacy as an operable and effective brand cue that is comparable to the most widely used brand cues, such as a brand name. In particular, Experiment 2 shows the path through which the sensory signature drives the meaning transfer process, through using different types of brand meanings (i. e., perceptual and semantic brand meanings). Experiment 3 provides supporting evidence to show that the effects observed from Experiment 2 are derived from the signatory perceptual feature, the signature taste, and not from other taste-related characteristics. Experiment 4 investigates the impact of a verbal description of a sensory signature, assuming that the simulation of experiencing a sensory signature from reading the description will act as effectively in transferring brand meanings as an actual experience. Interestingly, however, the finding shows that a verbal description of the sensory signature is not effective in either transferring semantic brand meanings or positively influencing product attitude. Rather, the verbal description of key semantic brand meanings performs as an effective brand cue, positively influencing attitude toward the cobranded product. Experiment 5 shows that it is the presence of the product picture that can effectively encourage the simulation of a sensory signature. Combined, the findings of five experiments address the research question and demonstrate the efficacy of a sensory signature as an effective brand cue, that is comparable to a brand name in transferring brand meanings to a cobranded product. The thesis builds on prior research on <b>cobranding,</b> the Meaning Transfer Model, and Grounded Cognition by enriching the current understanding of the factors that shape and determine the attitude and subsequent behaviour of consumers when products are cobranded...|$|E

In a 2 [*]×[*] 2 experimental design using real consumers (N[*]=[*] 122) in a shopping context, it found that, depending on brand equity, the marginal effect of organic labelling information in terms of perceived product quality varies.

40|$|Cobrands (or brand alliances) are {{increasingly}} popular {{as a viable}} strategic option for commercial success. Yet the impact of perceptions towards the parent brands’ positioning strategies on consumer evaluation of the cobrands has not been investigated so far. Our study examines the role of positioning strategies in consumer evaluation of cobrands. Employing an experimental design, we create three <b>cobranding</b> scenarios in different product categories (tablets, cosmetics and smart phones). The data are collected via structured questionnaires resulting in 160 valid responses. In line with the conceptual model and research objectives, consumer evaluation of cobrands is tested {{in relationship to the}} prior positioning of the parent brands, product fit and brand fit. The results confirm brand positioning as a robust indicator of consumer evaluation of cobrands. Our finding suggests that post-positioning strategies of parent brands are influenced by positioning of the cobrand, which in turn is influenced by the positioning of the parent brands in the alliance. Parent brands were found to ‘adopt’ the positioning perception of its partner. The findings have managerial implications for designing appropriate positioning strategies for cobrands.

40|$|PRODUCT) RED TM (hereafter RED) is a <b>cobranding</b> {{initiative}} {{launched in}} 2006 by the aid celebrity Bono {{to raise money}} from product sales to support The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In this paper we argue that RED is shifting the boundaries of ‘causumerism’ (shopping for a better world) by enrolling consumers in ways that do not rely on accurate knowledge of the products or specific understanding of the cause that The Global Fund engages but, instead, rely on a system of more general, affective affinity between the ‘aid celebrities’ who are behind RED (such as Bono) and the consumers who buy iconic brand products to help ‘distant others’. While in many other forms of causumerism, labels or certification systems ‘prove’ that a product is just, in RED, aid celebrities provide the proof. From the consumer point of view both labels and celebrities provide a similar simplification of complex social, economic, and environmental processes. At the same time, we argue that there are important distinctions as well—labels and certifications are ultimately about improving the conditions of production, whereas RED is about accepting existing production and trade systems and donating a proportion of sales income to help distant others in Africa. The iconic brands sitting under the RED umbrella also {{play an important role}} as they offer a consistent and known venue for channeling consumer affect. We argue that celebrity validation, backed up by iconic brands, facilitates at least three shifts in the realm of causumerism: from ‘conscious consumption’ (mainly based on product-related information) to ‘compassionate consumption’ (mainly based on the management of consumer affect); from attention to the product and its production process toward the medical treatment of the ‘people with the problem’ (AIDS patients in Africa); and from addressing the causes of problems to solving their manifestations. ...|$|E
40|$|Destination {{branding}} is {{an important}} focus of tourism marketing research and a cornerstone activity for many destination marketing organizations. National Tourism Branding is the specific activity of destination branding a nation to encourage tourism. This study examines National Tourism Branding from two perspectives. National Tourism Branding is examined {{from the perspective of}} the National Tourist Office (NTO) operating in the United States. The thesis also examines the National Tourism Brand (NTB), and the role of the National Tourism Office, from the perspective of commercial stakeholders in the brand development process. The study examines the attitudes of both tourism product and wholesalers to the branding process. This thesis began by exploring the phenomenon and process of branding with particular focus on the way branding is applied to nations and destinations in tourism marketing. The literature review examined the complex nature of destination brands noting that destination brands typically exist within a hierarchy of “place brands” and that destination brands exist in portfolios of brands due to the composite nature of destinations themselves. The role of stakeholders in the destination branding process was also reviewed in detail. Tourism Destinations, as composite entities with component products, have stakeholders concerned in the development of effective master branding of the destination. In addition, distribution channel members, reliant on the destination for business, are also stakeholders in the brand development process. In addition to “market driven” stakeholders destination marketers must also engage with “non-market driven” stakeholders including local residents, government and politicians. The literature review identified National Tourist Offices (NTOs) as the key drivers in the development of National Tourism Brands (NTB) and examined the activities of these organizations in the destination marketing and branding process. The process of destination branding was reviewed and compared to the general process of branding undertaken by consumer products. The development of brand strategy requires an assessment of the destination’s image, the development of a destination brand identity and the creation of a positioning strategy designed to meet brand and communications objectives. These activities are undertaken in the context of a specific target market. Destination brands are developed for the purpose of delivering benefits to the destination. The destination branding process is designed to increase the “brand equity” of the destination brand. Destination Brands can be described as public assets shared by the community and the tourism industry. As such the development of brands, while critical to National Tourist Offices is also an important issue to other users of the asset including tourism product and tourism intermediaries, both of which invest funds to promote the destination as part of their commercial offerings. The measures for assessing the value of the destination brand and its effectiveness in the market place are examined in the literature review. Chapter 2 examines the development of “Brand Australia” in the United States and reviews the Australian Tourist Commission’s marketing campaigns during the period 1996 - 2004. The thesis explored the way ATC used the Olympic Games held in Sydney in 2000 as both a catalyst for the development of Australia’s National Tourism Brand and as a brand partner, effectively <b>cobranding</b> Australia with the Olympics. The second section of Chapter 2 examined how the ATC engaged with partners in the development of the brand during this period. As a result of the literature review a series of key study areas were developed to address the nature of National tourism branding with particular focus on the activities of US based National Tourist Offices and the impacts on commercial stakeholders of National Tourism Activity. Within this framework three studies were undertaken to better understand the role of National Tourist Offices in the United States. Chapter 3 examines the results of these studies which focus on destination marketing and branding activities. As a result of the studies it was noted NTOs operating in the United States are relatively small operations, with modest levels of resources – both human and financial. Nevertheless, these organizations are tasked with significant goals and are committed to marketing to consumers in the largest most complex marketplace in the world. These NTOs consider destination branding an important activity that raises the profile of their countries, increases their marketing efficiency and effectiveness as well as those of their commercial stakeholders. These NTO operations in the United States have considerable freedom to interpret their brands in the market. They leverage their partners through both the use of industry input into strategy development and cooperative marketing. The NTOs perceive the greatest benefit of their brand activity is to provide a focused message to consumers while allowing partners to focus attention on sales/conversion activity. In order to better understand the impact of destination branding on the NTO and commercial stakeholders three additional studies were conducted. Study 4 was a two part content analysis which included analysis of ATC motivational brochures to examine the execution of brand positioning and an examination of tour wholesaler’s brochures. This analysis revealed that the NTO was able to devote both imagery and written copy to develop a brochure that provided both specific detail as well as a “holistic” impression that was consistent with brand values. The commercial brochures however relied heavily on images of the destination to convey brand values and so were limited in their ability to communicate the brand. Study 5 examined in detail the experience of two “market driven” stakeholder groups involved in the Australian branding process. As Australia’s NTO, the Australian Tourist Commission has government authority to promote Australia’s tourism brand and the ATC is committed to the success of the tourism industry. It was therefore instructive to examine the perceptions of Australia’s tourism providers and their channel partners of the Australian tourism brand, and it’s utility in generating passengers. This study found that both tourism product and their distribution partners, the travel wholesalers, are relatively small organizations with limited resources to achieve their marketing objectives. These organizations value the contribution of “Brand Australia” and consider their individual company’s performance is tied to the effectiveness of the brand Australia. These organizations perceive the greatest benefit they receive from Australian tourism branding is the ability to allocate resources to sales messages about their specific product offerings rather than to “back ground” information on the destination itself. Interestingly, despite their enthusiasm for Brand Australia these organizations perceive factors other than the ATC’s marketing activity drive the consumer buying process. In particular they attribute the greatest impact on raising awareness of the destination and creating desire to travel to “word of mouth” factors. The brand hierarchy of the National Tourism Brand often includes state and regional branding. In order to explore issues that occur when different destination marketers work with the same brand hierarchy a survey (Study 6) of leaders of Australia’s State Tourism Organizations (STOs) was conducted. This study revealed general alignment of branding objectives but concern that the various organizations involved in marketing Australia in the United States should invest greater energy in developing complementary brand strategies. In addition to the findings of the research several key insights have been generated in the development of this thesis. Firstly, it was noted NTB plays a variety of roles the in the brand architecture of the destination including “master brand”, “umbrella” brand and “driver brand”. It notes that due to the composite nature of destinations, destination brands can be considered as both a single brand and as a portfolio of component brands. The thesis also noted that the variety of stakeholders involved in the development of the brand as a public asset requires a that valuation of the benefits of the brand include not only benefits that accrue to the DMO or to the consumer but to the broader group of beneficiaries including the distribution network, the destination’s component products and the community to name a few. Finally it has also been noted that sustainable destination branding, despite the tendency of research to focus on only marketing issues, requires both marketing communication strategies and destination development strategies. Topics from this study were presented at the International Conference on Destination Branding and Marketing for Regional Tourism Development, 2005...|$|E
