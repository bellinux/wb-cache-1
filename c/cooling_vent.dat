Emissions tests {{ensure that a}} product will not emit harmful electromagnetic interference in communication and power lines. Immunity tests ensure that a product is immune to common electrical signals and Electromagnetic interference (EMI) that will be found in its operating environment, such as electromagnetic radiation from a local radio station or interference from nearby products. Safety tests ensure that a product will not create a safety risk from situations such as a failed or shorted power supply, blocked <b>cooling</b> <b>vent,</b> and powerline voltage spikes and dips.|$|E
50|$|The {{first two}} models (ausf A and B) were {{produced}} in small numbers from 1939. Ausf A and B models {{can be identified}} by {{the structure of the}} nose armor, which comprised two trapezoidal armor panels - the lower of which had an engine <b>cooling</b> <b>vent.</b> The B model, which began production in 1940, eliminated the fighting compartment's side vision slits. The C model, which started production in mid-1942, featured a simplified hexagonal-shaped forward armored plate for the engine. Models A through C had rear doors that bulged out. The C model had a large production run, but was quite complex to build, involving many angled plates. From early 1943, the D model was developed with the purpose of halving the number of angled body plates, simplifying the design and thus speeding up the production. D models can be easily recognized by their single piece sloping rear, with flat doors.|$|E

50|$|In {{perhaps their}} most famous action, Fireflies from A Squadron, 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, 33rd Armoured Brigade, A Squadron, the Sherbrooke Fusiliers Regiment, 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade, and B Squadron, The 144th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, 33rd Armoured Brigade, ambushed {{a group of}} four Tiger tanks from the 3rd Company and HQ Company, 101st SS Heavy Tank Battalion {{supported}} by several Panzer IV tanks and StuG IV assault guns. Tanks of the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry and elements of the 51st (Highland) Division reached the French village of Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil {{on the morning of}} 8 August 1944 during Operation Totalize. While B Squadron stayed around the village, A and C Squadrons moved further south into a wood called Delle de la Roque. C Squadron positioned themselves {{on the east side of}} the woods and the understrength A Squadron in the southern portion with No. 3 Troop on the western edge of the wood. From this position, they overlooked a large open section of ground and were able to watch as German tanks advanced up Route nationale 158 from the town of Cintheaux. Under strict orders from the troop commander, they held their fire until the German tanks were well within range. Ekins, the gunner of Sergeant Gordon's Sherman Firefly (Velikye Luki - A Squadron's tanks were named after towns in the Soviet Union) had yet to fire his gun in action. With the Tiger tanks in range, the order was given to fire. What followed was an almost 12-minute battle that saw Ekins destroying all three Tigers that No. 3 Troop could see; there were actually seven Tiger tanks in the area heading north along with some other tanks and self-propelled guns. A short time later, the main German counterattack was made in the direction of C Squadron. A Squadron (less Sgt Gordon who had been wounded and had already bailed out of the Firefly) moved over to support them and in the resulting combat, Ekins destroyed a Panzer IV before his tank was hit and the crew were forced to bail out. Ekins is credited by some with knocking out Michael Wittmann's Tiger, though there is still much controversy over whether Ekins really killed Wittmann, as Sherman Fireflies of the Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment also fired at the Tigers from a closer range of only 143 m at Gaumesnil, and the killing shot came from the left side of the Tiger, as photographs prove. In fact, the shot that killed Wittmann likely came from a Canadian non-Firefly Sherman, as the photos prove it penetrated the left engine <b>cooling</b> <b>vent</b> of his tank, directly behind the turret, which is much thinner and susceptible to 75mm armour piercing rounds. The British tanks of Ekins' unit were a kilometer away and facing the opposite (right) side of Wittmann's Tiger, and thus clearly impossible for Ekins to have hit on the left side.|$|E

50|$|Many {{electronic}} circuits contain special provisions to prevent thermal runaway. This {{is most often}} seen in transistor biasing arrangements for high-power output stages. However, when equipment is used above its designed ambient temperature, thermal runaway can still occur in some cases. This occasionally causes equipment failures in hot environments, or when air <b>cooling</b> <b>vents</b> are blocked.|$|R
50|$|The DB2 debuted at the New York Auto Show in April 1950 and {{continued}} in production until April 1953, {{by which time}} 411 had been made. The first 49 had a chrome-framed front grille in three separate parts, and large rectangular <b>cooling</b> <b>vents</b> in the front wings. Subsequent cars had a one-piece grille with horizontal chrome slats, and no side vents.|$|R
50|$|The {{approximate}} cost of {{the vehicle}} was $72,000, which contributed to the early halting of production. The high profile (height) of the vehicle was also a negative factor.

5000|$|Heath {{chose not}} to {{implement}} the S-100 bus and instead created their own, known as [...] "Benton Harbor Bus" [...] after their home town. The bus {{was based on a}} 50-pin connector and laid out to avoid the electrical problems of the S-100 system (like +5V and ground being placed beside each other). The H8 was packaged in a box-like chassis with pressboard sides and metal sheeting {{for the rest of the}} case. The top sheet was heavily perforated to form <b>cooling</b> <b>vents.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The SPARCstation 1 {{features}} several distinctive {{design and}} packaging elements driven internally by system designer Andy Bechtolsheim and externally by design house frogdesign. Bechtolsheim specified that the motherboard {{would be the}} size of a sheet of paper and the SBus expansion cards would be the size of index cards, resulting in an extremely compact footprint. The external design motif includes dot-patterned <b>cooling</b> <b>vents</b> on the side which are echoed by a [...] "dimple" [...] pattern on the front face, and [...] "Sun purple" [...] feet.|$|R
5000|$|Other unique M5 {{features}} include a wider track, unique body panels, 7-speed SMG III sequential manual gearbox, {{also known as}} a single-clutch automated manual transmission, a color heads up display featuring navigation, control messages, speed, rpm and gear selection information, automated seat side bolsters, heated/ventilated seats and power rear curtain.

The wheels were of a standard 19" [...] diameter with quad exhaust pipes to the rear.|$|R
50|$|For the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, Prodrive made {{modifications}} to the DBR9 design to not only improve performance, but also to increase driver comfort in the cockpit. Due to new regulations put into place by Le Mans organizers, the DBR9 required the installation of an air conditioning unit, to prevent overstressing drivers. Prodrive went further by putting a heat-resistant white roof on all new cars to assist in keeping cockpit temperatures down. Performance modifications included the removal of two, now immaterial, <b>cooling</b> <b>vents</b> from the bonnet of the car.|$|R
50|$|The Zastava M92 {{chambers}} and fires the Soviet 7.62×39mm round. It is a gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, and selective fire firearm with an under folding metal stock. In general design, it is a modified hybrid of the Soviet AKMSU and AKS-74U carbines, but is easily distinguished by {{the design of}} pistol grip and especially by the handguard (which is longer), which {{is made out of}} a different wood type and has three <b>cooling</b> <b>vents</b> instead of the usual two. This feature gives the M92 less overheating on full auto mode.|$|R
50|$|Several {{aircraft}} suffered rib {{failures and}} fabric shedding {{on the upper}} wing. Heat from the engine sometimes ignited phosphorus ammunition until <b>cooling</b> <b>vents</b> were installed in the engine cowling and fuel tanks sometimes broke at the seams. Aircraft built by the Fokker factory at Schwerin were noted for their lower standard of workmanship and materials. Despite faults, the D.VII {{proved to be a}} remarkably successful design, leading to the familiar aphorism that it could turn a mediocre pilot into a good one and a good pilot into an ace.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} {{dimensions of the}} car are 3.47 m long, 1.25 m wide and 1.10 m tall. There is 80 L of storage space. The car features an aircraft-style canopy, flat wheel covers and an underbelly cover to smooth the airflow. The engine <b>cooling</b> <b>vents</b> open only as needed.For light weight, the car uses an unpainted carbon fibre skin over a magnesium-alloy subframe. Individual components {{have been designed to}} be low weight, including engine, transmission, suspension, wheels (carbon fibre), brakes (aluminium), hubs (titanium), bearings (ceramic), interior, and so on. Empty vehicle weight is 290 kg.|$|R
50|$|Like all Zastava {{produces}} AK variants, the M90 can {{be identified}} from the originals by its longer lower wooden handguard design, which has three <b>cooling</b> <b>vents,</b> no bulge and like the stock, {{is made out of}} different wood type. Also, due to using Western round, this particular model also has different magazine design, similar to Western STANAG and a Western type flash eliminator, similar to one used on American M16 assault rifle. Like on the other Zastava AK's, this three vent feature gives the M90 lower overheating when compared to the originals, but, the Western round in this case, slightly reduces reliability.|$|R
50|$|A {{microwave}} oven converts {{only part of}} its electrical input into microwave energy. An average consumer {{microwave oven}} consumes 1100 W of electricity in producing 700 W of microwave power , an efficiency of 64%. The other 400 W are dissipated as heat, mostly in the magnetron tube. Such wasted heat, along with heat from the product being microwaved, is exhausted as warm air through <b>cooling</b> <b>vents.</b> Additional power is used to operate the lamps, AC power transformer, magnetron cooling fan, food turntable motor and the control circuits, although the power consumed by the electronic control circuits of a modern microwave oven is negligible (< 1% of the input power) during cooking.|$|R

5000|$|The Zastava M85 is an AK-pattern rifle {{incorporating}} design {{elements of}} the Soviet AKMSU and AKS-74U carbines, but chambered for the Western 5.56×45mm round. It is gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, and offers selective fire capability. It can be distinguished from traditional members of the AK family by its unique polymer pistol grip, 5.56x45mm magazine, and most significantly by its distinctive [...] "Yugo" [...] handguard, which is longer, and has three <b>cooling</b> <b>vents</b> {{instead of the usual}} two. The M85 also features a flash-hider muzzle device copied directly from the AKS-74U. Additionally, the M85 is built using a receiver stamped from 1.5mm sheet steel, which is thicker than the 1.0mm steel used in most AK derived rifles. This results in increased durability at the cost of increased weight.|$|R
50|$|This card is {{designed}} for the DIY market; it addresses many problems which the previous 7900 GX2 had suffered from, such as noise, size, power consumption, and price. The 7950 GX2 requires only a single PCIe power connector, {{in contrast to the}} twin-connectors of its predecessor; technically, this is understandable, as {{there is no need for}} a ring bus configuration - frames need only be passed on to the primary GPU. It is much shorter, fitting easily in the same space as a 7900 GTX. Lesser board layout and the removal of <b>cooling</b> <b>vents</b> on the bracket have greatly reduced temperatures, allowing the fans to run at a lower speed, thereby lowering noise. As of September 2006, the board can be found for $299, half the cost of a 7900 GX2.|$|R

50|$|Other {{modifications}} {{made to the}} 787's design {{included a}} relocation of the radiators. Initially placed beside the cockpit on the 767, a new single radiator was integrated into {{the nose of the}} 787. Air moved from the blunt nose of the car underneath the bodywork and through the radiator before exiting {{at the top of the}} nose. A Gurney flap was affixed to the radiator exit to increase front end downforce. This new radiator location also meant a redesign of the doors of the car, where the old radiator design had been located. The intake in front of the door and exit behind were no longer necessary and were thus not included, giving the 787 a smoother bodywork design on top. To aid in rear engine and brake cooling, intakes were placed on the side bodywork, immediately above the exhaust <b>cooling</b> <b>vents.</b>|$|R
50|$|The second {{prototype}} {{passed its}} State acceptance trials on 13 August 1931 and was ordered into production {{a month later}} on 13 September.
