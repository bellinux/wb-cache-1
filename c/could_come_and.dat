5|$|In May 1943, the Raymonds vouched for George Nakashima and his family, {{releasing}} {{them from}} a Japanese internment camp in Idaho, so that they <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> live at the New Hope farm.|$|E
5|$|The farmer, or {{specifically}} the small landowner-cultivator, was ranked just below scholars and {{officials in the}} social hierarchy. Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as tenants, wage laborers, and in rare cases slaves. Artisans and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants. State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and {{more powerful than the}} vast majority of government officials. Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> go from their master's home as they pleased. Medical physicians, pig breeders, and butchers had a fairly high social status, while occultist diviners, runners, and messengers had low status.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, the Sélignac Charterhouse was {{converted}} into a house in which lay people <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> experience Carthusian retreats, living the Carthusian life for shorter periods (an eight-day retreat being fixed as the absolute minimum, in order to enter at least somewhat into the silent rhythm of the charterhouse).|$|E
60|$|The prices stood fast at 25 cents a meal. You <b>could</b> <b>come</b> in <b>and</b> eat {{all they}} had in the caff for a quarter.|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps it's {{because you}} have--possibilities. You may be typewriting his manuscripts. And then, I am a widow, and often rather lonely--you <b>could</b> <b>come</b> in <b>and</b> {{read to me}} occasionally." ...|$|R
25|$|Soon after, Mary Margaret {{goes into}} labor. Emma and Hook attempt to stop Zelena before she <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> claim the child, {{but she has}} Gold drown him in a bucket of water, forcing Emma to kiss him and lose her magic to save his life. Zelena steals Mary Margaret's newborn son and begins to enact her time travel spell. Ultimately, Regina defeats her using light magic and takes the pendant, though she spares Zelena. However, Gold later visits Zelena in her cell and kills her in revenge for Neal's death.|$|E
25|$|Predecessors of {{the modern}} Akita were used for hunting bear, wild boar and deer in Japan as late as 1957. They {{would be used to}} flush out the bear and keep it at bay until the hunter <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> kill it. Today, the breed is used {{primarily}} as a companion dog. However, the breed is currently also known to be used as therapy dogs, and compete in all dog competitions including: conformation showing, obedience trials, canine good citizen program, tracking trials and agility competition, as well as weight pulling, hunting and schutzhund (i.e., personal protection dogs).|$|E
25|$|Society changed {{quickly after}} World War I. For example, customs, technology, and {{manufacturing}} all moved {{quickly into the}} 20th century after the interruption of the war. The rise of the automobile was {{an important factor in}} flapper culture, as cars meant a woman <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> go as she pleased, travel to speakeasies and other entertainment venues, and use the large vehicles of the day for their popular activity, petting parties. Also, the economic boom allowed more people the time and money to play golf and tennis and to take vacations, which required clothing adapted to these activities; the flapper's slender silhouette was very suitable for movement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wouldn't it be fun {{if all the}} castles in the air {{which we}} make <b>could</b> <b>come</b> true, <b>and</b> we <b>could</b> live in them?" [...] said Jo, after a little pause.|$|R

25|$|The Great Pustaha {{is among}} the 150 pustahas kept in the Tropenmuseum. Written by nine generations of datu, the pustaha {{is among the}} oldest pustaha in the world. Reaching the height of 42 centimeters if seated, {{it is also the}} largest pustaha in the world. The Great Pustaha has been on display at the museum almost {{permanently}} from the very beginning. In 1923, before Tropenmuseum was officially opened, visitors <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> see the Anniversary Exhibition for Queen Wilhelmina's 25 years of reign in 1923. While most of the museum was still under construction, objects were displayed on tables in the museum galleries, including the Great Pustaha.|$|E
25|$|For {{more than}} 30 years, {{beginning}} in the late 1950s, Peggy Appiah's extensive library at Mbrom was made available to the children of the neighbourhood, who <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> read children's books, and, as they grew older, the novels and poetry she had collected. Among her most prized collections were many of the volumes of the Heinemann African Writers Series. Other frequent visitors to the house included the traders who brought her the goldweights they had acquired on their collecting trips through the villages and towns of Ghana. She also took an interest in the education and welfare of a number of young people, who became part of her extended family, among them Isobel Kusi-Obodom, whose father died in Nkrumah's prisons, and Dr Joe Appiah-Kusi of Seattle.|$|E
25|$|On July 27, 1941, State Commissar (Reichskommissar) Hinrich Lohse (earlier Gauleiter of Schleswig-Holstein), {{ruler of}} the Baltic lands and Belarus or Ostland as the {{territory}} was called by the invaders– made his guidelines on Jewish question public. Jews, in his opinion, had {{to be used as}} a cheap labour force by paying them minimum wages or by providing them with a minimum food ration– with whatever may be left over after supplying the indigenous Aryan population. In order to govern the Jews they had to be moved to special areas where ghettos would be arranged and they would be forbidden to leave the area. Walter Stahlecker protested against the idea of Hinrich Lohse and demanded that the extermination of the Jews be continued. Berlin, however, passed the power to the civil administration of occupation force and it did things its own way. The area of the Latgale suburbs in Riga was chosen for the Riga Ghetto. It was mainly inhabited by poor people: Jews, Russians and Belarusians. The ghetto bordered on Maskavas, Vitebskas, Ebreju (Jewish), Līksnas, Lauvas, Lazdonas, Lielā Kalnu, Katoļu, Jēkabpils and Lāčplēša Streets. About 7000 non-Jews were moved from there to other flats in Riga. More than 23,000 Riga Jews were ordered to move to the territory of the ghetto. There now were more than 29,000 inmates in the ghetto, including those who had already previously resided there. The Jewish Council was formed within the ghetto, which was assigned the task of regulating social life. The Jewish police force for the maintenance of order formed there. It consisted of 80 men armed with sticks and rubber truncheons. The ghetto was enclosed by a barbed-wire fence. Wooden barriers (logs) were placed on the main streets at the entrance, and the Latvian police were stationed as guards there. Jews were allowed to leave the ghetto only in work columns and in the accompaniment of guards. Individual Jewish specialists <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> go by displaying a special yellow ID. Leaving independently was severely punished.|$|E
60|$|Carried away as I was by his vehemence, I was yet able to {{calculate}} shrewdly, and I decided {{to name a}} very high price, from which I <b>could</b> <b>come</b> down <b>and</b> still make a splendid deal.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{the student}} founders of GYSB created a group {{page on the}} popular social media platform, Facebook {{to serve as an}} avenue where like-minded youths <b>could</b> <b>come</b> {{together}} <b>and</b> share their thoughts and experiences on moderate drinking.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think of}} that. But couldn't Jane {{take care of}} her? She's always carryin' her around. <b>And</b> Uncle David <b>could</b> <b>come</b> here, <b>and</b> live with them. He wouldn't want to stay there without me, or no one." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{presence}} of wives, lovers and daughters {{was taken for}} granted. Visitors <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> go freely, and even live with the prisoners, without being asked who they were. Female prisoners were allowed to mix with the men. Some of the rooms were let to prostitutes. The prison gates were closed from ten at night until eight the next morning, with a bell warning visitors {{half an hour before}} closing time, and an officer walking around the prison calling, [...] "Strangers, women and children all out!" ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the number}} of visiting eagles fluctuated, about 200 to 300 eagles would show up each day during the months of winter and early spring. [...] Crows and gulls were also {{attracted}} to the area. Keene fed them an estimated 500 pounds (227kg) of fish per day, about 50,000 pounds (22,680kg) per year. Her fish supply included surplus and freezer-burned fish from fish processing facilities still on the Spit, her own purchases using her limited funds from Social Security or retirement benefits, or fish contributed by her supporters. Visitors <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> watch the eagles Keene fed on the Spit at no cost, but were asked {{to stay in their}} cars for their own safety and {{for the safety of the}} eagles.|$|E
500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E
60|$|Do {{write of}} yourself. Don't you be sad, dearest friend. Oh, I do wish you <b>could</b> have <b>come,</b> <b>and</b> let us {{love you and}} talk to you--but on the 16th of June, at any rate.|$|R
50|$|A few {{minor changes}} have been made for the 2001 and later year models. The trunk bottom of the 1999 model had a {{tendency}} to crack, <b>and</b> the antennae <b>could</b> <b>come</b> loose <b>and</b> fall off. Both issues were fixed as warranty claims.|$|R
6000|$|Here in Gibraltar he corners these educated British {{officers}} and badgers them with braggadocio about America and the wonders she can perform! He {{told one of}} them a couple of our gunboats <b>could</b> <b>come</b> here <b>and</b> knock Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea! ...|$|R
2500|$|Until 2015, the Turkish {{government}} had maintained a border regime that {{was referred to}} by commentators and Turkish journalists as the [...] "Jihadist Highway" [...] where militants including potential ISIL fighters and other radical groups <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> go freely.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses instructed that every third year, the Israelites were to take the full tithe, but leave it within their settlements, and the Levite, the proselyte, the orphan, and the widow in their settlements <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> eat. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and a closed portion ( [...] , setumah) end here {{with the end of the}} chapter.|$|E
2500|$|Bruce Hornsby never officially {{joined the}} band full-time, {{because of his}} other commitments, but he did play {{keyboards}} at most Dead shows between September 1990 and March 1992, and sat in with the band over one hundred times in all between 1988 and 1995. Jerry Garcia referred {{to him as a}} [...] "floating member" [...] who <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> go as he pleased.|$|E
6000|$|Val {{admitted}} {{that it was}} frightfully decent {{to do what you}} liked; the lectures were nothing; and there were some very good chaps. [...] "Only," [...] he added, [...] "of course I wish I was in town, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> down <b>and</b> see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{this will}} {{do very well}} indeed," [...] said Lawrence; [...] "and I wish I <b>could</b> <b>come</b> out <b>and</b> help you into your vehicle," [...] {{regarding}} the spring wagon which now stood at the door, with Plez {{at the head of}} the solemn sorrel.|$|R
6000|$|As {{soon as the}} child's malady had {{declared}} itself the afflicted parents of the May Queen telegraphed to Tennyson, [...] "Our child gone crazy on subject of early rising, <b>could</b> you <b>come</b> <b>and</b> write some poetry about her?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Upon {{taking the}} office of Mayor in 1993, Roxanne {{established}} [...] "Mayor's Night In" [...] where every Tuesday evening for two hours anyone <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> see her about any issue or concern; and she established the Mayor's Business Expansion and Retention Program and the Mayor's Business Breakfasts. These efforts reached out to over 1,000 individuals and 240 businesses and resulted in legislative initiatives, constituency services, and jobs and business expansion and retention.|$|E
2500|$|The smaller {{exhibits}} were {{housed in}} the old station buildings and the rolling stock and other large exhibits in the former locomotive erecting and repair shops of the old York and North Midland Railway (demolished after the museum closed). [...] Despite this however, the locomotives were displayed on short lengths of track acting as plinths, very much in traditional museum style. It was only when the NRM was formed that Britain acquired a rail-served railway museum where large exhibits <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> go with ease.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after, he {{had moved}} in with the family of his close friend, Ronnie Burns, who became a pop star: first {{as a member of}} The Flies (1964–65) and then as a solo artist. Meldrum had {{followed}} Burns to the latter's home and asked, [...] "Is there any chance I <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> live with you and your family?" [...] What had started as a two-week stay with the Burns family became nine years. During The Beatles' tour of Australia in June 1964, Meldrum was captured by TV cameras climbing atop the bonnet of their car shortly after arrival at Melbourne airport. Later, he and Burns were ejected from The Beatles' Melbourne concert for being [...] "too enthusiastic".|$|E

50|$|Operation Zitadelle was the {{greatest}} tank battle ever fought.

50|$|After Masahiro Tanaka {{began his}} rehab and {{strengthening}} programs in late August so he <b>could</b> <b>come</b> back <b>and</b> pitch {{before the end}} of season, he was sent back to New York City on August 29 with arm soreness. He later returned in September, but he finished the season 13-5.|$|R
