5|$|Among the {{earliest}} evidence of <b>chariot</b> use are the burials of horse and <b>chariot</b> remains by the Andronovo (Sintashta-Petrovka) culture in modern Russia and Kazakhstan, dated to approximately 2000 BC. The oldest documentary {{evidence of what}} was probably <b>chariot</b> warfare in the Ancient Near East is the Old Hittite Anitta text, of the 18th century BC, which mentioned 40 teams of horses at the siege of Salatiwara. The Hittites became well known throughout the ancient world for their prowess with the <b>chariot.</b> Widespread use of the <b>chariot</b> in warfare across most of Eurasia coincides approximately {{with the development of}} the composite bow, known from c.1600 BC. Further improvements in wheels and axles, as well as innovations in weaponry, soon resulted in chariots being driven in battle by Bronze Age societies from China to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, {{the owner}} and {{the driver of the}} <b>chariot</b> were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; obviously, he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic <b>chariot</b> race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the <b>chariot</b> himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own <b>chariot.</b> This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the <b>chariot</b> race twice. <b>Chariot</b> racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that <b>chariot</b> racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy.|$|E

5|$|Auriga, however, is {{sometimes}} described as Myrtilus, who was Hermes's {{son and the}} charioteer of Oenomaus. The association of Auriga and Myrtilus is supported by depictions of the constellation, which rarely show a <b>chariot.</b> Myrtilus's <b>chariot</b> was destroyed in a race intended for suitors to win the heart of Oenomaus's daughter Hippodamia. Myrtilus earned his position in the sky when Hippodamia's successful suitor, Pelops, killed him, despite his complicity in helping Pelops win her hand. After his death, Myrtilus's father Hermes placed him in the sky. Yet another mythological association of Auriga is Theseus's son Hippolytus. He was ejected from Athens after he refused the romantic advances of his stepmother Phaedra, who committed suicide as a result. He was killed when his <b>chariot</b> was wrecked, but revived by Asclepius. Regardless of Auriga's specific representation, {{it is likely that}} the constellation was created by the ancient Greeks to commemorate the importance of the <b>chariot</b> in their society.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Auriga {{is often}} {{identified}} as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius of Athens, the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be {{the inventor of the}} quadriga, the four-horse <b>chariot,</b> which he used in the battle against the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king of Athens. His <b>chariot</b> was created {{in the image of the}} Sun's <b>chariot,</b> the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.|$|E

Heston, in a DVD commentary track for the film, mentions that a third urban legend claims that he wore a wristwatch during the <b>chariot</b> race, but points out that he wore leather bracers up to the elbow.|$|E
5|$|The Hyksos invaders {{brought the}} <b>chariot</b> to Ancient Egypt in the 16th century BC and the Egyptians adopted its use {{from that time}} forward. The oldest {{preserved}} text related to the handling of war horses {{in the ancient world}} is the Hittite manual of Kikkuli, which dates to about 1350 BC, and describes the conditioning of <b>chariot</b> horses.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of horses in warfare {{occurred}} over 5,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of horses ridden in warfare dates from Eurasia between 4000 and 3000BC. A Sumerian illustration of warfare from 2500BC depicts some type of equine pulling wagons. By 1600BC, improved harness and <b>chariot</b> designs made <b>chariot</b> warfare common throughout the Ancient Near East, and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training <b>chariot</b> horses written about 1350BC. As formal cavalry tactics replaced the <b>chariot,</b> so did new training methods, and by 360BC, the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in technology, including {{the invention of the}} saddle, the stirrup, and later, the horse collar.|$|E
25|$|Before the Han Dynasty, {{the power}} of Chinese states and dynasties was often {{measured}} {{by the number of}} <b>chariots</b> they were known to have.

The majority of Iron Age <b>chariot</b> burials in Britain {{are associated with the}} Arras culture, and in most cases the chariots were dismantled before burial. Exceptions are the Ferrybridge and Newbridge chariots, which are the only ones found to have been buried intact. The Newbridge burial has been radiocarbon dated to 520–370BC, and the Ferrybridge burial is likely to be of similar date.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} exactly when <b>chariot</b> racing began, but It {{may have been}} as old as chariots themselves. It is known from artistic {{evidence}} on pottery that the sport existed in the Mycenaean world, but the first literary reference to a <b>chariot</b> race is one described by Homer, at the funeral games of Patroclus. The participants in this race were Diomedes, Eumelus, Antilochus, Menelaus, and Meriones. The race, which was one lap around the stump of a tree, was won by Diomedes, who received a slave woman and a cauldron as his prize. A <b>chariot</b> race also {{was said to be}} the event that founded the Olympic Games; according to one legend, mentioned by Pindar, King Oenomaus challenged suitors for his daughter Hippodamia to a race, but was defeated by Pelops, who founded the Games in honour of his victory.|$|E
5|$|Prithu himself {{shattered}} many mountains {{with his}} arrows {{and made the}} earth even.

His <b>chariot</b> could travel over land, water and air with complete ease. Mountains made way for Prithu on his <b>chariot</b> and his flagstaff was never entangled when Prithu travelled through dense forests as the trees made way for him. Prithu practised charity and donated colossal amounts of gold to the Brahmanas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Chariot</b> {{festival is}} the most {{prominent}} festival of the temple, and for the surrounding villages.

Verses from Nalayira Divya Prabandham are recited {{by a group of}} temple priests amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument). The <b>chariot</b> festival is unique in the state as a community feast is offered by several individuals and committees, a custom many centuries old. The processional idols of Pundarikakshan and Pankajavalli are brought to the temple car early in the morning amidst religious chanting. Ratharohanam, the rituals associated with taking the idols to the temple car, is performed at an auspicious time before commencing the procession.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{principal}} photography {{was expected}} to begin on 26 February 2008, and then on 15 March 2008, but finally began on 19 March 2008 in Rajasthan. Initial shooting occurred for 10 days in Rann of Kutch, Gujarat. Art director Ravinder went to Chennai and gave details of their requirements to a prominent chariot-making specialist. After rejecting the maker's first iron skeletons, Ravinder opted to design them himself, and prepared three models of chariots with different heights to be used, depending on the camera’s location and other technical requirements. He used fibre material for the iron skeleton's exteriors. For {{a scene in which}} neither the hero nor the villain was present on the <b>chariot,</b> Ravinder measured a short person and designed a hidden chamber in which he could sit and secretly control the horses. While the <b>chariot</b> race sequence was shot in Dholavira, the sequence in which the <b>chariot</b> sinks in quicksand was shot at a set comprising three acres in Ramoji Film City.|$|E
