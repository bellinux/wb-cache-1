50|$|The {{advent of}} the CNC lathe (or more properly, <b>CNC</b> <b>turning</b> center) has blurred these {{distinct}} levels of production to some extent. The <b>CNC</b> <b>turning</b> center most appropriately fits in the mid-range of production, replacing the turret lathe. However, it is often possible to produce a single component with a <b>CNC</b> <b>turning</b> center more quickly than {{can be done with}} an engine lathe. To some extent too, the <b>CNC</b> <b>turning</b> center has stepped into the region traditionally occupied by the (mechanical) screw machine. CNC screw machines do this to an even greater degree, but they are expensive. In some cases they are vital, yet in others a mechanical machine can match or beat overall performance and profitability. It is not unusual for cam-op automatic lathes to beat CNCs on cycle time. CNC offers many benefits, not least CAD/CAM integration, but the CNC itself usually does not give any inherent speed advantage within the context of an automatic lathe cycle in terms of speeds and feeds or tool-changing speed. There are many variables involved in answering the question of which is best for a particular part at a particular company. (Overhead is part of the calculation—not least because most cam-op machines are long since paid for, whereas a late-model CNC machine has hefty monthly payments). Businesses relying on cam-op machines are still competing even in today's CNC-filled environment; they just need to be vigilant and smart about keeping it that way.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Dimensional {{and form}} {{deviations}} {{that arise in}} <b>CNC</b> <b>turned</b> components due to cutting forces and thermal effects have been traditionally compensated by on-line corrections {{even when they were}} not strictly necessary. Machine-tools equipped with multiple sensors must be utilized in order to carry out these compensations what in turn leads to an increment in production costs, the occurrence of undesirable effects such as chatter as well as moving away from optimal conditions. A new approach is proposed in this work for prediction and compensation of deviations in turning by taking them into account at the planning stages prior to machining operations. The proposed model determines the admissible value of deviations in accordance to tolerance limits within the workpiece and utilizes them for setting up the appropriate operation conditions. Initial experimental steps for validating these deviation models are also described...|$|R

50|$|Most CNC Swiss-style lathes today use one or {{two main}} {{spindles}} plus {{one or two}} back spindles (secondary spindles). The main spindle is used with the guide bushing for the main machining operations. The secondary spindle is located behind the part, aligned on the Z axis. In simple operation it picks up the part as it is cut off, and accepts it for second operations, then ejects it into a bin, eliminating {{the need to have}} an operator manually change each part, {{as is often the case}} with standard <b>CNC</b> <b>turning</b> centers. This makes them very efficient, as these machines are capable of fast cycle times, producing simple parts in one cycle (i.e., no need for a second machine to finish the part with second operations), in as little as 10-15 seconds. This makes them ideal for large production runs of small-diameter parts.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{maturation}} of CNC, {{the implicit}} dichotomy of [...] "manual versus automatic" [...] still exists, but because CNC is so ubiquitous, the term [...] "automatic" [...] has {{lost some of}} its distinguishing power. All CNC machine tools are automatic, but (perhaps therefore) the usage of the machining industries does not routinely call them by that term. The term [...] "automatic", when it is used at all, still often refers implicitly to cam-operated machines. Thus a [...] "plain old" [...] 2-axis CNC lathe is not referred to as an [...] "automatic lathe" [...] (even though it is, literally speaking, automatic). However, within the machining subspecialty of Swiss-type <b>CNC</b> <b>turning</b> centers, the word [...] "automatic" [...] is often used freely for cam-op and CNC alike (for example, DMG Mori and Tsugami call their Swiss-type CNCs [...] "automatic lathes").|$|E

30|$|The {{final stage}} of the expert system {{consists}} of evaluating the feasible candidate alternatives to select the best <b>CNC</b> <b>turning</b> centre. In this stage, a final set of <b>CNC</b> <b>turning</b> centres {{that needs to be}} evaluated based on the set criteria is chosen from the list of feasible alternatives. A decision matrix comprising of the selected technical specifications with respect to each chosen <b>CNC</b> <b>turning</b> centre is then developed.

The following linear normalization procedure is adopted here.|$|E
