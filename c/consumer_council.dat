5|$|As {{a result}} of this and similar controversies, Alf Dubs {{introduced}} a private member's bill named the Solicitors (Independent Complaints Procedure) Bill on 12 February 1985, which would move the responsibility of regulating the solicitors profession to a body outside the Law Society. Professional opinion was split on this – the National <b>Consumer</b> <b>Council,</b> Legal Action Group and many of the smaller law societies supported the proposal, while larger law societies and the Law Society of England and Wales opposed it.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the UK National <b>Consumer</b> <b>Council</b> (NCC, now Consumer Focus) {{called on}} the UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to {{investigate}} Apple's EULA, claiming Apple's EULA, and those of multiple other technology companies, misled consumers and infringed legal rights. The NCC's product complaint included Apple's iLife as well as Microsoft's Office for Mac, and products by Corel, Adobe, Symantec, Kaspersky, McAfee, and others. The OFT determined the licensing agreements were unfair and Apple agreed to improve its terms and conditions to make them clearer and fairer to consumers.|$|E
5|$|The Law Society asked Coopers & Lybrand {{to produce}} {{a report on the}} Law Society, which {{included}} its disciplinary topics among the areas to be reported on. The draft report, published in 1984, recommended that the Law Society should transfer its disciplinary processes to an independent Solicitor's Complaints Board, which would be made up of both solicitors and lay people (although with a majority of its members being solicitors). In 1985 the National <b>Consumer</b> <b>Council</b> published a survey showing that only 15% of respondents felt that the Law Society should be investigating complaints, and only 5% felt that if an independent body was created it should contain a solicitor majority, with 36% wanting equal representation of solicitors and lay people and 55% preferring a majority of lay people.|$|E

5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of failure to provide service to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the <b>Consumer</b> <b>Council</b> in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, {{to the extent that it}} was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E

500|$|In June 2006, the Consumer Ombudsmen in Norway, Sweden and Denmark {{challenged}} Apple's iTunes {{end user}} license agreement (EULA) through the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman Bjørn Erik Thon, {{who claimed that}} Apple was violating contract and copyright laws in their countries. Thon stated that Apple's [...] "being an international company does not entitle [...] to disregard the laws of the countries in which it operates. The company's standard customer contract violates Norwegian law". An official complaint was filed by the Norwegian <b>Consumer</b> <b>Council</b> in January 2006, after which German and French consumer groups joined the Nordic-led drive to force Apple to make its iTunes online store compatible with digital music players made by rival companies. A French law allows regulators to force Apple to make its player and store compatible with rival offerings. The consumer protection regulators of Norway, Sweden, and Finland met with Apple in September 2006 in hopes of resolving the issues without litigation, but the matter was only resolved after Apple discontinued its FairPlay digital rights management (DRM) scheme.|$|E

2500|$|Compounding the ordinances' {{constitutional}} difficulties was the Supreme Court's {{recent decision}} in [...] Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens <b>Consumer</b> <b>Council,</b> which held that commercial speech was protected under the First Amendment. A Lawrence Township, New Jersey, ordinance targeting five head {{shops in the}} Quaker Bridge Mall was thus found to be overbroad since it banned advertising paraphernalia to minors; similarly, a Newark ordinance banning the advertising of paraphernalia was struck down. In response, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) drafted a model ordinance for communities in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|These {{reasons were}} {{central to the}} Court's {{rejection}} of a ban on advertising the prices of prescription drugs in Virginia State Pharmacy Board v.

2500|$|According supporters, {{there is}} a long history of {{legislative}} and judicial decisions that justifies the Bellotti decision. While pre-1900 Supreme Courts believed that corporations did not deserve any protection under the First Amendment, by 1970 some lower courts were beginning to recognize First Amendment protection to [...] "corporate speech." [...] Lawyer Robert Prentice stated that First Amendment protection for corporations has worked its way into the decisions of the Supreme Court since the 1940s, in cases such as Valentine v. Chrestensen (1942), Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations (1973) and Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens <b>Consumer</b> <b>Council</b> (1976). From 1973 to Chief Justice Burger's departure in 1986, [...] "the Burger Court...invalidated every commercial speech ban considered," [...] building up precedents for the Bellotti decision.|$|E

Then on 5 March 2007 Virgin Media threatened to take legal action against BSkyB if the matter remained unresolved in 30 days. On 12 April 2007 Virgin Media filed a legal case in the High Court against BSkyB under the UK Competition Act 1998 and Article 82 of the EC Treaty.

[...] "Thus, even assuming that marketing {{is a form}} of advertising entitled to some degree of First Amendment protection, the restriction applied by this ordinance does not infringe on any protected First Amendment activity," [...] Leighton concluded. And, since it only affected that, it could not be considered overbroad.
