Može se ostvariti kateterom za hemodijalizu ili pomoću konstrukcije arteriovenske (AV) fistule te arteriovenskog (AV) grafta. Pristup krvotoku može biti privremen ili trajan. Privremeni pristup krvotoku obuhvaća plasiranje odgovarajućeg katetera u jednu od centralnih vena (unutarnja jugularna, supklavijska ili femoralna). Punkcija se vrši perkutano, a prethodno se preporučuje vene vizualizirati ultrazvukom. Pritom se najčešće koriste tzv. netunelirani kateteri. Trajni pristup krvotoku moguće je ostvariti primjenom AV fistule ili AV grafta te tzv. tuneliranim ili, rjeđe, netuneliranim kateterom u jednu od središnjih vena. Komplikacije pristupa krvotoku su brojne. Kod AV fistula i AV grafta one mogu biti stenoza, tromboza, aneurizma, pseudoaneurizma, srčanožilne komplikacije, infekcije te periferna ishemija distalnoga dijela ekstremiteta. Komplikacije katetera za hemodijalizu obuhvaćaju hematom na mjestu punkcije, nepoželjnu punkciju arterije, neadekvatan položaj katetera, pneumotoraks, hematotoraks, hematoperikard, tromboze i infekcije. Za začepljivanje katetera u vrijeme nekorištenja upotrebljava se heparin, a u novije vrijeme citratna otopina različite koncentracije. Adekvatna njega katetera omogućit će njegovu dugotrajnu primjenu. In {{patients}} with end-stage chronic renal disease who {{are treated with}} regular hemodialysis, the vascular access is mandatory. It can be achieved through the <b>catheter</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> or through construction of arteriovenous (AV) fistula and arteriovenous (AV) graft. Vascular access may be temporary or permanent. Temporary access to the bloodstream includes the appropriate placement of a catheter {{into one of the}} central veins (internal jugular, subclavian or femoral). Puncture is performed percutaneously, and it is recommended that the vein is previously visualised by ultrasound. For temporary access, non-tunneled catheters are commonly used. Permanent access to the bloodstream can be achieved using the AV fistula or AV graft, and so-called tunneled or, uncommonly used, nontunneled catheter into one of the central veins. Complications of the vascular access are numerous. Complications of the AV fistula and AV graft are stenoses, thromboses, aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, cardiovascular complications, infections, and peripheral ischemia of the distal extremity. Complications of <b>catheter</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> include hematoma at the site of puncture, accidental arterial puncture, inadequate position of the catheter, pneumothorax, hematothorax, hematopericard, thrombosis and infection.

40|$|Backgraund/Aim. Hemodialysis catheter, as an {{integral}} part of hemodialysis, is a catheter placed into the jugular, subclavian and femoral vein. The most common catheter-related complications are infections and thrombosis. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of complications associated with differently inserted central-vein <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis.</b> Methods. The study was organized as a prospective examination during the period from December 2003 to November 2006, and included all patients who needed an active depuration by hemodialysis, hospitalized at the Clinical Center Kragujevac. The subject of the study were 464 centralvein catheters inserted during the mentioned period and there were recorded all complications related to the placement and usage of catheters. Results. The largest percent of inserted catheters was into the femoral vein − 403 (86. 8 %), significantly less into the jugular vein − 42 (9. 2 %), while into the subclavian vein there were placed only 19 catheters (4 %). The average of femoral catheter functioning was 17 catheter days, in jugular catheters it was 17. 3 days while the subclavian catheters had an average rate of functioning of 25. 9 catheter days; there was found a statistically significant difference regarding the duration of functioning (p = 0. 03). By microbe colonization of smear culture of the skin at the catheter insertion site, in clinically present suspicion of catheter infection, there was obtained a positive finding in 5. 5 % of catheters placed into the femoral vein and 7. 1 % of catheters instilled into the jugular vein, of which Staphylococcus aureus was the most important bacterial type, without statistically significant difference (p = 0. 51). Haemoculture, done when there was a suspicion of bacteriemia, was positive in 3. 7 % of the patients with femoral and 4. 8 % with jugular catheters; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacteria type, but there was no statistically significant difference (p = 0. 65). Colonizing the smears of the cut catheter tops, there was found a positive finding in 8. 9 % of femoral and 4. 7 % of jugular catheters in which the mentioned type of staphylococcal bacteria was prevalent, without statistically significant difference (p = 0. 82). In 77 % of femoral, 71. 4 % of jugular and 68. 4 % of subclavian catheters, there were no complications associated with insertion and manipulation of <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> and the difference was at the limits of statistical significance (p = 0. 06).

Unconvincing rate of infections and a smaller percent of serious complications associated with the placement and use of central vein catheters instilled into the femoral vein, indicate that personal experience is sufficient recommendation to convince us that femoral vein does not represent a region with an increased risk <b>for</b> insertion of <b>hemodialysis</b> <b>catheters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{patients}} with {{end-stage renal disease}} use a central venous <b>catheter</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> access. A large majority of these catheters malfunction within one year of insertion, with up to two-thirds due to thrombosis. The optimal solution for locking the catheter between hemodialysis sessions, to decrease the risk of thrombosis and catheter malfunction, is unknown. The Prevention of Catheter Lumen Occlusion with rt-PA versus Heparin (PreCLOT) study will determine if use of weekly rt-PA, compared to regular heparin, as a catheter locking solution, will decrease the risk of catheter malfunction. Methods/Design The study population will consist of patients requiring chronic hemodialysis thrice weekly who are dialyzed with a newly inserted permanent dual-lumen central venous catheter. Patients randomized to the treatment arm will receive rt-PA 1 mg per lumen once per week, with heparin 5, 000 units per ml as a catheter locking solution for the remaining two sessions. Patients randomized to the control arm will receive heparin 5, 000 units per ml as a catheter locking solution after each dialysis session. The study treatment period will be six months, with 340 patients to be recruited from 14 sites across Canada. The primary outcome will be catheter malfunction, based on mean blood flow parameters while on hemodialysis, with a secondary outcome of catheter-related bacteremia. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken to assess the cost of maintaining a catheter using rt-PA as a locking solution, {{compared to the use}} of heparin. Discussion Results from this study will determine if use of weekly rt-PA, compared to heparin, will decrease catheter malfunction, as well as assess the cost-effectiveness of these locking solutions. </p...|$|E

The aim of the thesis {{is to find out}} whether nurses observe the treatment standard when treating the blood vessel entries and if the nurses of a standard ward find the handling of the <b>catheter</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> problematic. The objective is also to map the most problematic area of blood vessel entries from the nurses? view. The following research queries result from the objectives set above. 1. Do the nurses observe the treatment standard when treating the blood vessel entries? 2. Do the nurses of a standard ward find the handling of the hemodialysis catheter problematic? 3. What is the most problematic area of blood vessel entries treatment from the view of the nurses? The qualitative research was carried out by means of hidden observation. Participants of the research included 5 nurses from the dialysis centre of Fresenius Medical Care in Benešov and 5 nurses from the internal medicine ward of Nemocnice Rudolfa a Stefanie a. s. (Hospital of Rudolf and Stefanie) in Benešov. The observation was supplemented by an anonymous survey carried out also at the dialysis centre and at a standard internal medicine ward. Hypotheses can be set based on the obtained results. The medical treatment standard for treatment of blood vessel entries is not observed by all nurses, the standard ward nurses find handling the hemodialysis catheter difficult and the most problematic area of the treatment of blood vessel entries is the failure to observe the aseptic procedures during the treatment as well as the fact that patients do not get extra bandage material for home use. The research results shall serve for preparation of a draft for the medical treatment standard ??Medical treatment for dialysis catheter??.

40|$|BackgroundAneurysms {{that develop}} in {{arteriovenous}} accesses {{as a result}} of repeated punctures are sometimes complicated by infection or ischemia causing sloughing of the overlying skin, which may endanger the access and risk major bleeding and other complications. Surgical revision may necessitate the temporary use of a central venous catheter until dialysis can be resumed via the access. We used stent grafts in selected patients for the exclusion of access aneurysms. MethodsTwenty of 63 patients requiring access revision for complication of an aneurysm from February 2005 to December 2009 underwent ambulatory endovascular stent graft deployment. Indications included signs of impending rupture, questionable viability of overlying skin, pain, infection, and limitation of cannulation sites by the size or number of the aneurysms. Endovascular treatment always included angioplasty of associated outflow or central vein stenoses at the same ambulatory session. ResultsTwenty patients with complicated access aneurysms were treated by endovascular stent graft exclusion at an average of 4. 8 ± 4. 3 years (range, 0. 2 to 16. 1 years) after access construction: nine graft pseudoaneurysms, nine native vein aneurysms, and two acute iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms. Six patients had skin erosion over the aneurysm, and 12 had painful aneurysms and clinical signs of compromised blood supply to the skin. Another two patients with an acute giant false aneurysm occurring during endovascular procedures were treated in the same interventional session by the stenting technique to control bleeding. All the aneurysms underwent endovascular exclusion without complications. Only one infected puncture site failed to heal within 2 months of stenting and was closed surgically 10 months later due to persistent localized graft infection, but with no further bleeding episodes. Only one aneurysm did not reabsorb within 3 months. Patients with painful skin ischemia had immediate pain relief. All patients also had stenosis in the draining veins necessitating additional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Only one patient required hospitalization (for intravenous antibiotic treatment of staphylococcal sepsis). No patients required a central <b>catheter</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis.</b> One access occluded due to cephalic arch stenosis in a noncompliant patient. Functional patency was 87 % at 12 months, with a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 6. 3 to 55. 5 months). ConclusionEndovascular treatment with stent grafts in complicated access aneurysms is a simple, safe and rapid ambulatory procedure that enables treatment of both the aneurysm and its accompanying draining vein stenosis. It enables continued cannulation of the existing access and avoids the use of central catheters...|$|E
40|$|Access-related infections (ARIs), such as exit-site infections, tunnel infections, bacteremia, fungemia and peritonitis, are the Achilles 2 ̆ 7 heel of dialysis, and {{contribute}} significantly to morbidity, mortality and excess healthcare costs in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patient populations. Despite international guidelines recommending the avoidance of <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> access, hospital admissions for vascular ARIs have {{doubled in the last}} decade. Moreover, repeated use of antibiotics to treat ARIs has been associated with the selection of multiresistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. ARIs result from direct inoculation of skin organisms during access cannulation/connection, migration of skin organisms along dialysis catheters into the bloodstream or peritoneal cavity, or contamination and colonization of catheter lumens with subsequent biofilm formation. This paper will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis and prevention of ARIs. It will focus specifically on randomized, controlled trial evidence in relation to the safety and efficacy of aseptic techniques, nasal eradication of S. aureus, oral antimicrobial prophylaxis, topical antimicrobial prophylaxis (including disinfectants, antibiotics and antibacterial honey), antimicrobial catheter lock solutions (including gentamicin, citrate and ethanol), antimicrobial-impregnated catheters, catheter design (straight vs coiled, single vs double cuff), peritoneal dialysis catheter connectology, catheter insertion technique, germicidal devices, vaccines and preinsertion antibiotic prophylaxis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Real-time ultrasound-guided {{techniques}} {{allow for}} improved cannulation {{of the internal}} jugular vein and femoral vein for hemodialysis; however, these techniques require extra sterilization procedures, specialized probes, or needle guides. A simpler ultrasound vessel localization method was performed to investigate whether this alternative approach would aid in the cannulation of the femoral vein for patients in whom temporary angioaccess was required <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis.</b> Methods: Patients requiring temporary femoral vein <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> were divided into 2 groups on alternating {{days of the week}} during a 6 -month period. One group underwent ultrasound localization of the femoral vein before cannulation and the second group received conventional landmark localization. Data regarding the strength of the femoral arterial pulse, number of attempts, failures, and complications were recorded. Results: Ultrasound localization resulted in significantly improved first-attempt success rates, reduced attempts, and reduced failure and complication rates overall (p < 0. 001, p < 0. 001, p = 0. 002 and p = 0. 004 respectively) {{as well as in the}} group of patients with a clearly discernible arterial pulse (p < 0. 001, p = 0. 001, p = 0. 004 and p = 0. 011 respectively). The same trend was observed among patients with faintly palpable or non-palpable femoral arterial pulses, although the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Cannulation of the femoral vein <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> should be performed with the aid of ultrasound. If real-time ultrasound-guided cannulation is not available, the vessel localization method is a good alternative, given its known limitations and the fact that it is simpler. It remains to be determined whether 1 - dimensional localization or localization including vessel depth information can improve outcomes in patients with faintly palpable or non-palpable femoral arterial pulses...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveCentral vein {{stenosis}} or occlusion {{remains an}} unfortunate complication {{associated with the}} use of dialysis catheters. In patients with a functioning arteriovenous fistula, central vein stenosis can lead to debilitating arm, breast, or neck swelling. Treatment typically involves central vein angioplasty or stenting, or both, but restenosis and reocclusion rates remain high. Presented here are the initial results of a unique series of patients with a mature arteriovenous access and symptomatic upper extremity venous hypertension who were treated with axillary vein-to-femoral vein bypass after endovascular therapy failed. MethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of 10 hemodialysis patients with a functioning right upper extremity access who underwent axillary vein-to-femoral vein bypass between December 2011 and April  2013. ResultsThe 10 patients (seven men) were a median age of 58  years. All patients had documentation of prior central venous catheter placement and had undergone a previous endovascular procedure that was unsuccessful or technically unfeasible. The median hospital stay was 2  days (range, 1 - 3  days), and the median assisted-primary patency was 197  days (25 th- 75 th percentile, 114 - 240  days). Three patients presented with recurrent arm swelling that was successfully managed in one patient with revision of the proximal anastomosis. Three additional patients presented with subsequent lower extremity swelling, with one patient benefitting from femoral vein angioplasty. Ultimately, six patients continued to use their original access, and two required placement of interval central venous <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis.</b> ConclusionsIn patients who have exhausted all endovascular options, axillary-to-femoral vein bypass may represent a safe and efficacious approach to alleviate extremity swelling while simultaneously salvaging a functional dialysis access...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Vascular {{access in}} {{patients}} undergoing hemodialysis {{is considered a}} critical determinant of bloodstream infection (BSI) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the occurrence of BSI in patients with end-stage renal disease using central venous <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis.</b> Methods A cohort study was conducted in a public teaching hospital in central-western Brazil from April 2010 to December 2011. For every patient, we noted the presence of hyperemia/exudation upon catheter insertion, as well as fever, shivering, and chills during hemodialysis. Results Fifty-nine patients were evaluated. Thirty-five (59. 3 %) patients started dialysis due to urgency, 37 (62. 7 %) had BSI, and 12 (20 %) died. Hyperemia at the catheter insertion site (64. 9 %) was a significant clinical manifestation in patients with BSI. Statistical analysis revealed 1. 7 times more cases of BSI in patients with hypoalbuminemia compared with patients with normal albumin levels. The principal infective agents identified in blood cultures and catheter-tip cultures were Staphylococcus species (24 cases), non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (7 cases of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 5 cases of Chryseobacterium indologenes), and Candida species (6). Among the Staphylococci identified, 77. 7 % were methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative Staphylococci. Of the bacteria isolated, the most resistant were Chryseobacterium indologenes and Acinetobacter baumannii. Conclusions Blood culture was demonstrated to be an important diagnostic test and identified over 50 % of positive BSI cases. The high frequency of BSI and the isolation of multiresistant bacteria were disturbing findings. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated microorganism, although Gram-negative bacteria predominated overall. These results highlight the importance of infection prevention and control measures in dialysis units...|$|R

40|$|The role of interventional {{radiology}} {{in the overall}} management of patients on dialysis continues to expand. In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the use of tunneled dialysis <b>catheters</b> (TDCs) <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> has become an integral component of treatment plans. Unfortunately, long-term use of TDCs often leads to infections, acute occlusions, and chronic venous stenosis, depletion of the patient′s conventional access routes, and prevention of their recanalization.

In this review, we discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each vascular access option. We illustrate the procedures with case histories and images from our own experience at a highly active dialysis and transplant center. We rank each vascular access option and classify them into tiers based on their relative degrees of effectiveness.

OBJETIVO: Apresentar uma série de casos que demonstram a factibilidade e a funcionalidade da implantação dos cateteres semi-implantáveis por meio de acesso venoso trans-hepático percutâneo em pacientes sem possibilidades de outros acessos. MÉTODOS: Análise observacional retrospectiva dos prontuários de seis pacientes que foram submetidos à implantação de nove cateteres trans-hepáticos percutâneos para hemodiálise. Os cateteres foram implantados na ausência de acessos venosos periféricos disponíveis. No seguimento dos pacientes, procurou-se avaliar: sucesso técnico do procedimento, taxa de complicação, taxa de infecção e patência do acesso. RESULTADOS: Quatro homens e duas mulheres com idades entre 31 e 85 anos (média: 55 anos). Sucesso técnico obtido em 100 %. A média de duração dos cateteres foi de 300, 5 dias (2 a 814 dias). Médias de patência primária e secundária foram de 179, 60 e 328, 33 dias, respectivamente. Taxa de trombose dos cateteres foi de 0, 05 por 100 cateteres-dias, assim como a taxa de infecção. Houve três complicações precoces (30 primeiros dias de implantação dos cateteres) : dois deslocamentos dos cateteres e uma infecção. Duas complicações tardias foram observadas: uma trombose e uma migração. Três pacientes (50 %) tiveram que trocar seus cateteres. Taxa de mortalidade em 30 dias foi de 33 %, porém não relacionada ao procedimento. CONCLUSÃO: Implantação do cateter para hemodiálise por meio do acesso venoso trans-hepático percutâneo parece ser uma técnica segura, porém a utilização desse acesso deve ser aplicada somente em casos de esgotamento de outros acessos vasculares profundos. BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transhepatic venous {{access is}} an option <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> {{patients}} who have exhausted all traditional sites of venous access. OBJECTIVES: To present a small sample regarding the possibility and the functionality of transhepatic implantation of long-term <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> in patients with no other possible access routes. METHODS: Retrospective observational analysis {{was made of the}} charts of six patients in which nine tunneled dialysis catheters were implanted by the percutaneous transhepatic route. Transhepatic catheters were placed {{in the absence of an}} available peripheral venous site. Patients were monitored to evaluate technical success, the complication rate, the infection rate and the duration of catheter patency. RESULTS: Four men and two women aged 31 to 85 years (mean age: 55 years). Technical success was 100 %. The mean duration of catheter function was 300. 5 days (range: 2 to 814 days). Means of primary and secondary patency were 179. 60 and 328. 33 days, respectively. The catheter thrombosis rate was 0. 05 per 100 catheter-days as the infection rate. There were three early complications (within the first 30 days of catheter implantation) : two catheter displacement and one infection. Two late complications were observed: one thrombosis and one migration. Three patients (50 %) needed to have their catheters changed. The 30 -day mortality rate was 33 % but with no relation to the procedure. CONCLUSION: It may be suggested that this technique is safe, however transhepatic hemodialysis catheters may be used in patients with no other options for deep venous access <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis,</b> albeit as a last resort access route...|$|R
40|$|Management of {{patients}} with kidney failure {{and the need for}} dialysis treatment is not an easy task. There are two types of dialysis – hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. More than one million people are receiving hemodialysis worldwide. Without this treatment most of them would have died within weeks. To be able to treat a patient with hemodialysis a vascular access must be established. The types of vascular access designed <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> include the arteriovenous fistula (AV), the arteriovenous graft and the venous catheter. There are two types of <b>catheters</b> used <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> - a tunneled catheter and a non-tunneled catheter. The <b>catheters</b> are used <b>for</b> emergencies and short periods, but in some cases also for a longer period if there are no options for permanent access. In this study I have mainly focused {{on the use of the}} tunneled hemodialysis catheter and studied some of the more common complications associated with this. Based on relevant literature, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials the present study addresses these issues. I have also retrospectively evaluated the use of tunneled hemodialysis catheters at Oslo university hospital Ullevål in 2013. The aim of this study is to examine how this method is used in practice: the indication of use, complications that arises, number of hemodialysis treatments days a week and the durability of these catheters. Medical records and procedure descriptions were used to study the patients. 49 patients (35 male and 14 female, mean 56, 8 years) were treated with a tunneled hemodialysis catheter in the period of January 2013 – December 2013, and included in the study. High blood pressure was the main leading cause of kidney failure in these patients. The results show that like any other medical intervention a variety of complications can arise, some more serious than others. The durability after catheter insertion was at the shortest 2 days and lasted at most 8 months and 19 days...|$|R
40|$|A {{randomized}} {{trial of}} minidose warfarin {{for the prevention}} of late malfunction in tunneled, cuffed hemodialysis catheters. BackgroundMinidose warfarin (1 mg/day) has been associated with a 74 % reduction in the thrombosis rate of central venous catheters used in oncology patients. To determine the efficacy of minidose warfarin on late malfunction caused by thrombosis or fibrin sheath formation in tunneled, cuffed <b>catheters</b> (TCC) used <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> (HD), we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. MethodsOne hundred five chronic HD patients with TCCs were initially randomized. Of these, 85 (warfarin 41 and placebo 44) completed {{the first two weeks of}} the protocol and were followed for the first year of TCC life or until TCC removal. ResultsSixteen TCCs failed with late TCC malfunction, eight in each group. In a multivariate analysis, there was no significant effect of warfarin on thrombosis-free TCC survival or time to the first urokinase (UK) instillation for incipient thrombosis. The presence of a low hemoglobin (Hgb; 1. 00. Patients with diabetes and those with a low Hgb or INR have a higher risk of late TCC malfunction...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundVascular access {{complications}} are {{the greatest}} cause of morbidity and hospitalization in hemodialysis patients. The most frequent complication of central <b>catheters</b> used <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> is dysfunction due to thrombosis. Tunneled hemodialysis catheter thrombosis represents a major medical and economic burden. Although systemic anticoagulation is commonly prescribed to prevent thrombosis and malfunction of the vascular access during hemodialysis, there are only limited data regarding the effect of systemic anticoagulation or antiplatelet activation in between dialysis sessions. MethodsThis randomized prospective study aimed to evaluate whether anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin or low dose aspirin {{is associated with a}} long-term improvement of tunneled hemodialysis catheter thrombosis outcome. Among the 58 patients included in the study, 20 were placed on daily warfarin and 19 on aspirin, while 19 were used as control. ResultsAmong patients receiving warfarin, 18 (90 %) achieved adequate anticoagulation (i. e. INR value within target range), and four (20 %) had at least one episode of catheter malfunction due to catheter thrombosis. Four (21. 1 %) patients on aspirin had one or more episodes of catheter malfunction because of central venous catheter thrombosis (p > 0. 05), while nine (47. 4 %) out of the 19 control patients had tunneled catheter thrombosis with catheter malfunction (p < 0. 01). Malfunction-free catheter survival at 12 months was 75 % in the warfarin group, 68. 4 % in the aspirin group, and 36. 8 % in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the warfarin and aspirin groups, while the difference between the warfarin or aspirin group and the control group was statistically significant (p < 0. 01). ConclusionThese results suggest that both warfarin and aspirin are effective in preventing tunneled hemodialysis catheter thrombosis and increasing long-term malfunction-free catheter survival...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} {{vascular}} surgeons {{were called in}} to place tunneled central venous <b>catheter</b> (TVC) <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> patients. Advent of percutaneous technique has resulted in {{an increasing number of}} interventional nephrologists inserting it. A single centre three year audit of 100 TVCs with a cumulative follow up of 492 patient months is presented here. From 2007 to 2010, 100 TVCs were placed by nephrologists in a percutaneous fashion in the operative room or the interventional nephrology suite. Those who completed minimum of three months on the catheter were included in analysis. There were 69 males and 31 females {{with a mean age of}} 52. 3 ± 13. 6 years. (range: 25 - 76). Chronic glomerulonephritis was the commonest cause of CKD (45 %) followed by diabetes (39 %). Right internal jugular vein was the preferred site (94 %). TVC was utilized as the primary access to initiate dialysis in 25 % of patients in whom a live donor was available for renal transplant. The blood flow was 250 - 270 ml/min. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 3 months and 6 months catheter survival rates were 80 % and 55 %, respectively. The main complications were exit site blood ooze, catheter block and kink. Catheter related bacteremia rate was low at 0. 4 / 1000 patient days. Primary cause of drop out was patient death unrelated to the TVCs. Those under the age of 40 years showed better survival, but there was no bearing of gender, catheter site, and etiology of CKD on survival. Tunneled central venous catheters could find a niche as the primary access of choice for pretransplant live donor renal transplants in view of its immediate usage, high blood flows, low infection rates and adequate patency rates for 3 - 6 months...|$|R
40|$|Internal jugular (IJ) <b>catheter</b> {{insertion}} <b>for</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> (HD) is {{an indispensable}} procedure {{in the management}} of patients with renal failure. The central approach is favored over posterior approach to insert IJ catheters. There are no studies comparing the outcomes between the two approaches. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare central approach with posterior approach <b>for</b> IJ HD <b>catheter</b> insertion and to analyze various outcomes like procedure-related complication rates, catheter insertion failure rates, interruptions during dialysis due to blood flow obstruction and catheter infection rates between the two methods among patients receiving HD. All patients requiring IJ HD catheter insertion during a 1 -month period were randomly assigned to undergo catheter insertion via either conventional central approach or posterior approach. Patients were followed-up till the removal of the catheter. Among 104 patients included in the study, 54 were assigned to the central approach group and 50 to the posterior approach group. The central approach group had higher rate of procedure-related complications (14. 81 % vs. 6 %, P = 0. 04). Catheter insertion failure rates were marginally higher in posterior approach group (20 % vs. 12. 96 %, P = 0. 07). One or more instance of interruption during HD due to obstruction in blood flow was more common in posterior approach (46 % vs. 9. 25 %, P < 0. 01). Catheter infection rates were similar between the two groups; 16. 66 % (n = 9) in central group vs. 14 % (n = 7) in posterior group. Posterior approach is a reasonable alternative to conventional central approach in IJ cannulation <b>for</b> HD <b>catheter.</b> It is, however, associated with a significantly high rate of interruption in HD blood flow and catheter insertion failure rates. The posterior approach can be used in patients with local exit site infection or in failed attempts to cannulate IJ vein via the conventional central approach...|$|R

The impact of vancomycin or cefazolin as prophylactic antibiotics on the infection outcomes was also tested. Patients and methods: Hemodialysis patients who presented to such procedure {{were divided into two}} cohorts: A (from 2004 to 2008) and B (from 2013 to 2015). Time from TC to TCC conversion, prophylactic antibiotics, and reasons for TCC removal were evaluated. Results: One hundred and thirty patients were included in cohort A and 228 in cohort B. Sex, age, and follow-up time were similar between cohorts. Median time from TC to TCC conversion was longer in cohort A than in cohort B (14 [3; 30] vs 4 [1; 8] days, respectively; P< 0. 0001). Infection leading to catheter removal occurred in 26. 4 % vs 18. 9 % of procedures in cohorts A and B, respectively, and infection rate was 0. 93 vs 0. 73 infections per 1, 000 catheter-days, respectively (P= 0. 092). Infection within 30 days from the procedure occurred in 1. 4 % of overall cohort. No differences were observed when comparing vancomycin and cefazolin as prophylactic antibiotics on 90 -day infection-free TCC survival in a Kaplan–Meier model (log-rank = 0. 188). TCC removal for low blood flow occurred in 8. 9 % of procedures. Conclusion: Conversion of TC to TCC by nephrologists had overall infection, catheter patency, and complications similar to data reported in the literature. Vancomycin was not superior to cefazolin as a prophylactic antibiotic.

40|$|Central venous {{catheters}} (CVCs) {{are frequently}} used {{in patients with}} chronic renal failure who require long-term hemodialysis. CVCs are also {{known to be a}} major source of bloodstream infections. Though antibiotic-lock therapy (ALT) has previously been used to prevent and treat catheter-related infections, the use of ALT remains controversial {{due to the lack of}} large prospective randomized controlled trials. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ALT in the prevention of catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) in a veteran population who required chronic hemodialysis. This was a retrospective, case-controlled study. All patients who underwent hemodialysis using a tunneled central catheter (TCC) from January 1, 2006 to October 8, 2008 were examined. Eleven patients who received ALT were compared with 15 case control subjects. The effectiveness of ALT for prevention of CRB was determined by the incidence of CRBs during the study period and catheter removal secondary to a CRB. A total of 10, 961 catheter-days were calculated from 47 TCCs among 26 patients. The two groups had similar demographics and risk factors for CRBs. There were a total of 17 incidences of CRBs with a rate of 1. 55 incidences/ 1, 000 catheter-days. The rate of CRB was significantly lower in the ALT group (0. 69 incidences/ 1, 000 catheter-days) than the control group (2. 54 incidences/ 1, 000 catheter-days), p= 0. 041. The rate of catheters removal due to a CRB was also significantly less in the ALT group (0. 5 catheter removed/ 1, 000 catheter-days) than the control group (2. 41 catheter removed/ 1, 000 catheter-days), p= 0. 041. Seven out of 9 patients died in the control group secondary to CRBs. Three patients died in the ALT group; however none of these deaths were associated with CRB.
