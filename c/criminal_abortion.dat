60|$|It {{had better}} be stated here and now {{at the outset that}} the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly {{addicted}} runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm {{on the one hand and}} on the other a happily chosen position, succubitus felix of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of <b>criminal</b> <b>abortion</b> or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- A {{preliminary}} {{survey was conducted}} during the years 1978 -’ 79 at Bhopal and its neighbourhood {{to find out the}} medicinal plants and their utility. From among a total number of 850 angiospermic plant species of this region, about 10 % of them were found having poisonous principles. One fourth of these poisonous plants can be used for safe termination of pregnancy. Certain of these plants are used by the villagers for <b>criminal</b> <b>abortions</b> and even for suicidal purpose. A good number of them can be used for fertility control and in aid of family planning programme. BHOPAL, the capital city of Madhya Pradesh, is a floristically rich region having over 850 flowering plant species (Oommachan, 1977) About 10 % of these plants are found to be poisonous by a survey carried out by Oommachan and Tripathi (1978). As a result of {{a recent survey by the}} present authors, it was revealed that over 25 % of these poisonous plants are used for fertility control and as abortifacients by the local people. Certa in plants are used by them for <b>criminal</b> <b>abortions</b> and even for suicidal purposes. A good number of these plants are useful for safe termination of pregnancy. It, therefore, warrants detailed chemical and pharmacological study for extensive use of such plants in family planning programme. The study of plants for fertility control purpose is getting impetus in our country as they are orally used by female as anti-ovulatory, antizygotic, anti-implantation, or as early abortifacient Tewari et al (1979), Chopra et al (1965) and Dastur (1970) also enlightened a number of Ayurvedic applications of poisonous and medicinal plants of India and its neighbourhood. pages 67 - 69 The following is a list of certain significant plants with their local names and details of parts acting as abortifacients and for the purpose of fertility control...|$|R

40|$|This note {{focuses on}} the issue of the state 2 ̆ 7 s {{application}} of the criminal law as a sanction against women who choose to have abortions. History reveals that pre-Roe criminal-abortion law-both by its terms and in its application-expressed an incoherent attitude toward the culpability of these women. While criminal-abortion laws treated the abortionist as a serious felon, sending him to prison for up to twenty years, 2 ̆ 7 the same statutes either did not cover the woman seeking an abortion, or, if the statutes did deem her a criminal, prosecutors and courts refused or neglected to hold her liable criminally. The law instead cast women as victims of the criminal conduct of others and sometimes, paradoxically, of themselves. This Note 2 ̆ 7 s project, therefore, is to document the progression of criminal-abortion laws and, by providing a moving picture over time, to demonstrate the implications of recriminalizing abortion today. Part I examines the history of the criminal law 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of women in the context of abortion. Part II brings the issue of <b>criminal</b> <b>abortion</b> up to date by examining the status of abortion law since Roe, demonstrating the Roe era to be a brief interlude in a remarkably consistent history of the legal treatment of women and abortion in our society. Part III explores the implications for the present debate of our past experience with abortion law. This Part first discusses the persistence of the anomalous treatment of the woman 2 ̆ 7 s conduct as the most prominent feature of criminal-abortion laws, both in the past and today. It then poses the political dilemma that confronts the supporters of abortion statutes today. Next, it considers and rejects a variety of potentially sound justifications for the anomalous treatment of the woman 2 ̆ 7 s conduct that those supporters might advance. Finally, this Note concludes that if the proponents of <b>criminal</b> <b>abortion</b> cannot successfully portray their legislative schemes as coherent, anything less than a wholesale rejection of criminal-abortion laws represents a return to a legal regime that embraces and perpetuates the paternalistic and patronizing treatment of women...|$|E
