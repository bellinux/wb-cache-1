5|$|In {{his role}} as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, <b>Cunningham</b> had to {{negotiate}} with the French Admiral Rene-Emile Godfroy for the demilitarisation and internment of a French squadron at Alexandria, in June 1940, following the Fall of France. Churchill had ordered <b>Cunningham</b> to prevent the French warships from leaving port, and to ensure that French warships did not pass into enemy hands. Stationed at the time at Alexandria, <b>Cunningham</b> entered into delicate negotiations with Godfroy to ensure his fleet, which consisted of the battleship Lorraine, four cruisers, three destroyers and a submarine, posed no threat. The Admiralty ordered <b>Cunningham</b> to complete the negotiations on 3 July. Just as an agreement seemed imminent Godfroy heard of the British action against the French at Mers el Kebir and, for a while, <b>Cunningham</b> feared a battle between French and British warships in the confines of Alexandria harbour. The deadline was overrun but negotiations ended well, after <b>Cunningham</b> put them on a more personal level and had the British ships appeal to their French opposite numbers. Cunningham's negotiations succeeded and the French emptied their fuel bunkers and removed the firing mechanisms from their guns. <b>Cunningham</b> in turn promised to repatriate the ships' crews.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, <b>Cunningham</b> led British {{naval forces}} {{to victory in}} several {{critical}} Mediterranean naval battles. These included the attack on Taranto in 1940, the first completely all-aircraft naval attack in history, and the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941. <b>Cunningham</b> controlled the defence of the Mediterranean supply lines through Alexandria, Gibraltar, and the key chokepoint of Malta. He also directed naval support for the various major Allied landings in the Western Mediterranean littoral. In 1943, <b>Cunningham</b> was promoted to First Sea Lord, the professional head of the Royal Navy, a position he held {{until his retirement in}} 1946. He was ennobled as Baron <b>Cunningham</b> of Hyndhope in 1945 and made Viscount <b>Cunningham</b> of Hyndhope the following year. After his retirement, <b>Cunningham</b> enjoyed several ceremonial positions, including Lord High Steward at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. He died on 12 June 1963, aged 80.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1946 Geoffrey de Havilland Jr {{was killed}} test-flying the DH.108 Swallow over the Thames estuary. <b>Cunningham</b> {{had taken off}} {{at the same time}} to deliver the first Vampire in Switzerland. <b>Cunningham</b> only learned the next morning, from Swiss {{newspapers}} at breakfast in Geneva, that de Havilland was missing. <b>Cunningham</b> knew the family well and contacted his father, whose other son John had been killed in a collision while flying a Mosquito in 1943. With the agreement of de Havilland senior, <b>Cunningham</b> took the dead pilot's post which earned him £2,000 per year.|$|E

5|$|Attempting {{his usual}} tactic, the British crew {{approached}} {{from behind and}} below. Suddenly the Heinkel lurched into a tight left-hand turn allowing the gunners to fire a broad-side. The bomber disappeared into the mist. <b>Cunningham</b> asked GCI for help. They tracked the Heinkel flying north near Shaftesbury. Engaging again the German pilot managed {{to turn into a}} head-on position and dive past almost upside down. He continually evaded <b>Cunningham</b> by turning in underneath him at near-impossible angles. <b>Cunningham</b> and Rawnsley came to understand they were not dealing with a novice. Soon a turning match began and then the German attempted to escape by twisting and diving. <b>Cunningham</b> forced him down to 900 feet but Rawnsley and GCI lost contact when the ground clutter hid the Heinkel's signal. <b>Cunningham</b> returned to base. News soon came through the He 111 had crashed onto the slopes on Cranborne Chase. Apparently, the Heinkel had broken through the clouds at only a hundred feet and dived vertically into the ground near the isolated village of Alvediston at 17:05. Intelligence later determined that the machine was a He 111H-6, Werknummer 4627, code 6N+FR, from 7./KGr 100. The bomber disintegrated upon impact. The pilot, Staffelkapitän ("squadron leader") Hauptmann Siegried Langer was killed along with his crew; Oberfeldwebel G. Schmidt, Feldwebel D. Hoffmann, P. Gaidies and Gefreiter W. Worring. It was a unique victory for <b>Cunningham.</b> He had not fired his guns in the 150-minute chase.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cunningham</b> drew on his {{religious}} faith to persevere through the loss, believing that God {{had a reason}} for everything to happen.

5|$|<b>Cunningham</b> {{had to wait}} a {{month for}} his next victory on 23 December 1940. Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 1) sent 100 bombers led by Kampfgruppe 100 to attack Manchester. GCI {{vectored}} <b>Cunningham</b> onto the enemy aircraft. It was not yet dark and <b>Cunningham</b> identified the machine as a Heinkel He 111. Flying at 15,000 feet, he saw the Heinkel above the Beaufighter at 16,500 feet. <b>Cunningham</b> engaged the enemy 50 miles south of West Lulworth. The enemy climbed to 19,000 feet. Following, <b>Cunningham</b> opened fire at 200–300 yards. The He 111 was engulfed in fire. The bomber was high enough for the crew to jettison the bombs and incendiaries and glide to France where it crash-landed at Cherbourg. Two of Feldwebel Georg Deininger's crew were wounded. The 3./KGr 100 machine was written off. The crew were unaware they had {{been a victim of}} a night-fighter. They supposed they had been shot down by a flak ship.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cunningham</b> {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave <b>Cunningham</b> a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then <b>Cunningham</b> would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cunningham</b> was {{promoted}} to flight lieutenant on 12 March 1940. In April 1940 the squadron flew as escort for a De Havilland Flamingo carrying Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, to Paris to attend a meeting after the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. Most of the unit's time during the Phoney War was consumed engaging in intensive training over the Wash which included co-operation with searchlights and mine-laying operations. It did not last for long. On 15 May 1940, 604 relocated to RAF Manston. From the airfield <b>Cunningham</b> flew sorties over the English Channel and patrols over Dunkirk as the Battle for France intensified. <b>Cunningham</b> made no recorded contact with the enemy and France capitulated on 25 June 1940.|$|E

40|$|This lecture (with {{movement}} demonstrations) {{uses the}} International Symmetry Notation system (ISN) {{to present an}} empirical explanation of reversals as they occur in Merce <b>Cunningham's</b> dances and teaching. While not limited to his technique, reversals are used more often and more systematically in <b>Cunningham's</b> technique than other major dance systems. The use of reversals is not an artificial contrivance, but rather it reflects the eye's natural tendencies in symmetry-perception of the human form. Despite their inherently inexact nature, <b>Cunningham's</b> use of reversals demonstrates the subtle yet profound role of higher-order symmetries in dance...|$|R
