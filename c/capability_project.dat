On 20 November 2008, the government released a statement saying it will support buying F-35s for the Royal Norwegian Air Force instead of the Gripen NG. The government's reasoning for choosing the F-35 over Gripen was that only the US aircraft supposedly fulfilled the operational requirements, and that it was allegedly offered at a more competitive price than the Swedish fighter. This has been strongly criticized by Saab, saying that Norway made errors when calculating the cost for Gripen NG vs the cost for the JSF.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} a foundation to guide future research on <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> based on three main contributions. First, drawing upon research on dynamic capabilities and organisational ambidexterity, {{we suggest that}} innovative and routine dimensions of <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> are developed and mobilised {{to deal with the}} variety of exploratory and exploitative conditions facing an organisation. Second, we distinguish between <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> at the operational and dynamic capabilities at the strategic levels, arguing that firms depend on identifiable dynamic capabilities (e. g. portfolio management techniques) to know when and how to maintain current <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> and when to modify or replace them depending on the conditions encountered. Third, we suggest that the relationship between dynamic and <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> is reciprocal, recursive and mutually reinforcing. In this reciprocal relationship, the emergence of new or declining <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> provides indications for the strategic priorities, behaviours and future deployment of an organisation's dynamic capabilities...|$|R
