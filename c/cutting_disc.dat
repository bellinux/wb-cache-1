50|$|Saw Blades - A popular {{weapon in}} the early years of robotic combat, these robots use a {{dedicated}} motor to power either a modified chainsaw or circular saw, or a custom-built <b>cutting</b> <b>disc,</b> usually at high speeds (up to 10,000 RPM). The serrated blade is used to slice through an opponent's armour to try and reach its internal components. These weapons can create spectacular showers of sparks, and are easy to combine with other designs, but can be ineffective against robots with tougher armour. The aforementioned Robot Wars champion Roadblock had a rear-mounted circular saw in addition to its wedge, while Series 4 runner-up Pussycat had a custom <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> with four serrated blades.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate performance of different mechanisms regarding straw mobilization, employed in a no-till seeder. The experimental area was conducted on clayey soil under no-tillage with a large quantity of sorghum residue. The experiment was established in a randomized block design, as the treatments consisted of a combination of two mechanisms at front of the furrow opener composed of <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> and row cleaners, and three mechanisms behind the seed furrower, covering discs prototype model M 1, Spider and commercial model, with the combination of <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> and Spider model not being evaluated. We assessed the coverage permanence on soil index, vegetation mass on surface and inside the line. The treatment containing the row cleaner mechanism efficiently removed straw from the surface of sowing line as well as the return one acted on straw replacement. It was identified that use of the <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> at the front of seeder contributed to the increase of straw installation inside the line, three times more than in the row cleaner system when operating individually.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Intensification of soil {{compaction}} process under no-tillage (NT) is motivating {{the search for}} alternatives to mitigate {{soil compaction}} state. This study evaluated changes in soil physical and hydraulic properties caused by seeder with fertilizer shanks at different depths compared with the double discs lagged seeder, to investigate the possibility of soil decompaction by sowing under NT in southern Brazil. The {{study was conducted in}} a clayed Oxisol, for 27 years under NT. Treatments were three planting mechanisms: S 0. 10 m: <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> combined with shank acting to 0. 10 m depth; S 0. 15 m: <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> combined with shank acting to 0. 15 m depth and, D 0. 07 m: double discs lagged acting to 0. 07 m depth in an experimental randomized block design with four replications. We evaluated the soil mechanical resistance, water infiltration rate, soil bulk density, pore size distribution and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Results indicated that the use of seeder with fertilizer shanks acting at 0. 15 m deep promoted the soil decompaction by the reduction of penetration resistance and increase of porosity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. To have significant increase in water infiltration rate the fertilizer shanks of the seeder must be deepened to the lower limit of the compacted surface layer...|$|E

Given these considerations, {{the aim of}} this study was to evaluate different mechanisms for coverage mobilization on the sowing line and their effect on germination environment of maize seeds, mainly in relation to the dynamics of straw in the seedbed, water content and soil temperature. Treatments consisted on the combination of two mechanisms at front of furrow opener, composed of <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> and row cleaners, with three mechanisms behind the seed furrower for returning the soil, consisting of three covering mechanisms, commercial and prototype models. It was found that straw presence on the surface of sowing line contributed to germination of maize seeds, maintenance of temperature and soil water content. The <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> treatment, associated with prototype, introduced percentages of water content near the ones in bottom layer, and this soil water content was 29. 7 % with 93. 75 % of straw coverage and deeper seeding depth, granting better conditions for {{seed germination}}. However, the straw coverage removal on soil by the row cleaners and its low sowing depth caused water loss in the lines resulting in great reduction of the emergence speed index in maize seedlings...|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanical}} pruner serves for pruning new hopvine shoots in spring. The later yield {{depends on}} the right timing and quality of pruning. That is why hop pruning {{is one of the}} most important agrotechnical procedures. A double-disc mechanical pruner used on high trellises cannot be used on low trellises due to its large size. Abroad, for pruning hops on low trellises a specially adapted sprinkler is used (chemical pruning). With regard to the effort to minimize the chemical environmental burden, we opted for the design of the mechanical pruner. Firstly, the low trellis, mechanical pruner, and also elements used in the design of hydraulic circuit are described. Next part of the paper is devoted to the input requirements for both the hydraulic circuit and the mechanical pruner designs. Then a description of an adapted inter-axle carrier used for the experimental model of the hop mechanical pruner and of the effected field measurement follows, along with interpretation of the measured data.

40|$|The {{following}} master {{thesis is}} {{an analysis of}} several factors that influence the performance of abrasive <b>cutting</b> <b>discs.</b> It {{has been done in}} collaboration {{with one of the most}} important companies worldwide in the construction tool industry. To keep the confidentiality of this company, this study will refer to it under the name HAG. Contrary to other tools, the performance of abrasive <b>cutting</b> <b>discs</b> is extremely variable depending on many different factors. These multiple factors are extremely diverse and can vary from storage conditions to tool usage. Therefore, this study is developed to obtain precise knowledge on these influential factors so that HAG can take advantage of their direct sales force to access their customers and train the users on how to maximize the performance of their HAG abrasive discs. Based on the available literature and interviews with experts in abrasives manufacturing and testing, this study provides a technical overview on abrasive discs properties, their manufacturing and the grinding process itself. Furthermore, it accurately identifies the most relevant influential factors on the performance of abrasive discs and specific tests are performed to quantify their impact. The mentioned tests provide solid results that have endowed HAG with a profound technical understanding about this sourced product. It has also enabled them to draw precise recommendations on key aspects to optimize the performance of HAG abrasive discs that sales representatives should use as selling arguments. This would not only increase the value of the discs but would also endow HAG salespeople with the image of product experts. The impact of the conclusions extracted from this study is highly interesting for HAG since the deep product knowledge provided will allow customers to use their discs more efficiently and this will, most certainly, imply an increase on the sales of abrasive discs at no additional cost...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{the first}} boring machine {{to have been}} built was used in 1853 during the {{construction}} of the Hoosac Tunnel.

The main objective {{of this study was to}} modify an existing plantain slicing machine so as to optimize its efficiency at low cost, reduce total time of slicing and produce hygienic and quality chips. The improvement on the design of the existing slicing machine was achieved through proper focus on the capacity, materials and other design criteria for various component parts. The slicer consists of <b>cutting</b> <b>disc,</b> cutting chamber, feeding chute, the main frame and power transmitting unit. The result of the improvement on the design of this slicing machine showed that maintenance cost is cheap, slicing time of plantain chips was reduced, operation of the machine does not require special skill, the machine is easy and safe to operate, it is free of noise and vibration,the slicing method is continuous with two slicing blades provided inside the cutting chamber and energy for loading and unloading is reduced since feeding chute and collecting bucket are provided. Slicing of plantain is safe since finger injury is reduced. The efficiency of the modified plantain slicing machine is 95. 79 % with capacity of 50. 49 g/s.

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the effect of a variety of root canal irrigation solutions on flexural strength of dentin. Materials and Methods: Fifty intact, extracted human mandibular third molars were used in this study. Each tooth was sectioned using diamond <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> to create dentin bar (1 x 1 mm, with 7 mm in length). All dentin bars were randomly assigned into 5 groups of 10 each. Group 1, dentin bars were immersed in 5 % NaOCl; group 2, in 2. 5 % NaOCl; group 3, in 15 % EDTA; group 4, in 0. 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX); and group 5, in saline (as control) respectively. Each group was immeresed for 2 hours. Each dentin bar was subjected to a three-point bend using MTS Universal Testing Machine to test the flexural strength. Data were analyzed using one way Anova, followed by Tukey's test performed at the 0. 05 level of significance. Results: All irrigation solution {{have an effect on the}} flexural strength (P< 0. 05). EDTA caused the greatest effect on dentin mechanical properties, which revealed the lowest flexural strength (100. 64 ¬± 7. 23). In contrast, 0. 2 % CHX generated the least influence on dentin mechanical properties, which demonstrated the greatest flexural strength (189. 85 ¬± 6. 44). Conclusion: Root canal irrigation solution can induce effect on flexural strength of detin. Chlorhexidine gluconate demonstrates the best irrigation solution since it has a slight effect on dentinal mechanical properties, particularly flexural strength.

40|$|A {{prediction}} model based upon Mohr-Coulomb soil mechanics {{theory has been}} developed to predict {{the interaction between the}} soil and agricultural discs of different geometries and operating angles to both vertical and tilted discs. The model is based on two forms of soil failure. The magnitude of each form of failure is depen- dent upon a passive reaction on the concave side of the disc and a vertical bearing reaction on the convex side of the disc. The predicted results are in close agreement with the results of the experimental studies. Disc geometry {{is one of the most}} important factors to be considered in evaluating the soil reaction acting upon a disc tool. A theoretical analysis of the disc geometry was therefore carried out. The analysis of the disc geometry makes it possible to determine the factors required for the predicted forces acting on a disc tool. The experimental studies were conducted in a sandy loam soil at a moisture content in the friable range, under controlled soil bin conditions. The work was carried out at full-scale with 3 dimensional force measuring apparatus developed primarily for this investigation. The discs studied had a range of disc angles between 150 and 600 and a range of tilt angles between 0 and 35. The depth of cut ranged from 80 mm to 140 mm and at speeds between 0. 75 m/s and 1. 5 m/s. The disturbance area of the soil caused by the rotating soil <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> is calculated to define the disturbed area for any combination of disc angle, disc diameter, gang spacing and depth of work in order to accurately calculate specific resistance.

40|$|The {{interconnection}} of the {{abrasive grain}} front angle parameter with the form, orientation and wear out parameters is investigated. The {{form of the}} abrasive grains was estimated by means of form coefficient which represents the relation of diameters of the spheres described around contours of grains, to diameters of the spheres entered in them. The spatial orientation angle of the abrasive grains was defined between main (i. e. the biggest) axis of the grains and the cutting plane. It is established that, depending on an orientation angle at increase in a form coefficient of the abrasive grains can be either an increase or {{a decrease in the}} values of their front angles. In most cases, with an increase in a form coefficient of the oriented grinding grains (at orientation angles [theta]= 10 ¬∞- 125 ¬∞) the growth of their front angles is fixed. At tangential orientation of grains ([theta]= 0 ¬∞) and at the close directions of orientation ([theta]= 135 ¬∞- 180 ¬∞) the return picture is observed. Also established that the longer the abrasive grain wears along the main axis and located in the tool body, the larger is its front angle. Besides that, the front angles of the abrasive grains reach the maximum positive values at orientation angles [theta]= 2. 5 ¬∞- 45 ¬∞. Dependence of tension in grains during the work with parameters of their form, orientation and depth of embedment in the bundle is investigated. It was found that for all orientation angles of grains their tension significantly increases with an increase in their form coefficient. Besides that it is confirmed that the deeper the grain is in the bundle, the lower the tension is there. Also found that tension is minimal when the grains are tangential orientated. Further on increase the option of the grains in the direction of action of the cutting force follows. Such option of orientation is the most rational both {{from the point of view}} of minimization of tension, and for ensuring rational sizes of front angles of the abrasive grains. The rational angle of grain orientation for <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> are in range [theta]= 65 ¬∞- 75 ¬∞. The joint analysis of dependences of front angles and tension in grains from factors of their form and orientation allows the prediction of operating characteristics of grinding tools at the design stage for specific tasks and processing conditions...|$|E
