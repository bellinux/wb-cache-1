30|$|If the {{pressures}} in tanks A and B are P A =  0.053  atm and P B =  0.046  atm, respectively, {{for increasing the}} pressure and ammonia concentration in tank B, the <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> valve in this tank is opened. However, the compressor does not start working. Vaporized ammonia from tank A flows into tank B because of the concentration difference, and thus, the ammonia gas pressure in tank B increases. When the ammonia gas pressure in tank A increases, the compressor begins to work; hence, the gas pressure in tank A is ensured to decrease. During this period, the compressor is running, and the <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> on tank B side is closed {{in order to prevent}} the flow of ammonia gas from tank B to the <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> line. When the pressure in tank A decreases to 0.043  atm, the compressor is stopped, and the opening <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> on tank B side is opened to ensure that ammonia gas flows to tank B.|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{performance and}} reliability of an air conditioner, the states of its refrigeration cycle need to be understood. Since the isentropic exponent of the next-generation refrigerant R 32 is larger than that of conventional refrigerant R 410 A, the compressor discharge temperature of R 32 is {{higher than that of}} R 410 A. When a wet refrigerant is entered into a <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> line to decrease the discharge temperature, it is generally difficult to estimate the vapor quality at the suction. This paper describes a method that estimates a vapor quality at the <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> by applying energy balances on the compressor with the values of suction pressure, discharge pressure, discharge temperature, etc. In the air conditioner test, the vapor qualities at the <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> estimated with this method agree well with those estimated with the conventional method by measuring liquid and vapor flow-rates. Moreover, this paper derives a relational expression for estimating a <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> state from a discharge state and discusses the characteristics of the coefficients in the expression calculated from the test results...|$|E
5000|$|A {{standard}} two staged {{cycle of}} this kind will possess an expansion valve that expands and modulates the amount of refrigerant incoming at the interstage. As the fluid arriving to the interstage expands, it will tend to evaporate, producing an overall temperature drop and cooling the second <b>compressor’s</b> <b>suction</b> when mixing with the fluid discharged by the first compressor. This kind of set up may have a heat exchanger between the expansion and the interstage, situation in which that second evaporator may serve to produce refrigeration as well, though not as cool as the main evaporator (for example to produce air conditioning or for keeping fresh products). A two staged system {{is said to be}} set up in a booster display with subcooling, if the refrigerant arriving to the interstage passes through a subcooling heat exchanger that subcools the main liquid line arriving to the main evaporator of the same system.|$|R
50|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} flash-gas in the liquid line include a {{cautious}} {{design of the}} cooling system and its piping, but also the incorporation of gear that might help solve this type of difficulty. The inclusion of a refrigerant receiver is a common, cheap and simple way of decreasing the gas ratio in the liquid line. The incorporation of a subcooling stage after the receiver reduces even more the chances to observe flash gas. This subcooling may {{be done in a}} reserved portion of the main condenser, or separately with a heat exchanger. Some receivers may incorporate an internal heat exchanger that draws heat form the subcooled liquid to superheat the gas <b>compressors</b> <b>suction.</b> There are also many kinds of independent subcooling displays and applications such as refrigeration cycle optimizers; these help avoiding flash-gas in the liquid line by lowering the temperature away from the refrigerant’s saturation curves. Some systems deal with flash-gas by separating it from the refrigerant that goes to the evaporator, as that portion of the refrigerant alrealdy evaporated and will only increase superheating.|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} plasma {{actuator}} {{to suppress}} boundary layer separation on a <b>compressor</b> blade <b>suction</b> side to increase axial compressor performance. Plasma actuators are {{a new type of}} electrical flow control device that imparts momentum to the air when submitted to a high AC voltage at high frequency. The concept presented in this paper consists in the positioning of a plasma actuator near the separation point on a <b>compressor</b> rotor <b>suction</b> side to increase flow turning. In this computational study, three parameters have been studied {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} plasma actuator: actuator strength, position and actuation method (steady versus unsteady). Results show that plasma actuator operated in steady mode can increase the pressure ratio, efficiency, and power imparted by the rotor to the air and that the pressure ratio, efficiency and rotor power increase almost linearly with actuator strength. On the other hand, the actuator&# 39;s position has limited effect on the performance increase. Finally, the results from unsteady simulations show a limited performance increase but are not fully conclusive, due possibly to the chosen pulsing frequencies of the actuator and/or to limitations of the CFD code...|$|R

30|$|Depending on the {{increase}} in the pressure of ammonia gas in tank A, the <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> valve of tank B opens, and thus, the entire amount of ammonia gas enters tank B from tank A. When the <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> valve is open, the compressor does not run, because the ammonia gas, which is vaporized in tank A and passed to tank B, can decrease the ammonia gas concentration in tank B.

40|$|A {{topology}} optimization method is developed to optimally design suction mufflers in reciprocating <b>compressors.</b> <b>Suction</b> mufflers {{should be designed}} for high noise reduction. The suction mufflers {{are not easy to}} systematically design because their outer shape is so complicated and the center axes of the inlet/outlet do not coincide. Muffler researchers in industry have designed the internal configuration of suction mufflers intuitively and experientially. However, since our proposed muffler design method is not restricted to location of the inlet and outlet and to the outer shape of suction muffler, it could be applied to suction muffler design problems. A {{topology optimization}} problem is formulated for a finite element model simulating a suction muffler for a reciprocating compressor. Transmission loss value at a target frequency is selected as an objective function and partition volume is constrained. Design variables change continuously from zero to one during optimization process. The material filling one element is an intermediate material between fluid and solid in each iterative calculation and become fluid or rigid body at a final converged stage depending on the value of design variables. Rigid body elements build up partitions or flow path to increase transmission loss.

40|$|LectureFor years, {{labyrinth}} shaft-end seals {{have been}} used for centrifugal compressors handling air and nonhazardous gases, and for low suction pressure compressors in hydrocarbon service. To prevent gas leakage from the hydrocarbon machines, either injection of inert gas or jet ejector systems have been applied with the seals. The ejectors were normally arranged to exhaust back to the <b>compressor</b> <b>suction.</b> Early application of labyrinth/ejector seal systems were generally on compressors with suction pressures in the 0 - 8 psig range, and the seal system operation was generally satisfactory. Many of the older machines have been uprated to higher suction pressures. The labyrinth/ejector seal systems have been applied to newer compressors with suction pressures as high as 15 psig. Many of the systems do not perform satisfactorily, and operators complain of leakage of hydrocarbons and contamination of the lube oil. This {{may be the result of}} noncritical-flow ejectors operating with critical pressure ratios. Labyrinth/ejector seal systems can be designed to perform satisfactorily with the higher <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> pressures, but these systems often require critical-flow ejectors. Despite their relatively low initial cost, the economics of labyrinth/ejector seal systems for high <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> pressures may not compare favorably with oil-type seal systems because of the energy required to recycle motive gas...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} operating performance for a novel reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method for air source heat pumps (ASHPs). Firstly, a description of both an experimental prototype ASHP unit where the novel reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method may be realized, and its operating modes are presented. This is followed by reporting an experimental set up for testing the defrosting performance of the prototype ASHP unit using the novel thermal energy storage (TES) based reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method. Finally, experimental results are presented and discussed. The experimental results suggested {{that the use of}} the novel reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method for the experimental ASHP unit was able to help shorten the defrosting time by ∼ 3 min or 38 %, and minimize the risk of shutting down the ASHP unit due to low suction pressure through increasing the <b>compressor's</b> <b>suction</b> pressure by about 200 kPa, when compared {{to the use of the}} traditional standard reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method. In addition, when the TES based reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method was used, the mean indoor coil surface temperature during defrosting was about 25 K higher than that when the traditional standard reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method was used. These results suggested that as compared to the use of the traditional standard reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method, the use of the novel TES based defrosting method would enable a quicker space heating resumption, impacting less on indoor thermal environment due to defrosting. Hence, the novel TES based defrosting method was proven to be effective in reducing the current problems in ASHPs using standard reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method, such as a longer defrosting time and a poor system reliability.

50|$|The {{compression}} process occurs over approximately 2 to 2½ rotations of the crankshaft, {{compared to}} one rotation for rotary compressors, and one-half rotation for reciprocating compressors. The scroll discharge and suction processes occur {{for a full}} rotation, compared to less than a half-rotation for the reciprocating suction process, and less than a quarter-rotation for the reciprocating discharge process. Reciprocating compressor have multiple cylinders (typically, anywhere from two to six), while scroll compressors only have one compression element. The presence of multiple cylinders in reciprocating <b>compressors</b> reduces <b>suction</b> and discharge pulsations. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} state whether scroll compressors have lower pulsation levels than reciprocating compressors as has often been claimed by some suppliers of scroll compressors. The more steady flow yields lower gas pulsations, lower sound and lower vibration of attached piping, while having no influence on the compressor operating efficiency.|$|R

30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that the ammonia gas pressure in tank B increases when ammonia flows into the tank after the <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> valve on tank B side is opened. During the ammonia gas transfer from tank A to tank B, nitrogen gas is discharged from the ammonia discharge point {{at the bottom of}} tank B. This nitrogen gas results from the purging using nitrogen in tank B. In this manner, a large pressure increase in tank B is prevented by discharging nitrogen gas.|$|E
30|$|In this manner, {{ammonia gas}} {{is sent to}} tank B, compressed, and made to {{discharge}} nitrogen into the atmosphere. According {{to the values of}} the operational parameters shown in Fig.  2, because of the increasing pressure difference between tanks A and B caused by the compressor in function, vaporized ammonia gas flows from tank A to tank B, which has lower ammonia gas pressure.

30|$|The {{ammonia gas}} {{entering}} tank B forces the nitrogen gas in this tank to be {{expelled from the}} discharge point. Similarly, when the pressure difference between tanks A and B decreases, the <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> valve is closed and the compressor is allowed to run for allowing nitrogen gas to flow between the tanks and for discharging nitrogen gas by creating pressure in the tank. Thus, the vaporized ammonia in tank A is liquefied and stored in tank A. Once the pressure of ammonia gas in the tank is increased by the multistage compressor, the compressor stops, and thus, liquid ammonia in tank A is vaporized.|$|E
40|$|Two-phase {{ejectors}} are devices {{capable of}} improving the performance of refrigeration and air conditioning cycles by means of expansion work recovery. Ejector studies often focus on the design and performance of the two-phase ejector and the effect it can have {{on the performance of}} the ejector cycle. However, the ejector is not the only component of the system that can have a significant influence on the performance of the ejector cycle. Recent experimental work has shown that the effect of evaporator design on ejector cycle performance can be quite significant, though there is very little research available on the relation between evaporator design and ejector cycle performance. In this paper, a numerical model of a microchannel air-to-refrigerant evaporator, capable of accounting for heat transfer and pressure drop effects, is developed and used to investigate the effect that different evaporator dimensions have on the performance of ejector cycles. The model is validated with experimental data from previous ejector cycle studies. There are two ejector cycles of interest: The standard ejector cycle, in which the ejector is used to directly lift the <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> pressure, and the ejector recirculation cycle, in which the ejector recirculates excess liquid through the evaporator but does not directly lift <b>compressor</b> <b>suction</b> pressure. The effects of microchannel port hydraulic diameter, number of evaporator passes, refrigerant outlet state, and air-side resistance are investigated.

Troubleshooting: Whole entire factors were investigated from process condition change, piping layout, separating drum size and valve design. Very viscous and sticky heavy hydrocarbon called `Green Oil? was found at the valves & cylinder could cause valve late closing and consequential excessive impact stress during valve closing. Increased colder spill-back by-pass flow could cool down gas after separator drum made easy formation of heavy hydrocarbon condensate. Moreover liquid condensate could exist as slug at low point of suction manifold piping directly connected to <b>compressor</b> <b>suction.</b> Valve dynamics and pulsation after revamp was acceptable but plate type valve seemed to be not good choice under service including sticky liquid showing bouncing at edge of plate during late closing.
