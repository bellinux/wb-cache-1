40|$|In <b>Canada,</b> <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> Style {{has come}} to be {{associated}} with domestic architecture and a relaxed, modern lifestyle characteristic of the region's exceptional geography and climate. My thesis is a study of how this cultural formation has been figured and refigured since the Second World War through a historical and discursive analysis of West Coast Style. This cultural study focuses on how the term West Coast Style circulates and shifts meaning in relationship to a variety of domestic architectures such as the suburban single-family dwelling and more urban types like the coop, condominium and high rise. In addition, I consider how West Coast Style has been configured in debates about architectural modernism and postmodernism, Canadian cultural nationalism, and in newly emerging civic, global, and transnational geo-political, economic and cultural networks...|$|E

On <b>Canada's</b> <b>west</b> <b>coast,</b> Red Fife wheat is whiter in colour, due to genetic interaction with mild environmental conditions.

50|$|The Canadian Pacific Railway's {{line through}} Rogers Pass {{completed}} its transcontinental railroad through to <b>Canada's</b> <b>west</b> <b>coast,</b> {{and at the}} time was the only such link. It was therefore of vital importance to keep it open through the winter months. Although completed in November 1885 it was soon abandoned as throughout that winter, up to 12 metres of snow buried the line and avalanches tore away newly-laid sections of track. A costly system of 31 'snow sheds' was constructed to protect the most vulnerable sections of line, covering 6.5 km in all. However, most of the route through the pass was still unprotected, meaning that men and equipment were often called upon to clear the track.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we draw on a {{case study}} of the {{development}} of commercial whale-watching on <b>Canada’s</b> <b>west</b> <b>coast</b> to explore the role of macro-cultural discourse and local actors in the structuration of new institutional fields. We argue that the development of the commercial whale-watching industry in the area was made possible by broad macrocultural changes in the conceptualization of whales in North America. At the same time, however, the characteristics of the geographically distinct institutional fields that emerged depended on local action and the processes of structuration that those actions supported. The constitution of specific new fields required interested actors to engage in the institutional innovation and isomorphism that produced the unique networks of relationships and sets of institutions that constituted those fields...|$|R
