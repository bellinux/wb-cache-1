50|$|A more {{practical}} approach, and one {{adopted by the}} majority of WSS manufacturers is shown schematically in Figure 1 (to be uploaded). The various incoming channels of a <b>common</b> <b>port</b> are dispersed continuously onto a switching element which then directs and attenuates each of these channels independently to the N switch ports. The dispersive mechanism is generally based on holographic or ruled diffraction gratings similar to those used commonly in spectrometers. It can be advantageous, for achieving resolution and coupling efficiency, to employ a combination of a reflective or transmissive grating and a prism - known as a GRISM. The operation of the WSS can be bidirectional so the wavelengths can be multiplexed together from different ports onto a single <b>common</b> <b>port.</b> To date, the majority of deployments have used a fixed channel bandwidth of 50 or 100 GHz and 9 output ports are typically used.|$|E

Later, their geographical origins seemed to have shifted; a 1902 report by Japanese consul Noma Seiichi identified Moji in Kyushu as the most <b>common</b> <b>port</b> of origin for these young women; recruiters often targeted young women coming out of the Mojikō Station near the docks. However, the Japanese consulate had little co-operation from the local Japanese community in their efforts to suppress prostitution; Japanese businesspeople in the hospitality industry depended on custom from prostitutes and their johns for its profits.|$|E

50|$|On 9 May 1940 {{she was in}} port in Liverpool England, {{awaiting}} {{return to}} the Netherlands when the crew was warned not {{to return to their}} home country. The next day the German army invaded the Low Countries. The ship and crew were immediately militarized and Maasdam was chartered to the Ministry of War Transport in London. Maasdam left New York for Halifax on 11 June 1941 with a crew of forty-eight, plus thirty-two passengers, including eleven US Marine Corps personnel and seventeen American Red Cross volunteer nurses. The marines were destined for duty at the US Embassy in London and the nurses were scheduled to serve at the Harvard Hospital. Halifax was a <b>common</b> <b>port</b> from which eastbound convoys formed. Maasdam arrived the evening of 13 June 1941.

5000|$|After its founding, El Copano was a <b>common</b> <b>port</b> used by pirates and smugglers.

Around this time, a customhouse and {{freshwater}} tank were all that could be found on land, but the port was valued. General Juan Almonte described it as the deepest port on the Texas coast during an 1834 inspection for Antonio López de Santa Anna, and it was described as the [...] "safest" [...] on the coast, due to its protection by Copano Reef. [...] Copano was also used by many Irish emigrants from 1828 to 1835, many of whom landed at the port during their trek from New York City to the Irish colony of San Patricio. At least 200 of these settlers died of cholera upon arrival and were buried on Copano beach.|$|E
5000|$|The test {{frequency}} {{is generated by}} a variable frequency CW source and its power level is set using a variable attenuator. The position of switch SW1 sets the direction that the test signal passes through the DUT. Initially consider that SW1 is at position 1 so that the test signal is incident on the DUT at P1 which is appropriate for measuring [...] and [...] The test signal is fed by SW1 to the <b>common</b> <b>port</b> of splitter 1, one arm (the reference channel) feeding a reference receiver for P1 (RX REF1) and the other (the test channel) connecting to P1 via the directional coupler DC1, PC1 and A1. The third port of DC1 couples off the power reflected from P1 via A1 and PC1, then feeding it to test receiver 1 (RX TEST1). Similarly, signals leaving P2 pass via A2, PC2 and DC2 to RX TEST2. RX REF1, RX TEST1, RX REF2 and RXTEST2 are known as coherent receivers as they share the same reference oscillator, and {{they are capable of}} measuring the test signal's amplitude and phase at the {{test frequency}}. All of the complex receiver output signals are fed to a processor which does the mathematical processing and displays the chosen parameters and format on the phase and amplitude display. The instantaneous value of phase includes both the temporal and spatial parts, but the former is removed by virtue of using 2 test channels, one as a reference and the other for measurement. When SW1 is set to position 2, the test signals are applied to P2, the reference is measured by RX REF2, reflections from P2 are coupled off by DC2 and measured by RX TEST2 and signals leaving P1 are coupled off by DC1 and measured by RX TEST1.

40|$|Part 2 : CONTROL SYSTEMS SECURITYInternational audienceThe {{security}} of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks has attracted considerable attention since {{the discovery of}} Stuxnet in 2010. Meanwhile, SCADA networks have become increasingly interconnected both locally and remotely. It is, therefore, necessary to develop effective network intrusion detection capabilities. Whitelist-based intrusion detection has become an attractive approach for SCADA networks. However, when analyzing network traffic in SCADA systems, general properties such as TCP handshaking and <b>common</b> <b>ports</b> are insufficient to create flow whitelists. To address the problem, this chapter proposes a methodology for locality-based creation of flow whitelists and conducts experiments to evaluate its effectiveness in seven SCADA systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the methodology generates effective whitelists for deployment in SCADA networks...|$|R
