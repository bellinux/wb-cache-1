2500|$|Before {{they perform}} their project {{on a grand}} scale, they decide to get some {{experience}} by dressing a small business of all-female driving instructors in uniform. A uniform had been optional, {{but all of the}} instructors were keen on the idea. The duo's next step is re-designing the uniform of the <b>catering</b> <b>department</b> at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend. To get a feel of what it is like working in these uniforms, Trinny and Susannah spend a few hours working at the establishment. One worker commented [...] "We were surprised. Although they are quite posh, they did have a go. They weren't too worried about slops. Although Susannah did say it was making her ill." [...] Before the renewal of the uniform, it consisted of old-fashioned mismatched items, until it was replaced by matching pink gingham outfits. Then came the task of designing a practical outfit for the Somerfield workers. When the items are made, selected members of Somerfield model the catwalk in the fruit & veg section.|$|E
