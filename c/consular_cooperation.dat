The new challenges (expressed in terms of security and public order through phenomena such as the increase in migration flows and international terrorism) have emphasised the strategic role played by local <b>consular</b> <b>cooperation</b> as a means to improve the integrated management of the EU’s external borders. This article analyses the development and the institutional modalities of this type of cooperation that has been developed outside the borders of the EU, and questions the contribution of same to the construction of an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) within the Union...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} written against the {{background}} of the on-going evaluation of the EU Visa Code and an emerging paradigm shift in EU visa policy with visas becoming a tool for economic growth and job creation. The paper analyses, more particularly, current challenges for the proper functioning of the EU’s common visa policy by focusing on the three pillars on which this policy is based: its cornerstone, the Visa Code; <b>consular</b> <b>cooperation</b> on the ground, as an indispensable supplement of the latter; and, finally, the Visa Facilitation Agreements, a potential tool for its smooth operation in certain countries. Due to the limited mid-term review of the Stockholm Programme, initially foreseen for 2012, the Stockholm guidelines for visa policy are integrated in the relevant analysis...|$|E

The study suggests that at least in the medium term, {{there is a lot to}} be gained from a bilateral engagement between India and the Members of ASEAN in services, especially as the region remains relatively closed to foreign service providers. The pillars of negotiation should be both market access and other <b>consular</b> <b>cooperation,</b> including signing of MRAs and other related Domestic Regulation issues.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s the European Union has {{struggled}} to increase integration in the sovereignty sensitive areas of justice and home affairs and foreign policy. The aim {{of this paper is}} to enhance our understanding of what patterns of cooperation have been established between the member states, and why. I do so by analysing the case of short-stay visa policy. Visas are a corner stone of EU’s border control, regulating access to the Union’s area of freedom, security and justice. It is moreover an instrument used in foreign and diplomatic relations. As a field where the member states’ cooperation is particularly intense it is an ‘extreme case’ well-suited for drawing out empirical patterns and developing theoretical concepts. The paper is based on a network analytical approach and a new dataset of all the EU/Schengen member states’ mutual consular visa assistance agreements. This I use to document the extent and pattern of cooperation from 2005 to 2010. I show that the member states rely intensively on each other’s consular services. They mainly share sovereignty in four distinct regional clusters – a Nordic, Benelux, Southern European and an emerging Central Eastern. France and Germany are at the centre of the network. To explain this structure of cooperation I discuss the relative merits of realist, liberal intergovernmentalist and constructivist approaches. I show how they each identify important dynamics but emphasise the relative merits of a constructivist perspective. I put forward a new concept of ‘regional imagined communities’ which explains cooperation by the existence of shared identities owing to regional commonalities in language and state-building histories. I argue that the concept improves our understanding of European integration in visa policy, and suggest it might hold wider potential for explaining dynamics of collaboration in other sovereignty sensitive policy areas.

40|$|Initially {{off to a}} slow start, European Union (EU) {{consular}} crisis management cooperation eventually developed as a response to exogenous factors. Given that guaranteeing the safety of one’s citizens is seen as one of the core responsibilities of the nation state, however, the EU’s Member States still seem reluctant to transfer this responsibility to the European level and the EU institutions. At times equated with propaganda, both the terminology and practice surrounding public diplomacy has received increased attention recently. Though not always labelled as such, public diplomacy efforts have gradually been stepped up by national foreign ministries and the EU institutions. Against the backdrop of this renaissance for consular affairs and public diplomacy, the current study examines EU action in the field of {{consular crisis}} management cooperation as a means of EU public diplomacy, potentially affecting the alleged (internal) lack of support for the project of an ever closed Union among the EU citizens, as well as serving the EU’s public diplomacy purposes vis-à-vis foreign audiences. On the basis of legal provisions, budget allocations and proven action thus far in the field of public diplomacy efforts related to EU consular crisis management cooperation, a number of conclusions are suggested: According to existing legal provisions, there is considerable scope for EU efforts in this field. Though it could potentially later be challenged by Member States and/or other EU institutions, the so-called institutional prerogative – which is often used as the legal basis for budgetary commitments in the field of information and communications by the European Commission – could be applied also to EU public diplomacy efforts in this area, i. e. (increasingly) funded through the Community budget. Though the enabling legal conditions are in place, and a number of budget lines exist {{that could be used to}} this end, to date a very limited number of initiatives have been realised. Looking at existing data regarding public opinion and EU <b>consular</b> <b>cooperation,</b> it seems that EU citizens (though to a varying degree, depending on the EU Member State and other demographical variations) would welcome an increased role for the EU in the area. Regarding public diplomacy, recent developments cannot be confined to the EU alone, but tend to be part of a broader trend which can be labelled the “societization” of traditional diplomacy, characterised by closer links between diplomacy and society. In terms of the limits of EU consular crisis management cooperation as a means of EU public diplomacy, constraints include the issue of responsibility, the distribution of credit and blame, national sensitivities, and differences in Member States’ resources and representation. Finally, arguing that the potential for European efforts in the field of consular crisis management as a tool of effective EU public diplomacy (both within the Union and outside) is great, it is surprising that not more attention is given to the area – especially in light of the Commission’s discourse on delivering tangible benefits to the EU’s citizens. To move from action as a mere response to exogenous factors to a situation where it is part of an EU policy of deliberate public diplomacy, the Union still has a long way to go...|$|E
