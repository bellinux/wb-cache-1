5|$|The South financed a {{much lower}} {{proportion}} of its expenditures through direct taxes than the North. The share of direct taxes in total revenue for the North was about 20%, while for the South the same share was only about 8%. A {{major part of the}} reason why tax revenue did not play as large a role for the Confederacy was the individual states' opposition to a strong central government and the belief in states' rights which precluded giving too much taxing power to the government in Richmond. Another factor for not extending the tax system more broadly was the belief, present in both the North and the South, that the war would be of limited duration, and hence there was no <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> increase the tax burden.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{qualifications}} {{required of}} presidential candidates resulted in walkovers during {{the elections of}} 1999, 2005 and 2017. The incumbent President Ong Teng Cheong did not run {{for a second term}} at the 1999 presidential election, saying that he had no <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> do so. In addition to the eventual winner, Sellapan Ramanathan (better known as S. R. Nathan), the other potential candidates were Tan Soo Phuan, a member of the opposition Workers' Party of Singapore; and Ooi Boon Ewe, a private tutor turned real estate executive. Both of them were found not to have met the criteria to stand for election. As a result, Nathan, a former civil servant and Ambassador to the United States, was deemed to have been elected President. At the presidential election of 2005, the persons who applied for a certificate of eligibility to contest the election were Nathan, Ooi and Ramachandran Govindasamy Naidu. However, as Nathan was again the only candidate issued with a certificate, he was elected by default on nomination day.|$|E

25|$|At first, their nonchalance proved justified: Toungoo's annual dry-season raids of Lower Burma (1534–37) all failed while Pegu {{could not}} {{organize}} a counterattack against either Toungoo or Martaban. Closer to the battleground, however, King Narapati of Prome was increasingly concerned by Toungoo's deeper and longer raids with each successive campaign, {{and raised the}} alarm with Ava. In 1538, Prome, presumably with Ava's permission, entered into an alliance with Takayutpi. Though he had now taken sides, Thohanbwa still did not see a <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> commit his troops, or ask his Confederation allies for additional troops.

25|$|Starting {{from the}} {{argument}} that a historical universal scientific method does not exist, Feyerabend argues that science does not deserve its privileged status in western society.

Feyerabend also argued that scientific accomplishments such as the moon landings are no <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> give science a special status. In his opinion, it is not fair to use scientific assumptions about which problems are worth solving in order to judge the merit of other ideologies. Additionally, success by scientists has traditionally involved non-scientific elements, such as inspiration from mythical or religious sources.|$|E

This paper examines the value of using human behaviour as a target for system behaviour through a study making use of a simulation method.

The version based on human behaviour is rated more human-like, polite and intelligent. ...|$|R

Hawryliw {{had been}} The X-Files {{property}} master from 1993 to 1998 while {{the show was}} filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Over the years, he had written several scripts but had never submitted them to The X-Files writing staff. Eventually, {{he moved on to}} work on Millennium, where he developed a friendship with Guttridge. Guttridge showed Hawryliw a script he had been writing that he wanted to submit for The X-Files. Although the story was not written like an X-Files script, Hawryliw enjoyed the premise. The two decided to form a partnership: Guttridge would craft the basic story and script and Hawryliw would help to craft it into an X-Files script. Hawryliw later explained that the idea to make Pinker search out his son: [...] "There's this unique man who can walk through walls. Now, who would this ability best apply to? Well, a convict obviously—a guy in prison. But then we had to give him an even stronger, more <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> want his freedom, and that was where his son came from".|$|E

[...] Yehl also praised the art, saying it looked [...] "impressively good" [...] despite the fact that there were four artists on the book. Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the first issue 2 stars out of 5, saying that the story is a [...] "protracted version of what readers have already learned in Phantom Stranger and elsewhere" [...] and criticizing the fact that Pandora's origin greatly differed from that of her Greek counterpart and the story had little to do with the [...] "Trinity War". Like Yehl, Johnson also praised the fluidity of the art from Zircher, Cannon, Sampere and Cifuentes. Newsarama's Aaron Duran gave the title a 5 out of 10, saying the comic is simply okay and would have worked better as a shorter installment within other books or as bonus digital content.|$|E

Harries opposed the idea, believing that the {{audience}} would want a happy ending for the characters. However, he allowed the writer and producer to proceed with their idea. Langan and Episode 6 director Nigel Cole wanted Adam to leave after finding out about Rachel's pregnancy. She would have followed him and proven her love to him by singing to him over the PA system of the train—similar to the pilot's conclusion. Bullen thought that this idea was [...] "atrocious", so spent the Easter weekend drafting an end to the series. The genesis of Rachel becoming pregnant, possibly by Kris, came during the filming of the second episode. Langan suggested to Bullen that they return to Rachel's marriage later in the series, using an adage she had learned from working on a soap opera that if the [...] "seeds" [...] of a storyline are sown early on it can pay off later. The Brief Encounter homage was conceived close to filming. Bullen had not seen the film so had to rent it on video before writing the scene.|$|E
