50|$|A key {{aspect of}} the {{philosophy}} of wheel and tire cleaning {{is the use of}} high volume water flow at low pressure. The high volume flow of water flow serves to clean the tires and effectively remove the wash sludge slurry from the wash platform into the recycling and solids <b>collection</b> <b>tanks.</b> Mist and overspray from high pressure systems would not be an effective method of cleaning and removing the wash sludge into the recycling and solids <b>collections</b> <b>tanks.</b> Other disadvantages of high pressure cleaning are wasted water, energy and obstruction of driver visibility.|$|R

In this article, we reported {{the discovery of the}} first primitive robotic applications as automatic machines for the sensitive calculation of liquids such as blood in the literature. Al-Jazari who wrote the book “Elcâmi ‘Beyne’l - ‘ilm ve’l - ‘amel en-nâfi ‘fi es-sınaâ ‘ti’l - hiyel”, lived in Anatolian territory between 1136 and 1206. In this book that was written in the twelfth century, Al-Jazari described nearly fifty graphics of robotic machines and six of them that were designed for medical purposes. We found that some of the robots mentioned in this book are related to medical applications. This book reviews approximately 50 devices, including water clocks, candle clocks, ewers, various automata used for amusement in drink assemblies, automata used for ablution, blood <b>collection</b> <b>tanks,</b> fountains, music devices, devices for water lifting, locks, a protractor, a boat-shaped water clock, and the gate of Diyarbakir City in south-east of Turkey, actually in northern Mesopotamia.

50|$|Just as in {{a normal}} dryer, {{condenser}} or condensation dryers pass heated air through the load. However, instead of exhausting this air, the dryer uses a heat exchanger to cool the air and condense the water vapor into either a drain pipe or a <b>collection</b> <b>tank.</b> The dryer air is run through the loop again. The heat exchanger typically uses ambient air as its coolant, therefore the heat produced by the dryer will go into the immediate surroundings instead of the outside, increasing the room temperature. In some designs, cold water {{is used in the}} heat exchanger, eliminating this heating, but requiring increased water usage.|$|E

50|$|The pyramid stands about 26 feet (8 meters) tall, 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter, {{and has a}} conical shape. It is {{constructed}} of plastic sheeting, which is inflated using a fan powered by solar energy generated by the pyramid.

Distilled water runs {{down the sides of}} the pyramid wall and is collected by gutters that feed into a <b>collection</b> <b>tank.</b> When sunshine is replaced by rain, the falling water is also collected {{around the edge of the}} base of the cone and stored for use in dry weather. Each pyramid can desalinate approximately 265 gallons (1000 liters) of water each day. To increase water production, a village simply adds additional pyramids.|$|E

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This {{feasibility}} study report presents a draft {{design of the}} Vitrified Waste Interim Storage Facility (VWISF), {{which is one of}} three subprojects of the Idaho Waste Vitrification Facilities (IWVF) project. The primary goal of the IWVF project is to design and construct a treatment process system that will vitrify the sodium-bearing waste (SBW) to a final waste form. The project will consist of three subprojects that include the Waste <b>Collection</b> <b>Tanks</b> Facility, the Waste Vitrification Facility (WVF), and the VWISF. The Waste <b>Collection</b> <b>Tanks</b> Facility will provide for waste collection, feed mixing, and surge storage for SBW and newly generated liquid waste from ongoing operations at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center. The WVF will contain the vitrification process that will mix the waste with glass-forming chemicals or frit and turn the waste into glass. The VWISF will provide a shielded storage facility for the glass until the waste can be disposed at either the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant as mixed transuranic waste or at the future national geological repository as high-level waste glass, pending the outcome of a Waste Incidental to Reprocessing determination, which is currently in progress. A secondary goal is to provide a facility that can be easily modified later to accommodate storage of the vitrified high-level waste calcine...|$|R
