40|$|Route falsification {{attacks are}} easy to launch in mobile ad hoc {{networks}} with on demand routing protocols that employ network-wide flooding of control packets for route discoveries. To mitigate this attack, we propose a p-hop <b>crosscheck</b> mechanism that requires nodes p, p ≥ 2, hops apart to authenticate and verify route reply packets using pair-wise shared keys. The <b>crosscheck</b> can detect route falsification by non-colluding malicious nodes on-thefly; furthermore, it can identify a group of at most p + 1 nodes that contain the malicious nodes that caused the route falsification. Unlike intrusion detection techniques, which require extensive monitoring and sampling, the proposed <b>crosscheck</b> mechanism is light-weight and fast. Therefore, the proposed <b>crosscheck</b> mechanism {{can be used to}} augment the existing secure routing protocols and improve intrusion detection capability. We implemented 2 -hop <b>crosscheck</b> for AODV in the Glomosim simulator. Using simulations, we show that 2 -hop <b>crosscheck</b> mitigates attacks by multiple malicious nodes with negligible performance impact...|$|R

5000|$|The {{peace is}} {{explained}} thus: [...] "Start {{with the answer}} of the philosopher Immanuel Kant to why universalizing republics (democracy was a bad word for Classical Liberals in his time) would create a peaceful world. People would not support and vote for wars in which they {{and their loved ones}} could die and lose their property. But this is only partly correct, for the people can get aroused against nondemocracies and push their leaders toward war, as in the Spanish-American War. A deeper explanation is that where people are free, they create an exchange society of overlapping groups and multiple and <b>crosschecking</b> centers of power. In such a society a culture of negotiation, tolerance, and splitting differences develops. Moreover, free people develop an in-group orientation toward other such societies, a feeling of shared norms and ideals that militates against violence toward other free societies" ...|$|E

The guidelines under the Central and the state enactments, call for a sketch of the mining area when a mining lease is applied for. It was found by the Lokayukta that sometimes the actual mining areas {{are not related to}} the sketch given with the applications without officials <b>crosschecking</b> them. Further mining applicants falsely claim a prohibited forest area as a revenue area. Finally the actual area of the mine is much bigger than the claimed area.The Indian Bureau of Mines rules which control the type of mining, allow a maximum mining depth six metres to prevent environmental degradation. But miners have flouted this rule to over-extract iron-ore. For example, if they are allowed to take 100 metric tones, mines take 1,000 metric tonnes. Officials at road check posts reportedly collude in a massive under-counting of lorries and trucks transporting the iron-ore from the Bellary mines to the ports. News reports suggest that only 200 trucks are reported as against 4000 plying everyday.|$|E
50|$|With Ramon H. Myers, {{a senior}} fellow and curator of the East Asian Collection at the Stanford University’s Hoover Institution Library, Chang edited and {{compiled}} The Storm Clouds Clear over China: The Memoir of Ch’en Li-fu, 1900-1993, published by Hoover Institution Press in 1994. The editors condensed Timothy Tung’s English translation of the original eleven-hundred-page handwritten Chinese manuscript to seven hundred pages, <b>crosschecking</b> the original Chinese writing of Ch’en against Tung’s translation. They set with Chen Lifu for ten interviews, averaging {{two to three hours}} each. Answers related to various episodes added two hundred pages of transcriptions to the original. All the information from interviews plus follow-up correspondence with the author was integrated into the final product. The editors verified the facts and events recorded in the memoir through such sources as U.S. Military Reports: China 1911-1941, U.S. State Department Confidential Central Files: China Internal Affairs 1945-1949, and other publications of the State Department, notably U.S. Foreign Relations, 1927-1951. Ch’en Li-fu was of paramount importance in the Kuomintang throughout most of its existence. This was the first memoir in English about modern Chinese Nationalist politics. The information that it provided about a variety of questions, until the time of its publication quite concealed (Chiang Kai-shek’s negotiations with the USSR, the organization of the Chinese secret services, the information about the Second United Front), was totally original.|$|E

We have applied our dynamic specification checking technology <b>CrossCheck</b> to the CUTS [2, 3] model simulation framework as a way of verifying properties of interest in a model. <b>CrossCheck</b> [1] utilizes a specialized language to express specifications, which are properties about the behavior of the system under check. <b>CrossCheck</b> specifications are compiled to generate a very efficient checking runtime...|$|R

This work explores the use of <b>CrossCheck</b> as a tool to prevent and provide protection against plagiarism in the JEET. Since 2011, the JEET has been using <b>CrossCheck</b> and has adopted implicit and latent review guidelines internally. In this study, we investigate the function of <b>CrossCheck</b> by considering two types of similarity levels for published and rejected articles, namely, integrated similarity index (ISI) and maximum similarity index (MSI). The Minitab tool is used for statistical analysis. The JEET employs a blind <b>CrossCheck</b> system, in which ISI and MSI information is supplied only to the associate editor and not to the reviewers. Positive results are obtained even under the blind <b>CrossCheck</b> system. An exception is the group of “red” articles with ISI and MSI scores of above 50 %. The ISI and MSI information of such red articles is supplied to the editors and reviewers of the JEET. The results of this work could serve as a reference for establishing a guideline or criterion for rejecting suspicious plagiarized articles during the review process...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{influence}} of maneuver design for stability derivatives of aerodynamic forces and moments identification {{in the performance of}} closed loop control systems is evaluated, where two maneuvers largely used in aeronautical industry - doublet and 3211 - are compared to a maneuver of restricted use in aeronautical industry, but already well known in identification - the PRBS. This evaluation is divided in two steps: in the first, it is performed the identification with each of the maneuvers and then a <b>crosschecking</b> of the obtained models, computing the mean quadratic prediction error; in the second, the identified models are analytically linearized and use in a bank angle tracker. The calculated gains are then applied to the nonlinear model and the performance indices computed, as peak time and maximum overshoot, of step response with each gain set. The <b>crosschecking</b> showed the superior capacity of PRBS maneuver to capture the dynamics of the reference model, where the prediction error was relatively small for all models when compared to the response to doublet. With the 3211 data set, the error of the model identified with doublet was significantly larger than 3211 and PRBS models error, that had similar performance, however lightly better for the PRBS. With the PRBS data set, the PRBS error was relatively small, while the doublet and 3211 models error was relatively large. This result shows the direct relation of the maneuvers frequency spectra and the excitation persistence characteristic in the identified models. With an exigent performance requirement to the bank angle tracker, it was possible to expose the differences between the models and verify {{the influence of}} these differences in the closed loop response. In an equivalent form, as observed in the <b>crosschecking</b> analysis, the control system designed with the PRBS model showed performance indices closer to the target in comparison to the control system designed with the 3211 model, that was significatively better than the system designed with the doublet model. The closed loop amplified the difference between the models, and depending on the control system structure, these differences can be still larger. Finally, a practical application on aircraft identification and control is presented and discussed...|$|E

Because dependency reification can become intractable, we aim to enforce the isolation of the old and new versions during the upgrade.
