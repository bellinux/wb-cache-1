5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version of it, but had gone in a {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they thought would be powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; when {{it turned out to}} not be, they had started investigating replacing the computer hardware with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap enough for an arcade game would not be powerful enough to run enough games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were <b>curious</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that they had not solved that problem yet.|$|E

As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly <b>curious</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that {{would be useful to}} him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.|$|E

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Island {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", Michael was {{supposed}} to return in the season three finale, but Perrineau was filming the pilot of Demons, so was unable to return. Instead he returned in the seventh episode of season four, [...] "Ji Yeon". His return {{was meant to be}} announced during Losts slot at the 2007 Comic-Con International, however there were complaints at the Television Critics Association Press Tour when ABC's President of Entertainment Stephen McPherson commented that [...] "some big announcements" [...] would be made at the Lost panel. Some journalists felt that any announcements should be made to them at the press meeting, rather than at a fan convention. After numerous reporters asked about what would be announced, Lost producer Damon Lindelof was contacted, and he gave permission for McPherson to say Harold Perrineau would be returning to Lost. At Comic-Con, Lindelof confirmed Perrineau would be back as a cast member, not just for a flashback. Lost producer Carlton Cuse said [...] "Michael's story is for us one of the most becoming storylines on the show because here's a character who ... undertook some very extreme actions in order to basically get his son off the Island, and then when he sailed off in that boat I think everyone was very <b>curious</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happened to him, what is his fate ... we really feel that Michael's story will be a really compelling part of the season." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed, and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are all these questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] Cuse responded [...] "We pride ourselves on having a very racially diverse cast. It's painful when any actor's storyline ends on the show. Harold is a fantastic actor whose presence added enormously to Lost". Perrineau later said he should have thought before making a racial comment, and although he felt like that, he never discussed the matter with the producers. Perrineau said that although he would be happy to return to Lost, he would have to know what the storyline would be.|$|E
2500|$|Wanrong wore a mask in {{accordance}} with Chinese tradition and Puyi, who knew nothing of women, remembered: [...] "I hardly thought about marriage and family. It was only when the Empress came into my field of vision with a crimson satin cloth embroidered with a dragon and a phoenix over her head that I felt at all <b>curious</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> she looked like." [...] After the wedding was complete, Puyi, Wanrong, and his secondary consort Wenxiu (whom he married the same night) went to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, where everything was red [...] the color of love and sex in China [...] and where emperors had traditionally consummated their marriages. Puyi, who was sexually inexperienced and timid, fled from the bridal chamber, leaving his wives {{to sleep in the}} Dragon Bed by themselves. About Puyi's failure to consummate his marriage on his wedding night, Behr wrote:It was perhaps too much to expect an adolescent, permanently surrounded by eunuchs to show the sexual maturity of a normal seventeen year-old. Neither the Dowager consorts nor Johnston himself had given him any advice on sexual matters [...] this sort of thing simply was not done, where emperors were concerned: It would have been an appalling breach of protocol. But the fact remains that a totally inexperienced, over-sheltered adolescent, if normal, could hardly have failed to be aroused by Wan Jung's [...] unusual, sensual beauty. The inference is, of course, that Pu Yi was either impotent, extraordinarily immature sexually, or already aware of his homosexual tendencies.|$|E

Robin is also <b>curious</b> <b>about</b> <b>what's</b> {{underneath}} the coat and when Liddy goes to the bathroom, Barney bemoans the fact that Marshall isn't present.

After Robin and Liddy leave the bar, Ted expresses his concern that Robin will not be happy with Barney's behavior.

Barney finds Robin waiting for him wearing nothing but the coat, causing him to turn up the thermostat.|$|R

40|$|The boxing similes ‘dance like a butterfly, sting like a bee’, {{applied to}} {{educational}} situations, refer to informal, authentic ‘breakthrough’ moments of trustworthy leadership that occur {{every day in}} organisations at all hierarchical levels, taking people forward to achieve beneficial outcomes, despite barriers and tensions. Such moments of dazzling virtuoso leadership, sometimes humorous, sometimes poignant, always authentic, ‘dance’ to inspire others. They can also ‘sting’, speaking truth to power with harshly accurate critique at times when others are too frightened to speak. They occur spontaneously and the leaders enacting them may be anyone, though some hardy individuals tend be the authors of such moments more than others. This chapter analyses selected moments of authentic values-based leadership that emerged from data collected in 28 interviews, five surveys and five focus groups carried out with educational staff {{in a series of}} research studies in 2006 - 10 on trust and leadership in post-compulsory education. Rather than focus on individual ‘leaders’ or ‘followers’, on formal leadership development, organisational systems or management hierarchies, this chapter analyses selected instances of heutagogic leadership that emerged from the complex interplay of variant discourses interwoven during the research studies. An interpretative phenomenological research paradigm was followed, in which the researcher was <b>curious</b> <b>about</b> discovering <b>what</b> leadership meant to the participants, facilitating a debate regarding how leadership interacted (or not) with trust in the experiential world of educational staff, and what the problems were in organisational settings described by participants as ‘low trust’. The concept of ‘heutagogic’ leadership was developed to describe self-directed moments of authentic leadership that came to light spontaneously {{during the course of the}} research, when participants demonstrated that ‘everyone in the workplace should be their own leader’. The chapter recommends that the ‘heutagogic leadership’ model may prove useful in improving understandings about the development of trust in post-compulsory educational leadership...|$|R
