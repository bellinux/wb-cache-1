As they search, one thing is certain: proposed solutions must be based upon a sound business case. Transportation during the construction process has been identified as one area where the environmental impacts of construction may be reduced. Compressed natural gas is an alternative fuel {{that can be used in}} construction vehicles of all types, including <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> <b>trucks.</b> The question is: will switching from diesel fuel to compressed natural gas save money while providing increased value during the construction process?

40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} {{alternative methods}} for {{the processing of}} concrete waste.

The results obtained so far show that both techniques {{can be used to}} weaken concrete samples and to enhance aggregate selective liberation (that is the production of cement paste-free aggregates) during crushing and grinding. Electric pulses treatment seems to appear more efficient, more robust and less energy consuming (1 - 3 kW h t− 1) than microwave treatment (10 - 40 kW h t− 1) but it can only be applied on samples in water leading to a major drawback for recycling aggregates or cement paste in the cement production process...|$|R

40|$|European Conference on Human Centred Design for Intelligent Transport Systems, LOUGHBOROUGH, ROYAUME-UNI, 30 -/ 06 / 2016 - 01 / 07 / 2016 Speed {{is one of}} the {{essential}} information needed to perform correctly the primary driving task. While driving a truck, a misjudgement of speed can lead to rollover in a bend (particularly for <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> <b>trucks),</b> jackknifing at braking, or swinging out on slippery roads [1]. In addition to visual, auditory and vestibular cues, the speedometer on the dashboard provides a more accurate speed value to the driver. The design of the speedometer is critical for road safety because it generates a very high number of glances out of the road that could overlap a time-critical event. Two main types of speedometers are currently proposed in the truck industry: analogue and digital speedometers. In the human factors literature, some studies investigated the effects of both speedometers on human behaviour. Results are mostly equivocal but it seems that the more appropriate mean of presenting the speed information to the driver depends on the task performed. A digital speedometer would be more appropriate for an absolute reading of the speed value [2]-[5], and for a relative reading task (i. e. compare to a target speed) [2], [6]. An analogue speedometer would be better for reading a dynamic speed change [6]-[8]. Moreover, the existing literature does not allow concluding whether an analogue or digital format is better for truck speedometer design. First, most studies have been conducted on cars. Compared to car driving, truck's driver eye position is higher (thus, far from the dashboard) and the difference in vehicle speed variation (due to vehicle weight) could impact speed management and control. Second, existing studies have been obtained with conventional mechanical and physical supports. Advancements in display technologies (i. e. with liquid crystal display - LCD - screens as instrument cluster) make it interesting to update the results for a more contemporary vision. This study aimed at comparing an analogue and a digital speedometer in terms of usability and distraction in simulated truck's driving on a LCD screen. 18 trucks drivers were equipped with an eye-tracker and were required to drive on a driving simulator. Results showed that reading the value of the speed (i. e. absolute reading) was faster and less distracting, and the reported cognitive effort was lower with the digital speedometer. Similarly, the digital speedometer was more efficient for a relative reading task (i. e. say if the speed value was under or over 50 km/h). On the contrary, detecting if the speed was decreasing or increasing (i. e. dynamic change reading) was faster and less distracting with the analogue speedometer. Both speedometers were perceived as usable by drivers, but the global preference went to the digital speedometer. The existing results in the literature have therefore been replicated and extended to truck drivers on a LCD instrument cluster. Future researches can then rely on these results to investigate new speedometer representations that would be efficient for the three reading types...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} some of {{the results}} of an investigation on the possible applications of use of waste <b>concrete</b> aggregates from <b>mixer</b> <b>trucks</b> <b>concrete</b> productions (WCA) in concrete. The investigation has been carried out using factorial design for experimental design. For the study, the physical and mechanical properties along their durability of concrete produced with WCA were investigated and the results presented. Concrete mixtures were prepared using WCA as the replacement of natural fine aggregate at the level 10 %, 20 % and 30 wt. % with water/cement ratios of 0. 40, 0. 50 and 0. 60. Properties of fresh and hardened concrete were evaluated: fresh unit weight, consistency, 7 -day and 28 -day compressive strength were carried out in specimens. The necessary data for establishing a mix proportion design and a quality control method are obtained using a full factorial design 3 2. The influence of level of WCA on the mineralogical composition has been established, and its suitability for use in a concrete application has been assessed. Empirical contour plots for the physical-mechanical properties of fresh and hardened concrete with WCA were obtained via regression analysis, which predict that as the amount of waste increases, has no or little effect on the compressive strength of concrete mixes. The results form confirmation experiments justify the prediction from the statistical approach...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} a great concern about the {{environmental}} issues such as global warming. In the construction industry, traditional construction consumed huge amount of fuels and produce a large amount of carbon emissions that affect the environment. The aim {{of this study is to}} estimate the environmental impacts on global warming potential (GWP from fuel consumption during building construction activities by plants and machineries. The methodology that is used in this study is Midpoint Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). GaBi software has been used for the LCIA purposes. The findings revealed that there was a great impact from construction plants and machineries on GWP. Three types of machineries namely tower crane, lorry, and <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> <b>truck</b> have been analysed in this study. Thed <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> <b>truck</b> was found to be the highest contribution of global warming potential with the highest capacity of engine power. Results also shown that the global warming potential value for tower crane JT 170 -H 10 and Potain H 30 / 30 C were 2. 31 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq and 2. 37 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq respectively. Meanwhile GWP for for Nissan lorry, Isuzu lorry and ZZ 1257 M 3641 <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> <b>truck</b> were 2. 27 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq, 2. 24 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq and 2. 74 E 006 kg CO 2 Eq respectively. The total global warming potential for all of these machineries were estimated to be around 3. 7 E 006 kg CO 2 Eq. Consequently, the <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> <b>truck</b> were identified to contributed the highest carbon emissions because of the long usage duration and the engine power as well. Followed by the Potain H 30 / 30 C and JT 170 -H 10. Moreover, Nissan lorry and Isuzu lorry were found to be the lowest contribution of carbon emissions. It can be concluded that the construction activities should take more consideration on the fuel consumption in order to reduce the GWP. Modern and efficient plants and machineries could help to reduce the fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions...|$|E
