5000|$|Natural {{convection}} of {{the liquid}} starts when heat transfer to the liquid {{gives rise to a}} temperature difference {{from one side of the}} loop to the other. The phenomenon of thermal expansion means that a temperature difference will have a corresponding difference in density across the loop. The warmer fluid on one side of the loop is less dense and thus more buoyant than the <b>cooler</b> <b>fluid</b> on the other side. The warmer fluid will [...] "float" [...] above the <b>cooler</b> <b>fluid,</b> and the <b>cooler</b> <b>fluid</b> will [...] "sink" [...] below the warmer fluid. This phenomenon of natural convection is known by the saying: [...] "heat rises". Convection moves the heated liquid upwards in the system as it is simultaneously replaced by cooler liquid returning by gravity. A good thermosiphon has very little hydraulic resistance so that liquid can flow easily under the relatively low pressure produced by natural convection.|$|R

25|$|In {{simplest}} form, {{a condenser}} can {{consist of a}} single tube of glass or metal, where the flow of outside air produces the cooling. In a further simple form, condensers consist of concentric glass tubes, with the tube through which the hot gases begin to pass running {{the length of the}} apparatus. The second tube defines an outer chamber through which air, water, or other cooling fluids can pass to reduce the temperature of the gasses to afford the condensation; hence, the outer tube (or, as designs become more complex, outer cooling chamber) has an inlet and an outlet to allow the <b>cooling</b> <b>fluid</b> to enter and exit.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} with the classic CANDU design, experimental variants were being developed. WR-1, located at the AECL's Whiteshell Laboratories in Pinawa, Manitoba, used vertical pressure tubes and organic oil as the primary coolant. The oil used has a higher boiling point than water, allowing the reactor to operate at higher temperatures and lower pressures than a conventional reactor. WR-1's outlet temperature was about 490C compared to the CANDU 6's nominal 310C, which means less <b>cooling</b> <b>fluid</b> is needed to remove {{the same amount of}} heat, resulting in a smaller and less expensive core. The higher temperatures also result in more efficient conversion to steam, and ultimately, electricity. WR-1 operated successfully for many years, and promised a significantly higher efficiency than water-cooled versions.|$|E
2500|$|A {{condenser}} is {{an apparatus}} or {{item of equipment}} used to condense (change the physical state of a substance from its gaseous to its liquid state). In the laboratory, condensers are generally used in procedures involving organic liquids brought into the gaseous state through heating, with or without lowering the pressure (applying vacuum)—though applications in inorganic and other chemistry areas exist. While condensers can be applied at various scales, in the research, training, or discovery laboratory, one most often uses glassware designed to pass a vapor flow over an adjacent cooled chamber. In simplest form, such a condenser consists of a single glass tube with outside air providing cooling. A further simple form, the Liebig-type of condenser, involves concentric glass tubes, an inner one through which the hot gases pass, and an outer, [...] "ported" [...] chamber through which a <b>cooling</b> <b>fluid</b> passes, to reduce the gas temperature in the inner, to afford the condensation.|$|E

The shunt, which lies {{just below the}} skin, is cooled with an ice pack placed “upstream” of the sensor. If CSF is flowing through the shunt, the <b>cooled</b> <b>fluid</b> will move “downstream” and the ShuntCheck sensor will detect a drop in temperature. Faster shunt flow results in greater temperature decreases. If the shunt is not flowing, the <b>cooled</b> <b>fluid</b> remains upstream and no temperature drop is recorded.|$|R

2500|$|The {{combination}} of these has taken the simple condenser concept through simple changes (e.g., addition, in Allihn-type condensers, of [...] "bubbles" [...] or undulations to the inner, straight vapor tube of the simple Liebig design, so that diethyl ether (b.p., ca. 35°C), could be accommodated), on to many unique condenser configurations, types of [...] "packings" [...] of the vapor space, and applied cooling media and mechanisms (see below). In this array of designs, the direction of vapor and condensate flows depends on the specific application (e.g., being countercurrent in reflux procedures, and concurrent in many simpler distillation procedures); {{the same is true}} with regard to the optimal flow direction for the <b>cooling</b> <b>fluid</b> (air, water, aqueous ethylene glycol co-solutions, etc.) relative to the direction of vapor flow. Note, while the traditional coolants, air and chilled tap water, have often been used without recirculation (i.e., allowed to exit to atmosphere or drain, respectively), larger scale operations and municipal and other regulations make engineered recirculation necessary, and it is always required for special cooling liquids, such as low temperature alcohols and co-solutions.|$|E
2500|$|Likewise, the {{configurations}} of laboratory apparatus involving condensers are many and varied, to cover {{low and high}} boiling solvents, simple and complex separations, etc. Several common process types based on the change of physical state provided by condensers can easily be described, including simple evaporations or [...] "solvent stripping" [...] (the bulk removal of all volatiles to leave behind concentrated solutes present in the original solution being evaporated), reflux operations (where {{the aim is to}} contain all volatiles while providing a constant process temperature established by the boiling point of the solvent system being used), and separation/distillation operations (where high theoretical plates provide for selective delivery of one or more volatile components of a complex [...] "mixture" [...] in a controlled fashion). The direction of vapor and condensate flows in the laboratory condenser chosen for each of these may vary (e.g., being countercurrent in reflux procedures, and concurrent in many simple distillation procedures), as do the optimal flow direction for the <b>cooling</b> <b>fluid,</b> etc. In all processes, condenser selection/design requires that the heat of entering vapor never overwhelm the condenser and cooling mechanism; as well, the thermal gradients and material flows established during the gas-liquid transition are critical aspects, so that as processes increase in scale from laboratory to pilot plant and beyond, the design of condenser systems becomes a precise engineering science.|$|E
50|$|The {{compression}} assembly system aims {{to decrease}} the thermal contact resistance between the thermoelectric module and the heat exchanger surfaces.

30|$|Viscosity, like thermal conductivity, {{influences}} the heat transfer behaviour of <b>cooling</b> <b>fluids.</b> Nanofluids are preferred as <b>cooling</b> <b>fluids</b> {{because of their}} improved heat removal capabilities. Since most of the cooling methods used involve forced circulation of the coolant, modification of properties of fluids which can result in an increased pumping power requirement could be critical. Hence, viscosity of the nanofluid, which {{influences the}} pumping power requirements in circulating loops, requires a close examination. Investigations [3, 4, 15 – 22] {{reported in the literature}} have shown that the viscosity of base fluids increases with the addition of nanoparticles.|$|R

50|$|The {{maximum amount}} of heat or mass {{transfer}} that can be obtained is higher with countercurrent than co-current (parallel) exchange because countercurrent maintains a slowly declining difference or gradient (usually temperature or concentration difference). In cocurrent exchange the initial gradient is higher but falls off quickly, leading to wasted potential. For example, in the diagram at the right, the fluid being heated (exiting top) has a higher exiting temperature than the <b>cooled</b> <b>fluid</b> (exiting bottom) that was used for heating. With cocurrent or parallel exchange the heated and <b>cooled</b> <b>fluids</b> can only approach one another. The result is that countercurrent exchange can achieve a greater amount of heat or mass transfer than parallel under otherwise similar conditions. See: flow arrangement.|$|R

During film boiling a volume of insulating vapor separates the heated surface from the cooling fluid; this causes the temperature of the heated surface to increase drastically to once again reach equilibrium heat transfer with the <b>cooling</b> <b>fluid.</b> In other words, steam semi-insulates the heated surface and surface temperature rises to allow heat to get to the <b>cooling</b> <b>fluid</b> (through convection and radiative heat transfer).|$|E

50|$|Natural {{convection}} is a mechanism, or type of heat transport, {{in which}} the fluid motion is not generated by any external source (like a pump, fan, suction device, etc.) but only by density differences in the fluid occurring due to temperature gradients. In natural convection, fluid surrounding a heat source receives heat, becomes less dense and rises. The surrounding, <b>cooler</b> <b>fluid</b> then moves to replace it. This <b>cooler</b> <b>fluid</b> is then heated and the process continues, forming a convection current; this process transfers heat energy {{from the bottom of}} the convection cell to top. The driving force for natural convection is buoyancy, a result of differences in fluid density. Because of this, the presence of a proper acceleration such as arises from resistance to gravity, or an equivalent force (arising from acceleration, centrifugal force or Coriolis effect), is essential for natural convection. For example, natural convection essentially does not operate in free-fall (inertial) environments, such as that of the orbiting International Space Station, where other heat transfer mechanisms are required to prevent electronic components from overheating.|$|R
