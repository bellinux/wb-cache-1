50|$|From {{the edge}} of the Harz to 700 m above sea level beech woods dominate, {{especially}} the wood-rush beech woods on locations poorly supplied with nutrients where the <b>common</b> <b>beech</b> (Fagus sylvatica) is often the only tree species. In lower, drier locations the English oak (Quercus robur) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea) occur as well. Sycamore trees (Acer pseudoplatanus) may be found growing in wetter places. During times of decay and rejuvenation when there is plenty of light, light-dependent pioneers such as rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), silver birch (Betula pendula) and pussy willow (Salix caprea) play a role. Melic grass beech woods are found in the few places where there is an abundance of nutrients and bases, e. g. over dolerite and gneiss formations, and they have a vegetation layer rich in variety and luxuriant growth. Here, too, the <b>common</b> <b>beech</b> dominates, mixed, for example, with sycamore, ash (Fraxinus excelsior), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and Scots elm (Ulmus glabra).

The use of oak forests (Has Dushkajën) and natural resources, for simple economic necessity, as the easiest way without spending led to significant damage. Nature and its beauty underwent significant changes, that created a distinct separation barrier between nature and the neighboring states. This destruction of nature deepened in the early 90s, where cruelty and exploitation of natural resources for economic purposes (outside state control) was associated with reductions of extinction of biological potentials, as well as a considerable number of ecosystems.|$|R

50|$|The <b>common</b> European <b>beech</b> (Fagus sylvatica) grows {{naturally}} in Denmark and southern Norway and Sweden {{up to about}} the 57th - 59th northern latitude.

Near the city of Larvik is the largest naturally occurring beech forest in Norway. Planted beeches are grown much farther north along the Norwegian coast. There is some research suggesting that early agriculture patterns supported the spread of beech in continental Europe. Research has linked the establishment of beech stands in Scandinavia and Germany with cultivation and fire disturbance, i.e. early agricultural practices. Other areas which {{have a long history of}} cultivation, Bulgaria for example, do not exhibit this pattern, so it is as yet unclear how much human activity has influenced the spread of beech trees.|$|R
6000|$|These facts, {{it might}} have been thought, would have been {{sufficient}} to render it probable that a pendulous habit would in all cases be strictly inherited. But let us look to the other side. Mr. MacNab (12/42. Verlot op. cit. page 93.) sowed seeds of the weeping beech (Fagus sylvatica), but succeeded in raising only <b>common</b> <b>beeches.</b> Mr. Rivers, at my request, raised a number of seedlings from three distinct varieties of weeping elm; and {{at least one of the}} parent-trees was so situated that it could not have been crossed by any other elm; but none of the young trees, now about a foot or two in height, show the least signs of weeping. Mr. Rivers formerly sowed above twenty thousand seeds of the weeping ash (Fraxinus excelsior), and not a single seedling was in the least degree pendulous: in Germany, M. Borchmeyer raised a thousand seedlings, with the same result. Nevertheless, Mr. Anderson, of the Chelsea Botanic Garden, by sowing seed from a weeping ash, which was found before the year 1780, in Cambridgeshire, raised several pendulous trees. (12/43. For these several statements see Loudon's 'Gard. Magazine' volume 10 1834 pages 408, 180; and volume 9 1833 page 597.) Professor Henslow also informs me that some seedlings from a female weeping ash in the Botanic Garden at Cambridge were at first a little pendulous, but afterwards became quite upright: it is probable that this latter tree, which transmits to a certain extent its pendulous habit, was derived by a bud from the same original Cambridgeshire stock; whilst other weeping ashes may have had a distinct origin. But the crowning case, communicated to me by Mr. Rivers, which shows how capricious is the inheritance of a pendulous habit, is that a variety of another species of ash (F. lentiscifolia), now about twenty years old, which was formerly pendulous, [...] "has long lost this habit, every shoot being remarkably erect; but seedlings formerly raised from it were perfectly prostrate, the stems not rising more than two inches above the ground." [...] Thus the weeping variety of the common ash, which has been extensively propagated by buds during a long period, did not with Mr. Rivers, transmit its character to one seedling out of above twenty thousand; whereas the weeping variety of a second species of ash, which could not, whilst grown in the same garden, retain its own weeping character, transmitted to its character the pendulous habit in excess! ...|$|R
