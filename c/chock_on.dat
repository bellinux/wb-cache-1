40|$|Abstract: In recent years, {{the world}} economy faced several {{economic}} and financial crisis due to the financial globalization {{and the introduction of}} new financial product. The downturn of the US real estate crisis and the transmission of US financial crisis to the whole international financial systems were considered as the most serious events that economists haven’t anticipated. In order, to avoid the impacts of such crisis many economists suggest the construction of computable general equilibrium models (CGEM) which is a conceptual framework for macroeconomic analysis based on a neoclassical microeconomic foundation. It enables us to expect the impact of economic and financial <b>chocks</b> <b>on</b> the whole economy. This model is based essentially on data provided by the Social Accounting Matrix.

The remaining forecastle guns and the outer port gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns.

40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of optimum chock (support) capacity is very crucial {{for a successful}} longwall mining. The {{selection of}} <b>chock</b> capacity depends <b>on</b> the site-specific geotechnical parameters, constraints and longwall panel geometry, which are generally not known in detail in priority. Hence, based {{on the field and}} laboratory data, various possible combinations should be analyzed to cater for the unforeseeable mining conditions. This paper discusses the use of numerical model for selecting an appropriate <b>chock</b> capacity based <b>on</b> the site-specific geological and geotechnical information and longwall panel geometry. The fracture mechanisms of immediate and main roofs are also discussed for various panel widths and support capacities. For the models considered, the chock convergence is predicted to increase by about 33 % due to the increase in face width from 100 to 260 m. Similarly, the massive roof strata are found to yield higher chock convergence compared to bedded strata...|$|R

40|$|Uranium {{enrichment}} {{operations at}} the three US gaseous diffusion plants produce depleted uranium hexafluoride (DUF{sub 6 }) as a residential product. At the present time, the inventory of DUF{sub 6 } {{in this country is}} {{more than half a million}} tons. The inventory of DUF{sub 6 } is contained in metal storage cylinders, most of which are located at the gaseous diffusion plants. The principal objective of the project is to ensure the integrity of the cylinders to prevent causing an environmental hazard by releasing the contents of the cylinders into the atmosphere. Another objective is to maintain the cylinders in such a manner that the DUF{sub 6 } may eventually be converted to a less hazardous material for final disposition. An important task in the DUF{sub 6 } cylinders management project is determining how much corrosion of the walls can be tolerated before the cylinders are in danger of being damaged during routine handling and shipping operations. Another task is determining how to handle cylinders that have already been damaged in a manner that will minimize the chance that a breach will occur or that the size of an existing breach will be significantly increased. A number of finite element stress analysis (FESA) calculations have been done to analyze the stresses for three conditions: (1) while the cylinder is being lifted, (2) when a cylinder is resting on two cylinders under it in the customary two-tier stacking array, and (3) when a cylinder is resting <b>on</b> tis <b>chocks</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Various documents describe some of the results and discuss some of the methods whereby they have been obtained.

40|$|Dust {{generation}} from longwall chock {{movement and}} the Beam Stage Loader/crusher (BSL) is {{a major source of}} air contamination on modern longwall faces. If not controlled effectively, much of these respirable dust particles would disperse quickly into the longwall due to high face ventilation velocities, contributing significantly to higher dust levels. A new water mist based venturi system has been developed for the purpose of suppressing respirable dust from longwall chock movements close to the maingate (MG). The unit is powered by compressed air and water using an ultrasonic nozzle embedded in a venturi body. The ultrasonic nozzle is capable of producing ultra fine water mist with droplet sizes ranging from 1 to 100 μm. Laboratory tests indicate that the ultrasonic nozzle (MAL- 1300 -B), when combined with a 70 mm (diameter) x 143 mm (length) venturi body, was can produce an optimum spray covering a distance over 10 m. Further tests show that a combination of air supply at 6 bar and water at 4 bar produces the optimum water mist thrust with inducted air velocity over 8 m/s. The venturi system was built as a stand alone unit using fire resistant and antistatic materials and can be easily hooked under the chock canopy with a magnetic base. The system can be powered by compressed air and water supplied to the longwall face and adjusted with the spray angle to achieve the droplet size and velocity needed for dust suppression and diversion. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling was undertaken {{to gain a better understanding}} of face ventilation and dust flow patterns to optimise the spray orientation of the venturi system for field trial installation. CFD modelling results show that the operating conditions of sprays with the best mitigation performance vary according to the source of dust, a better dust mitigation effect can be achieved when the venturi units <b>on</b> longwall <b>chock</b> are installed at 20 o down towards the floor and tilted 45 o along the face. Field trials were conducted at two underground longwall mines in QLD and NSW. Three venturi units were installed <b>on</b> <b>Chock</b> No 6 <b>on</b> the longwall with an additional unit trialled at the BSL to mitigate dust from longwall outbye.

Lynams Blue Dragon was a small clinker built yawl of his own design, as was Robinetta http://robinetta-log.blogspot.com/p/robinetta.html, built on the Mersey, from where he sailed her to the Firth of Clyde.

Between 1937 and 1938 Rayner completed two short cruises in Robinetta, sometimes with his wife - [...] "E" [...] - and sometimes with RNVR comrades, Dick Taudevin and W.H.

The aim of this research is to test if monitoring of the gas-oil contact by a seismic acquisition inside the horizontal well is feasible. This could be done much cheaper, more often and with better repeatability than classical 4 D seismic.

40|$|In {{hindsight}} one {{can often}} learn {{a valuable lesson}} or two. Looking back at the financial crisis of 2008, perhaps more than two lessons can be learned. The grave <b>chock</b> that occurred <b>on</b> the financial markets {{at the end of}} 2008 left the whole world questioning what had caused it. Theories that had previously been accepted as general truth were subjected to critique in the light post-crisis. The Capital Asset Pricing Theory or CAPM is one of these theories. It seeks to explain the relation between risk and returns. There are many studies critiquing CAPM that have been published after the crisis. Most studies that we found (post- and pre-crisis) are conducted based on portfolios and not individual stocks. Also we could not find a single study that compared if CAPM performed differently on stocks between different sectors. Based on our ontological and epistemological approaches of positivism and objectivism, we chose a deductive research approach and performed a quantitative data collection. This study was conducted on the Large Cap index listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange (SSE). We chose 12 companies from the Financials sector and 12 companies from the Industrials sector, in total 24 companies. The period which we tested, were the years 2005 - 2012, 8 years in total. Comparison was made between the two sectors and between two different periods. The periods were Period 1 2005 - 2008 (pre-crisis) and 2009 - 2012 (post-crisis) We found that the original CAPM model, Sharpe-Lintner, did not explain the assumed relation between risk and return in the model, with Beta as the only risk-factor. In the second period (post crisis) CAPM did not have a single regression that showed that there was a relation between risk (Beta) and return (excess return). Pre crisis the majority (88 %) of the regressions to test CAPM showed that there was no relation between the variables (risk and return). The Industrial sector had more positive correlations coefficients than the financial sector, but they were still to few to support the models postulated risk-return relationship. ...|$|R
