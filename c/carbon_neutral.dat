The analysis of the graphite plume optical emission indicates the existence of two different ablation regimes, with the emission of large graphite fragments at low fluences and carbon radicals and atoms at larger fluences, in agreement with the theoretical description of ultra-fast ablation of graphite...|$|R

In contrast, the feedstocks for polymers derived from petrochemicals will eventually deplete. In addition, biopolymers {{have the potential to}} cut carbon emissions and reduce CO2 quantities in the atmosphere: this is because the CO2 released when they degrade can be reabsorbed by crops grown to replace them: this makes them close to <b>carbon</b> <b>neutral.</b>|$|E

The spatial and velocity distribution of CI and CO are often very similar.

40|$|JET has {{performed}} two dedicated carbon migration experiments {{on the final}} run day of separate campaigns (2001 and 2004) using (CH 4) -C- 13 methane injected into repeated discharges. The EDGE 2 D/NIMBUS code modelled the carbon migration in both experiments. This paper describes this modelling and identifies {{a number of important}} migration pathways: (1) deposition and erosion near the injection location, (2) migration through the main chamber SOL, (3) migration through the private flux region (PFR) aided by E x B drifts and (4) neutral migration originating near the strike points. In H-Mode, type I ELMs are calculated to influence the migration by enhancing erosion during the ELM peak and increasing the long-range migration immediately following the ELM. The erosion/re-deposition cycle along the outer target leads to a multistep migration of C- 13 towards the separatrix which is called 'walking'. This walking created <b>carbon</b> <b>neutrals</b> at the outer strike point and led to 13 C deposition in the PFR. Although several migration pathways have been identified, quantitative analyses are hindered by experimental uncertainty in divertor leakage, and the lack of measurements at locations such as gaps and shadowed regions...|$|R

40|$|Although carbon is {{the fourth}} most cosmically {{abundant}} element, it exists only rarely as <b>neutral</b> atoms, because <b>carbon</b> that is cool enough to be neutral rapidly combines with other atoms to form molecules such as CO. Atomic carbon (CI) forms when CO is dissociated by ultraviolet photons, but the dissociation energy {{is close to the}} ionization energy of CI, so that <b>neutral</b> <b>carbon</b> is easily ionized into C II. At the edges of molecular clouds, carbon will exist mostly in the form of C II, with only a narrow transition zone containing CI covering the interior of the cloud, where CO predominates. We present here observations of the submillimetre line due to the 3 Pl- 3 P 0 fine-structure transition of C I, from which we construct high-resolution maps of <b>neutral</b> <b>carbon</b> in molecular clouds in the star-forming region Orion A, in the externally illuminated cloud S 140, in the edge-on ionization front of M 17, and at the Galactic Centre. C I emission is indeed concentrated in a transition zone, but we confirm earlier suggestions that <b>neutral</b> <b>carbon</b> is also present at lower concentrations within the clouds. In the case of M 17, our images provide direct evidence for clumpiness in the cloud distribution. ...|$|R
