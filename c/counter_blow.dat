50|$|On October 29, 1896, Matthews {{knocked out}} English born boxer Stanton Abbott {{in the seventh}} of fifteen rounds at the Empire Athletic Club, in Buffalo, New York before a crowd of around 2,000. According to several sources, Abbott took the English {{lightweight}} title at 132 pounds in January 1893 at the National Sporting Club in London. Matthews employed a low crouch in the fight {{and seemed to be}} dominant throughout. He overwhelmed his opponent, who at several times seemed to have trouble effectively <b>countering</b> his <b>blows.</b>|$|R

Surprisingly, {{he had just}} lost to Mouzon by knockout in a non-title bout only three months previously on August 19, 1946 at Shibe Park in Philadelphia. In their fiercely fought November title match, Mouzon took the first three rounds with speed and jabs, but Montgomery <b>countered</b> with body <b>blows</b> and rights, before ending the bout 2:18 into the eighth with a long left hook. Mouzon took a serious lacing throughout all but the first round, and had a serious injury to his right eye.|$|R
40|$|Several {{kinds of}} defects {{that occur in}} bottle {{industry}} will reduce efficiency of bottle production. The defective bottle products are caused by several factors, such as human error, compositions, faults in temperature and machinery setting. From such those errors, faults in temperature and machinery setting often occur during bottle fabrication. This research aims to simulate bottle fabrication by using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) and being used to predict loading mark bottle defect. The {{results indicate that the}} temperature range in <b>counter</b> <b>blow</b> process should be 600 - 800 °C and {{in order to reduce the}} inhomogeneous parison temperature distribution the proper air velocity should be 0. 1 m/s. The inhomogeneous parison temperature distribution at the contact area between parison and blank mold may lead to the presence of loading mark. Based on the simulation results, the loading mark is likely to take place at the shoulder and neckring of the bottle...|$|E
5000|$|When Melusine {{was created}} Duchess of Munster in 1716 and Duchess of Kendal in 1719, Sophia {{was said to}} have also campaigned for either an Irish or British peerage. This campaigning was taken for granted when in a {{newsletter}} of 14 November 1717, it was stated that she [...] "came to town some weeks since on pretence to be with her husband...but as others say upon a difference with the Duchess of Munster." [...] Her husband died a day later and his illness, not her rivalry with the Duchess, was more likely to be the reason for her return to London. Perhaps to <b>counter</b> the <b>blow</b> of the South Sea Bubble, she was created Countess of Leinster in the Peerage of Ireland in 1721 and Countess of Darlington and Baroness Brentford a year later in the Peerage of Great Britain, all life peerages. The letters patent for both titles had the king describe her as [...] (of our common blood) and her coat of arms included the arms of Brunswick with a bar sinister to denote her as an illegitimate daughter of an elector of Hanover.|$|R

A parked car suddenly started off in reverse in downtown Oklahoma City Friday, ran wild a half block before crashing through a plate glass window at Katz drugstore, Main and Robinson. Two women were hurt, neither believed to be seriously, police reported. They were identified as Mrs. Louise Doyle Clark, 48, 2712 Cashion place, and her mother-in-law, Mrs. Eunice Clark, 79, Arlington, Texas. Both were taken to Mercy hospital with cuts and bruises. Police said the careening car narrowly missed several pedestrians when it jumped a curb and crossed the sidewalk. No one in the drugstore was injured, although merchandising <b>counters</b> were <b>blown</b> over. Mrs. Clark told police she {{parked in front of}} the State theater to let some passengers out of the car. She said she left the car's motor running. She said she asked her mother-in-law to get in the car from the driver's side.

5000|$|During {{the brief}} regency of Anna Leopoldovna (October 1740-December 1741) Osterman {{stood at the}} height of his power, and the French ambassador, Marquis de La Chetardie, {{reported}} to his court that [...] "it is not too much to say that he is tsar of all Russia" [...] Osterman's foreign policy was based upon the Austrian alliance. He had, therefore, guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction with the deliberate intention of defending it. Hence the determination of France to remove him at any cost. Russia, as the natural ally of Austria, was very obnoxious to France; indeed it was only the accident of the Russian alliance which, in 1741, seemed to stand between Maria Theresa of Austria and absolute ruin. The most obvious method of rendering the Russian alliance unserviceable to the queen of Hungary was by implicating Russia in hostilities with her ancient rival, Sweden, and this was brought about, by French influence and French money, when in August 1741 the Swedish government, on the most frivolous pretexts, declared war against Russia. The dispositions previously made by Osterman enabled him, however, to <b>counter</b> the <b>blow,</b> and all danger from Sweden was over when, early in September, Field-Marshal Lacy routed the Swedish general von Wrangel under the walls of the frontier-fortress of Willmanstrand, which was carried by assault.|$|R
500|$|Using an {{improved}} {{version of the}} [...] "Freeflow" [...] combat system from Arkham Asylum, the player can now <b>counter</b> multiple <b>blows</b> simultaneously, catch hurled projectiles, attack aerially, and administer a succession of consecutive strikes. Many of Batman's gadgets can now be used in combat. Enemies are armed with varying levels of armor and weapons; attacks from basic weapons like baseball bats and lead pipes inflict minor damage and can be countered, while guns inflict significant damage. Certain enemies must be disarmed in specific ways {{before they can be}} neutralized in combat: enemies with stun batons can only be attacked from behind; enemies with shields require aerial attacks to disarm; and enemies wearing body armor must be stunned with rapid successive strikes before they can be harmed. Larger enemies must be tackled with stuns and combo attacks, and can be manipulated to take out their allies. Disputes between gangs allied to rival villains often spark s, which complicate the player's ability to move about Arkham City. Combat, among other actions, rewards the player with experience points that allow the player to periodically level Batman up and purchase upgrades to his Batsuit, gadgets, and combat and stealth skills. Each category contains approximately 15 different upgrades. For instance, an upgraded grapnel gun can be used to remotely disarm enemies, while a combat upgrade makes it easier to activate special attacks.|$|R
50|$|The by far {{best way}} to shorten the opponent's health meter is with knockdowns, that is fully {{depleting}} their health meter {{before the end of}} the round. The game also features nearly one-punch KO's that result from a well-placed signature or step-in punch. Counters are also rewarded with extra damage and staggering the opponent, but only works against the heavy punches. The high- and low-block means the player's never completely safe from taking a hit and if a light punch is thrown to meet a heavy punch the heavy punch will still keep going and connect, even though they're slower, easier to predict and wear out the fighter. As a result, this means that, just like in boxing; rushing can beat blocking, counters can beat rushing, out-boxing can beat <b>counters,</b> heavy <b>blows</b> can beat out-boxing and blocking can beat heavy blows. Matches can end after just one or two knockdowns, with the referee waiving the fight off without a count. The connect rates mirror real-life boxing matches, with each exhibition bout against the CPU averaging at around 37% of the punches landed, as opposed to the relatively high connect rates common in other boxing games. The AI is the toughest seen in any recent boxing game, with the CPU taking advantage of every opening and every mistake players make, as well as using sound defense and demonstrating overall awareness.|$|R

5000|$|On December 14, 1908, Harry {{had a close}} {{bout with}} one of his {{frequent}} opponents, welterweight contender Willie Lewis at the New Haven, Connecticut, Grand Opera House. As was typical of Lewis's style of boxing, he was an expert in <b>counter</b> punching, rapid <b>blows,</b> and scientific boxing. The New London Day wrote of the fight [...] "Harry put on a very fast exhibition of infighting {{in the early stages of}} the go but towards the end he seemed to lose out in putting his punches over with the necessary force and as a result the New York boy (Willie) was in a fair way of stopping his namesake who holds the championship." [...] The New York Times, however, considered the twelve round bout a draw. Among the two preliminary bouts, the first was a close fight between New London native Abe Hollandersky and Maurice Lemoine of Webster, Massachusetts.|$|R

60|$|At this bland query spoken {{from under}} the lamp at the garden gate, like some demand of a god, their nerves gave way, and {{snatching}} up their coats, they ran at the railings, shinned up them, and made for the secluded spot whence they had issued to the fight. Here, in dim light, they mopped their faces, and without a word walked, ten paces apart, to the college gate. They went out silently, Val going towards the Broad along the Brewery, Jolly down the lane towards the High. His head, still fumed, was busy with regret {{that he had not}} displayed more science, passing in review the <b>counters</b> and knockout <b>blows</b> which he had not delivered. His mind strayed on to an imagined combat, infinitely unlike that which he had just been through, infinitely gallant, with sash and sword, with thrust and parry, as if he were in the pages of his beloved Dumas. He fancied himself La Mole, and Aramis, Bussy, Chicot, and D'Artagnan rolled into one, but he quite failed to envisage Val as Coconnas, Brissac, or Rochefort. The fellow was just a confounded cousin who didn't come up to Cocker. Never mind! He had given him one or two. 'Pro-Boer!' The word still rankled, and thoughts of enlisting jostled his aching head; of riding over the veldt, firing gallantly, while the Boers rolled over like rabbits. And, turning up his smarting eyes, he saw the stars shining between the housetops of the High, and himself lying out on the Karoo (whatever that was) rolled in a blanket, with his rifle ready and his gaze fixed on a glittering heaven.|$|R
