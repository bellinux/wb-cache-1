40|$|Background: Previous {{studies suggest}} that humans can acquire {{immunity}} to reinfection with schistosomes, most probably due to immunologic mechanisms acquired after exposure to dying schistosome worms. Methodology/Principal Findings: We followed longitudinally two cohorts of adult males occupationally exposed to Schistosoma mansoni by washing cars (120 men) or harvesting sand (53 men) in Lake Victoria. Men were treated with praziquantel each time S. mansoni infection was detected. In <b>car</b> <b>washers,</b> {{a significant increase in}} resistance to reinfection, as measured by the number of cars washed between cure and reinfection, was observed after the <b>car</b> <b>washers</b> had experienced, on average, seven cures. In the <b>car</b> <b>washers</b> who developed resistance, the level of schistosome-specific IgE increased between baseline and the time at which development of resistance was first evidenced. In the sand harvesters, a significant increase in resistance, as measured by the number of days worked in the lake between cure and reinfection, was observed after only two cures. History of exposure to S. mansoni differed between the two cohorts, with the majority of sand harvesters being lifelong residents of a village endemic for S. mansoni and the majority of <b>car</b> <b>washers</b> having little exposure to the lake before they began washing cars.

40|$|Longitudinal {{investigations}} {{of an adult}} male population of Kenyan <b>car</b> <b>washers</b> who have heavy and quantifiable occupational exposure to Schistosoma mansoni cercariae revealed that some individuals develop resistance to reinfection while others remain highly susceptible. We sought to characterize immune correlates associated with host protection in this population. Previous studies have demonstrated an association of peripheral eosinophilia with resistance to reinfection with schistosomes. Thus, we investigated {{the relationship between the}} percentage of circulating eosinophils and the effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) coinfection on the susceptibility of the <b>car</b> <b>washers</b> to reinfection with schistosomes. Elevated percentages of circulating eosinophils were associated with resistance to reinfection by S. mansoni in HIV- 1 -seronegative persons. In the HIV- 1 -seropositive cohort, low CD 4 +-T-cell counts were associated with a less intense eosinophilia. Moreover, eosinophils from the <b>car</b> <b>washers</b> expressed high levels of FcεRI β chain, a molecule important in immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated immunity. Levels of FcεRI β chain expression correlated with serum levels of total and antigen-specific IgE for HIV- 1 -negative <b>car</b> <b>washers,</b> but {{this was not the case}} for individuals coinfected with HIV- 1. Overall, these data further implicate eosinophils as having a potential role in development of protective immunity against schistosomes and suggest that changes associated with HIV- 1 coinfection increase susceptibility to reinfection...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSchistosomiasis is a {{neglected}} tropical disease caused by blood-dwelling flukes {{of the genus}} Schistosoma. While the disease may affect as many as 249 million people, treatment largely relies on a single drug, praziquantel. The near exclusive use of this drug for such a prevalent disease has led to concerns regarding the potential for drug resistance to arise and the effect this would have on affected populations. In this study, we use an in vitro assay of drug sensitivity to test the effect of praziquantel on miracidia hatched from eggs obtained from fecal samples of Kenyan adult <b>car</b> <b>washers</b> and sand harvesters as well as school children. Whereas in a previous study we found the <b>car</b> <b>washers</b> and sand harvesters to harbor Schistosoma mansoni with reduced praziquantel sensitivity, we found no evidence {{for the presence of}} such strains in any of the groups tested here. Using miracidia derived from seven <b>car</b> <b>washers</b> to infect snails, we used the shed cercariae to establish a strain of S. mansoni with significantly reduced praziquantel sensitivity in mice. This was achieved within 5 generations by administering increasing doses of praziquantel to the infected mice until the parasites could withstand a normally lethal dose. This result indicates that while the threat of praziquantel resistance may have diminished in the Kenyan populations tested here, there is a strong likelihood it could return if sufficient praziquantel pressure is applied...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 200 {{million people}} have {{schistosomiasis}} in parts of Africa, South America, the Middle East, the Caribbean and Asia. Several studies of multiple treatments and reinfections indicate that some people develop resistance to reinfection. Of all the immunologic findings associated with such studies, the most consistent observation is that resistance (usually defined as lower levels of infection upon reinfection) correlates with high IgE and low IgG 4 antibodies against schistosome antigens. Our studies test whether single nucleotide polymorphisms residing in the gene or promoter regions of cytokines pivotal in controlling production of these antibody isotypes are different amongst those that develop resistance to reinfection {{as opposed to those}} that do not. Through genotyping of these polymorphisms in a cohort of occupationally exposed <b>car</b> <b>washers,</b> we found that men with certain genotypic patterns of polymorphisms in IL- 4, IFN-γ, and IL- 13 {{were significantly more likely to}} be resistant to reinfection than those with different patterns.

50|$|Just as {{the culture}} was {{spreading}} outside New York City and overseas, the cultural aspect of graffiti in New York City {{was said to}} be deteriorating {{almost to the point of}} extinction. The rapid decline in writing was due to several factors. The streets became more dangerous due to the burgeoning crack epidemic, legislation was underway to make penalties for graffiti artists more severe, and restrictions on paint sale and display made racking (stealing) materials difficult. Above all, the MTA greatly increased their anti-graffiti budget. Many favored painting sites became heavily guarded, yards were patrolled, newer and better fences were erected, and buffing of pieces was strong, heavy, and consistent. Stainless steel, to which paint adheres poorly (and was easily removed by the powerful cleaning solutions and spinning brushes used in automatic <b>car</b> <b>washers</b> at the yards) had also become the car body material of choice for new rolling stock, retiring hundreds of worn out carbon-steel bodied subway cars whose exteriors had made an ideal canvas for taggers.

40|$|The Baixa de Maputo is the {{historic}} {{core of the}} city of Maputo Mozambique, developed from the 17 th century onwards from the Dutch fort Lijdzaamheid, the subsequent Portuguese fortified trading post to the heart of Lourenço Marques, the capital of the Portuguese colony, and after 1976, as Maputo, capital of the independent nation. The introduction of automobile traffic around 1945 favoured development of the new, broadly laid out modernist part of Maputo and caused a slow dilapidation of the Baixa de Maputo. Recently however, new development within {{the eastern part of the}} Baixa and the former industrial harbour area is creating a revival, but the city centre is however facing urban transformations with a severe impact on the composition and the functioning of the city. These recent developments in and around the Baixa ignore and deny its quality and by doing so form a threat to its identity of a melting pot of social, cultural and economical classes and activities. The developments de-democratize the city centre and by replacing the existing fabric have a severe impact on the composition and the functioning of the city and the inclusivity of its inhabitants. This project proposes a democratic respond to the current state of the city, matching conservation of spatial, economical and social quality with the accommodation of new requirements and programs. The project reacts on its context by including instead of excluding, enhancing instead of hindering and embracing instead of repelling, and at the same time the project identifies itself with recent developments and suits the evolving image of Maputo as a modern Metropolis. On the urban scale, the implementation of a sequence of spatial moments connects the different identities of the Baixa, develops the waterfront area as an social generator and provides a more accessible connection with the higher eastern part of the city centre. On the architectural and human scale this projects accentuates the most present cultural, economical and social value of this African city, which for me is the public street life and its adaptation and appropriation of space and build environment. The street life is defined by small-scale commercial activities based on gaining maximum necessities trough minimum means, which are provided by street vendors, <b>car</b> <b>washers,</b> parking guards etc and their receivers of service and/or goods.

The study was carried out in Kisumu, western Kenya within the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Research and Public Health Collaboration platform. The three phases included: 1. PHASE I: Identification and determination of categories of KPs and techniques of locating and motivating them to participate in HIV prevention trials. 2. PHASE II: Design and Implementation of a mRDS methodology in recruiting Ks into HIV prevention trials. 3. PHASE III: Evaluation of the mRDS in recruitment of KPs into an HIV incidence cohort study. Methods Phase I of the study included the conduct of in depth interviews which were used to identify different categories of persons considered to be KPs within Kisumu, identify strategies of locating the KPs and determine motivators and inhibitors of KPs participation in HIV prevention trials. Phase II on the other hand included the administration of a survey that had been refined in Phase I. The survey was used to design a mRDS methodology which was then implemented to recruit KPs into the survey. Phase III evaluated the success of the mRDS in recruiting KPs into an HIV prevention study by assessing the risk profiles for participants screened and enrolled into the Phase III study. Ethical approval for the study was sought from the ethics committee of the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the US CDC and the University of the Western Cape. The study recruited 53 individuals into phase I and was able to 8 identify different categories of people considered to be KPs and the 4 salient strategies {{that could be used to}} recruit them into HIV prevention studies. The phase also identified 8 potential motivators and 9 potential inhibitors to participation in HIV prevention research. These categories and salient strategies were used in phase II to develop and pilot a mRDS methodology in recruiting 203 individuals into a survey. The survey was used as a validation tool for the risk levels of persons recruited by the mRDS using the variables of inconsistent condom use and having multiple partners. The validated mRDS was then applied in the recruitment of 1, 292 participants in phase III of thestudy. These study participants had characteristics similar to those seen in similar studies and elucidated from phases I and II of the study. HIV seropositivity was used as the variable for validating risk levels of participants in this study and this was found to be higher that that seen in general population and comparable to that seen in other KPs groups in the region. Results: Overall the study was able to identify different categories of people considered to be at high riskof HIV acquisition. The groups identified included people who frequent bars (e. g. bar workers, drunkards, sex workers, businessmen), people who work in transportation (e. g. truck drivers, matatu drivers, motorcycle drivers, taxi drivers, bicycle taxi drivers), fishermen/fishmongers, MSM and hair salon workers. The study also identified using personal contact, link persons, peer mobilisers and leaders as strategies of identifying and locating KPs. The study used the mRDS successfully in recruiting participants with evaluation of inconsistent condom use and multiple sexual partnerships showing the participants to be of high risk behaviour. Of all the females in the study, only 3. 3 % were pregnant. The prevalence of Chlamydia was 2. 9 %, gonorrhoea was 5. 0 %, syphilis was 0. 4 % and HSV- 2 was 46. 0 %. Those who tested positive for HIV were 26. 2 % with 42. 3 % of the HIV positive participants having CD 4 counts of between 250 – 500 cells/ml. Recommendations and Conclusion:The mRDS was successful in recruiting KPs in an HIV prevention trial. Majority of the participants reported inconsistent condom use and having multiple sex partners. In addition to MSM, SW and transport industry workers, fisherfolk, discordant couples, widowers, street youth, <b>car</b> <b>washers</b> and police also form part of KPs groups. The HIV prevalence was higher amongst these groups compared to general population with discordant couples having the highest HIV prevalence. The study recommends that mRDS should be used to identify and recruit KPs as it not only allows for faster recruitment of KPs, it also reduces the expense and complexity associated with coupon management in the standard RDS...|$|R
