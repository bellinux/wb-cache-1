30|$|Group multi-hop {{synchronization}} [4] {{can be used}} to synchronize a {{group of}} sensor nodes of a wireless neighborhood. They first propose a lightweight secure group synchronization (L-SGS) that exploits multicast authentication to synchronize the neighborhood. This technique is also vulnerable to compromised nodes. To solve this vulnerability, Ganeriwal et al. propose secure group synchronization (SGS). SGS requires nodes to exchange and process messages after the initial multicast exchange to <b>check</b> <b>time</b> consistency. SGS and L-SGS provide 10 μ s accuracy and 20 μ s pulse-delay vulnerability window. The consistency check is inefficient, since it does not exploit the broadcast nature of the wireless neighborhood. Moreover, the consistency check can only tolerate one compromised node, and no provision is made to cope with a subset of compromised nodes. Moreover, they allow for whatever neighborhood member to anarchically start the (L-)SGS protocol, which can be exploited for battery depletion attacks.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{numerical}} {{tool for the}} design of controllers each representing an actuator of a smart safety restraint sys-tem, is introduced. The airbags are left out of consideration. The focus is on the design of a controller for the chest ac-celeration of the driver by manipulating the force applied to the belt by the beltforce limiter. The tool is based on local linearizations of the non-linear transfer of the manipulated variable (the beltforce) to the controlled variable (the chest acceleration). Local linearizations are performed at equidis-tant time points during a crash in order to <b>check</b> <b>time</b> invari-ancy and using perturbations with different magnitudes in order to check linearity of the transfer. The identified linear model is used to design a PID controller. For an evalua-tion of the outlined approach, the controller is applied to the (non-linear) model of the US-NCAP crash test, designed in the multibody and finite element package MADYMO.

Therefore, the cutting process {{is one of the}} main value adding processes. Several functions are included in the cutting process; namely fabric laying, cutting and bundling of cut panels.

Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis are used to analyze the data. Overall, the results show that six factors out of identified seven are significantly useful in predicting total lay time.

40|$|Berger code (BC) is {{an optimal}} {{separable}} code which can detect all single stuck-at and unidirectional faults. The traditional BC checker is not totally self-checking (TSC) when k = 2 r- 1, where k {{is the number}} of information bits in a code word, and r {{is the number of}} check bits. The case in which k = 2 r- 1, however, is important and practical since information words in most digital systems are {{in the form of a}} power of 2. This problem was solved recently by Rao et al., who proposed a TSC BC checker based on the concept of a generalized BC partition technique.

This system, similar to Pioneer [20] but built with relaxed assumptions, successfully detects attacks on code integrity over 10 links of an enterprise network, despite an average of just 1. 7 % time overhead for the attacker. We also present the first implementation and evaluation of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware timing-based attestation protocol. We describe the design and results {{of a set of}} experiments showing the effectiveness of our timing-based system, thereby providing further evidence of the practicality of timing-based attestation in real-world settings.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{strategy}} for optimizing the placement of bin boundaries to minimize the cost of query evaluation using bitmap indices with binning. For attributes {{with a large number}} of distinct values, often the most efficient index scheme is a bitmap index with binning. However, this type of index {{may not be able to}} fully resolve some user queries. To fully resolve these queries, one has to access parts of the original data to check whether certain candidate records actually satisfy the specified conditions. We call this procedure the candidate check, which usually dominates the total query processing time. Given a set of user queries, we seek to minimize the total time required to answer the queries by optimally placing the bin boundaries. We show that our dynamic programming based algorithm can efficiently determine the bin boundaries. We verify our analysis with some real user queries from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For queries that require significant amount of time to perform candidate check, using our optimal bin boundaries reduces the candidate <b>check</b> <b>time</b> by a factor of 2 and the total query processing time by 40 %...|$|E
