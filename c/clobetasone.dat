40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{double-blind}} trial comparing the efficacy of betamethasone phosphate 0. 1 %, <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate 0. 1 %, and placebo in the treatment of acute unilateral nongranulomatous uveitis. The 2 steroids were equally comparable in improvement of the patients' symptoms, though betamethasone phosphate was significantly more effective than <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate in improving the ocular signs of uveitis. However, <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate had significantly less effect on raising intraocular pressure in known steroid responders and ocular hypertensives than did dexamethasone. The use of a bolometer as an objective measure in uveitis was significant only in the more severe cases of uveitis. In comparing the placebo group of patients with those on topical steroids, the former group, though improving, appeared to lag behind by approximately one week. Four cases on placebo, however, had to be withdrawn because of worsening of the condition. Mild cases of anterior uveitis would probably resolve without using topical steroids...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clobetasone</b> butyrate, a new {{corticosteroid}} {{with a high}} topical activity, {{has been}} compared with prednisolone phosphate and a placebo {{in the treatment of}} inflammation following cataract extraction. These 2 steroids were more effective in relieving postoperative inflammation than placebo (P less than 0. 05), though no obvious clinical differences between the 2 compounds emerged from this investigation. However, a single-blind comparative study against betamethasone phosphate in patients suspected of having steroid-induced glaucoma showed that, while betamethasone phosphate significantly raised intraocular pressure, <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate had only a minimal effect, and this difference was statistically significant (P less than 0. 02) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate and betamethasone were measured in aqueous humour of patients undergoing cataract extraction 12. 5 to 18. 5 hours after application {{into the lower}} conjunctival sac of an ointment containing 0. 1 % of the steroid. Samples were assayed from 10 patients receiving <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate and 13 patients receiving betamethasone phosphate. There were measurable concentrations in only 2 samples in the former group, and both were 0. 1 ng/ml. In the betamethasone group measurable concentrations were found in 11 samples, and the concentrations ranged from 0. 5 to 20. 3 ng/ml, with the highest concentrations between 12. 5 and 13. 5 hours after application. The concentration of betamethasone in the aqueous humour decreased by about 90 % in the 6 hours from 12. 5 to 18. 5 hours after application.

40|$|Since {{the great}} {{majority}} of patients possess immune response to herpes simplex virus (HSV), the influence of a topical anti-inflammatory corticosteroid (0. 1 % <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate) on ulcerative herpetic keratitis was studied in rabbits with a previous HSV skin infection (immunised) and compared with that in normal rabbits. Corticosteroid treatment had a much greater ulceration-exacerbating effect in immunised than in normal animals. On day 7 the mean area of ulceration in immunised rabbits were 3 times greater in treated eyes. 0. 01 % <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate treatment had less effect on immunised rabbits; 0. 001 % had no effect. It is concluded that the immunised rabbit provides a useful experimental model for studying the relationship between concentration of topical anti-inflammatory agents and enhancement of herpetic ulceration...|$|E

40|$|A new echographic {{evaluation}} method employing a B scanner and a dedicated software (Dermavision 2 D, Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Denmark) {{was used in}} assessing the potency of three different corticosteroids. Experimental lesions were induced by patch tests with nickel sulfate 5 % in petrolatum in 10 sensitized subjects and treated with two medications of different steroids (clobetasol propionate, fluocinolone acetonide or <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate) performed 16 and 40 h after {{the application of the}} nickel patch tests. Clinical and echographic evaluations were carried out {{at the beginning of the}} experiment and 64 h after the induction of the reactions. After obtaining echographic images, these were processed by software, enabling the selection of amplitudes of interest, the highlighting of parts of images and their assessment by a value corresponding to the number of pixels (picture elements). For evaluations a low reflecting band was chosen, marking edema and inflammatory infiltration. At positive patch test sites we observed a progressive increase in the number of low reflecting pixels, in accordance with the intensity of the reaction. Therapeutic response was assessed as the difference between values of treated and untreated test sites. The rank order of the efficacy of test substances as determined echographically was identical to the rank order generally accepted for these steroids. This {{evaluation method}} of topical corticosteroid activity could be usefully employed besides traditional evaluation methods...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{experiments}} {{in recent years}} have indicated differences in the bioavailability of corticosteroids from seemingly identical topical dosage forms. The human blanching assay was utilized in this study to assess the comparative blanching activities of various locally manufactured proprietary corticosteroid preparations. The first experiment was performed to assess the relative blanching activities of six semi - solid preparations containing the same concentration of betamethasone 17 -valerate. The preparations used were Betnovate cream and ointment, Persivate cream and ointment and Celestoderm-V cream and ointment. This was followed, in the second experiment, by the investigation of the blanching activities of two lotions containing betamethasone 17 -valerate (Betnovate and Celestoderm-V) and a lotion containing betamethasone 17, 21 - dipropionate (Diprosone). The third experiment involved a study of six semi-solid proprietary corticosteroid-containing formulations, viz. Dermovate (clobetasol propionate) cream and ointment, Betnovate (betamethasone 17 -valerate) cream and ointment and Eumovate (<b>clobetasone</b> butyrate) cream and ointment. This investigation was prompted by claims in advertisements in the medical media that Dermovate is therapeutically more efficacious than Betnovate which is more efficacious than Eumovate. The penultimate experiment in this study served the purpose of finding a corticosteroid-containing preparation that falls into the moderately potent group of corticosteroid formulations, as described in the United Kingdom MIMS. This preparation was used in the final experiment which was undertaken to ascertain the potency category of Florone (diflorasone diacetate) cream and ointment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Background. There is {{evidence}} {{to indicate that}} peripheral glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function is reduced in major depression, and a possible molecular explanation {{for this is the}} impact of raised pro-inflammatory cytokines. The topical steroid vasoconstriction assay provides a convenient probe of peripheral GR function. The present study sought to assess the sensitivity of peripheral GRs in antidepressant-resistant major depressives and investigate the association between GR sensitivity and circulating plasma cytokines. Method. Nineteen antidepressant-resistant depressives together with age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent the steroid vasoconstriction assay using three commercial preparations of corticosteroids containing clobetasol propionate 0. 05 %, betamethasone valerate 0. 1 %, and <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate 0. 05 %, corresponding to very potent, potent, and moderately potent steroid creams respectively. The pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The severity of the depressive episode was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Results. Depressed subjects had a significantly reduced vasoconstriction response across all three strengths of steroid. They also had significantly higher concentrations of TNF-a and IL- 6. There was a significant inverse correlation between TNF-a concentration and vasoconstriction response and also between the HAMD score and vasoconstriction response. Conclusions. These findings suggest that cutaneous GR function is abnormal in antidepressantresistant depression, that circulating TNF-a may {{play a significant role in}} this abnormality and that the efficacy of topical steroids in antidepressant-resistant depressives is reduced...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fluticasone {{propionate}} is a {{novel and}} potent corticosteroid. It seems to have an improved therapeutic index {{on the basis of}} studies on skin thinning and suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Objective: We assessed the efficacy and safety of fluticasone propionate (FP) 0. 05 % cream once daily as compared with <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate (CB) 0. 05 % cream twice daily in children with atopic dermatitis (AD). Methods: Twenty-two children (3 to 8 years old) with moderately active AD received either FP once daily or CB twice daily. Severity of AD was scored weekly by means of the modified Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis system (SCORAD) and treatment was either stopped when skin lesions were almost cleared (SCORAD < 9) or after 4 weeks. Cortisol excretion was determined by means of 24 -hour urine before and after treatment. Results: Twenty-one children completed the study. After 1 week of treatment, mean SCORAD significantly decreased in both treatment groups. After 2, 3, and 4 weeks cumulatively, 8, 12, and 16 children, respectively, were clinically healed (SCORAD < 9). No significant differences in efficacy were observed between the two treatments. Urinary cortisol excretion was not altered by either of the treatments. Two weeks after discontinuation of active treatment, mean SCORAD had increased to 22, but still was significantly lower than that {{at the beginning of the}} study. Conclusion: Once-daily treatment with FP is as safe and effective as twice-daily treatment with CB in children with AD. All children experienced an exacerbation of AD within 2 weeks after treatment was withdrawn, indicating the need for long-term "intermittent" treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{human skin}} {{blanching}} assay {{is a well}} established method for ranking the efficacy of corticosteroids after epicutaneous application. Vasoconstriction is a pharmacological activity, which correlates well with the clinical efficacy, the intensity of skin blanching after a single application under occlusion corresponding, generally, to the clinical efficacy after repeated application without occlusion. However, in studies dealing with the comparison between the vasoconstriction assay and {{the evaluation of the}} clinical effects on inflammatory skin diseases, some exceptions to this correlation have been reported. Therefore, in a preclinical phase, {{it would be useful to}} combine the blanching assay with at least one anti-inflammatory assay. In the present study the blanching assay and the allergic contact dermatitis inhibition test were performed in parallel, in order to compare the two testing procedures in the same group of subjects, utilizing standardized study designs supported by objective means of evaluation. Three commercial preparations of corticosteroids containing clobetasol propionate (CP), <b>clobetasone</b> butyrate (CB) and hydrocortisone acetate (HA), respectively, were employed both to treat nickel-induced positive patch test responses on the volar forearms, and to perform a vasoconstrictor assay on normal forearm skin in 16 nickel-sensitized healthy volunteers. For evaluating skin blanching, we employed colorimetric measurements, whereas for the quantitative determination of the inhibition of the intensity of allergic patch test reactions, 20 MHz B-scanning supported by image analysis was used. Both colorimetric and echogenicity values enabled us to distinguish between the three corticosteroids (at the 17 h evaluation and the 64 h assessment, respectively). A fair correlation was noted between colorimetric and echogenicity values. Both testing procedures ranked the three corticosteroids in the expected order. Corticosteroid preparations should be compared using methods which allow different effects to be simultaneously monitored, without involving a high number of patients. We are proposing this double procedure for the parallel intraindividual evaluation of the vasoconstrictory action and the anti-allergic activity of topical steroids...|$|E
