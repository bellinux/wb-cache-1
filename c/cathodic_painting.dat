The more prolonged retention of protection properties of the coating was assigned to the morphology of the film containing nano ZnO after exposure to UV light. Nano ZnO stabilized coatings show a uniform degradation of the film surface while non-stabilized coating exhibit deep cracks which results in deterioration of the film integrity.

40|$|The current trend {{shows an}} {{increasing}} demand for novel technologies, that facilitate a functional integration of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) in metal based structures, especially in automotive industry. To {{comply with the}} requirements of large-scale production the use of fiber reinforced thermoplastics in form of hybrid metal/composite-laminates seems advantageous. By targeted exploitation of their high lightweight potential, combined with suitable capabilities for mass production and good damping properties, cost-effective and weight-optimized parts with high stiffness and load capacity can be provided for future applications. As there is little known about the processing and the mechanical properties of thermo-plastic based FRP/metal-laminates, the study focuses on the development of novel hybrid laminates with low residual stresses, made of metallic steel sheets and continuous glass or carbon fiber reinforced polyamide 6. In this context, the influence of several pre-operations like sand blasting, cleaning or primer application on the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) was examined in addition to their resistance to <b>cathodic</b> dip <b>paint</b> treatment...|$|R
40|$|Increasing mechanical, {{economic}} and environmental requirements lead to multi material designs, wherein different classes of materials and manufacturing processes are merged to realize lightweight components {{with a high level}} of functional integration. Particularly in automotive industry the use of corresponding technologies will rise in the near future, as they can provide a significant contribution to weight reduction, energy conservation and therefore to the protection of natural resources. Especially the use of continuous fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) with thermoplastic matrices offers advantages for automotive components, due to its good specific characteristics and its suitability for mass production. In conjunction with isotropic materials, such as steel or aluminum, optimized lightweight structures can be produced, whose properties can be easily adapted to the given component requirements. The present paper deals with the development of innovative hybrid laminates with low residual stresses, made of thin-walled steel sheets and glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic (GFRP) prepregs layers. Thereby the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) was increased by an optimization of the FRP/metal-interfaces, carried out by examining the influence of several pre-operations like sanding, cleaning with organic solvents and applying primer systems. Based on these findings optimized compound samples were prepared and tested under realistic <b>Cathodic</b> dip <b>paint</b> conditions to determine the influence on the ILSS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Quasi-static/dynamic three-point bending {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to assess the crash performance of magnesium alloy AZ 31 B extruded and sheet tubes at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) – Institute of Vehicle Concepts in Stuttgart. Different foam-filled AZ 31 B beams with a variation of foam density and thickness were fabricated through several manufacturing processes: cold bending, tungsten inert gas welding, <b>cathodic</b> dip <b>painting</b> and polyurethane foam injection. The experimental results were compared with those from mild steel DC 04 tubes. It shows that empty magnesium alloy AZ 31 B outperforms steel DC 04 in terms of specific energy absorption for the empty tubes with equivalent volume when subjected to bending loads. It {{was found that the}} foam-filled tubes achieved much higher load carrying capacity and specific energy absorption than the empty tubes. Moreover, there is a tendency showing that a foam-filled beam with a higher foam density reaches higher load carrying capacity, but fractures earlier. The foam-filled AZ 31 B tube with 0. 20 g/cm 3 foam obtained the highest specific energy absorption, but this outperformance was weakened due to the earlier fracture. In addition, the numerical simulation utilising material model MAT_ 124 in LS-DYNA explicit FEA package was performed. The simulation results indicate that using calibrate...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} load-deflection curve {{characteristics}} and deformation/fracture modes and energy absorption capacity for polyurethane foam-filled magnesium alloy AZ 31 B rectangular thin-walled beams under dynamic three-point bending loads, and compares these characteristics with those for mild steel DC 04 beams. Different foam-filled AZ 31 B beams with {{a variation of}} foam density (0. 05 g/cm 3, 0. 20 g/cm 3 and 0. 30 g/cm 3) were fabricated through several manufacturing processes: cold bending, tungsten inert gas welding, <b>cathodic</b> dip <b>painting</b> and polyurethane foam injection. It was found that 0. 20 g/cm 3 and 0. 30 g/cm 3 foams stabilised the cross sections of the thin-walled AZ 31 B beams and no inward folds occurred during the bending process, which resulted in significantly higher load carrying capacity than the empty beam. A nonlinear non-monotonic relationship between the specific energy absorption and the foam density was found for the foam-filled AZ 31 B beams. The AZ 31 B beam filled with 0. 20 g/cm 3 foam reached the highest specific energy absorption; moreover, it absorbed nearly 33 % more energy and reached nearly 2. 9 times higher specific energy absorption than the foam-filled DC 04 beam filled with the same foam, although the former one was nearly 54 % lighter. This outperformance is associated to the high work hardening rate of AZ 31 B in compression, where more material is involved in plastic deformation. However, the foam-filled AZ 31 B beams tend to fracture at the compression and tension walls, because the foam exhibits brittle fracture behaviour in tension and AZ 31 B exhibits low ductility in compression and plane-strain conditions, which limits their energy absorption at a larger deflection...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the evaluation of}} different polymeric membranes for the reclamation of wastewater generated by two manufacturers. Specifically, ultrafiltration (UF) membranes were evaluated for wastewater pretreatment use while nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were evaluated for wastewater reclamation use. Results show that both the UF membranes used were not suitable for pretreatment of the oily wastewater stream due {{to the presence of}} suspended <b>cathodic</b> electrodeposition (CED) <b>paint</b> particles. The CED paint particles rapidly deposit on the membrane surface resulting in severe fouling and very low permeate fluxes. With respect to the metals and beverage wastewater streams, the polyvinylidine-difluoride (PVDF) UF membrane was shown to be more suitable for pretreatment than the polyacrylonitrile UF membrane. The PVDF-UF membrane had relatively lower flux decline rates, higher turbidity and higher total organic carbon reduction rates. Meanwhile, the lowpressure RO membrane proved to be suitable for wastewater reclamation of the oily and beverage wastewater streams – showing low flux decline rates, high conductivity and high chemical oxygen demand reduction rates. In terms of reclaiming themetalswastewater stream, theNFmembrane proved more suitable than the low-pressure RO membrane. The NF membrane had relatively higher permeate fluxes and metals rejection rates compared to the RO membrane...|$|R
