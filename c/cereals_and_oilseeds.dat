50|$|Foods are dried {{to inhibit}} {{microbial}} development and quality decay. However, {{the extent of}} drying depends on product end-use. <b>Cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>oilseeds</b> are dried after harvest to the moisture content that allows microbial stability during storage. Vegetables are blanched before drying to avoid rapid darkening, and drying is not only carried out to inhibit microbial growth, but also to avoid browning during storage. Concerning dried fruits, the reduction of moisture acts in combination with its acid and sugar contents to provide protection against microbial growth. Products such as milk powder must be dried to very low moisture contents {{in order to ensure}} flowability and avoid caking. This moisture is lower than that required to ensure inhibition to microbial development. Other products as crackers are dried beyond the microbial growth threshold to confer a crispy texture, which is liked by consumers.|$|E
