500|$|Dylan {{has stated}} {{that he had to}} {{overcome}} considerable resistance at Columbia Records to give the album its title. He told biographer Robert Shelton: [...] "I wanted to call that album Highway 61 Revisited. Nobody understood it. I had to go up the fucking ladder until finally the word came down and said: 'Let him <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>what</b> he wants to call it'." [...] Michael Gray has suggested that the very title of the album represents Dylan's insistence that his songs are rooted in the traditions of the blues: [...] "Indeed the album title Highway 61 Revisited announces that we are in for a long revisit, since it is such a long, blues-travelled highway. Many bluesmen had been there before , all recording versions of a blues called 'Highway 61'." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{could well}} {{be argued that the}} tax {{involved}} here [...] is an [...] "excise tax" [...] based upon the receipt of money by the taxpayer. It certainly is not a tax on property and it certainly is not a capitation tax; therefore, it need not be apportioned.... Congress has the power to impose taxes generally, and if the particular imposition does not run afoul of any constitutional restrictions then the tax is lawful, <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>what</b> you will.|$|E

5000|$|Additionally in his 2007 {{interview}} on Fresh Air, Luntz discussed {{his use of}} the term, [...] "energy exploration" [...] (oil drilling). His research on the matter involved showing people a picture of current oil drilling and asking if in the picture it [...] "looks like exploration or drilling." [...] He said that 90 percent of the people he spoke to said it looked like exploring. [...] "Therefore I'd argue that it is a more appropriate way to communicate." [...] He went on to say, [...] "if the public says after looking at the pictures, that doesn't look like my definition of drilling—it looks like my definition of exploring—then don't you think we should be <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>what</b> people see <b>it</b> to be, rather than adding a political aspect to it all?" [...] Terry Gross responded, [...] "Should we be <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> actually is, as opposed to <b>what</b> somebody thinks <b>it</b> might be? The difference between exploration and actually getting out the oil—they're two different things, aren't they?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Cradle of Filth's {{particular}} genre {{has provoked}} {{a great deal}} of discussion, and their status as a black metal band or otherwise has been in debate since near the time that the group rose to fame. The band have openly cited first wave black metal acts such as Bathory, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate among their influences, but Dani Filth, in a 1998 interview for BBC Radio 5 for example, said [...] "I use the term 'heavy metal', rather than 'black metal', because I think that's a bit of a fad now. <b>Call</b> <b>it</b> <b>what</b> you like: death metal, black metal, any kind of metal...". Gavin Baddeley's 2006 Terrorizer interview states that [...] "few folk, the band included, call Cradle black metal these days." [...] In a 2006 interview with Terrorizer magazine, former guitarist Paul Allender said, [...] "We were never a black metal band. The only thing that catered to that was the make-up. Even when The Principle of Evil Made Flesh came out—you look at Emperor and Burzum and all that stuff—we didn't sound anything like that. The way that I see it is that we were, and still are now, an extreme metal band." ...|$|E
