The challenge for software project development We have witnessed the expanding application of the software in the field of commercial, industrial, management and research. The software is no longer {{at the edge of the}} technical systems, it has already become to one important factor in many application fields. New requirements for software are arising from these trends. Availability, robustness, easy installation and integration are becoming the most important features for the software. This series of changes led to software becoming more and more huge and complex.

40|$|This thesis studies Turkish {{migration}} policies as {{an outcome of}} the interactions between the European Union, international organisations (UNHCR, IOM) and domestic migration governance. Counterbalancing a tendency in the literature to focus on external influences and specifically the EU’s power over candidate countries, Turkish migration policy is seen to result from interrelationships between external and domestic actors that vary according to context of policy type, time and relative {{balance of power between}} the actors. Changes in international relations, Turkey’s relationship with the EU, and internal to migration governance, can relativize the power asymmetry between EU and Turkey, leading to opportunities for domestic authorities to exert influence. The study has a comparative design across four cases of migration policy decision-making and by actor-type. This allows investigation of interrelations and an actor’s efforts to exert influence relative to the others. A prominent policy is examined for each of the main four fields of Turkish migration policy: legislative reform (Law on Foreigners and International Protection), irregular migration (EU-Turkey readmission agreement), regular migration (adoption of the EU’s visa lists) and asylum (removal of geographical limitation clause from the 1951 Refugee <b>Convention).</b> <b>Document</b> analysis is supplemented by original data from twenty-one semi-structured interviews, conducted with experts from Turkish Ministries, international organisations and the EU Commission. The main finding is that the degree of external influence over Turkish migration policy is contextually shaped, by time, the substance of a specific policy field, and most notably by {{the degree to which a}} policy field is politicised. EU influence is strongest when a policy field is politicised and driven by ‘conditionality’. International organisations are less influential actors but present in shaping more technocratic and less politicised policies through ‘social policy learning’. Turkish authorities exert clear agency and use international negotiations to gain leverage to advance domestic migration interests...|$|E

40|$|This project uses <b>convention</b> <b>documents</b> {{to explore}} the {{relationship}} between a progressive religious movement and America’s progressive political party. The Social Gospel Movement rose {{in the early twentieth century}} as a response to modern industrial realities. It sought the Kingdom of Heaven on earth through progressive policy and church action. It supported the national progressive party of its era, the Republican Party. As the Democratic Party became America’s national progressive party, following the New Deal era, it failed to integrate the Social Gospel into its midst and has since experienced difficulty mobilizing religious voters and defining the sacred. Contemporary Democrats, religious scholars, and clergymen call on the Democratic Party to connect either with a revitalized Social Gospel or some similar religious tradition. These calls make sense in the context of the competing Republican Party’s successes relating to traditional and conservative Protestant voters. However, through an examination of convention speeches, party platforms, and politician-clergy relations, this project attempts to explain the historical inability of the Democratic Party to connect meaningfully with a religious movement- even one seemingly tailor-made like the Social Gospel Movement. ...|$|R
