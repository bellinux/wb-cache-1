40|$|A {{new type}} of {{permanent}} magnet (PM) brushless <b>claw</b> <b>pole</b> <b>motor</b> (CPM) with soft magnetic composite (SMC) core is designed and analyzed in this paper. The PMs are mounted on the claw pole surface, and the three-phase stator windings are fed by variable-frequency three-phase AC currents. The advantages of the proposed CPM are that the slip rings on the rotor are cast off and it can achieve the efficiency improvement and higher power density. The effects of the claw-pole structure parameters, the air-gap length, and the PM thinner parameter of the proposed CPM on the output torque are investigated by using three-dimensional time-stepping finite element method (3 D TS-FEM). The optimal rotor structure of the proposed CPM is obtained by using the response surface methodology (RSM) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method and the comparison of full-load performances of the proposed CPM with different material cores (SMC and silicon steel) is analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The main {{advantage}} of claw-pole machines lies {{in their ability}} to yield higher torque density values than is obtainable from a conventional machine. However, the high torque density has its price; leakage flux is often high resulting in low power factor and efficiency. This thesis is mainly concerned with the design of a claw-pole motor that meets application requirements of reasonably high torque density and a power factor comparable to conventional topologies. After critically reviewing previously proposed designs of Transverse-flux and Claw-pole machines, the thesis focuses on a special type of <b>claw</b> <b>pole</b> <b>motor</b> having claws in both the stator and the rotor. The claws are made of Soft Magnetic Composites (SMC); consisting of iron powder particles that are individually insulated and can be readily pressed into complex geometries. Detailed explanation of the operation of such a design is then provided. Internal design of the claw-pole motor is investigated with the aid of three-dimensional finite-element field computation. In particular, the effect of the following parameters on the motor's performance has been investigated: number of poles, main dimensions, magnet material and dimensions, pole-face profile and claw angle. This theoretical work was verified, to some extent, against measurements obtained from an experimental machine especially constructed for this purpose. Details of this experimental motor are also presented. The investigation of the internal design of the claw-pole motors presented in this thesis provides a physical insight into their operation and, therefore, can be utilised for their general design. Indeed, this work enabled realisation of a claw-pole servomotor that is capable of achieving a torque density of about 1. 5 Nm/Kg at a power factor of 0. 9. The decisions made in arriving at the servomotor design are presented and clearly related to the conclusions of the internal design investigation...|$|E

40|$|As one of {{the main}} {{parasitic}} parameters in permanent magnet (PM) synchronous machines (PMSMs), cogging torque is the main component of the torque ripple, which has always been the handicap in the high-performance, low-speed drive systems. Over the last two decades, various methods have been proposed to decrease the cogging torque in both radial-flux and axial-flux PMSMs. Among these methods, stator slot skewing, stator tooth notching, permanent magnet (PM) skewing, PM shifting, and pole pairing are extensively investigated. However, little work has been done on reducing the cogging torque of the <b>claw</b> <b>pole</b> machine (CPM), whose cogging torque cannot be ignored. In this paper, the general methods that have been used to reduce the cogging torque in radial-flux and axial-flux PMSMs are developed and verified in a CPM with a soft magnetic composite (SMC) core. The 3 -D finite element method (FEM) is used to calculate the cogging torque and PM flux linkage per turn.
