500|$|Because {{of their}} soft, {{gelatinous}} bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils, and fossils {{that have been}} interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue. Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about [...] in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, {{far more than the}} 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species – for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a <b>comb</b> <b>jelly.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Nuda is a {{class of}} ctenophores or <b>comb</b> <b>jellies.</b> The class {{contains}} a single family, Beroidae, with two genera, Beroe and Neis, and the group is more {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "beroids". They are distinguished from other <b>comb</b> <b>jellies</b> by the complete absence of tentacles, in both juvenile and adult stages. Beroe is found in all the world's oceans and seas, and the monotypic Neis occurs only near Australia; all beroids are free-swimmers that form part of the plankton.|$|R

50|$|Pleurobrachia pileus is {{a species}} of <b>comb</b> <b>jelly,</b> {{commonly}} known as a sea gooseberry.

2500|$|Jellyfish, <b>comb</b> <b>jellies,</b> {{and related}} animals have diffuse nerve nets {{rather than a}} central nervous system. [...] In most {{jellyfish}} the nerve net is spread more or less evenly across the body; in <b>comb</b> <b>jellies</b> it is concentrated near the mouth. [...] The nerve nets consist of sensory neurons that pick up chemical, tactile, and visual signals, motor neurons that can activate contractions of the body wall, and intermediate neurons that detect patterns of activity in the sensory neurons and send signals to groups of motor neurons as a result. [...] In some cases groups of intermediate neurons are clustered into discrete ganglia.|$|R
