Zile is famous for its grapes, leblebi, cherry, and fruit gardens. The annual Cherry Festival is very famous in Tokat, Sivas and Yozgat. People of Zile don't use their grapes to produce wine, but pekmez - a syrup-like liquid mixed from different kinds of fruit-juices.|$|E
40|$|The {{positive}} effects of intercropping systems are well known. Based on this we tested if a pea-cereal intercropping under reduced tillage can compensate the higher weed growth compared to deep ploughing. Furthermore we studied {{the reasons for the}} better weed suppression. In Organic Farming we need regional produced protein-rich animal feedstuffs. Therefore we tested different seed ratios of <b>common</b> <b>vetches</b> in mixtures with oat harvested as a grain crop...|$|R

50|$|Megoura viciae {{feeds on}} leguminous plants, {{primarily}} vetch, peas and broad beans {{of the genus}} Vicia from which M. viciae gets its <b>common</b> name of <b>vetch</b> aphids. Feeding on the host plant causes a leaf gall to form.|$|R
5000|$|Cystathionine, an {{intermediary}} product of this biochemical pathway, is secreted in urine. This process can effectively {{lead to the}} depletion of vital protective reserves of the sulfur amino acid cysteine and thereby making Vicia sativa seed a dangerous component in mixture with other toxin sources. The Spanish pulse mix [...] contains <b>common</b> <b>vetch</b> and bitter vetch in addition to vetchling (Lathyrus cicera) seeds; it can be fed in small quantities to ruminants, but its use as a staple food will cause lathyrism even in these animals. Moreover, <b>common</b> <b>vetch</b> as well as broad bean - and probably other species of Vicia too - contain oxidants like convicine, isouramil, divicine and vicine in quantities sufficient to lower glutathione levels in G6PD-deficient persons to cause favism disease. At least broad beans also contain the lectin phytohemagglutinin and are somewhat poisonous if eaten raw. Split <b>common</b> <b>vetch</b> seeds resemble split red lentils (Lens culinaris), and has been occasionally mislabelled as such by exporters or importers to be sold for human consumption. In some countries where lentils are highly popular - e.g., Bangladesh, Egypt, India and Pakistan - import bans on suspect produce have been established to prevent these potentially harmful scams.|$|E
5000|$|Vicia sativa, {{known as}} the <b>common</b> <b>vetch,</b> garden vetch, tare or simply vetch, is a nitrogen-fixing leguminous plant in the family Fabaceae.

It bears showy pea-like flowers in shades of lavender and fuchsia. The fruit is a hairless pod about 3 centimeters long that contains usually two light brown peas. American vetch is widespread across North America.|$|R
50|$|Horses thrive {{very well}} on <b>common</b> <b>vetch,</b> {{even better than}} on clover and rye grass; {{the same applies to}} {{fattening}} cattle, which feed faster on vetch than on most grasses or other edible plants. Danger often arises from livestock eating too much vetch, especially when podded; colics and other stomach disorders are apt to be produced by the excessive amounts devoured.|$|E
50|$|Another Christmas {{tradition}} is the planting of <b>common</b> <b>vetch</b> seeds in flat-bottomed pots. They are planted around {{the beginning of}} December, normally placed on white cotton and watered every day whilst being {{kept in the dark}} all the time. They are usually taken out just before Christmas, and resemble long white spaghetti-like strands of leaves (since they would have grown in the dark).|$|E
50|$|Bruchus are specialists, {{feeding and}} {{developing}} {{almost exclusively on}} plants of the legume tribe Fabeae (Vicieae), which includes peas, sweet peas, lentils, and vetches. Examples include cow vetch (Vicia cracca), which is attacked by at least nine Bruchus species, <b>common</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia sativa), which is host to five recorded species, and meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis) and tuberous pea (Lathyrus tuberosus), which are each attacked by four species.

50|$|It is {{native to}} Europe and Western Asia. It {{can be found on}} other continents as an {{introduced}} species. For example, hairy vetch is commonly used in cover crops and green manures on farms in North America. Typically, <b>common</b> <b>vetch</b> or hairy vetch provides the leguminous component of the crop, usually comingled with a grassy component as a nurse crop and an addition of more cellulose to the resultant organic matter (for example, rye or winter wheat). The species Vicia villosa is also called hairy vetch.|$|E
50|$|The {{site is a}} long narrow {{triangle}} {{north of}} Belmont railway station. It is an old meadow which formerly belonged to Belmont Hospital. The meadow is unimproved chalk grassland with common grasses and wild flowers, including <b>common</b> <b>vetch,</b> bladder campion and common knapweed. It provides a good habitat for invertebrates such as butterflies, grasshoppers and crickets. On the eastern side there is a hawthorn hedge next to the railway line, while the western edge is lined by an avenue of large trees, mainly horse chestnut.|$|E
50|$|Spanning 1.2 {{hectares}} (approx 3 acres), {{the limestone}} grassland {{of the reserve}} provides a rich array of wildflowers, such as <b>common</b> bird's-foot-trefoil, horseshoe <b>vetch,</b> kidney vetch, ivy broomrape, Alexanders, large bindweed, white bryony, wild madder and charlock. These flowers make suitable conditions for butterflies and other insects such as the grey bush cricket. The sheltering copse of sycamores, {{as well as the}} scrub-covered slopes down to Portland's disused railway track, are both important features for migrating birds arriving or leaving via Portland, while the sheltered tall grass {{has become one of the}} best sites on island for glow-worms. A conservation team operates on the site, and stops the scrub from encroaching onto the grassland, particularly non-native plants like Cotoneaster horizontalis, as well as dealing with tree regeneration.|$|R
60|$|Many {{other insects}} besides ants, however, {{are fond of}} the sweet {{secretions}} of the aphides, and {{it is probable that}} the honey-dew thus acts to some extent as a preservative of the species, by diverting possible foes from the insects themselves, to the sugary liquid which they distil from their food-plants. Having more than enough and to spare for all their own needs, and the needs of their offspring, the plant-lice can afford to employ a little of their nutriment as a bribe to secure them from the attacks of possible enemies. Such compensatory bribes are common enough in the economy of nature. Thus our <b>common</b> English <b>vetch</b> secretes a little honey on the stipules or wing-like leaflets on the stem, and so distracts thieving ants from committing their depredations upon the nectaries in the flowers, which are intended for the attraction of the fertilising bees; and a South American acacia, as Mr. Belt has shown, bears hollow thorns and produces honey from a gland in each leaflet, in order to allure myriads of small ants which nest in the thorns, eat the honey, and repay the plant by driving away their leaf-cutting congeners. Indeed, as they sting violently, and issue forth in enormous swarms whenever the plant is attacked, they are even able to frighten off browsing cattle from their own peculiar acacia.|$|R
50|$|Vicia pannonica is {{a species}} of vetch known by the <b>common</b> name Hungarian <b>vetch.</b> It is native to southern, central Europe and western Asia, and it is {{sometimes}} cultivated as an agricultural crop for use as hay and fodder. It may escape cultivation and grow as a casual roadside weed. This is an annual herb producing a hairy, climbing stem supported by the tendrils on its leaf-tips. The leaves are each made up of 10 to 20 oval or oblong leaflets measuring up to 2.5 centimeters in length. The inflorescence bears two to four pealike flowers each up to 2 centimeters long. The flower corolla is yellow or purple-marked {{and the back of}} the banner (the large top petal) is coated in soft hairs. The fruit is a hairy legume pod 2 to 3 centimeters long.|$|R
