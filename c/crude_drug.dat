5000|$|The {{most common}} means for {{fractionation}} are solvent-solvent partitioning and chromatographic {{techniques such as}} high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), medium-pressure liquid chromatography, [...] "flash" [...] chromatography, open-column chromatography, vacuum-liquid chromatography (VLC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), with each technique being most appropriate for a given amount of starting material. Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) is particularly well-suited for bioassay-guided fractionation because, as an all-liquid separation technique, concern about irreversible loss or denaturation of active sample components is minimized. After isolation of a pure substance, the task of elucidating its chemical structure can be addressed. For this purpose, the most powerful methodologies available are nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). In the case of drug discovery efforts, structure elucidation of all components that are active in vitro is typically the end goal. In the case of phytotherapy research, the investigator may use in vitro BAGF {{as a tool to}} identify pharmacologically interesting or important components of the <b>crude</b> <b>drug.</b> The work does not stop after structural identification of in vitro actives, however. The task of [...] "dissecting and reassembling" [...] the <b>crude</b> <b>drug</b> one active component at a time, in order to achieve a mechanistic understanding of how it works in phytotherapy, is quite daunting. This is because it is simply too difficult, from cost, time, regulatory, and even scientific perspectives, to study experimental fractions of the <b>crude</b> <b>drug</b> in humans. In vitro assays are therefore used to identify chemical components of the <b>crude</b> <b>drug</b> that may rationally be expected to have a given pharmacological effect in humans, and to provide a rational basis for standardization of a <b>crude</b> <b>drug</b> formulation to be tested in sold/marketed to humans.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{detect the}} {{contents}} of four active components of Salvia miltiorrhiza in various commercially available danshen <b>crude</b> <b>drugs</b> and preparations. METHODS: Commercially available danshen <b>crude</b> <b>drugs</b> from different sources, as well as danshen pills and intravenous injection preparations containing danshen alone or {{in combination with other}} herbs were collected. The composition of these danshen samples was analyzed using HPLC. Specifically, the amounts of magnesium tanshinoate B (MTB), danshensu, isotanshinone II A, and cryptotanshinone were determined. In some of these samples, the content of MTB was further confirmed by liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS) /MS method. RESULTS: There were great variations in the amount of the four active ingredients in the commercially available danshen <b>crude</b> <b>drugs</b> and drug preparations in this study. The amount of MTB was the highest among the four components measured in the <b>crude</b> <b>drugs.</b> However, the amounts of MTB in all danshen preparations were much lower than those in <b>crude</b> <b>drugs.</b> The 2 lipophilic components, isotanshinone II A and cryptotanshinone, were very low or not detectable in both injection and oral preparations. CONCLUSION: MTB can be used to standardize the various forms of danshen <b>crude</b> <b>drugs</b> and drug preparations from different sources. In view of the variation in the amounts of MTB and other components, improvement in the production methods of danshen preparations is essential to ensure consistent amount of its active ingredients and reproducible pharmacological actions. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|One {{characteristic}} of <b>crude</b> <b>drug</b> material is that constituents {{may have an}} opposite, moderating or enhancing effect. Hence, the final effect of any <b>crude</b> <b>drug</b> material will be {{a product of the}} interactions between the constituents and the effect of each constituent on its own. To effectively study the existence and effect of such interactions, scientific studies must examine the effect that multiple constituents, given concurrently, have on the system. Herbalists assert that as phytopharmaceuticals rely upon synergy for their activities, plants with high levels of active constituents like ginsenosides or hypericin may not correlate with the strength of the herbs. In phytopharmaceuticals or herbal medicine, the therapeutic effects of herbs cannot be determined unless its active ingredient or cofactors are identified or the herb is administered as a whole. One way to indicate strength is standardization to one or several marker compound that are believed to be mainly responsible for the biological effects. However, many herbalists believe that the active ingredient in a plant is the plant itself.|$|E
