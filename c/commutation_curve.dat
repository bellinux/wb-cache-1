40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the description of}} some properties of p-dimensional invertible real maps Tb, turning into a (p - 1) -dimensional non invertible ones T 0, p = 2, 3, when a parameter b of the first map is equal to a critical value, say b= 0. Then {{it is said that}} the noninvertible map is embedded into the invertible one. More particularly properties of the stable, and the unstable manifolds of a saddle fixed point are considered in relation with this embedding. This is made by introducing the notion of folding as resulting from the crossing through a <b>commutation</b> <b>curve</b> when p = 2, or a commutation surface when p = 3...|$|E
40|$|Modelling the {{saturation}} {{major loop}} of a ferrous metal produces the intrinsic magnetization parameters; fitting the measured <b>commutation</b> <b>curve,</b> however, can yield different results. The {{relation of the}} intrinsic loci of the vertices of the minor loops (ND= 0) to the experimental curve (ND≠ 0) is investigated. The two-way transformation between the two curves is formulated in closed mathematical form {{with the help of}} the internal demagnetization factor, ND. The method is applied to four ferrous metals, with widely different intrinsic properties (soft nonoriented Fe-Si steel, normalized low carbon steel, and Finemet in nanocrystalline and amorphous state) supporting the predictions of the proposal. The developed relationship is model independent and it is shown that the ND factor depends linearly on coercivity based on experimental evidence...|$|E

By this solution ， <b>commutation</b> <b>curves</b> and the values of the voltage drop between brush and commutator segment are obtained for some representative conditions of commu-tation in d-c machine to examine the commutating performance of the Tandem Brush. 1...|$|R
