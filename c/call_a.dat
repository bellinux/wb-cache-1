5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> general election in the near future.|$|E
5|$|By {{calling a}} federal referendum, {{a group of}} {{citizens}} may challenge a law passed by parliament, if they gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days. If so, a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law. Any 8 cantons together can also <b>call</b> <b>a</b> constitutional referendum on a federal law.|$|E
5|$|By the {{day after}} the regular session ended, Dayton had vetoed all of the budget bills passed by the legislature, and said in a {{statement}} that he anticipated a shutdown would occur. Dayton did not <b>call</b> <b>a</b> special session of the legislature to further address the budget during May or June, claiming that the lack of agreement between him and Zellers and Koch would make it unproductive to do so. He remained in contact with legislative leaders, sticking by the $35.8 billion budget he proposed late in the session, with minor changes. As the end of June approached, Koch urged the governor to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> session to pass a temporary 'lights-on' bill while a final deal was reached, but he refused to answer this proposal on the grounds that extending the budget's deadline would not serve the goal of reaching a final agreement. Since the budget impasse had not ended by the end of June 30, the shutdown began at midnight of June 30–July 1, 2011.|$|E

5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may <b>call</b> <b>a</b> consonant for $500 per occurrence, <b>call</b> <b>a</b> free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, British Airways held a {{promotion}}al contest {{to mark the}} 10thanniversary of the airline's move into the private sector.

Contestants had to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> special hotline to compete with up to 20million people.|$|E
5|$|In an SMC, {{only one}} {{candidate}} is elected {{to represent the}} constituency in question.

5|$|This species' call is a distinctive, plaintive cooOOoo-woo-woo-woooo, {{uttered by}} males to attract females, {{and may be}} mistaken for the call of an owl at first. (Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard {{preceding}} the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call (cooOOoo) by paired males to attract their mates to the nest sites, a greeting <b>call</b> (<b>a</b> soft ork) by males upon rejoining their mates, and an alarm <b>call</b> (<b>a</b> short roo-oo) by either male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound {{that is hard to}} hear. The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing.|$|E
5|$|Within four days, 2,300 men had {{answered}} Ellsworth's <b>call.</b> <b>A</b> selection {{of only the}} most desirable men cut that number to 1,100, which was considered a regiment's full strength.

5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could <b>call</b> <b>a</b> special session {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a bill by the end of the special session.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposal}} {{was made to}} <b>call</b> <b>a</b> special session to repeal the law, and Bradley {{was in favor of}} the action, but a poll of the legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal to justify the call. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission.|$|E
5|$|After {{just over}} a year in office, Cook was forced to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> new election, the first double dissolution. Labor won back its {{majority}} in the House, and Fisher returned for a third term as prime minister. He struggled with the demands of Australia's participation in World War I, and in October 1915 resigned in favour of Billy Hughes. Fisher subsequently accepted an appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, holding that position from 1916 to 1920. After a brief return to Australia, he retired to London, dying there at the age of 66. In total, Fisher served as prime minister for just under five years; Bob Hawke is {{the only member of the}} Labor Party to have served for longer.|$|E

In May, at least one state delegate urged the General Assembly to call itself into special session.|$|E
5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat.

When his attempt to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E

He was angered that Hoover refused to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> special legislative session to adopt relief measures after the regular congressional adjourned in early March 1931. He planned a series of speeches condemning Hoover beginning in June but was injured in an automobile accident on June 22, limiting his political activities {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|Batista {{had come}} under {{increasing}} pressure by 1958. His army's military failures, coupled with his press censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, were increasingly criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy arms from the United Kingdom. The opposition used this opportunity to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received strong support {{in central and eastern}} Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|By 1987, {{unemployment}} was falling, {{the economy}} was stable and strong and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead, and local council election results had also been successful, prompting Thatcher to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> general election for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. The election saw Thatcher re-elected for a third successive term.|$|E
5|$|By July, {{attempts}} at conciliation had completely collapsed. Maria Theresa's ally, the Elector of Saxony, now became her enemy and GeorgeII declared the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg to be neutral. The Queen {{was once again}} {{in need of help}} from Hungary. In order to obtain it, she granted favours to the Hungarian noblemen and flattered them without conceding to all of their demands. She had already won their support when she appeared in Pressburg in September 1741, hoping to persuade the Diet to <b>call</b> <b>a</b> mass conscription and recognise Francis Stephen as co-ruler. Upon achieving both goals, she showed her gift for theatrical displays by triumphantly holding her son and heir, Joseph, before the Diet, thereby gaining sympathy of the noblemen.|$|E
