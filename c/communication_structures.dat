Microstructure is the pattern of relations between most basic elements of social life, that cannot be further divided and have no social structure of their own (for example, pattern of relations between individuals in a group composed of individuals - where individuals have no social structure, or a structure of organizations as a pattern of relations between social positions or social roles, where those positions and roles have no structure by themselves). Macrostructure is thus a kind of 'second level' structure, a pattern of relations between objects that have their own structure (for example, a political social structure between political parties, as political parties have their own social structure). Some types of social structures that modern sociologist differentiate are relation structures (in family or larger family-like clan structures), <b>communication</b> <b>structures</b> (how information is passed in organizations) and sociometric structures (structures of sympathy, antipathy and indifference in organisations - this was studied by Jacob L.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – Based on father-child dyadic responses, {{this paper}} is aimed at {{revising}} and validating the scales of fathers' <b>communication</b> <b>structures,</b> identifying Jordanian fathers' <b>communication</b> <b>structures</b> and patterns. Design/methodology/approach – Based on two different studies, group interviews face-to-face, self-administered questionnaires and drop-off self-administered questionnaires were respectively employed to solicit young children's and fathers' responses. While the first study (n= 100) depended on convenience sampling procedures, proportionate stratified random sampling technique that relied on young children of ages 8 - 12 was conducted to select the participants of the second study (n= 916). Fathers' consent on the participation of their young children in the group interviews was obtained before collecting data. Findings – Children of ages 8 - 12 can precisely perceive family communication patterns (FCP) as adolescents and mothers. The influence of culture on fathers' <b>communication</b> <b>structures</b> and patterns is not clear. Jordanian fathers are principally classified as pluralistic fathers in their communication related to consumption issues and there is significant association between fathers' consumer socialisation goals and their <b>communication</b> <b>structures</b> and patterns. Research limitations/implications – The development of fathers' communication dimensions {{was based on a}} single-country study and the two research samples were restricted to the public schools of Amman metropolitan. Practical implications – Marketers can directly target Jordanian children in their advertising campaigns since children are more likely to make their own purchasing decisions. The marketers may focus on young children in their promotion campaigns to influence the family decision making related to products and services since their fathers adopt concept-oriented <b>communication</b> <b>structures.</b> Originality/value – An important contribution {{of this study is that}} neither fathers' <b>communication</b> <b>structures</b> nor young children's perceptions were previously used in revising and validating the scales of family <b>communication</b> <b>structures</b> and patterns at the level of collectivistic or individualistic cultures.

40|$|We study {{cooperative}} {{games with}} <b>communication</b> <b>structure,</b> represented by an undirected graph. Players {{in the game}} are able to cooperate only if they can form a network in the graph. A single-valued solution, the average tree solution, is proposed for this class of games. Given the graph structure we define a collection of spanning trees, where each spanning tree specifies a particular way by which players communicate and determines a payoff vector of marginal contributions of all the players. The average tree solution is defined to be the average of all these payoff vectors. It is shown that if a game has a complete <b>communication</b> <b>structure,</b> then the proposed solution coincides with the Shapley value, and that if the game has a cycle-free <b>communication</b> <b>structure,</b> it is the solution proposed by Herings, van der Laan and Talman (2008). We introduce the notion of link-convexity, under which the game is shown to have a non-empty core and the average tree solution lies in the core. In general, link-convexity is weaker than convexity. For games with a cycle-free <b>communication</b> <b>structure,</b> link-convexity is even weaker than super-additivity.

In an interpretive analysis of the interview transcripts, four <b>communication</b> <b>structures</b> were identified. In the linked triad the stepchild relied on indirect communication with the stepparent through his or her residential parent. The outsider triad was characterized by the stepchild communicating primarily with the residential parent with limited awareness of interdependence with the stepparent. In the adult-coalition triad the stepchild perceived that the residential parent and stepparent had formed a coalition, leading to cautious and distrustful communication with both adults. The complete triad featured the stepchild experiencing a “real family” with open communication with both the residential parent and the stepparent.
