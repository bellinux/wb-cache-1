50|$|In {{the past}} the {{examining}} judge could order committal of the accused, this power being subject to appeal. However, {{this is no longer}} the case, and other judges have to approve a <b>committal</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
50|$|A warrant of committal {{may not be}} {{enforced}} {{more than two years}} after the date it was issued, without further order from the court. The court may dispense with service of the judgment, order, claim form or application notice if it deems it fair to do so. If the <b>committal</b> <b>order</b> has been made {{in the absence of the}} respondent, without being served on him, the judge may fix a date and time when the person to be committed is to be brought before him or the court.|$|E
5000|$|The {{procedure}} made {{no provision}} for recourse by the debtor to the magistrate or higher authority once an order for committal had been made. Section 65L, which dealt {{with the release of}} a debtor from prison, contained no mechanism whereby a debtor, even one against whom a <b>committal</b> <b>order</b> had been made in absentia, was entitled to approach a court for relief. As a result of these defects, the statute swept up those who could not pay with those who could but simply would not. For this reason, the limitation could not be justified as reasonable, as required by section 33(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
40|$|Suicidality, drug {{treatment}} administered {{in the emergency}} department, restraining measures applied, <b>committal</b> <b>ordered</b> under state laws, the diagnosis of dementia, referral to hospital by a physician, or the patient presenting at the emergency department unaccompanied are the main factors that favour the indication for inpatient admission in our study. With increasingly limited time and high personal demands on the individual, a knowledge of these factors may provide doctors working in emergency departments with important pointers to help them more quickly and efficiently select the appropriate form of psychiatric treatment for the individual patient. In order to gain further insights in this field, further studies should be conducted, which should also include such aspects as {{the influence of the}} length of clinical experience of the duty physician on the number of inpatient admissions.

40|$|Extract {{from the}} minutes of the Management Committee of the Girls Industrial School, June 1862 - December 1869. The {{collection}} of minutes comprises eleven quarto volumes of minutes of the Management Committee ranging from 1862 until 1945. The School was founded in June 1862, originally as the Hobart Town Female Refuge to provide a home for neglected girls and train them in washing, sewing and domestic work. It was managed by a committee of ladies elected by subscribers, usually under the patronage of the Governor’s wife, but five gentlemen were elected as governors and formed an advisory committee. The School took 30 to 40 girls, usually between 6 and 14, but occasionally younger, and the committee liked to keep them beyond their committal period until they were 16 and trained for service, unless there were suitable relatives. These records are the committee records only. There are no personal records of the girls or their background or <b>committal</b> <b>orders.</b> The minutes of the monthly committee meetings dealt with bills, expenses, staff matters and {{the welfare of the}} children, and note briefly admissions and decisions on discharge of girls to service or to relatives, if any.

5000|$|A recall {{application}} was made {{asserting that the}} unsworn submissions used by the Supreme Court to <b>order</b> <b>committal</b> of Siemer to prison were not evidence. The application included evidence the website extracts relied upon in those submissions had been materially altered. The Supreme Court’s recall rejection was as brief as it was quick: [...] "The appellant’s application to recall this Court’s judgment 2010 NZSC 54 raises no matter which has not previously been considered {{in relation to the}} appeal and is dismissed." ...|$|R
50|$|Justice Finnegan, President of the High Court of the Republic of Ireland, jailed {{the five}} on 29 June 2005 by for civil {{contempt}} of court after refusing to obey a temporary court injunction forbidding them to interfere with work being undertaken by Shell on their land. The <b>committal</b> <b>order</b> was sought by Shell who intended to build a high pressure raw gas pipeline across land in Rossport to pipe gas from the offshore Corrib Gas Field. Three of the five men own land in Rossport: Vincent McGrath and Ó Seighin were brought to court along with them as they had assisted in blocking the Shell workers. About thirty others who {{had done the same}} were not charged.|$|E
50|$|In any perjury charge {{courts are}} enjoined to {{specifically}} {{set out the}} assignment of perjury by telling the accused what amount to perjury from his sworn evidence. This is essential and, in particular when a court adopts a summary procedure to commit an accused to prison for perjury. Where the accusation or even {{the gist of the}} offence is not clearly discernible from the record a conviction secured in such circumstances is most likely to be set aside on appeal. In the case of Chang Hangkin and Others v Piggot and Another the Privy Council rescinded the <b>committal</b> <b>order</b> against the appellants because the appellants was not given an opportunity to give reasons why the summary measure was being taken against them. This case also decided that it is not essential to set out the assignment of perjury in the summary procedure provided the accused is made aware of the pith of the charge against him.|$|E
50|$|In January Shell sent {{registered}} {{letters to}} a number of land owners, who were denying the company access to their land, that they would take court action against them.Following the granting of planning permission, local people started blockading the terminal site and compounds set up for pipeline construction. On 4 April 2005 Shell obtained a high court order restraining protesters from restricting access to its Rossport compound. In the week of 20 June it obtained a temporary injunction. On 29 June Shell sought a <b>committal</b> <b>order</b> against five people for breach of the temporary injunction. This led to the imprisonment of the five men who became known as the Rossport Five,. An Independent TD (member of Irish Parliament), Jerry Cowley liaised regularly with members of the Rossport Five while they were in jail. It is important, as a matter of historical record, that the Shell to Sea campaign did not arise following the jailing of the 5 men; the name Shell to Sea was adopted in January 2005 and therefore precedes the jailing later in that year. Shell to Sea, together with the Solidarity Camp, formed the backbone of resistance to and raising awareness of what was happening in north Mayo.A 300 km 'Long Walk' from Rossport, Co Mayo to Dublin took place in August 2006 to highlight opposition to the project. It took 12 days.|$|E
40|$|The School {{was founded}} in June 1862, {{originally}} as the Hobart Town Female Refuge to provide a home for neglected girls and train them in washing, sewing and domestic work. It was managed by a committee of ladies elected by subscribers, usually under the patronage of the Governor’s wife, but five gentlemen were elected as governors and formed an advisory committee. The School occupied various temporary houses until 1873 when the committee leased buildings in the Barracks, which premises were extended in 1879 when the School took the protestant girls from the Queen's Orphan School, New Town, which was being closed. In 1892 it moved to 'Kensington House, Davey Street (now the Trades Hall) and finally in 1924 it moved to 'Maylands, Pirie Street, New Town. The School took 30 to 40 girls, usually between 6 and 14, but occasionally younger, and the committee liked to keep them beyond their committal period until they were 16 and trained for service, unless there were suitable relatives. They were usually referred by a magistrate {{and supported by the}} Government, by relatives or by donations and the little earned by laundry and sewing work. The children were looked after by a matron and sub-matron and ladies of the committee visited in turn. As well as instruction in domestic work the children were given some basic education, by a Schoolmistress appointed after the transfer of the Orphan School girls in 1879, and after 1925 attended state school, and also received religious instruction from local ministers or Sunday school teachers. In February 1945 the School was transferred to the Salvation Army. These records are the committee records only. There are no personal records of the girls or their background or <b>committal</b> <b>orders.</b> Nor has any of the secretary’s correspondence survived. However the minutes of the monthly committee meetings dealt with bills, expenses, staff matters and the welfare of the children, and note briefly admissions and decisions on discharge of girls to service or to relatives, if any. There is an admission register noting name, date of admission and usually age {{and the name of the}} J. P. or other authority committing the child and the period of detention, with occasionally a note of discharge to service or the name of a parent, if known, but this volume was apparently not used regularly after about 1880. In 1902 a special record was begun, for the committee's use, of girls in the institution, noting where they were sent into service so that the committee could keep in touch with them. The amount of information noted varied. Private Deposit G 3 & G 3 / 9 -...|$|R
