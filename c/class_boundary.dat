50|$|Because some classes {{may have}} {{references}} to other classes, testing a class can frequently {{spill over into}} testing another class. A common {{example of this is}} classes that depend on a database: in order to test the class, the tester often writes code that interacts with the database. This is a mistake, because a unit test should usually not go outside of its own <b>class</b> <b>boundary,</b> and especially should not cross such process/network boundaries because this can introduce unacceptable performance problems to the unit test-suite. Crossing such unit boundaries turns unit tests into integration tests, and when test cases fail, makes it less clear which component is causing the failure. Instead, the software developer should create an abstract interface around the database queries, and then implement that interface with their own mock object. By abstracting this necessary attachment from the code (temporarily reducing the net effective coupling), the independent unit can be more thoroughly tested than may have been previously achieved. This results in a higher-quality unit that is also more maintainable.|$|E

The two methods are tested on four object classification problems of increasing difficulty and are compared with the commonly used static <b>class</b> <b>boundary</b> method.

Based on SVM and improved reduced set algorithm (IRS), the method generates new examples lying close to the face/non-face <b>class</b> <b>boundary</b> to enlarge the original dataset and hence improve its sample distribution. The new IRS algorithm has greatly improved the approximation performance of the original reduced set (RS) method by embedding a new distance metric called image Euclidean distance (IMED) into the kernel function.

40|$|Neural {{networks}} have frequently {{been found to}} give accurate solutions to hard classification problems. However neural networks do not make explained classifications because the <b>class</b> <b>boundaries</b> are implicitly defined by the network weights, and these weights do not lend themselves to simple analysis. Explanation is desirable because it gives problem insight both to the designer and to the user of the classifier. Many methods have been suggested for explaining the classification given by a neural network, but they all suffer from {{one or more of}} the following disadvantages: a lack of equivalence between the network and the explanation; the absence of a probability framework required to express the uncertainty present in the data; a restriction to problems with binary or coarsely discretised features; reliance on axis-aligned rules, which are intrinsically poor at describing the boundaries generated by neural networks. The structure of the solution presented in this thesis rests on the following steps: Train a standard neural network to estimate the class conditional probabilities. Bayes’ rule then defines the optimal <b>class</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Obtain an explicit representation of these <b>class</b> <b>boundaries</b> using a piece-wise linearisation technique. Note that the <b>class</b> <b>boundaries</b> are otherwise only implicitly defined by the network weights. Obtain a safe but possibly partial description of this explicit representation using rules based upon the city-block distance to a prototype pattern. The methods required to achieve the last two represent novel work which seeks to explain the answers given by a proven neural network solution to the classification problem. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Training {{a visual}} {{inspection}} device is not straightforward but {{suffers from the}} high variation in material to be inspected. This variation causes major difficulties for a human, and this is directly reflected in classifier training. Many inspection devices utilize rule-based classifiers the building and training of which rely mainly on human expertise. While designing such a classifier, a human tries to find the questions that would provide proper categorization. In training, an operator tunes the classifier parameters, aiming to achieve as good classification accuracy as possible. Such classifiers require {{lot of time and}} expertise before they can be fully utilized. Supervised classifiers form another common category. These learn automatically from training material, but rely on labels that a human has set for it. However, these labels tend to be inconsistent and thus reduce the classification accuracy achieved. Furthermore, as <b>class</b> <b>boundaries</b> are learnt from training samples, they cannot in practise be later adjusted if needed. In this thesis, a visual based training method is presented. It avoids the problems related to traditional training methods by combining a classifier and a user interface. The method relies on unsupervised projection and provides an intuitive way to directly set and tune the <b>class</b> <b>boundaries</b> of high-dimensional data. As the method groups the data only by the similarities of its features, it is not affected by erroneous and inconsistent labelling made for training samples. Furthermore, it does not require knowledge of the internal structure of the classifier or iterative parameter tuning, where a combination of parameter values leading to the desired <b>class</b> <b>boundaries</b> are sought. On the contrary, the <b>class</b> <b>boundaries</b> can be set directly, changing the classification parameters. The time need to take such a classifier into use is small and tuning the <b>class</b> <b>boundaries</b> can happen even on-line, if needed. The proposed method is tested with various experiments in this thesis. Different projection methods are evaluated {{from the point of view}} of visual based training. The method is further evaluated using a self-organizing map (SOM) as the projection method and wood as the test material. Parameters such as accuracy, map size, and speed are measured and discussed, and overall the method is found to be an advantageous training and classification scheme...|$|R

Its focus lies on the harmonization of national classification methods to guarantee a common understanding of Good Ecological Status' in surface waters. This article defines reference conditions and sets class boundaries for deep (mean depth [15 m, IC lake type L-AL 3) and moderately deep (mean depth 315 m, IC lake type L-AL 4) Alpine lakes [0. 5 km 2. Data were collated from each of the five EU member states included in the Alpine Geographical Intercalibration Group (Alpine GIG: Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Slovenia). Hydro-morphological, chemical and biological data from 161 sites (sampling stations) in 144 Alpine lakes over a period of seven decades were collated in a database. Based on a set of reference criteria, 18 L-AL 3 and 13 L-AL 4 reference sites were selected. Reference conditions were defined using a combined approach, based on historical, paleolimnological and monitoring data in conjunction with trophic modelling and expert judgement. Reference values and class boundaries were set for annual mean total biomass (biovolume), and then derived for annual mean chlorophyll-a using a regression between the two parameters. In order to allow for geographical differences within the Alpine GIG and to facilitate the inclusion of the broadly defined common IC types and national lake types, ranges were defined for each reference value. Range of reference values are 0. 2 0. 3 mg l- 1 (L-AL 3) and 0. 50. 7 mg l- 1 (L-AL 4) for total biovolume and 1. 51. 9 lg l- 1 (L-AL 3) and 2. 7 3. 3 lg l- 1 (L-AL 4) for chlorophyll-a.

All admit that a large amount of parameters of DNNs allow great potential to learn complex speech and noise patterns and their <b>class</b> <b>boundaries.</b> If the {{training is}} based on clean speech only, however, the flexibility provided by the DNN structure is largely wasted. This is because the phone <b>class</b> <b>boundaries</b> are relatively clear with clean speech, and so the abundant parameters of DNNs tend to learn the nuanced variations of phone implementations, conditioned on a particular type of channel and/or background noise. This is a notorious over-fitting problem. By injecting random noises, the DNN training is enforced to emphasize on the most discriminative patterns of speech signals. In other words, the DNNs trained with noise injection tend to be less sensitive to noise corruptions. This intuition is supported by the noise injection theory as presented in the next section.|$|R
