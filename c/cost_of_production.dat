Double-file lines over a block long were reported for opening-week showings at the Audubon Theatre in New York.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} an increase in the petroleum price on the sectoral <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Three components <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> which comprise domestic materials, imported input, and labour have been identified. By using the input-output model, different scenarios of the petroleum price changes on sectoral <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> were stimulated. The simulation results indicated that the fishing, forestry, and logging product, electricity and gas, cement, lime and plaster, and transport sectors are mostly affected by the increase in petroleum price. These sectors are expected to show large impact on <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> as a result of petroleum price increase because these industries highly consume petroleum products as an intermediate input in their production process...|$|R

5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} cortisone {{to concentrate on}} Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of the Bland–Allison Act {{did not end}} {{calls for}} free silver. The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other {{agricultural}} commodities. Silver advocates argued that this dropoff, which caused the price of grain to fall below its <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> {{was caused by the}} failure of the government to adequately increase the money supply, which had remained steady on a per capita basis. Advocates of the gold standard attributed the decline to advances in production and transportation. The late 19th century saw divergent views in economics as the laissez-faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists, and both sides found ample support for their views from theorists.|$|E
5|$|With {{a modest}} budget of 1 million, the {{production}} of Loev was funded partly by the production partners, and by private equity. A crowdfunding campaign was started at the funding portal Indiegogo, raising an amount of approximately 4,000. In an interview with Manoj Sharma of Pandolin, a digital film magazine, Lamba talked about the struggle of funding the project saying that the investors backed out at the last-minute at more than one occasion.

For the mineral raw materials the structures of their prices in respective socialist countries are essentially different. The analysis of the problem shows that efforts must be continued to make uniform the structures <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and prices <b>of</b> mineral raw materials, in order to obtain the comparability <b>of</b> these <b>costs</b> and prices.

5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, Maryland's economy was {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} price fluctuations on the world market of its main cash crop, tobacco. Often in those years, the price on world markets was barely above the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> leaving planters with little to show for their efforts. This affected small Protestant planters disproportionately, as many of the larger Catholic landowners had diversified economically. This growing socioeconomic inequality exacerbated underlying religious tensions. Furthermore, the new Governor, William Joseph, who arrived in the colony just before Carroll, immediately entered into an adversarial relationship with the Protestant-dominated lower house of the assembly. Into this powder keg came the news that England's Glorious Revolution had taken place; the Catholic King James II had been deposed and replaced with the Protestant William of Orange. In an attempt to maintain control in the colony, Governor Joseph quickly canceled the session of the colonial assembly scheduled for April 1689.|$|E
5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> in the New York City area would be prohibitive {{and it was also}} going to be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E

In Spring 1946 {{it was announced that}} Liberty would be getting a fifth partner, producer-director Victor Fleming, although that deal never saw fruition. The film was released in November 1946, but was a financial failure. Although it was in the top 7% of that year's films as ranked by box office gross, it was unable to recoup its high production cost of $2.3 million, much less show a profit. After the film's release, Briskin became an outspoken advocate for the policy of longer runs for films, allowing them to recoup the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Without longer runs, he told The Film Daily, the quality of films would decline, as production costs continued to escalate.|$|E

Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Canada. The following decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time measurement devices in laboratory settings—the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a quartz clock able to measure small weekly variations in the rotation rate of the Earth was developed. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the United States on quartz clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks. In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Astron.

25|$|There {{are many}} multi-faceted {{problems}} in Occidental Mindoro's economy. In rice farming, {{the biggest issue}} confronting the producers is the high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> This is attributed mainly to the spiraling prices of farm inputs. A study concluded that from 1997 to 2003, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> rose by 47 percent, while the income derived from marketing rice maintained 1997 levels. There are also confused reports that the average production rate has declined due to the reduced application of necessary farm chemicals.
