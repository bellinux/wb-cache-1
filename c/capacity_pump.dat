The most popular solution is a system where a throttling control valve is fed by a constant <b>capacity</b> <b>pump</b> cooperating with an overfl ow valve. This system, working with a constant pressure, achieves a high energy effi ciency value η only at the point of maximum motor load coeffi cient MM and maximum motor speed coeffi cient ωM. Energy savings in a constant <b>capacity</b> <b>pump</b> operation may be achieved by means of an overfl ow valve controlled by the oil outlet point pressure between the directional control valve and the cylinder. Although structural volumetric losses cannot be eliminated in such a system, it is possible to reduce considerably structural pressure losses, mechanical losses and volumetric losses in the pump, and also mechanical losses in the cylinder.

The origins of these observations are still poorly understood. A hydrodynamic analysis is presented for the fully flooded contact zone of a smooth shaft surface running against a rough seal surface. Four roughness structures are considered: one-dimensional sinusoidal and two-dimensional sinusoidal seal roughness structures both without and with a tangential seal surface displacement. The tangential seal surface displacement is chosen asymmetric with the axial position in the contact. It follows that the tangential deformation of the one- and two-dimensional seal roughness structures used in this paper can explain the aforementioned experimental observations and simulate the observed order of magnitude of load-carrying <b>capacity,</b> <b>pump</b> rate, and friction torque found in the literature...|$|E

In view of these,here we present a concept and methodology for developing a simple, lowcost irrigation nozzle using PVC pipe.

Performance indicators showed that the nozzle can be operated satisfactorily over the pressure range 0. 4 - 0. 6 kg/cm 2 with application rate of 17 – 15 mm/h. Due to high application rate, field crops can be irrigated more efficiently compared to nozzles requiring very high operating pressures, ranging from 1. 5 to 3. 5 kg/cm 2. Low pressure requirement facilitates the use of low rating pipe network, low <b>capacity</b> <b>pump</b> and other accessories and therefore the overall system cost can be reduced substantially.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper {{concentrates}} on an approach to provide additional power supply by {{the implementation of the}} integration of wind turbine and Pico hydro turbine installed at the roof of high rise building. The Pico hydro turbine is installed over the storage tank where the tank is filled with water by the high <b>capacity</b> <b>pump</b> which is installed at the ground floor of the building. In the storage tank of high rise building water is thrown by the pump with a very high velocity which pushes the turbine to make it spin. The spinning of the turbine is turned into electricity by means of a generator and immense amount of wasted kinetic energy of the water is recovered thrown by the pump. The electrical energy created is usually stored in a battery which can then power electrical objects in house, such as appliances and lights. When the storage tank will be filled by water no more power can be extracted from the Pico hydro turbine. A wind turbine could also be installed at the roof of the high rise building with the purpose of acquiring additional power supply as the wind velocity is generally higher at the roof of the building. The electrical power, obtained from both the generators one coupled with the Pico hydro turbine impeller and another with the wind turbine blade can be utilized in houses, offices, and also in the industries. With the integration of Pico hydro turbine and wind turbine more electrical power could be gained. Moreover the major advantage of this system is the elimination of the cost of fuel and it is an eco-friendly clean power generation method.

40|$|In modern {{supersonic}} aircrafts due to aerodynamic skin heating {{a temperature}} of hydraulics environment significantly exceeds that of permissible for fluids used. The same problem exists for subsonic passenger aircrafts, especially for Airbuses, which have hydraulics of high power where convective heat transfer with the environment is insufficient {{and there is no}} required temperature control of fluid. The most significant in terms of heat flow is the flow caused by the loss of power to the pump and when designing the hydraulic system (HS) it is necessary to pay very serious attention to it. To use a constant <b>capacity</b> <b>pump</b> is absolutely unacceptable, since HS efficiency in this case is extremely low, and the most appropriate are variable-capacity pumps, cut-off pumps, dual-mode pumps. The HS fluid cooling system should provide high reliability, lightweight, simple design, and a specified heat transfer in all flight modes. A system cooling the fluid by the fuel of feeding lines of the aircraft engines is the most effective, and it is widely used in supersonic aircrafts, where power of cooling system is essential. Subsonic aircrafts widely use convective heat exchangers. In thermal design of the aircraft hydraulics, the focus is generally given to the maximum and minimum temperatures of the HS fluid, the choice of the type of heat exchanger (convective or flow-through), the place of its installation. In calculating the operating temperature of a hydraulic system and its cooling systems it is necessary to determine an increase of the working fluid temperature when throttling it. There are three possible formulas to calculate the fluid temperature in throttling, with the error of a calculated temperature drop from 30 % to 4 %. The article considers the HS stationary and noon-stationary operating conditions and their calculation, defines temperatures of fluid and methods to control its specified temperature. It also discusses various heat exchanger schemes, makes recommendations for regulation of heat flows, power reduction of cooling system, and choice of heat insulation elements of HS. </p...|$|E

40|$|City of Surakarta, {{known as}} Solo City {{is one of}} cities in Central Java Province traversed by Bengawan Solo River. Heavy {{rainfall}} in upstream area of Bengawan Solo River causes increase in high water level at downstream. Bengawan Solo River will be higher than water level in drainage system which may induce a backwater flow. Since Colonization era, the government has built dikes and barrages against backwater flow and inundation problem. One of the barrages was Demangan Barrage dividing river flow into Bengawan Solo River and Pepe River. It was equipped with total <b>capacity</b> <b>pump</b> of 12, 3 m 3 /s. The inundation is not only caused by the backwater flow coming from Bengawan Solo River, but also surface runoff {{as the result of}} the excess rainfall which cannot be drained gravitationally to the main river if the gate was closed. Therefore, comprehensive study combining hydrology and hydraulics analysis is highly needed in order to achieve more effective flood control management. Hydrology analysis was done to estimate the direct runoff hydrograph from catchment area in Solo City to downstream of Pepe River. While in hydraulics case, hydraulic parameter in downstream of Pepe River influenced by Bengawan Solo River stream was analyzed. Both studies were simulated using software HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 version. The simulation considered drainage channel, gate, pump system and dike in Pepe River downstream. Simulation using 10 years of return period in Solo City and average annual water level in Bengawan Solo River showed that Pepe River can flow through the gate, while the highest water level is still below the dike. Simulation considering 10 years of return period, water level hydrograph of Bengawan Solo River, existing pump, and gate operation inferred that Pepe River surpassed top of dike. Capacity of required pump should be more than 168, 3 m 3 /s in order to pass 10 years of return period. By combining operational of existing pump and dike elevated up to + 87, 63 m, capacity of required pump became lesser which was approximately 120, 3 m 3 /s. Simulation of HEC-RAS conducted by operating pump automatically on critical elevation without heightened dike obtained the total capacity of pump was 132, 3 m 3 /s.

40|$|The {{conventional}} fixed {{supply pressure}} valve-controlled (FPVC) hydraulic actuation method {{is a simple}} way to obtain motion control of a multi-axis system. The energy dissipated by the relief valve and the control valves is the main cause of the low energy-efficiency (and consequent oil heating) in the system. To overcome this problem, some approaches have been investigated such as load sensing, separate meter-in-and-meter-out, switching control and electro-hydrostatic actuation. In this thesis, a load-prediction based energy-efficient electrohydraulic actuation system – variable supply pressure valve-controlled (VPVC) actuation is described and implemented. A two-axis robotic arm is used as an example plant. In this research, the VPVC hydraulic actuation system is implemented by a fixed <b>capacity</b> <b>pump</b> driven by a brushless servo-motor. The feed forward part of the VPVC controller predicts the minimum required supply pressure for the demanded motion to each joint of the robotic arm by assuming its control valve is fully open. It is based on the prediction of the required piston force for a given motion demand, by applying Lagrange's equations of the-second-kind. The supply pressure for the whole system is the higher one of the two load branches; the other one is controlled by the common valve throttling. The supply flow is varied by controlling the speed of the servomotor. The feedback control of the VPVC is simple PI control for the valves and P control for the motor speed. Although the VPVC method is demonstrated for a two axis system, it is applicable to systems with any number of axes. By using the variable minimum required supply pressure together with the maximum valve opening (and hence minimum throttling losses), the hydraulic energy-efficiency is improved compared with a fixed supply pressure valve-controlled (FPVC) system. Moreover, due to the feed forward control, the response has much less phase lag hence the dynamic error is much smaller than a conventional FPVC system with proportional integral position feedback control. Applied to a known plant, especially enough load information, VPVC provides a higher energy-efficiency and a higher accuracy of motion control. The simulation and experimental results have validated the advantages of the VPVC over the FPVC. The hydraulic power consumption comparison between VPVC and FPVC with the same sine wave motion demand showed that up to 70 % saving was achieved by VPVC experimentally. If the energy loss via relief valve in FPVC is taken into account, the saving can be increased greatly. The experiment also showed that the VPVC brought a very quiet operating due to the minimum flow throttling and variable motor speed, whereas serious flow throttling and constant high speed of motor in FPVC. Very low noise is another significant benefit of VPVC over FPVC. All the dynamic errors in VPVC tests were smaller than in FPVC. They were within 6 % of the total motion range, compared to 14 % for FPVC. And the average dynamic errors of VPVC tests were within 1. 5 % of the total motion range...|$|E
40|$|The Sagebrush Flat Wildlife Area is a 12, 718 acre complex {{located in}} Douglas County, Washington. Four {{distinct}} management units {{make up the}} area: Bridgeport, Chester Butte, Dormaier and Sagebrush Flat. The four Units are located across a wide geographic area within Douglas County. The Units are situated roughly along a north/south line from Bridgeport in the north to the Douglas/Grant county line in the south, 60 miles away. The wildlife area was established to conserve and enhance shrubsteppe habitat for the benefit shrubsteppe obligate and dependent wildlife species. In particular, the Sagebrush Flat Wildlife Area is managed to promote the recovery of three state-listed species: Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (threatened), greater sage grouse (threatened) and the pygmy rabbit (endangered). The US Fish and Wildlife Service also list the pygmy rabbit as endangered. Wildlife area staff seeded 250 acres of old agricultural fields located on the Sagebrush Flat, Dormaier and Chester Butte units. This has been a three project to reestablish high quality shrubsteppe habitat on fields that had either been abandoned (Dormaier) or were dominated by non-native grasses. A mix of 17 native grasses and forbs, {{most of which were}} locally collected and grown, was used. First year maintenance included spot spraying Dalmatian toadflax on all sites and mowing annual weeds to reduce competition. Photo points were established and will be integral to long term monitoring and evaluation. Additional monitoring and evaluation will come from existing vegetation transects. This year weed control efforts included spot treatment of noxious weeds, particularly Dalmatian toadflax, in previously restored fields on the Bridgeport Unit (150 acres). Spot treatment also took place within fields scheduled for restoration (40 acres) and in areas where toadflax infestations are small and relatively easily contained. Where toadflax is so widespread that chemical treatment would be impractical, we use the bioagent Mecinus janthinus, available through Professor Gary Piper of Washington State University. This year we released 4, 000 M. janthinus on the Bridgeport Unit at 6 separate locations. Since 2002 we have released approximately 14, 400 of these insects, 80 % of these on the Bridgeport Unit. Additional weed control activities included mowing and spot spraying more than 32 miles of roads, cutting and removal of annual weeds within fenced deer exclosures. We upgraded the solar powered irrigation system that supplies water to a stand of water birch trees planted in 2002. Wildlife area staff designed and built a new solar array and installed a higher <b>capacity</b> <b>pump.</b> The increased capacity will ensure that these trees receive adequate water through the hot summer months and allow us to create at least one additional stand. This project is an important part in our effort to expand the available winter habitat for sharp-tailed grouse on the Bridgeport Unit. Maintenance of fences, parking areas and roads continued during throughout the year. Two parking areas, at Chester Butte and Bridgeport, were graded and additional gravel added. Roads on the Bridgeport Unit were graded and repaired following spring runoff. Trespass and dumping issues have increased in recent years on the Bridgeport Unit. To address these problems we constructed four steel gates at access points on this unit. Each gate is tubular steel attached to 8 -inch diameter steel posts, 10 feet long that are cemented into the ground. Two gates allow access to BPA substation facilities and power-line right-of ways so placement, construction and locking issues had to be coordinated with BPA's Real Estate staff in Spokane. Environmental Compliance Documentation issues were addressed again this year. This process has the potential to cause delays the completion of projects within the fiscal year. With this in mind and an eye toward the future, we requested that several projects planned for the coming years be surveyed this year. Beginning in August of 2007, area staff worked with BPA staff to identify work elements that had the potential to disturb cultural resources. Subsequently, in April of 2008, BPA staff archaeologists surveyed numerous sites and several miles of fence line. Final clearance to proceed was granted in August of 2008. This year we submitted and were awarded a grant from the state Recreation and Conservation Office. This grant will provide funding to restore native shrubsteppe habitat on 335 acres of old CRP fields located on the Bridgeport Unit. These fields were planted to non-native grasses in 1988 and currently have marginal habitat values for shrubsteppe obligate and dependent wildlife. Assuming that the state legislature allocates the funds, which, given the state's financial condition is not a sure thing, work on this project can begin late in the summer of 2009...|$|E
