50|$|This {{sidewall}} ply to bead tension {{support was}} a big reason for older cross-ply cord tire construction using the materials available in the early 19th century. The cross-ply cord arrangement orients the cords to more directly support the bead & wheel rim (like a sling: bead to cord and around below the tread back to the opposite bead, both ways, thus crossing plies of cords). However, with improved combinations of cord, bead, rim materials, and manufacturing techniques, combined with ongoing focus and research on tire efficiency and durability, it became both feasible and desirable to manufacture radial-ply cord tires, which, for many applications (despite higher costs), outperform and more than outlast (reliable-usual-service-life/cost ratio) similar cross-ply cord tire designs by (a) facilitating a flatter <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> with more evenly distributed pressure on the momentarily stationary area of contact between tread & ground and (b) lower operating costs over time: due to reduced tire temperature, decreased rolling resistance, lower puncture rates, greater longevity, etc.|$|E

In this paper, we focus on inferring an individual's social <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> from detailed census data, and generate various types of social <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> such as hierarchical-district-structure-based, cross-district and age-district-based patterns.

First, the generation of social <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> based on a hierarchical district structure allows for simulations at different district levels. Second, the newly generated social <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> reflect individuals social contacts.

The experimental technique calculated joint <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> by combining CT-based 3 D bone models with joint motion data that were accurately measured from biplane x-ray images. Joint <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> were calculated for the repaired and contralateral shoulders of 20 patients who had undergone rotator cuff repair.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to estimate the <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> for gear drives. The proposed method {{is based on the}} geometric properties of the generated surfaces of the pinion and the gear and it neglects the mechanical characteristics of the mating members. The key feature of the method is the superimposition of a virtual marking compound over the gear surface that mimics the industrial practice of <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> inspection. For each meshing condition the instantaneous contact area is estimated as the intersection of the pinion surface with the marking compound gear surface. Finally, the <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> is estimated by the convex envelope of all the instantaneous contact areas in the zr-plane. The marking compound shape is identified through an optimization process to match a target <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> obtained, e. g. with an accurate loaded tooth contact analysis tool. The proposed method has been tested with a dedicated FEM software package capable of producing a very accurate <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> estimation of the <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> under load. Extensive simulations have shown that, once the optimal marking compound shape has been identified, the proposed method computes a reliable <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> even for very different surface geometries (e. g. an ease-off on the pinion surface) and assembly errors. The computational cost of the entire procedure is about two orders of magnitude lower than that required to run the full FEM analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThe aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis {{was to examine the}} associations between the kinematics of the knee characterised by the tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>pattern,</b> and degenerative change, in the context of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. While the natural history of degenerative change following knee injury is well understood, the role of kinematics in these changes is unclear. Kinematics of the knee has been described in a variety of ways, most commonly by describing motion according to the six degrees of freedom of the knee. The advantage of mapping the tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> is that it describes events at the articular surface, important to degenerative change. It was hypothesised that the tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> would be affected by injury to the knee. A model of ACL injury was chosen because the kinematics of the knee {{have been shown to be}} affected by ACL injury, and because the majority of chronic ACL-deficient knees develop osteoarthritis, the associations between kinematics and degenerative change could be explored. A technique of tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> mapping was established using MRI, as a quantifiable measure of knee kinematics. The tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> was recorded from 0 º to 90 º knee flexion while subjects performed a leg-press against a 150 N load, using sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The technique was tested and found to be reliable, allowing a description of the tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> in 12 healthy subjects. The tibiofemoral contact patterns of knee pathology were then examined in a series of studies of subjects at a variety of stages of chronicity of ligament injury and osteoarthritis. Twenty subjects with recent ACL injury, 23 subjects with chronic ACL deficiency of at least 10 years standing, and 14 subjects with established osteoarthritis of the knee were recruited. The 20 subjects with recent ACL injury were examined again at 12 weeks and 2 years following knee reconstruction. The tibiofemoral contact patterns were examined for each group of subjects and the associations between changes in the contact patterns and evidence of joint damage explored. Evidence of joint damage and severity of osteoarthritis were recorded from xrays, diagnostic MRI, operation reports and bone densitometry at the tibial and femoral condyles of the knee. Each of the three groups with knee pathology exhibited different characteristics in the tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>pattern,</b> and these differences were associated with severity of joint damage and osteoarthritis. The recently ACL-injured knees demonstrated a tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> that was posterior on the tibial plateau, particularly in the lateral compartment. Those with chronic ACL deficiency demonstrated differences in the <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> in the medial compartment, associated with severity of damage to the knee joint. Osteoarthritic knees showed reduced femoral roll back and longitudinal rotation that normally occur during knee flexion. Two years following knee reconstruction there was no difference between the <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> of the reconstructed and healthy contralateral knees. This technique of tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> mapping is sensitive to the abnormal characteristics of kinematics in ligament injury and osteoarthritis. This is the first time the tibiofemoral contact characteristics of chronic ACL-deficient and osteoarthritis knees have been described and links examined between tibiofemoral contact patterns and degenerative change...|$|E

Ocean mobile delay tolerant network (OMDTN) can provide low-cost data transmission service in the network by utilizing the contact chances of moving vessels.

30|$|This study {{describes}} a technique for measuring in vivo glenohumeral joint <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> during dynamic activities, and demonstrates {{application of this}} technique by characterizing differences between repaired and contralateral shoulders of patients who have undergone rotator cuff repair. The experimental method described here offers advantages over conventional techniques for describing glenohumeral joint motion. Specifically, glenohumeral joint <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> provide a measure of joint function {{that may not be}} adequately captured when reporting only conventional measures of humeral rotation and translation. This is important, since many pathologic conditions of the shoulder (e.g., rotator cuff tear, glenohumeral joint instability) are believed to alter the glenohumeral joint articular mechanics, and procedures for treating these common conditions rely implicitly on the belief that restoring normal glenohumeral joint mechanics is necessary to obtain a satisfactory outcome. The approach described here of quantifying joint <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> has also been used by other investigators as a means of detecting functional differences associated with a specific clinical condition (e.g., distal radius malunion [19, 20]) that can not be detected using conventional kinematic parameters. Thus, joint <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> are perhaps not only a more sensitive measurement than conventional kinematics for detecting subtle differences in joint function but may also provide a more clinically relevant indication {{of the extent to which}} a conservative or surgical procedure has adequately restored normal joint function.|$|R
40|$|Characterizing {{mobility}} or <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> in {{a campus}} environment {{is of interest}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. Existing studies of these patterns can be classified into two basic approaches – model based and measurement based. The model based approach involves constructing a mathematical model to generate movement patterns while the measurement based approach measures locations and proximity of wireless devices to infer mobility patterns. In this paper, we take a completely different approach. First we obtain the class schedules and class rosters from a university-wide Intranet learning portal, and use this information to infer contacts made between students. The value of our approach is in the population size involved in the study, where <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> among 22341 students are analyzed. This paper presents the characteristics of these <b>contact</b> <b>patterns,</b> and explores how these patterns affect three scenarios.

We then evaluate a variety of methodologies for incorporating contact heterogeneity, including network-based models and several modifications to the simple SIR compartmental model.

In general, however, network models are more intuitive and accurate for predicting disease spread through heterogeneous host populations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Contact</b> <b>patterns</b> in populations {{fundamentally}} {{influence the}} spread of infectious diseases. Current mathematical methods for epidemiological forecasting on networks largely assume that contacts between individuals are fixed, {{at least for the}} duration of an outbreak. In reality, <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> may be quite fluid, with individuals frequently making and breaking social or sexual relationships. Here we develop a mathematical approach to predicting disease transmission on dynamic networks in which each individual has a characteristic behavior (typical contact number), but the identities of their contacts change in time. We show that dynamic <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> shape epidemiological dynamics in ways that cannot be adequately captured in static network models or mass-action models. Our new model interpolates smoothly between static network models and mass-action models using a mixing parameter, thereby providing a bridge between disparate classes of epidemiological models. Using epidemiological and sexual contact data from an Atlanta high school, we then demonstrate the utility of this method for forecasting and controlling sexually transmitted disease outbreaks.
