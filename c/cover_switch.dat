40|$|Introducing a {{parameterization}} of {{the interactions}} between wind-driven snow depth changes and melt pond evolution allows us to improve large scale models. In this paper we have implemented an explicit melt pond scheme and, for the first time, a wind dependant snow redistribution model and new snow thermophysics into a coupled ocean–sea ice model. The comparison of long-term mean statistics of melt pond fractions against observations demonstrates realistic melt pond cover on average over Arctic sea ice, but a clear underestimation of the pond coverage on the multi-year ice (MYI) of the western Arctic Ocean. The latter shortcoming originates from the concealing effect of persistent snow on forming ponds, impeding their growth. Analyzing a second simulation with intensified snow drift enables the identification of two distinct modes of sensitivity in the melt pond formation process. First, the larger proportion of wind-transported snow that is lost in leads directly curtails the late spring snow volume on sea ice and facilitates the early development of melt ponds on MYI. In contrast, a combination of higher air temperatures and thinner snow prior to the onset of melting sometimes make the snow <b>cover</b> <b>switch</b> to a regime where it melts entirely and rapidly. In the latter situation, seemingly more frequent on first-year ice (FYI), a smaller snow volume directly relates to a reduced melt pond cover. Notwithstanding, changes in snow and water accumulation on seasonal sea ice is naturally limited, which lessens the impacts of wind-blown snow redistribution on FYI, as compared to those on MYI. At the basin scale, the overall increased melt pond cover results in decreased ice volume via the ice-albedo feedback in summer, which is experienced almost exclusively by MYI...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe crystallographic {{structure}} of the G protein heterotrimer Giα 1 (GDP) β 1 γ 2 (at 2. 3 A) reveals two nonoverlapping regions of contact between α and β, an extended interface between β and nearly all of γ, and limited interaction of α with γ.

Alterations in GDP binding in the heterotrimer (compared with α-GDP) explain stabilization of the inactive conformation of α by βγ. Repeated WD motifs in β form a circularized sevenfold β propeller. The conserved cores of these motifs are a scaffold for display of their more variable linkers on the exterior face of each propeller blade...|$|R

This work mainly <b>covers</b> <b>switched</b> and impulsive switched delay SPSs. Multiple Lyapunov functions technique as a tool is applied to these systems. Dwell and average dwell time approaches are used to organize the switching between subsystems (modes) so that the hybrid system is stable. Systems with all stable modes are first discussed and, after developing lemmas to ensure existence of growth rates of unstable modes, these systems are then extended to include, in addition, unstable modes. Sufficient conditions showing that impulses contribute to yield stability properties of impulsive switched systems that consist of all unstable subsystems are also established. A number of illustrative examples are presented to help motivate the study of these systems...|$|R

50|$|Subscribers paid {{an annual}} rental, which <b>covered</b> <b>switching</b> fees and {{operator}} costs. Landowners paid a tax levy on phone lines running through their property, which covered repairing and building lines. The levy {{was based on}} the quarters of land through which telephone lines ran. There were two rates. A quarter of land which had a line passing through it paid a 'straight' rate, and a quarter of land in which someone lived and had a phone paid a higher 'take-off' rate. Since the 'straight' rate levy was charged regardless of whether the owner had phone service, land owners without phones could be paying as much or more as land owners with phone service. In spite of attempts to reform this system, it remained in place until the government took over the service. In addition to the annual rental and line levy, there was a special levy to pay back the debenture.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{modeling}} {{framework is}} proposed for circuits that are subject both to externally induced switches (time events) and to state events. The framework applies to switched networks with linear and piecewise-linear elements, including diodes. We {{show that the}} linear complementarity formulation, which already has proved effective for piecewise-linear networks, can be extended in a natural way to also <b>cover</b> <b>switching</b> circuits. To achieve this, we use a generalization of the linear complementarity problem known as the cone-complementarity problem. We show that the proposed framework is sound {{in the sense that}} existence and uniqueness of solutions is guaranteed under a passivity assumption. We prove that only first-order impulses occur and characterize all situations that give rise to a state jump; moreover, we provide rules that determine the jump. Finally, we show that within our framework, energy cannot increase {{as a result of a}} jump, and we derive a stability result from this.
