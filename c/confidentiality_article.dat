50|$|The Municipal Campaign Finance Code {{would become}} amended with an {{ordinance}} numbering 2007-OR-56 in city records. In this {{amendment to the}} Municipal Campaign Finance Code it begins with an introduction, Article I definitions, and then into Article II Section 2.4 Receiving and Collecting Gifts and Favors. Section 2.4 restricts {{the context in which}} gifts or favors are given and what can be given. It also explains who can give gifts or favors and what amounts in certain situations can be given. Section 2.5 City Owned Property addressed that use of property of the city is for official use only and all uses must be authorized prior to usage by city officials or employees. Then Section 2.6 Use or Disclosure of Confidential Information explains that officials, candidates, and city employees shall not disclose confidential information other than what required by law, performing his or her official duties, and as permitted in section 2.13. The Municipal Finance Code continues explanations in conflicts of interest regulating business conducted with people like family members of an official, representations of other people regulating how officials and employees represent the city or other persons in situations, post employment restrictions regulating how business is conducted after leaving a job with the city or official position, interests in city business regulating the interaction of business conducted with officials or employees for contracts, services, or other work. After those sections this amendment addresses the employment of Relative in which input is prohibited in the decision process of hiring someone of relation to an official or employee of the city. The hiring of relatives has been controversial for several mayor administrations in the past. The amendment then continues with political activity regulating officials, candidates, or employees interactions with other officials or employees political interests. As well as the limitations thus far the amendment addresses a Whistleblower Protection clause for people making reports with the Ethics Commission as long as they aren't knowingly making a false report. The rest of the amendment clarifies limitations of contributions to elected officials and candidates and the prohibition of accepting donations from individuals, entities, or corporations that have pending litigation against the city. Article III is the Financial Disclosure referencing an old ordinance numbered 94-OR-17 in the city records. Article IV Board of Ethics regulates the composition and powers of the board and <b>confidentiality.</b> <b>Article</b> V Sanctions for Violations explains employment sanctions, fines, and validity of contract. Article VI Miscellaneous Provisions regulating severability. Article VIII Effective Date which was passed by the Council on November 5, 2007 and then signed by mayor Rob Waiz on November 9.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—High-assurance systems, such as {{flight control}} and banking systems require strict {{guarantees}} on information flows or else face catastrophic consequences. Information flow tracking (IFT) is a frequently used security measure for preventing unintended information flows in such systems. Recently, Gate Level Information Flow Tracking (GLIFT) {{has been proposed}} to track information flows at the hardware level. GLIFT enables a concrete understanding of all information flows from Boolean gates. It unifies the notions of explicit flows, covert channels, and even timing channels at the gate level and provides a general approach for enhancing important security properties such as integrity and <b>confidentiality.</b> This <b>article</b> presents a new encoding scheme for GLIFT with fewer encoding states by combining two states into one. Unlike the previous method, this reduction in encoding states allows the GLIFT tracking logic to operate independently from the original circuit. This independence allows for the GLIFT logic to be configured as both redundancy and tracking logic for the original circuit. Further, experimental results show this new state assignment provides on average 25. 7 % reductions in area, 31. 4 % reductions in delay, and 48. 6 % decrease in simulation time for several IWLS benchmarks.

40|$|The {{argument}} {{for access to}} sensitive unit-level data produced within government is usually framed in terms of risk and the legal responsibility to maintain <b>confidentiality.</b> This <b>article</b> argues that the framing of the question may restrict the set of possibilities; a more effective perspective starts from the data owner’s principles and user needs. Within this principles-based framework, the role of law changes: It becomes an ‘enabling technology’, helping to define the solution but playing no role in setting the objectives. This shift in perspective {{has a number of}} consequences. The perception of ‘costs’ and ‘benefits’ is reversed. Law and established practice are distinguished and appropriately placed within a cost-benefit framework. The subjectivity and uncertainty in risk assessments is made explicit. Overall, all other things being equal, the expectation is that a move towards objective-based planning increases data access and improves risk assessment. This alternative perspective also addresses the problem of the public-good nature of research outputs. It encourages the data owner to engage with users and build a case for data access taking account of the wider needs of society.

Review sites for professional service providers like doctors and lawyers are following the trail blazed by restaurants and hotels and are beginning to catch up. A 2014 survey found that prospective clients actively seek out lawyer reviews online and will travel farther to hire an attorney with positive reviews. At {{the same time as}} reputational data has grown in relevance, however, the media is increasingly reporting stories of individuals and businesses that have handled online reviews in spectacularly counterproductive ways. Lawyers are not exempt: recent disciplinary cases and ethics opinions have demonstrated that lawyers can also be tempted to respond to negative reviews by lashing out at former clients a manner that violates the duties of loyalty and <b>confidentiality.</b> This <b>Article</b> explores the psychological dynamics arising from online reviews, and it explains how these dynamics unleash processes of ego threat and cognitive distortion that encourage overreaction. It examines the limits of attorney responses under the rules of professional conduct, looking at both ex ante strategies to influence and control what is posted, as well as ex post efforts to neutralize or rebut negative reputational information after reviews have been posted. It concludes that both of these strategies fail to serve regulatory goals. The Article therefore proposes broadening the structure of attorney regulation to encompass reputation management. It recommends that states create voluntary proceedings that would allow attorneys to challenge allegedly false or misleading online reviews in a confidential setting — and would also empower disciplinary committees to impose sanctions for instances of lawyer misconduct that come to light during these proceedings. The Article concludes that this shift in regulatory emphasis would improve the reliability of lawyer review sites and would also offer two additional benefits: first, it would help close the regulatory gap arising from an increase in multijurisdictional law practice, and second, it would give the client perspective a greater influence in attorney regulation...|$|R

However, common understandings of privacy in arbitration often lull individuals into assuming personal information revealed in arbitration may not become public. They assume privacy and confidentiality are synonymous. The {{reality is that}} arbitration is private but not necessarily confidential, or secret. This is the privacy paradox: it defies common conceptions of arbitration 2 ̆ 7 s secrecy, but is nonetheless true. This paradox is problematic because it leads to shortsighted contracting and simplistic assumptions about arbitral justice. Moreover, it may foster injustice when repeat players unduly benefit from unpublished awards as well as pro-drafter <b>confidentiality</b> provisions. This <b>Article</b> thus calls contracting parties to more carefully draft their arbitration contracts, and invites policymakers to craft transparency reforms that consider tensions created by the privacy paradox. It seeks to spark discussion of multi-perspective transparency reforms by proposing a two-prong approach toward transparency: (1) Require publication of arbitration awards in arbitrations involving statutory discrimination, consumer protection, corruption, and fraud; and (2) Establish default rules protecting personal and proprietary information from use or disclosure outside of arbitration hearings. The key is to balance all parties 2 ̆ 7 interests in confidentiality and privacy with the public 2 ̆ 7 s legitimate interests in accessing information that may affect health, safety or wellbeing.
