5|$|On 2 December 2013, {{after more}} than a year of {{testimony}} and over 12,000 pages of evidence, the presiding coroner instructed the jury to begin their deliberations, and requested they <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> verdict in Smith's death and recommendations on means to prevent a recurrence of such an event.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Jeff Hardy. MVP quickly beat down Hardy and {{dominated}} {{early in the}} match. Hardy tried to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mule kick from the corner, but MVP {{moved out of the}} way, leading Hardy to crash the mat face first. MVP controlled most of the match, until Hardy finally had some offense with a rope-aided corner dropkick in the corner. With the upper hand, Hardy performed a Swanton bomb on MVP, but MVP moved out of the way. MVP tried to perform a running big boot, but Hardy countered into a drop toe hold. The match ended with Hardy winning the match, after performing the Whisper in the Wind, a move performed by executing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, then spinning 180°, landing on a fallen opponent back-first.|$|E
25|$|In early 2009, before spring training, {{third baseman}} Alex Rodriguez {{admitted}} to using steroids while {{playing for the}} Texas Rangers during the 2001–2003 seasons. This happened right before a hip injury to Rodriguez, and that stopped his playing time from early March until mid-May. A-Rod would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bang, having a 3-run homer on the first pitch he had seen since early spring training.|$|E

25|$|His {{debut in}} the Octagon was a third fight with Heath Herring at UFC 73, {{promoted}} under various combinations of his name and nickname, but was officially introduced to the audience under his full name and nickname. Nogueira once again defeated Herring, via unanimous decision. During the first round, Herring landed a head kick that sent Nogueira to the canvas, in which unofficial judge Eddie Bravo thought the fight could have been stopped. Herring let Nogueira get back to his feet, and Nogueira was then able to recover and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dominant decision victory.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the quick}} scoring {{and the first}} Test result led many {{people to believe that}} Australia would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vengeance {{on the second day of}} the matcht. Instead, Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's career. The {{dismissal}} was to set the tone of the innings. Although Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch – Ponting swept to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a risky single for 20. Once again, Vaughan was in the action, hitting the stumps with a throw from mid off. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, but again, a couple of quick wickets – Clarke edging a quicker ball from Ashley Giles behind and Simon Katich falling in the same way to Andrew Flintoff swung it England's way. At 208 for 5, the Australians were struggling, but another good partnership between Langer and Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss.|$|E
25|$|On January 17, the Bulldogs went on {{the road}} to play Portland, whom they beat 71–49. Despite two early fouls on Olynyk in the first half, Gonzaga shot 46.6% from the field. Olynyk would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong second half to finish with 21 points, eight rebounds, one steal, and two blocks. The game {{extended}} Gonzaga's best start in school history with an eight-game winning streak. Two days later, they would travel to Hinkle Fieldhouse to play a non-conference game at #13 Butler {{as a part of the}} debut game of ESPN's College GameDay for the 2013 college basketball season. Gonzaga was ahead 33–32 at halftime, but Butler scored the first five points of the second half to take the lead. Ahead 63–62 with 3.5 seconds left, Stockton threw the ball inbounds and watched as it was stolen by Butler sophomore Roosevelt Jones, who took the buzzer beater shot to give Butler the 64–63 win. The team would recover and return home from their second loss of the season on January 24 by beating BYU 83–63. Olynyk scored 26 points on 9-for-9 shooting and was also 8-for-8 on free throws. The Zags won the rebound battle 37–29 and outscored BYU 42–28 in the paint while shooting 56.9% from the field.|$|E

25|$|The Stanley Cup Finals {{were against}} the Edmonton Oilers, {{the first time}} in NHL history that two former WHA franchises had played against one another in the finals. The Hurricanes rallied from a 3–0 deficit in Game 1 to win 5–4 after Rod Brind'Amour scored with 30 seconds left. In Game 2, the Hurricanes shelled the Oilers 5–0 to take a two-game lead. The Oilers won Game 3 in Edmonton, 2–1, as Ryan Smyth scored the game-winning goal with 2:47 left to play. Carolina rebounded in Game 4 with a 2–1 victory, and came home with a chance to win the Cup on home ice. However, Game 5 saw the Oilers <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{stunning}} 4–3 overtime win on a shorthanded breakaway by Fernando Pisani. In Game 6 in Edmonton, Carolina was soundly defeated 4–0; the only bright point for the Hurricanes was the return of forward Erik Cole from a broken neck that had sidelined him since March. In Game 7, before the second-largest home crowd in franchise history (18,978), the Hurricanes won 3–1, sealing the Hurricanes' first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history. Ward was honored with the Conn Smythe Trophy for the playoffs' most valuable player, becoming just the fourth rookie to be honored with the award. Several Hurricanes raised the Cup for {{the first time in}} their long NHL careers; Rod Brind'Amour and Bret Hedican had both played over 15 years without winning the Cup, while Glen Wesley – the last remaining Hartford Whaler on the Hurricanes' roster – had waited 18 seasons.|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, Cash and Vivian {{moved to}} Memphis, Tennessee, where he sold {{appliances}} while {{studying to be}} a radio announcer. At night he played with guitarist Luther Perkins and bassist Marshall Grant. Perkins and Grant were known as the Tennessee Two. Cash worked up the courage to visit the Sun Records studio, hoping to get a recording contract. He auditioned for Sam Phillips by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music. It was once rumored that Phillips told Cash to [...] "go home and sin, then <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> song I can sell", although in a 2002 interview Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment. Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, [...] "Hey Porter" [...] and [...] "Cry! Cry! Cry!", which were released in late June and met with success on the country hit parade.|$|E
