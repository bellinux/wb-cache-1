2500|$|Medical residencies {{traditionally}} require lengthy {{hours of}} their trainees. Early residents literally resided at the hospitals, often working in unpaid positions during their education. During this time, a resident might always be [...] "on call" [...] or share that duty {{with just one}} other practitioner. More recently, 36-hour shifts were separated by 12 hours of rest, during 100+ hour weeks. [...] The American public, and the medical education establishment, recognized that such long hours were counter-productive, since sleep deprivation increases rates of medical errors. [...] This was noted in a landmark study {{on the effects of}} sleep deprivation and error rate in an Intensive-care unit. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly (averaged over 4 weeks), overnight <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> to no more than one overnight every third day, and 10 hours off between shifts. Still, a review committee may grant exceptions for up to 10%, or a maximum of 88 hours, to individual programs. Until early 2017, duty periods for postgraduate year 1 could not exceed 16 hours per day, while postgraduate year 2 residents and in those in subsequent years can have duty periods up to a maximum of 24 hours of continuous duty. After early 2017, all years of residents may work up to 24 hour shifts. While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for the purposes of accreditation, though lack of adherence to hour restrictions is not uncommon.|$|E

5000|$|A {{somewhat}} analogous {{system has}} been reported in horseshoe bats, in which echolocation <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> appears to be a magic trait. In these bats, the constant frequency component of the call not only determines prey size but may also function in aspects of social communication. Work from one species, the large-eared horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus philippinensis), shows that abrupt changes in <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> among sympatric morphs is correlated with reproductive isolation. A further well-studied circumstance of sympatric speciation is when insects feed on more than one species of host plant. In this case insects become specialized as they struggle to overcome the various plants' defense mechanisms. (Drès and Mallet, 2002) ...|$|E

50|$|A {{behavioral}} {{study conducted}} by Puechmaille et. al. (2014) revealed that the peak frequencies of echolocation calls emitted by male and female Rhinolophus mehelyi accurately reflect their body size and condition. In the experiment, larger males proved to have higher call frequencies that attracted females twice as often as males with lower call frequencies. In contrast, males appeared to choose females at random. This distinction suggests that females choose males based on their <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> for the indirect benefits of having healthier and fitter offspring. The mating system is therefore comparable to a lek, making female mate choice a selection factor {{in the evolution of}} <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> in males that may counter other selection pressures imposed by their ecological niche.|$|E

50|$|The {{specificity}} of the auditory system {{is proportional to}} the range of frequencies found in the resting <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> (RF) of the bat. Therefore, the narrow range of frequencies found within the RF of a CF bat is reflected in the sharp sensitivity of the auditory system (the auditory fovea).|$|E
50|$|There are {{at least}} nine {{separate}} blue whale acoustic populations worldwide. Over the last 50 years blue whales have changed {{the way they are}} singing.

30|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>call</b> <b>frequencies</b> showed a cline between both subregions {{to the lower}} southern area of the Peninsula, just around the Isthmus of Kra. High <b>call</b> <b>frequencies</b> (≥ 75 kHz) {{were found to have}} a southern limit at Ranong province while lower <b>call</b> <b>frequencies</b> (≤ 71 kHz) were found to have their northern limit at Chumphon province. In Ranong, both high and low frequencies were recorded. However, the high frequencies recorded from north of the Isthmus of Kra (Ranong, Prachuap Kiri Khan and Phetchaburi) were not supported by morphology and genetic data as belonging to the Indochinese subregion but grouped with material from the Sundaic subregion. This highlights the general need for examination of morphological and genetic data in tandem with echolocation call data.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the echo frequency around a constant value for optimal hearing, the bat must dynamically modulate the frequency of the pulses it emits. This is done rapidly in the naturally behaving animal, and is accomplished by making a series of small changes to the <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> upon receiving auditory feedback {{in the form of an}} echo. [...] These small changes are produced between, not within, calls. [...] The bat produces a call, listens for the returning echo, and makes a small, step-wise adjustment in the frequency of its next pulse. [...] By making small changes to the frequency of each call, and increasing the overall rate of pulses produced, the bat is able to rapidly attend to ongoing auditory feedback and use that information to accurately stabilize the echo frequency around a constant value. [...] Making large changes in <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> without increasing the call rate leads to a risk that the bat will overcompensate for the Doppler shift, which will also result in the echoes falling outside of the auditory fovea. [...] By making a series of small, rapid changes to <b>call</b> <b>frequency,</b> the Doppler shift can be acutely compensated for, without the echo frequency falling outside of the acoustic fovea. [...] This mechanism of feedback control ultimately optimizes speed, accuracy, and overall stability of the DSC in the animal’s natural context.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{work has}} {{revealed}} that the parabrachial nuclei (PB), a different region of the midbrain, is the neural substrate for DSC and auditory feedback regulation of pulse frequency. [...] When neurons of the PB are inhibited via exogenous drug administration (e.g. using muscimol, the GABAA agonist, or CNQX, an AMPA antagonist), the pulse frequencies emitted at rest and in flight (during DSC) were lowered. [...] Conversely, when the area was excited via exogenous drug administration (e.g. using BMI, the GABAA antagonist, or AMPA to cause excitation), the resting <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> was increased, {{and there was a}} severely reduced or completely abolished response to auditory feedback of increased frequency. [...] The magnitude and specificity of these results suggest that the PB is directly involved in the integration of auditory and vocal stimuli, and is involved in neural regulation of <b>call</b> <b>frequency,</b> because manipulations in the area drastically affected pulse frequency. [...] This is suggestive of a midbrain network of control of call parameters, that functions in parallel to and independently of cortical control of pulse parameters.|$|E
50|$|Advantages, As with a {{heterodyne}} detector, an FD detector {{works in}} real time {{with or without a}} heterodyne function. Bat calls can be heard in their entirety over their whole range rather than over a limited frequency range. Retuning with an FD detector is not required although this is done with a dual type with heterodyne. By analysing the recording later, the entire <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> range and the call pattern can be measured.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{processes}} that are commonly used to achieve the conversion: second harmonic generation (SHG, also <b>called</b> <b>frequency</b> doubling), or sum frequency generation which sums two non-similar frequencies. Direct third harmonic generation (THG, also <b>called</b> <b>frequency</b> tripling) also exists {{and can be used}} to detect an interface between materials of different excitability. For example, it has been used to extract the outline of cells in embryos, where the cells are separated by water.|$|R
50|$|In {{some parts}} of the UK the band is little utilised, while in others, notably Belfast, Bristol, South and Mid Wales, North London and Hertfordshire, there is {{extensive}} local FM operation. There is considerable AM activity in the Dublin area. As band occupancy is relatively low, FM operation tends to take place on the <b>calling</b> <b>frequency,</b> 70.450 MHz, and AM operation on that <b>calling</b> <b>frequency,</b> 70.260 MHz. In the UK, the band is also used considerably for emergency communications, Internet Radio Linking Project links (IRLP), data links and low powered remote control.|$|R
50|$|Use of some {{distress}} frequencies is permitted for calling other stations to establish contact, whereupon the stations {{move to another}} frequency. Such channels are known as distress, safety and <b>calling</b> <b>frequencies.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{distinguish}} between P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus, if a call is around 45 kHz it is a Common Pipistrelle and around 55 kHz it is a Soprano. The rare P. nathusii calls at around 39 kHz {{and so is}} easier to distinguish. The {{problem is that there}} seems to be an almost continuous spectrum of Pip frequencies from 43 kHz to 59 kHz. More studies need to be done on the <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> ranges of each species.|$|E
50|$|When an echolocating bat {{approaches}} a target, its outgoing sounds return as echoes, which are Doppler shifted upward in frequency. In certain species of bats, which produce constant frequency (CF) echolocation calls, the bats {{compensate for the}} Doppler shift by lowering their <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> as they approach a target. This keeps the returning echo in the same frequency range of the normal echolocation call. This dynamic frequency modulation is called the Doppler Shift Compensation (DSC), and was discovered by Hans Schnitzler in 1968.|$|E
50|$|Bat call {{frequencies}} {{range from}} {{as low as}} 11 kHz to as high as 212 kHz. Insectivorous aerial-hawking bats have a <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> between 20 kHz and 60 kHz {{because it is the}} frequency that gives the best range and image acuity and makes them less conspicuous to insects. However, low frequencies are adaptive for some species with different prey and environments. Euderma maculatum, a species that feeds on moths, uses a particularly low frequency of 12.7 kHz that cannot be heard by moths.|$|E
50|$|The power {{utilities}} {{are able to}} predict to a reasonable accuracy (generally to within one or two percent) the demand pattern throughout any particular day. This means that the free market in electricity is able to schedule just enough base load in advance. Any remaining imbalance would then be due either to inaccuracies in the prediction, or unscheduled changes in supply (such as a power station fault) and/or demand. Such imbalances are removed by requesting generators to operate in so <b>called</b> <b>frequency</b> response mode (also <b>called</b> <b>frequency</b> control mode), altering their output continuously to keep the frequency near the required value.|$|R
50|$|Cumulative {{frequency}} analysis is {{the analysis of}} the frequency of occurrence of values of a phenomenon less than a reference value. The phenomenon may be time- or space-dependent. Cumulative <b>frequency</b> is also <b>called</b> <b>frequency</b> of non-exceedance.|$|R
