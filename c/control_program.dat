40|$|Abstract — Many {{networked}} systems today, {{ranging from}} home automation networks to global wide-area net-works, are operated using centralized <b>control</b> <b>programs.</b> Bugs in such programs pose serious risks to system secu-rity and stability. We {{develop a new}} technique to system-atically explore the behavior of <b>control</b> <b>programs.</b> Be-cause <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> depend intimately on absolute and relative timing of inputs, a key challenge that we face is to systematically handle time. We develop an approach that models programs as timed automata and incorporates novel mechanisms to enable scalable and comprehensive exploration. We implement our approach in a tool called DeLorean {{and apply it to}} real <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> for home automation and software-defined net-works. DeLorean is able to finds bugs in these programs as well as provide significantly better code coverage—up to 94 % compared to 76 % for existing techniques. ...|$|R
5|$|Because {{microcomputers}} in Japan {{were not}} powerful enough {{at the time}} to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming Space Invaders, Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game. He created the arcade board using new microprocessors from the United States. The game uses an Intel 8080 central processing unit, features raster graphics on a CRT monitor and monaural sound hosted by a combination of analog circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. Despite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted—the <b>Control</b> <b>Program</b> board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster—and he considered the development of the hardware {{the most difficult part of}} the whole process. While programming the game, Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render the alien graphics faster the fewer were on screen. Rather than design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he decided to keep it as a challenging gameplay mechanism.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} synthesizing <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> for a {{distributed}} system controlling a batch production plant. We present a timed automata model of a production plant. This model aims at faithfully reflecting the level of abstraction required for synthesizing <b>control</b> <b>programs,</b> therefore it quickly becomes too detailed and complicated for automatic synthesis. To solve this problem we present a general way of adding guidance to a model by augmenting it with additional guidance variables and decorate transitions with extra guards. Applying this technique have made synthesis of <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> feasible for a plant producing as many as 35 batches. In comparison, we could only handle plants producing two batches without using guides. The synthesized <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> were executed in the plant. By doing so we found and corrected some errors in the model. Keywords: real-time verification, guided model-checking, scheduling, program synthesis, distributed systems. 1 Intro [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to allay public fears and {{to reduce the risk}} of shark attack, the state {{government}} of Hawaii spent over $ 300, 000 on shark <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> between 1959 and 1976. Six <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> of various intensity resulted in the killing of 4, 668 sharks at an average cost of $ 182 per shark. The programs furnished information on diet, reproduction, and distribution of sharks in Hawaii, but research efforts of the programs had a number of shortcomings. Analysis of the biological data gathered was not directed toward the tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvier (Peron & LeSueur), which is responsible for most attacks in Hawaii. Reliable estimates of shark populations in Hawaii cannot be made based on catch data from <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> because of sampling biases. Most of the information gained from the <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> was not published in reviewed journals and is not readily available to the scientific community. The ability of the <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> to reduce shark populations and to remove large sharks from coastal waters appears to have been stated with more confidence than is warranted, considering seasonal changes observed in shark abundance and variable fishing effort. Shark <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> do not appear to have had measurable effects on the rate of shark attacks in Hawaiian waters. Implementation of large-scale <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> in the future in Hawaii may not be appropriate. Increased understanding of the behavior and biology of target species is necessary for evaluation of the effectiveness of small-scale control efforts, such as selective fishing after an attack. Acoustic telemetry, conventional tagging, and studies on population dynamics concentrating primarily on the tiger shark may be used to obtain data about activity patterns, distribution, and population parameters, providing information useful for reducing the risk of shark attack in Hawaii and elsewhere...|$|R
