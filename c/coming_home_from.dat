25|$|One Folgers {{television}} ad from 1985 became particularly {{associated with}} the Christmas holidays. A student named Peter returns home from college, the smell of freshly brewed coffee awakening his parents and alerting them to their son's arrival. The Cunningham & Walsh spot aired yearly until 1998, then in edited form in 2004 and 2005. In 2009, a similar theme was employed, a son <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> West Africa and {{waking up to the}} smell of coffee.|$|E
25|$|Right after <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> {{the festival}} the ladies {{walked into the}} {{rehearsal}} room of their friends and selected their instruments.

Mari Halonen became the guitar player and lead vocalist, being {{the only one with}} any previous musical experience – on violin.|$|E
25|$|Remington Rand was a {{potential}} sponsor during the show's conception and counseled against the show's suggested title, Wally and the Beaver, believing viewers would think the show was a nature program. The show was ultimately sponsored by Ralston Purina, with General Electric (the GE logo was clearly visible on all kitchen appliances) and Chrysler Corporation sponsoring the later seasons (Ward Cleaver was often seen driving the newest Plymouth Fury during the opening credits or <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work, starting in Season 3.

25|$|The poem {{is about}} a local blacksmith. Noted as being strong, he works by the sweat of his brow and does not owe anyone anything.

On Sundays, the blacksmith, a single father {{after the death of his}} wife, takes his children to church, where his daughter sings in the choir. He goes through his life following the daily tasks assigned to him and has earned his sleep at night. The narrator concludes by thanking the blacksmith for the lessons he can teach.|$|E
25|$|When the Taliban {{emerged in}} the mid-1990s, Karzai {{initially}} recognized them as a legitimate government because he thought that they would stop the violence and corruption in his country. He was requested by the Taliban to serve as their ambassador but he refused, telling friends that he felt Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was wrongly using them. He lived in the Pakistani city of Quetta among the Afghan refugees, where he worked to reinstate former Afghan King Zahir Shah. In July 1999, Karzai's father, Abdul Ahad Karzai, was gunned down {{early in the morning}} while <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> a mosque in the city of Quetta. Reports suggest that the Taliban carried out the assassination. Following this incident, Karzai decided to work closely with the Northern Alliance, which was led by Ahmad Shah Massoud.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Make Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Matt Barnes. The clip premiered on March 9, 2009 {{and served as a}} viral commercial for In a Perfect World...

Hilson said that the opening scene of her entering her apartment represents her <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the studio on a normal day.

500|$|Many years later, {{another of}} his followers, Virginia Downsborough, {{recalled}} that during the mid-1960s he [...] "talked a lot about Sara Northrup and {{seemed to want to}} make sure that I knew he had never married her. I didn't know why it was so important to him; I'd never met Sara and I couldn't have cared less, but he wanted to persuade me that the marriage had never taken place. When he talked about his first wife, the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them." [...] As Downsborough put it, he portrayed himself as [...] "a constant victim of women".|$|E

[...] "I'd basically gone from being the guy in Fall Out Boy to being the guy who, like, hangs out all day," [...] Wentz recalled. Previously known as the [...] "overexposed, despised" [...] leader of the band, Wentz [...] "simply grew up," [...] sharing custody of his son and embracing maturity: [...] "There was a jump-cut in my life.

The three rooms are shown behind a department store window, outside which a crowd of observers form. At the end of the video, Lohan stands behind the glass and photographs of memories fly up onto it, from which she breaks out. As a response to the video, Lindsay's father {{wrote a letter to the}} New York Daily News, saying, [...] "while I always considered and expressed how truly blessed Lindsay, as well as my other children are, I never realized how blessed I am to have a daughter as amazing as Lindsay. Hold onto my shirt honey, soon enough you'll be able to hold on to me!" ...|$|E

500|$|While Hemingway {{painstakingly}} describes seemingly extraneous minutiae from Nick's fishing trip, he avoids or barely {{hints at}} {{the driving force of}} the work: the emotional turmoil wrought on Nick by his return home from a catastrophic war. Hemingway has said he believes this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute, writing [...] "'Big Two-Hearted River' is about a boy beat to the wide <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the war.... beat to the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat, since those who had been were unable to comment on this condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence. So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war is omitted." [...] Flora believes that in [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] the concept of the iceberg theory is more evident than in any other piece written by Hemingway.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{released}} his fourth full-length solo album Shadows Collide with People on February 24, 2004. This featured guest appearances {{from some of}} his friends, including Klinghoffer, and Chili Peppers bandmates Smith and Flea. In June 2004, {{he announced that he}} would be releasing six records over six months: The Will to Death, Ataxia's Automatic Writing, DC EP, Inside of Emptiness, A Sphere in the Heart of Silence and Curtains. With the release of Curtains Frusciante debuted his only music video of 2004, for the track [...] "The Past Recedes". He wanted to produce these records quickly and inexpensively on analog tape, avoiding modern studio and computer-assisted recording processes. Frusciante noted, [...] "These six records were recorded in a period of six months after <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> touring with the Chili Peppers for one-and-a-half years. I made {{a list of all the}} songs I had and they totaled about seventy. My objective was to record as many songs as I could during the break that I had. In the midst of doing that, I was writing some of my best songs, so some of these albums have as many new songs as old songs. It was definitely the most productive time of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the music}} on Eat a Peach that was {{recorded}} after Duane's death directly dealt with the tragedy. [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More" [...] was written by Gregg Allman for his brother, Duane, immediately following his death. The song was composed on an 110-year-old Steinway piano in Studio D of Criteria. [...] "Ain't Wastin'" [...] was composed when Duane was still alive, but the lyrics deal with his passing, as well as veterans <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the Vietnam War. The song relates to the theme that [...] "death is an inescapable inevitability — that every day is precious." [...] "Les Brers in A Minor" [...] is an instrumental penned by Dickey Betts, and its title is [...] "bad French" [...] for [...] "less brothers." [...] When writing the song, all in the band felt something was familiar about the song; {{it turned out to}} be a solo of Betts's from live renditions of [...] "Whipping Post." [...] It resurfaced many years later on a bootleg recording. [...] "Les Brers" [...] began recording in the newly constructed Studio C of the recording complex at Criteria, but the band disliked the sound captured in the room and moved to Studio A. As a result, the recording contains a slight pitch variation due to the difficulty of matching the original speed of the instruments when the intro was spliced onto the master tape.|$|E

500|$|Six Feet Under Episode 16, of Season 2, [...] "The Plan", {{featured}} a seminar-delivery organization called [...] "The Plan", which the character Claire Fisher immediately compared to est. [...] Actress Alice Krige portrays [...] "Alma" [...] the seminar leader of [...] "The Plan" [...] - who uses jargon {{related to the}} [...] "blueprint" [...] for building a house in order to convey concepts about self-improvement. [...] She singles out the character Ruth and berates her for [...] "tiptoeing around her own house like she's afraid of waking someone up." [...] Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversations with family, and complains to her daughter that she cannot yet go to sleep after <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> her seminar because she must first do [...] "homework" [...] from the course. This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for [...] "all the terrible things she did to me", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will [...] "renovate" [...] her life. [...] During the following day of [...] "The Plan", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to [...] "renovate their homes" [...] together. [...] In the seminar, the leader asks everyone to close their eyes and imagine that everyone else is laughing at them for being stupid, and then asks the participants if they get the joke. Everyone does, except Ruth, who rants at the course instructor. After her rant, the leader congratulates her for [...] "knocking down her old house", and proceeds {{to tell her that}} now she can rebuild a new house.|$|E

50|$|Growler’s fifth, sixth, {{and seventh}} patrols, out of Brisbane to the Bismarck-Solomons area, were {{relatively}} uneventful, heavy enemy air cover {{and a lack}} of targets resulted in her <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> empty-handed <b>from</b> all but the fifth, on which she sank the passenger/cargo ship Miyadono Maru. The seventh patrol was marred by trouble with the storage battery and generators, and on 27 October 1943, only 11 days out of Brisbane, she was ordered to Pearl Harbor (arriving 7 November) and from there to the Navy Yard at Hunter's Point, California, for an extensive overhaul and refitting.|$|R
60|$|I lived well enough, {{and pleased}} my master {{so well that}} he called me his own boy; and I would have called him father, {{but he would not}} allow it, for he had {{children}} of his own.
