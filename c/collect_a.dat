5|$|Although the Inaccessible Island rail {{may have}} been known to the Tristan Islanders who visited the island {{annually}} to hunt seals, the species first {{came to the attention of}} scientists during the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876. When the expedition visited the island in October 1873, Sir Charles Wyville Thomson learned of the species and recorded observations made by two German brothers, the Stoltenhoffs, who had been living on the island for the last two years. Thomson was unable to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> specimen, much to his regret.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite {{believed}} in the ancient astronaut hypothesis, which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity {{in the past and}} placed humans on Earth and would return to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> select few. Parts of this teaching bear similarities to the Reformed Christian concept of election, likely owing to Applewhite's Presbyterian upbringing. He often discussed extraterrestrials using phrases from Star Trek and stated that aliens communicated with him through the show.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, McBride {{had made}} {{his way through the}} minor leagues to the Cardinals' Class AA {{affiliate}} in Little Rock. Though he was successful there and he received a promotion to the Class AAA team in Tulsa, he was initially hesitant to report there, wondering whether he was ready for Class AAA baseball. In his first at bat at the Class AAA level, McBride hit a ball off of the outfield wall and seemed to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> triple, but he was called out for failing to touch second base.|$|E

5|$|Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low {{with his}} daughter. The {{loss of his}} wife had a {{profound}} effect on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to press-gang married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> shipment of logs for resale in Boston.|$|E
5|$|Most modern breweries use a {{continuous}} sparge, collecting the original wort and the sparge water together. However, {{it is possible}} to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches. Each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer. This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the game's {{mechanisms}} for contacting players grew more complex. Players were sent messages via email, called on their cell phones, and travelled to arranged meetings between players and characters. The game culminated by inviting {{players of the}} game to visit one of four cinemas where they could {{get a chance to}} play Halo 2 before its release and <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> commemorative DVD.|$|E

5|$|Poe had {{intended}} to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> number of his early short stories into a volume titled Tales of the Folio Club in the 1830s. The collection would be unified {{as a series of}} tales presented by members of a literary club designed as burlesques of contemporary literary criticism. Poe had previously printed several of these stories in the Philadelphia Saturday Courier and the Baltimore Saturday Visiter.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{historian}} Rafał Jaworski {{states that}} the estimates {{of the size of}} Bolesław's army range between 2,000–5,000 Polish warriors, in addition to Thietmar's reported 1,000Pechenegs, 300German knights, and 500Hungarian mercenaries. Less is known about Yaroslav's army, but it is assumed that he managed to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> force of similar size. It is also believed that he was aware of Bolesław's intentions and had time to make defensive preparations.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of bonus levels, both {{containing}} only pods, not full-sized spheres. One bonus level has yellow and blue pods, both of which can be collected, but only blue pods earn points. <b>Collecting</b> <b>a</b> blue pod causes a yellow pod to turn blue. Another bonus level has blue and red pods. <b>Collecting</b> <b>a</b> blue pod earns points, while <b>collecting</b> <b>a</b> red pod ends the bonus level immediately. There are also hidden bonuses available during the game; for example, completing a level by not rotating right earns extra bonus points.|$|R
5|$|The Ama are Japanese skin divers, {{predominantly}} women, who traditionally {{dive for}} shellfish and seaweed {{wearing only a}} loincloth and {{who have been in}} action for at least 2,000 years. Starting in the twentieth century, they have increasingly been regarded as a tourist attraction. They operate off reefs near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> harvest. They have been romanticized as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|Union troops {{continued}} {{to organize and}} train at military camps in the city, as battles in Kentucky and Tennessee caused major changes to Indianapolis. After the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, the Union began to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> large number of Confederate prisoners of war for transport to the North. Governor Morton volunteered to hold some of the prisoners at Indianapolis. Designated as one of four northern prisoner-of-war camps, Camp Morton was converted {{into one of the}} Union's largest prisons for captured Confederate soldiers.|$|E
5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress the power to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also {{the ability to make}} laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had the power to tax, since it had the power to fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's rescission of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Another {{attempt was}} made to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> {{specimen}} by Lord Crawford on his yacht Valhalla in 1905. A final {{attempt was made}} during the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, which passed by in April 1922 on its way back to Britain. This visit also failed, but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then able to use the skins to describe the species. He did so, briefly, {{at a meeting of the}} British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} hotel, policemen Lobo and Lele kill three {{drug dealers and}} <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> guitar case {{containing}} cocaine, which they must deliver to drug lord Tashi. Charlie and his men invade the jockey's hotel room and take all his possessions. The ensuing chase leads to the hotel car park where Lobo and Lele are placing the guitar case in their van. Charlie and his men seize the van {{to escape from the}} jockey's men and realise they had stolen a police vehicle, whilst also discovering the cocaine, which Charlie steals to sell. The policemen, upon returning, discover that the cocaine is missing and set out to find Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E

5|$|Environmental impact studies {{began on}} the part of SR 125 south of SR 54 in 1987. In 1990, Caltrans {{proposed}} building the southern portion as a toll road, operated by private firms; California Transportation Ventures (CTV) and PrivaCAL both applied for the role. In September, state officials approved this proposal, which was expected to cost $400 million. In the 1991 agreement, Caltrans agreed not to build more than one high-occupancy vehicle lane in each direction on I-805 to reduce competition from SR 125. CTV soon declared that they would be considering many potential routings for the road, including some that Caltrans had declined. The next year, while the company hoped to start the environmental impact study, objections were raised about increased pollution and traffic from the road, as well as the part of the franchise agreement that would allow for the company to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> settlement if SR 905 was constructed with more than six lanes, since it would compete with the proposed toll road.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{guilty about}} her {{deception}} and concerned for the Flanders' safety, Marge goes {{to check on}} them at their new house. There, she tells them {{the truth about the}} murders, but they are not annoyed. Ned and Maude are pleased {{to be a part of}} Springfield's history, and refuse Marge's offer of returning the deposit. Unfortunately, the house is destroyed seconds later when Li'l Bandit and Wiggum's police car crash through the house. Marge returns Flanders' down payment. Hutz, annoyed at the damage costs and especially by the return of the money, fires Marge. At the end of the episode, Homer takes Marge to the government unemployment office to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> welfare check.|$|E
5|$|In , a new {{collectible}} item {{known as}} mini medals, resembling small gold coins with a five-pointed {{star in the}} middle, was introduced; {{they have nothing to}} do with winning the game, but they can be traded with a certain character for items. Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not want to repeat the necessity for players having to <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> certain number of them before they could complete the game.|$|E
