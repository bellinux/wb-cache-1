5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are moving across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt.</b> The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the costs associated with}} staff, Minnesota lost some revenue during the shutdown. The Minnesota State Lottery did not sell tickets during the shutdown, which meant the state could have lost about $1.25 million in revenue daily. Minnesota stopped selling tax stamps for cigarettes, which must be affixed to each pack before sale. The Star Tribune reported that cigarette sales would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> by mid-August if no more tax stamps were issued. The state also stopped issuing liquor purchasing cards, which businesses need in order to purchase liquor from wholesalers. Many stores, bars, and restaurants renewed their liquor purchasing cards before the shutdown. However, the purchasing cards for approximately three hundred establishments expired {{on the first day of}} the shutdown, July 1. Liquor purchasing cards would have continued to expire on the first day of each month. Alcohol brand licenses expired, so MillerCoors lost their license to sell 39 brands of beer in Minnesota, and had to have them removed from shelves.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph {{had not yet been}} invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E

5|$|To build {{a working}} nuclear reactor, the Montreal Laboratory {{depended}} on the Americans for heavy water from Trail, which was under American contract, {{but this was not}} forthcoming. An American request for Halban to come to New York to discuss heavy water with Fermi and Urey was turned down by the British, and the Americans brought cooperation to a standstill. By June 1943 work at the Montreal Lab had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt.</b> Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. The British government seriously considered going it alone on developing nuclear weapons, despite the cost and the expected length of the project. In August 1943, Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King hosted the Quebec Conference, at which Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt came together, and agreed to resume cooperation. The Quebec Agreement subsumed Tube Alloys into the Manhattan Project, and established the Combined Policy Committee, on which Canada was represented by Howe, to control the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Throughout July, the battalion's {{companies}} were detached to support individual Australian brigades during the First Battle of El Alamein as the Allied forces– which had, {{since the beginning}} of the year, been steadily pushed back by the German and Italian forces– fought desperately to stop the German advance east towards Cairo. Supporting the infantry battalions fighting around Tel el Eisa in early July, several of the battalion's crews played significant roles in turning back attacks on the Australian positions, and in concert with divisional artillery were reported to have inflicted heavy casualties upon the German and Italian soldiers. Later, in the middle of the month, they supported an attack by the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion, now commanded by the 2/2nd's old commander, Whitehead, around Makh Khad Ridge to the right of the Qattara Track. By the end of the month the offensive had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> and during the lull that followed the battalion provided defensive fire from depth positions. In October, it joined the second Allied counter-attack that was launched during the Second Battle of El Alamein. During these battles, the battalion was heavily engaged, with a company supporting a composite force under Whitehead, and another operating in support of the 24th Brigade. Its casualties amounted to 21 killed, 128 wounded and 26 captured.|$|E
5|$|German {{forces had}} started gradual {{withdrawal}} to northernmost Finland in early September 1944 in Operation Birke. As {{the value of}} Petsamo region had decreased, the Germans decided in early October 1944 to abandon Finland and most of northern Norway and had begun Operation Nordlicht (Northern Light), a retreat into prepared positions at Lyngen in northern Norway. Operation Nordlicht {{had come to an}} end at the beginning of January 1945, with only a few miles of Finnish territory remaining in German hands, and several isolated garrisons in Norwegian Finnmark. Soviet forces occupied eastern Finnmark, and the USSR asked that Western Allied forces be landed to support them. Only a single company of Norwegian mountain infantry could be spared for this duty, though the British and Norwegian governments provided food supplies for the civilian population in the area. Due to the failure of the recent offensive in the Ardennes and the fact that several new types of U-Boat were ready to be deployed, the German positions in Norway became of great value to Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Naval High Command as a way to continue submarine warfare against the Allies. They also were to Adolf Hitler, who denied requests from General Heinz Guderian that divisions should be withdrawn from Norway for use in the defence of Germany, and from Böhme in March that northern Norway should be abandoned and that construction of submarine pens should <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> due to lack of materials. He feared that any withdrawal might tempt neutral Sweden to enter the war in support of the Allies, and that any withdrawal from northern Norway would endanger U-Boat bases in the southern parts of the country. Until {{the last days of the}} war, Dönitz believed that Norway should be kept in order to deploy submarines against Allied vessels, and on 3 May the Kriegsmarine Naval Warfare Command informed U-Boat staff that even if Germany itself were occupied, submarines would still sail from Norway. Only on 4 May were orders issued by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht that all German troops in Norway were to avoid actions that might provoke Allied forces.|$|E

25|$|Pigment used in {{paintings}} were imported from Fukien {{and used in}} textile dyeing. To achieve the color white, ground chalk or powdered shells were used. Other colors were achieved using cochineal, vermilion, arsenic, and sulphur. Some patterns can use up to 18 different color applications. After the kingdom was under Japanese rule, the Okinawans could no longer trade for these pigments and sought new ways to continue with their painting.

25|$|The {{first serious}} armed {{conflict}} {{of the war}} took place on February 14. While Soviet units retreated without a fight {{from the town of}} Mosty, fighting erupted near the towns of Maniewicze and Bereza Kartuska in Belarus. By late February the Bolshevik offensive had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt,</b> and it had become apparent that the Red Army would not break through the Polish lines with half-hearted attacks. On 27 February 1919 the Soviets proclaimed the creation of the Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Both Polish and Soviet forces had also been engaged with the Ukrainian forces (Polish–Ukrainian War). Active fighting {{was going on in the}} territories of Baltic countries (Lithuanian Wars of Independence, Latvian War of Independence and Estonian War of Independence). Further escalation of the conflict seemed inevitable.|$|E
25|$|However, as the Allied forces {{advanced}} rapidly into German-held territory {{following the}} Normandy landings, Metz {{became an important}} location for the German command to organize its defenses and attempt to contain the Allied advance. By the end of August 1944, German forces in Lorraine had managed to reestablish a defensive line and the U.S. Third Army had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> in face of the German defenses, resulting in a brief pause of operations {{in this area of}} the western front. According to an order issued by Hitler in March 1944, fortress commanders were ordered to allow their forts to be surrounded if necessary and hold them, surrendering only with Hitler's approval. Metz was required to follow this order by early September, since the U.S. Third Army led by General George S. Patton had reached Verdun and was posing a threat to the Sarre region of Germany. The German command intended to obtain more time for the strengthening of the West Wall through this strategy. The defense was undertaken by the German First Army, commanded by General Otto von Knobelsdorff. The number of German troops positioned in the vicinity of Metz was equivalent to four and a half divisions.|$|E

25|$|As {{the green}} light signalled {{the start of the}} race, Hill and Schumacher both made brisk starts and led into Sainte Dévote, but behind them a {{multiple}} collision between Coulthard and the two Ferraris caused the race to be red-flagged to a halt. Coulthard was slightly slower away from the line and was challenged {{on the outside of the}} run to the first corner by Berger, and on the inside by Alesi. As the track narrowed at the entry to Sainte Devote, there was not enough space for the three cars to run side-by-side, and Alesi made contact with the rear-right quarter of Coulthard's car, which in turn pushed it into Berger. The Williams was launched up into the air and spun through 180 degrees before crashing down again and coming to a halt at the apex of the corner with broken suspension, whilst the two damaged Ferraris also made further contact with each other before coming to rest at the same point. Most of the pursuing drivers, led by Brundle, threaded their way through the stationary cars, but Irvine knocked off his front wing, Boullion sustained a broken diffuser, and Katayama, Salo, Morbidelli, Inoue and Schiattarella were all forced to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> as they negotiated the obstacles. With the track now completely blocked, the race was halted and preparations were immediately made for a completely fresh start.|$|E
25|$|In , Senna {{became the}} {{youngest}} ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing his pole position record to 60 from 127 events. Prost, because of the downturn in performance at Ferrari, {{the likes of which}} littered the team's history, was no longer a serious competitor. In preseason testing, Senna made public misgivings about the car's competitiveness with the new Honda V12, stating that the engine was not as powerful as the prior year's V10. Senna won the first four races as his rivals struggled to match his pace and reliability. By midseason, Nigel Mansell in the Williams-Renault was able to put up a challenge. Before the Mexican Grand Prix, Senna was injured in a jet-skiing accident near São Paulo for which he required stitches {{on the back of his}} head. During qualifying for that Grand Prix, he attempted to take the banked 180-degree Peraltada corner (Mexico City circuit's fastest corner) faster than normal, ending up spinning off the track and rolling over the car after crashing into a tyre barrier. At the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Senna's car had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> on the final lap, but he was not left stranded out on the circuit, as race-winner Mansell pulled over on his parade lap and allowed the Brazilian to ride on the Williams side-pod back to the pits. During the Spanish Grand Prix, Senna and Mansell went wheel-to-wheel with only centimetres to spare, at over 320km/h (200mph) down the main straight, a race which the Briton eventually won.|$|E
25|$|Now {{left with}} only seven of his {{original}} jeeps, Farran pressed on, {{the remainder of the}} troopers strafing a passing goods train, puncturing the boiler on its engine and forcing it to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt.</b> Eventually they linked up with Grant-Hibbert's men after one final encounter during their journey, assaulting a German radar station and causing the German garrison to flee; prisoners informed the SAS troopers that they believed the jeeps to be the advance guard of General George S. Patton's United States Third Army. Farran took command of the combined group, which consisted of a composite squadron of 60 troopers, 10 jeeps and a civilian truck, and ordered it to move to another base to avoid further German scrutiny. The squadron roamed around until the end of August, assaulting German troop convoys and facilities, and then split into three groups to maximise the area they could cover and the damage that could be dealt to the German forces. Throughout their entire time behind German lines they were supplied by the Royal Air Force in 36 sorties, which supplied by the SAS with 12 new jeeps and 36 supply panniers. Operation Wallace came to an end on 17 September, when the groups linked up with advance elements of the United States Seventh Army; during the month they had been active, Farran and his men had caused more than 500 German casualties, destroyed some 95 enemy vehicles and more than 100,000 gallons of petrol. 17 SAS troopers had been lost, including one in a parachuting accident, as well as 16 jeeps. After linking up with the American forces, Farran sent the squadron back to Paris and granted it a week's leave in the capital, despite it officially being out of bounds to all British troops. As a result of these actions, Farran was awarded a Distinguished Service Order, which unusually was awarded under the pseudonym of 'Patrick McGinty'; Farran had used the name since his escape from German captivity in 1941, and claimed that the name was a reference to an Irish song.|$|E
