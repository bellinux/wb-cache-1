5000|$|Edward Packard {{was born}} in 1843 at Saxmundham in Suffolk, the son of Edward Packard senior. He was educated at King's College, London and the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester. He joined his father in {{business}} as a dispensing chemist at Bramford in 1866, and was {{an active member of}} Dr. John Taylor's Ipswich Science-Gossip Society from the late 1860s. He received, accompanied and led the Society's inspection of the works in 1872. In that year, when the Packards patented a new type of highly <b>concentrated</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> the works covered four acres of land with a surrounding village of houses for employees, and 800 tons of superphosphates and other manures were being produced every week. He stated before the Ipswich Dock Commissioners that of 882 vessels clearing outwards of the Port of Ipswich in 1871, 425 were loaded by this firm.|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of applying fertilizers {{to the soil}} by adding the liquid form to the irrigation water is increasing in popularity. There are several advantages maintained for such a method of application. Some of the advantages are: (A) Ease of application (B) No special equipment is required for application. (C) The fertilizer can be applied at any stage of plant growth without physical disturbance of the plant. (D) Penetration into the root zone may be greater than the dry fertilizers. Considerable phosphate fertilizer is used on soils of irrigated regions. If the behavior of liquid phosphoric acid after its incorporation with soil is such that it penetrates into the root zone and is otherwise as efficient as dry phosphate fertilizers in inducing favorable plant response, then it would seem practical to utilize the other advantages offered by applying the fertilizer in irrigation water. Commercial phosphoric acid (52 % available P 2 O 5) is produced by applying an excess of sulfuric acid to ground rock phosphate. This phosphoric acid is usually applied to an additional amount of phosphate rock to make <b>concentrated</b> <b>superphosphate.</b> A given quantity of phosphoric acid can yield more available phosphorus by applying it to rock phosphate than by using it directly as a fertilizer. Because of its potential value in producing <b>concentrated</b> <b>superphosphate</b> commercial phosphoric acid has been used very little as a fertilizer. There is insufficient research in which the comparative value of the acid as a fertilizer has been investigated {{the purpose of the}} studies reported in this paper are, to compare: (A) the value of commercial phosphoric acid and <b>concentrated</b> <b>superphosphate</b> as fertilizers when applied in equivalent amounts and, (B) the different methods of application and dilution of the phosphoric acid...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relative availability of some of the phosphorus-bearing fertilizers sold in Nebraska. As one means of achieving this objective, a survey was made of the water-soluble phosphorus contained in mixed fertilizers sold on the Nebraska market. Water solubility was determined on several phosphatic fertilizer samples received by the State Department of Agriculture in its registration and inspection program. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the significance of water solubility in relation to residual fertilizer availability. Six dominant fertilizer mixes on the market, plus <b>concentrated</b> <b>superphosphate</b> and ammonium phosphate, were applied to four soils in a mixed and a banded placement. The soils ranged from very low to very high in phosphorus activity and from strongly acid to alkaline in soil reaction. Oats and subsequent crops of alfalfa were used as indicator crops. A second experiment was conducted in the field to determine maximum application rates permissible with drill placement. The six mixed fertilizers, plus <b>concentrated</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> were drilled with winter wheat on the Agronomy Farm. Rates of 25, 50, 100 and 200 pounds per acre of available phosphorus were applied. Counts of the germination were determined and moisture samples of the soil were taken one and two weeks after planting. Advisor: R. A. Olson...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 A great {{potential}} for increasing upland rice production exists in the savanna soils of Colombia. These vast areas are currently underutilized. However, they have good soil structure, flat topography, coupled with sufficient and well distributed rainfall, making savanna soils ideal for upland rice cropping system. The major constraints to upland rice production in these soils are their low fertility and lack of appropriate technology for their management. The basic concept is to alleviate or overcome soil constraints by planting rice cultivars to Al toxicity and low native fertility, and obtaining reasonable, but not necessarily the maximum yield obtained with lowland or paddy rice. Upland rice production systems were evaluated in representative savanna soils of CRI La Libertad, Llanos Orientales, Colombia, during the rainy seasons of 1983 and 1984. Cultivars such as Perola, Tox 1011 - 4 - 2, IAC 47, IAC 165, IRAT 101 and Makalioka 34 showed a high yield potential and good level of resistance against the prevalent pests and diseases. They also have thick and deep roots which make them suitable for upland rice culture in savanna soils. They are tolerant to Al toxicity, and have good level of adaptation to acid-soil conditions. A second component of a successful rice production technology was the determination of appropiate rates of P an Ca. Based on plant tissue analyses and in grain yield, a fertilization rate of 150 Kg Ca/ha using dolomite, and 60 Kg P₂ 0 ₅/ha as <b>concentrate</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> appears to be adequate for acceptable yield levels on savanna soils. An additional component of the management system is to drill plant adapted rice cultivars in rows 15 cm apart, with a rate of seeding of 60 Kg/ha. Significantly higher yield was obtained with these cultural practices. Through the integration of these management practices a productive upland rice production technology can be developed and the incorporation of savanna soils to food production is feasible...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to develop an economical process for making nitrogenous fertilizers from ammonia and cellulosic waste materials such as corncobs, cornstalks, and oat hulls. In this endeavor, two different methods were investigated;One method was based on hydrolysis of the hemicelluloses in these materials with dilute solutions of mineral acids or salts followed by ammoniation with anhydrous ammonia of the hydrolysate. With corncobs, when 8. 25 percent sulfuric acid and a liquid/solid ratio of 2. 0 was used for hydrolysis, and ammoniation was carried out slightly above room temperature, a product was obtained containing 7. 4 percent total nitrogen of which 4. 2 percent was organic nitrogen (Product A), With the same hydrolysis conditions and an ammoniation temperature of 249 °C, a product was obtained containing 9. 5 percent nitrogen of which 56 percent was organic nitrogen (Product B). In Product A, 86. 4 {{percent of the total}} nitrogen was water-soluble, and in Product B only 17. 6 percent was water-soluble. Normal and <b>concentrated</b> <b>superphosphates</b> or dilute phosphoric acid in the hydrolysis step did not result in as much organic nitrogen an sulfuric acid;The second method involved the ammoniation of the cellulosic materials with anhydrous ammonia. By this process, a product containing 4. 6 percent total nitrogen was obtained with corncobs at a temperature or 300 °C (Product C). In this product, all the nitrogen was organic and none of it was water-soluble;Small-scale engineering equipment for producing Product A was built and tested. Products were made which were essentially the same as those prepared on a laboratory scale;An evaluation of Products A, B, and C as fertilizer materials was made. Tests were made to determine chemical stability, hygroscopicity and caking characteristics. These tests showed that Products A, B, and C could be used in mixed fertilizers. Greenhouse plant-growth tests were carried out. Product A proved to be better than Milorganite, a commercial nitrogen fertilizer made from sewage, and was almost an good as ammonium sulfate, Products B and C did not compare well with Product A ammonium sulfate, or Milorganite in the plant-growth tests; however, under different conditions of a longer growing season, these two products might be better;A preliminary cost analysis indicated that Product A might compete with ammonium sulfate and could easily undersell Milorganite;It is recommended that further pilot plant work be carried out on the production of Product A...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of five types of organic residues on the nature of <b>concentrated</b> <b>superphosphate</b> fertilizer reactions in an alluvial soil (23 % CaCO 3) and in a desert soil (8 % CaCO 3). The solubility data showed that, with increasing rates of P, the solubility of P tended towards dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) which with time probably changes to hydroxyapatite (HA). Addition of organic residues at rates (1 and 5 mg/g soil) decreased the monocalcium phosphate potentials of native and treated soils with superphosphate, indicating that the organic matter may have successfully retarded the immobilization of applied superphosphate in two highly calcareous soils low in organic matter content...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} Large White turkeys to evaluate high-fluorine, fertilizer phosphates, diammonium phosphate (DAP) and <b>concentrated</b> <b>superphosphate</b> (CSP) along with partially defluorinated phosphate (PDP) and monocalcium phosphate (MCP) as sources of supplemental phosphorus. Aluminum as an alleviator of fluorine toxicity in starting and growing-finishing turkeys was studied. Fertilizer phosphates, PDP and MCP were each added to furnish all the dietary supplemental phosphorus. Aluminum sulphate was added to provide 0, 295 or 590 p. p. m. of Al in the first experiment and about a 1 : 1 A 1 :F ratio in the second experiment. CSP and DAP were somewhat toxic, significantly (P < 0. 05) depressing body weight and feed efficiency when fed to supply all supplemental phosphorus from day-old to 20 weeks, but CSP was not toxic for short periods, day-old to four weeks. Only CSP and DAP significantly (P < 0. 05) increased bone strength, bone ash and fluorine level of bone ash. Fluorine content of muscle was significantly (P < 0. 05) increased by DAP. Aluminum partially eliminated the toxic effect of DAP and CSP, but was not effective in preventing all symptoms of fluorine toxicity produced by the fertilizer phosphates. It was concluded from {{results of this study}} that PDP was an excellent phosphorus source for young turkeys. However, DAP and CSP should be added to furnish only a portion of the supplemental phosphorus along with feed grade phosphates...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} quantification of the dynamics of litter decomposition, microbiota populations, and nutrient movement in response to nitrogen and phosphorus additions to a deciduous forest stand. Nitrogen (urea) was applied at rates of 0, 550, and 1100 kg/ha in combination with phosphorus (<b>concentrated</b> <b>superphosphate)</b> at rates of 0, 275, and 550 kg/ha. Total loss of organic material from white oak, red maple, and black gum litter bags over a 16 -month period was 34, 35, and 45 %, respectively. Phosphorus treatment retarded weight loss from litter bags of all species. Weight loss for the 0 -, 275 -, and 55 -kg/ha levels of phosphorus averaged 23, 20, and 19 % for white oak; 26, 25, and 25 % for red maple; 29, 27 and 26 % for black gum. Weight losses were increased by a small amount (1 to 2 %) or not at all by nitrogen treatment. The NP interfaction weight loss means were intermediate to the main treatment means. The increase in decomposition associated with nitrogen was offset by the decrease associated with phosphorus. Litter and soil bacterial populations were significantly increased by nitrogen additions, while litter and soil fungi did not respond to nitrogen. Soil fungal populations were increased by phosphorus addition, while litter bacterial populations were reduced. Litter fungi and soil bacteria did not respond to phosphorus. Combined additions of nitrogen and phosphorus increased bacterial populations, though not as much as nitrogen alone. There was a good correlation (r = 0. 70) between bacterial population and litter weight loss...|$|E
40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} Large White turkeys to determine the feasibility of using fertilizer phosphates {{as a source of}} supplemental phosphorus for starting, growing and finishing turkeys in practical, corn-soybean meal diets. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine and compare the relative biological value of two fertilizer phosphates, <b>concentrated</b> triple <b>superphosphate</b> (CSP), and diammonium phosphate (DAP), and phosphated egg shell with a reference standard which was mono-sodium phosphate, NaH 2 PO 4 *H 2 O (A. R. or technical grade), (2) to determine the possible fluorine toxicity of CSP and DAP in diets for starting and growing-finishing turkeys, (3) to determine the effect of higher levels of dietary phosphorus on body weight gain, bone breaking strength, percent bone ash and survival, (4) to determine the toxicity of calcium fluorphosphate from CSP and DAP as compared to sodium fluoride, (5) to determine the response of turkeys fed CSP, DAP and partially defluorinated phosphate from day-old to 20 weeks of age, and (6) to determine the response of turkeys to “minimal” and “optimal” levels of “available” phosphorus from day-old to 20 weeks of age.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Waste {{products}} from industry {{have often been}} disposed in landfills without regard for any beneficial uses of the product in agricultural production. This research was conducted {{to determine the effect}} of a refractory metal processing waste product on (a) soil chemical and physical properties, (b) perennial ryegrass forage quality and seed yield, and (c) percolation water quality. Refractory metals processing waste was applied either as a slurry or dried to Dayton silty clay loam (sicl) at rates of 0, 5, 10, 25, and 50 tons/acre. Ammonium nitrate, <b>concentrated</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> muriate of potash, calcium sulfate, and lime were added to optimize plant growth. Lime, gypsum, and phosphorus fertilizer variables were incorporated into the study to investigate specific beneficial or problems areas associated with the waste product. The waste and fertilizers were tilled into the soil, and all plots seeded with perennial ryegrass (var. Linn) and irrigated. Elements found in the waste in excess of one percent included: Zr, Ca, F, Fe, Al, S, and C (as CO₃). Those elements found in concentrations ranging between 0. 1 and 1. 0 percent included: Hf, Mg, Na, Pb, P, NH₄-N, and K. The concentration of Cd, Ci, Co, Cr, Ni, Mn, and Mo were less than 1000 ppm. Soil pH, soluble salts, extractable Ca, Mg, NH₄-N, Zn, Ni, S, and F and the total Zr, Hf, and Pb content of the soil increased with waste application, while extractable Fe, Mn, and P levels decreased with waste application. Extractable Na, K, NO₃-N, Al, and Cu levels were not affected by waste application. The soluble salt content decreased from greater than 4. 0 mmhos /cm in the fall to less than 1. 7 mmnos /cm in the spring. The extractable Mg, Na, K, NH₄, NO₃, P, S, and Zn also decreased in the spring as compared to the fall levels. Acid extractable P levels were less than the minimum required for optimum crop production, 30 ppm. Iron, Mn, and Ni availability increased with time, due to the wet, reduced soil conditions present between sampling periods. Water percolation through the Dayton sicl soil increased with waste application, but soil moisture retention was not changed. Perennial ryegrass dry matter yields were not significantly changed by waste product additions, and were similar to yields obtained in commercial farm operations. Mean yields ranged from 2. 6 to 3. 3 tons/acre on the soils treated with dry waste, and 2. 8 to 4. 0 tons/acre on soils treated with the waste slurry. Clean seed yields were slightly less than normal, ranging from 754 to 1238 lbs /acre. The subnormal seed yields were probably due to seed loss during harvesting and cleaning. The waste additions did not affect seed viability. The Ca, Mg, K, P. Fe, Al, Mn, Cr, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Mo, F, Zr, Hf, and Pb contents of the perennial ryegrass were not significantly affected by waste application. The S, Na, and N uptake by the ryegrass increased at application rates of 50 ton/acre, compared to control plots, which indicated that the waste product may serve as a N and S fertilizer. Plant P levels were not significantly depressed by waste application, despite decreases in acid available P levels. Addition of 100 lbs P /acre did not significantly improve P uptake compared to soil treated with 25 lbs P/acre and similar amounts of waste. Ryegrass grown on soil that received no lime or waste showed significant reductions in uptake of Ca and Mo, compared to control plots. The addition of waste, 25 ton/acre, eliminated these reductions. The application of the waste product to the soil may pose a threat of fluoride pollution to groundwaters which would require special management practices. No other elemental hazards to groundwater were suggested. Utilization of refractory metals processing waste on Dayton sicl appears to be a viable waste disposal alternative, providing that further study establishes that F does not pose a threat to groundwaters under field conditions...|$|E
