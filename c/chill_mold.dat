40|$|Centrifugal casting into {{a massive}} slot <b>chill</b> <b>mold</b> {{was used to}} prepare two series of {{specimens}} of alloys of the Al - Cu system, containing from 10 to 32. 2 at. % Cu. The first series was fabricated without a homogenizing heat treatment of the melt, while the second series was fabricated with heating of the melt to 1400 A degrees C. Both kinds of specimens were cast at the same temperature {{in order to provide}} for the same cooling rate of about 10 (4) K/sec. The structures, phase compositions and microhardnesses of the structural components are compared. It is established that the homogenizing heat treatment changes the kinetics of crystallization and, hence, the proportion of phases in the alloy structure and the copper content in them...|$|E

By coating a <b>chilled</b> <b>mold</b> first with a fruit gelatin, a glazed effect can be produced. Imperfections in the unmolding are disguised with strategically placed fluted piping of “crème chantilly”. In the United States, it is common to serve Bavarian Cream directly from the bowl it has been chilled in, similar to a French mousse. In this informal presentation, Escoffier recommended the bavarian cream be made in a [...] "timbale or deep silver dish which is then surrounded with crushed ice".|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{influence}} on segregation of iron based phases on the secondary alloy AlSi 7 Mg 0. 3 microstructure by chrome. Iron {{is the most common}} and harmful impurity in aluminum casting alloys and has long been associated with an increase of casting defects. In generally, iron is associated with the formation of Fe-rich phases. It is impossible to remove iron from melt by standard operations, but it is possible to eliminate its negative influence by addition some other elements that affect the segregation of intermetallics in less harmful type. Realization of experiments and results of analysis show new view on solubility of iron based phases during melt preparation with higher iron content and influence of chrome as iron corrector of iron based phases. By experimental work were used three different amounts of AlCr 20 master alloy a three different temperature of <b>chill</b> <b>mold.</b> Our experimental work confirmed that chrome can be used as an iron corrector in Al-Si alloy, due to the change of intermetallic phases and shortening their length...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between cooling rate and microsegregation of directionally solidified ductile iron. The unidirectional heat transfer system used in this research {{is made up of}} a copper <b>mold</b> kept <b>chilled</b> by circulating water and embedded in the bottom of Furan sand mold. Thermocouples are connected to the computer measuring system to record the cooling curves of the castings at a distance of 0, 30, 60 and 90 mm from the <b>chilled</b> copper <b>mold</b> surface. Alloys including Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni and Ti were added to the specimens. Electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) was employed to examine distribution of elements between the dendrite arms and nodular graphite. Results show that unidirectional heat transfer affects directly the solidification mode and microstructure of the casting. The cooling curves reveal that local solidification time increases with increasing distance from the <b>chilled</b> copper <b>mold</b> surface. Different solidification rates with corresponding microstructure and element segregation were observed in the same unidirectionally solidified casting. Local solidification time was closely related to element segregation. The effective segregation coefficient (Keff) calculated using the Scheil equation was found to vary, according to the stage of solidification. The actual segregation characteristics of complex alloys generally follow the Scheil equation...|$|R
40|$|Damping of axial and {{bending mode}} {{vibrations}} in giant magnetoelastic polycrystalline TbDy alloys was studied at cryogenic temperatures. All specimens of TbDy were arc-melted {{in the proper}} composition ratio and dropped into a <b>chilled</b> copper <b>mold.</b> Additional treatments consisted of cold plane-rolling to induce crystallographic texture and then heat-treating to relieve internal stress. Mechanical hysteretic losses were measured at various strains, frequencies, and loading configurations down to 77 K. Both as-cast and textured polycrystalline TbDy samples were tested along with an aluminum specimen for comparison. Loss factors at multiple natural vibration frequencies of the samples were measured for axial modes. Larger damping rates were measured for axial mode vibrations than for bending mode vibrations, possibly reflecting the larger specimen volume contributing to magnetoelastic damping. At LN 2 temperatures TbDy materials demonstrated q > 0. 05 at 0. 01 Hz and q > 0. 1 at higher frequencies from 0. 6 - 1. 5 kHz...|$|R
50|$|To {{control the}} {{solidification}} {{structure of the}} metal, {{it is possible to}} place metal plates, <b>chills,</b> in the <b>mold.</b> The associated rapid local cooling will form a finer-grained structure and may form a somewhat harder metal at these locations. In ferrous castings, the effect is similar to quenching metals in forge work. The inner diameter of an engine cylinder is made hard by a chilling core. In other metals, chills may be used to promote directional solidification of the casting. In controlling the way a casting freezes, it is possible to prevent internal voids or porosity inside castings.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this {{research}} work, ProCAST software is employed {{to study the}} sand casting process of a box-type part for wind turbine. The casting part is big in size, non-uniform in wall thickness, and heavy in some local positions. Shrinkage cavity and porosity are very likely to from at these locations. By numerical simulation, {{the influence of the}} parameters such as pouring temperature, <b>chills,</b> riser on <b>mold</b> filling and solidification is analyzed. Simulation researches reveal that with appropriate pouring temperature, correct number, size and location of chills and risers, a smooth mold filling, reduced shrinkage and other defects are available and desired sound castings can be produced...|$|R
50|$|Risers, {{also known}} as feeders, {{are the most common}} way of {{providing}} directional solidification. It supplies liquid metal to the solidifying casting to compensate for solidification shrinkage. For a riser to work properly the riser must solidify after the casting, otherwise it cannot supply liquid metal to shrinkage within the casting. Risers add cost to the casting because it lowers the yield of each casting; i.e. more metal is lost as scrap for each casting. Another way to promote directional solidification is by adding <b>chills</b> to the <b>mold.</b> A <b>chill</b> is any material which will conduct heat away from the casting more rapidly than the material used for molding.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{fabricating}} soft tissue implants using a mold. The cavity surface of an initially untextured mold. made of an organic material such as epoxy. {{is given a}} thin film coating of material that has pinholes and is resistant to atomic particle bombardment. The mold cavity surface is then subjected to atomic particle bombardment, such as when placed in an isotropic atomic oxygen environment. Microscopic depressions in the mold cavity surface are created at the pinhole sites on the thin film coating. The thin film coating is removed and the mold is then used to cast the soft tissue implant. The thin film coating having pinholes may be created by <b>chilling</b> the <b>mold</b> below the dew point such that water vapor condenses upon it; distributing particles, that can partially dissolve and become attached to the mold cavity surface, onto the mold cavity surface; removing the layer of condensate, such as by evaporation; applying the thin film coating over the entire mold surface; and, finally removing the particles, such as by dissolving or brushing it off. Pinholes are created in the thin film coating at the sites previously occupied by the particles...|$|R

In high {{pressure die}} casting <b>mold,</b> <b>chill</b> vents are used to allow residual air and gases to exhaust out from the mold cavity. The objective {{of this paper is}} to design and develop a bi-metallic chill vent for high {{pressure die casting}} using copper alloy material having high thermal conductivity, coated with steel layer on the surface. Transient thermal analysis was carried out using ANSYS software, and temperature distribution was compared with bimetallic and tool steel chill vents.

40|$|Defect-free {{bioactive}} glass surfaces with a grooved microstructure {{at the low}} micrometer {{scale were}} achieved by a mold casting process. The process {{was applied to the}} well-known glass compositions 45 S 5 and 13 – 93. Such microstructured surfaces may exhibit especially favorable conditions for bone cell orientation and growth. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the parameter range for a successful casting process and thus to produce samples suitable to investigate the interaction between structured surfaces and relevant cells. Viscous flow in its temperature dependence and thermal analysis were analyzed to identify a suitable process window and to design a manageable time-temperature process scheme. Counteracting effects such as formation of <b>chill</b> ripples, <b>mold</b> sticking and build-up of permanent thermal stress in the glass had to be overcome. A platinum gold alloy was chosen as mold material with the mold surface bearing the mother shape of the microstructure to be imprinted on the glass surface. First experiments studying the behavior of osteoblast-like cells, seeded on these microstructured glass surfaces revealed excellent viability and an orientation of the cells along the microgrooves. The presented results show that direct casting is a suitable process to produce defined microstructures on bioactive glass surfaces...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} apparatus {{to determine}} the heat-transfer coefficient in the gap formed between the cast metal and the mold wall of a vertical direct <b>chill</b> (DC) casting <b>mold</b> is described. The apparatus simulates the conditions existing {{within the confines of}} the DC casting mold and measures the heat flux within the gap. Measurements were made under steady-state conditions, simulating the steady-state regime of the DC casting process. A range of casting parameters that may affect the heat transfer was tested using this apparatus. In the current article, the operation of the apparatus is described along with the results for the effect of gas type within the mold, and the size of the metal-mold gap formed during casting. The results show that the gas type and the gap size significantly affect the heat transfer within a DC casting mold. The measured heat fluxes for all the conditions tested were expressed as a linear correlation between the heat-transfer coefficient and the metal-mold gap size, and the fluxes can be used to estimate the heat transfer between the metal and the mold at any gap size. These results are compared to values reported in the literature and recommendations are made for the future reporting of the metal/mold heat-transfer coefficient for DC casting. The results for the effect of the other parameters tested are described in Part II of the article...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that REMs are strong oxide and {{sulphide}} formers that can easily form large clusters which have harmful effect on the casting process as well as the quality of the final steel product. By adding these elements right before casting, the number of narrow transfer parts are eliminated (compared to if added in ladle) Also, the REM inclusions has less time to sinter together to form large clusters, preventing clogging. The general idea behind this alloying method in the continuous casting machine is to feed a wire of FeSiRE powder blend, coated with a metal strip, into the melt in the <b>chilled</b> Cu <b>mold</b> (CC mold) Adding REMs to the steel, in particular Ce, can increase the resistance to oxidation at high temperatures by improving the properties of the chromia layer. This is of big interest for SANDVIK as it can improve their corrosion resistant grades and may also, in the future, enable alloying in with other volatile elements such as Zr. This master thesis has the objective to find out the dissolution time of the wire, coated with three different metal strips; Steel, Cu and Al. The experiments were performed with steel grade 316 L, provided by SMT, in a 2 kg melt in a lab scaled induction furnace at 1500 oC, 1510 oC and 1530 oC. The operations were performed both with and without FeSiRE powder inside. The results obtained with powder inside at 1500 oC showed that the Al wire experienced the shortest dissolution time (0, 5 to 1 s) followed by Cu (≤ 10 s) and Steel (18 to 20 s). In addition to this, sampling procedures was implemented (1, 1, 3, 5 10 and 29 mins after wire addition) in a depth of 40 mm for each wire. Here, the yield of Ce 1 minute after wire addition was highest for the Steel wire (41. 9 %) followed by Cu wire (25 %) and Al wire (< 14. 8 %). From samples taken 1 and 5 mins after wire addition in the Al wire experiment, inclusions were extracted and collected on a film filter after electrolytic extraction and filtration. The film filter was observed in SEM. The morphology and compositions were analysed and compared. It was found that Ce and La was present as Ce La oxy sulfides both individually and on Al Mg O clusters...|$|R
