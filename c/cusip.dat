50|$|The <b>CUSIP</b> {{system is}} owned by the American Bankers Association and is {{operated}} by S&P Capital IQ. The operating body, <b>CUSIP</b> Global Services (CGS), also serves as the national numbering agency (NNA) for North America, and the <b>CUSIP</b> serves as the National Securities Identification Number (NSIN) for products issued from both the United States and Canada. In its role as the NNA, <b>CUSIP</b> Global Services (CGS) also assigns all US-based ISINs.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States and Canada the NNA is the <b>CUSIP</b> Services Bureau and the NSIN is the <b>CUSIP.</b>|$|E
50|$|The acronym <b>CUSIP</b> {{derives from}} the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, a {{committee}} of the American Bankers Association. The Committee was founded in July 1964 and developed the <b>CUSIP</b> system. The Committee formed the <b>CUSIP</b> Service Bureau in 1968, during the paper crunch on Wall Street.|$|E
50|$|TBA <b>CUSIPs</b> incorporate, {{within the}} {{identifier}} itself, a security’s mortgage type (Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac), coupon, maturity and settlement month.|$|R
50|$|For example, CLIP of WESTLAB AG (reference entity) is 'DMFCCI'. There are {{multiple}} issues from WESTLAB AG each with different <b>CUSIPs</b> - D96637AG4, D96637AH2, D96637AK5 etc.|$|R
50|$|The CUSIP-linked MIP code (CLIP) {{is used in}} the {{financial}} derivatives markets to identify the reference entity of a credit default swap. It is mainly used as a key field in Markit's reference entity database (RED). Each CLIP is linked with one or more <b>CUSIPs</b> each representing reference entity obligations (securities).|$|R
50|$|There is {{a special}} {{assignment}} of <b>CUSIP</b> numbers for TBA Security. Working with the MBSCC, <b>CUSIP</b> Global Services (CGS) developed a specialized identification scheme for TBA (To Be Announced) mortgage-backed securities.|$|E
50|$|A <b>CUSIP</b> is a nine-character {{alphanumeric}} code that identifies a North American financial {{security for the}} purposes of facilitating clearing and settlement of trades. The <b>CUSIP</b> was adopted as an American National Standard under Accredited Standards X9.6.|$|E
50|$|Like other securities, {{individual}} {{issues of}} T-bills are {{identified with a}} unique <b>CUSIP</b> number. The 13-week bill issued three months after a 26-week bill is considered a re-opening of the 26-week bill and is given the same <b>CUSIP</b> number. The 4-week bill issued two months after that and maturing {{on the same day}} is also considered a re-opening of the 26-week bill and shares the same <b>CUSIP</b> number. For example, the 26-week bill issued on March 22, 2007, and maturing on September 20, 2007, has the same <b>CUSIP</b> number (912795A27) as the 13-week bill issued on June 21, 2007, and maturing on September 20, 2007, and as the 4-week bill issued on August 23, 2007 that matures on September 20, 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Apple Inc.: ISIN US0378331005, {{expanded}} from <b>CUSIP</b> 037833100The {{main body of}} the ISIN is the original <b>CUSIP,</b> assigned in the 1970s. The country code [...] "US" [...] has been added on the front, and an additional check digit at the end. The country code indicates the country of issue. The check digit is calculated using the Luhn algorithm.|$|E
50|$|<b>CUSIP</b> also {{reserves}} {{the special}} characters '*', '@' and '#' {{for use with}} private placement numbers (PPNs) used by the insurance industry.|$|E
50|$|The <b>CUSIP</b> {{system has}} grown {{over the years}} to cover corporate, government, municipal, and {{international}} securities (through the CINS, or <b>CUSIP</b> International Numbering System); IPO's; preferred stock; funds; certificates of deposit; syndicated loans; and U.S. and Canadian listed options. The CGS database contains issuer and issue-level identifiers, plus standardized descriptive data, for more than 14 million financial instruments and entities. CGS is also the designated national numbering agency responsible for assigning the ISIN in over 35 other markets.|$|E
50|$|On May 10, 2016 Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners L.P. {{changed its}} name to Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. The stock symbol and <b>CUSIP</b> will remain the same.|$|E
50|$|During {{periods when}} Treasury cash {{balances}} are particularly low, the Treasury may sell cash management bills (or CMBs). These {{are sold at}} a discount and by auction just like weekly Treasury bills. They differ {{in that they are}} irregular in amount, term (often less than 21 days), and day of the week for auction, issuance, and maturity. When CMBs mature on the same day as a regular weekly bill, usually Thursday, they are said to be on-cycle. The CMB is considered another reopening of the bill and has the same <b>CUSIP.</b> When CMBs mature on any other day, they are off-cycle and have a different <b>CUSIP</b> number.|$|E
50|$|The VALOR {{number is}} a code which uniquely {{identifies}} listed securities and financial instruments in Switzerland, and serves a similar purpose to <b>CUSIP</b> or WKN in the North American or German markets respectively. The VALOR number {{is incorporated in}} the Swiss ISIN number.|$|E
5000|$|Sicovams {{could be}} {{directly}} converted to ISINs {{as with other}} older systems, including <b>CUSIP</b> and SEDOL. To do so the number was padded out with three zeros on the front, then the country code [...] "FR" [...] {{was added to the}} front and the ISIN check digit to the end.|$|E
5000|$|... {{algorithm}} Cusip-Check-Digit(cusip) is Input: an 8-character <b>CUSIP</b> [...] sum := 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 8 do c := the ith {{character of}} <b>cusip</b> if c is a digit then v := numeric {{value of the}} digit c else if c is a letter then p := ordinal position of c in the alphabet (A=1, B=2...) v := p + 9 else if c = [...] "*" [...] then v := 36 else if c = [...] "@" [...] then v := 37 else if c = [...] "#" [...] then v := 38 end if if i is even then v := v &times; 2 end if [...] sum := sum + int ( [...] v div 10 [...] ) + v mod 10 repeat [...] return (10 - (sum mod 10)) mod 10 end function ...|$|E
50|$|Bonds are debt securities, tradeable on a bond market. A country's {{regulatory}} structure determines what {{qualifies as a}} security. For example, in North America, each security is uniquely identified by a <b>CUSIP</b> for trading and settlement purposes. In contrast, loans are not securities {{and do not have}} CUSIPs (or the equivalent). Loans may be sold or acquired in certain circumstances, as when a bank syndicates a loan.|$|E
5000|$|MIP is {{a synonym}} of Markit Partners. CLIP is known with {{multiple}} names like Markit RED code, RED CLIP or simply CLIPS. S&P and Markit Partners introduced CLIP concept and entity CLIP codes are {{generated by the}} S&P <b>CUSIP</b> Bureau [...] and are assigned to each entity name individually. CLIP codes are used for electronic matching on DTCC and have been integrated in various online platforms.|$|E
50|$|Issuer numbers 990 to 999 and 99A to 99Z in {{each group}} of 1,000 numbers are {{reserved}} for internal use. This permits a user to assign an issuer number to any issuer which might be relevant to his holdings but which does not qualify for coverage under the <b>CUSIP</b> numbering system. Other issuer numbers (990000 to 999999 and 99000A to 99999Z) are also reserved for the user {{so that they may}} be assigned to non-security assets or to number miscellaneous internal assets.|$|E
5000|$|S&P {{has run the}} <b>CUSIP</b> Service Bureau, {{the only}} International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) issuer in the US, {{on behalf of the}} American Bankers Association. In its formal {{statement}} of objections, the EC alleged [...] "that S&P is abusing this monopoly position by enforcing the payment of licence fees for the use of US ISINs by (a) banks and other financial services providers in the EEA and (b) information service providers in the EEA." [...] It claims that comparable agencies elsewhere in the world either do not charge fees at all, or do so on the basis of distribution cost, rather than usage.|$|E

5000|$|What is DTC eligibility? This {{means that}} a company's stock is {{eligible}} for deposit with DTC aka [...] "Cede & Co" [...] aka the Street. Your company's security holders {{will be able to}} deposit their particular shares with a brokerage firm. Clearing firms, as full participants with DTC, handle the DTC eligibility submissions to DTC. Transfer agents were responsible for eligibility coordination years ago. Now, {{in order to make a}} new issue of securities eligible for DTC’s delivery services, a completed and signed eligibility questionnaire must be submitted to DTC’s Underwriting Department, Eligibility. Parties that may submit the questionnaire include one of the following: Lead Manager/Underwriter, Issuer’s financial advisor or the DTC Participant clearing the transaction for its correspondent. The Lead Manager/ Underwriter must ensure that DTC’s Underwriting Department receives the issue’s offering document (e.g., prospectus, offering memorandum, official statement) and the <b>CUSIP</b> numbers assigned to the issue within the time frames outlined in DTC’s Operational Arrangements.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} panel of publicly traded United States manufacturing firms which was created and updated at the National Bureau of Economic Research from 1978 through 1988 within the Productivity Program. The panel consists of about 2600 large manufacturing firms with three to twenty-seven years of data each; the period covered by the sampling frame was 1976 through 1985, with data back to 1959 where possible. There are approximately 70 variables for each firm-year of data, consisting of income statement and balance sheet variables and the corresponding common stock data. The technological data available for these firms consist of R&D expenditures and patents granted, both by date of application and by granting date. The patents data are available only through about 1981, due to the limitations of our sources and budget. The firms on the file are identified both by their <b>CUSIP</b> number and by name, making it feasible to match this data to other sources. ...|$|E

40|$|Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (DWAC) is {{a service}} {{offering}} of DTCC’s FAST program that allows Participants to deposit and withdraw shares in FAST-eligible issues directly to/from the transfer agent/custodian. To use the DWAC service, Participants input the transaction via file transfer or DTCC’s PTS/PBS functions, {{where it is}} either approved or rejected by the transfer agent/custodian. Approved transactions result in the shares either being (1) added to DTCC’s FAST balance as a deposit and a credit to the Participant’s free position, or (2) withdrawn from DTCC’s FAST balance and reissued in firm or customer name. Rejected transactions are dropped and are reported as such. Transfer Agents charge a fee for this service, which is currently billed outside of DTCC. The Securities Transfer Association (STA) contacted DTCC a few years ago, outlining {{the need for a}} more efficient billing process (i. e. centralized billing at DTCC). The Participant community agreed that DTCC should pursue this solution, as it eliminates the time and expense associated with receiving invoices, verifying details, and forwarding payments to FAST transfer agents. As part of this service, DTCC will make available to its Participants a daily file of all DWAC transactions approved earlier that day (the file will be available at 8 : 00 p. m.). The file will include: the transfer agent name, transfer agent number, security description, <b>CUSIP,</b> quantity, ”D ” for a deposit o...|$|E
