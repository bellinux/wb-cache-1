40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the effect of reflow {{parameters}} on the joint shear strength. Eight reflow profiles were developed using four factors at two levels of Taguchi design of experiment for 1206, 0805 and 0603 chip resistors. Normal probability and main effect plots were used to provide a complete profile of the effect of reflow parameters on the <b>chip</b> <b>resistor</b> solder joint shear strength. The Normal Probability plots show effect of some reflow parameters on shear strength. Some data points did not fall on the best fit line. These outliers indicate parameter effects. The 1206 <b>chip</b> <b>resistor</b> shear strength value of 74. 85 N lies outside the best fit line indicating that some of the parameters are critical and significantly affect the response value. The results of the Main Effect plots help identify the unknown critical parameters in the probability plots. It indicates that the shear strength of 1206 <b>chip</b> <b>resistor</b> depends on the peak temperature, time above liquidus and preheat slope but not on cooling rate. In the case of the 0805 <b>chip</b> <b>resistor,</b> there were no exceptional departures from the line fitted to the data. It can be assumed that the factors and the levels considered here have no significant effect on the response. The normal probability plot of the 0603 <b>chip</b> <b>resistor</b> shows that the 46. 68 N shear strength lies outside the fitted line. This means that the factors and settings (run 3) can be further modified to improve the response. The factors which affected the 0603 resistor from the main effect plot are preheat slop and cooling rate. The results of the 1206 <b>chip</b> <b>resistor</b> show the highest shear force of 74. 8 N using a peak temperature setting of 230 °C (low level).

It is well known that in surface mount technology (SMT), thermal strains in electronic assemblies are induced in the solder joints by the mismatch between the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the components, substrate and solder, both during their processing and in service. Therefore, thermo-mechanical damage is likely to occur in the solder and the principle reliability hazard in SMT assemblies is the resulting fatigue cracking of the solder fillet, caused by cyclic thermal stresses. These stresses may be caused by both cyclic variations in power dissipation within equipment and by external environmental temperature changes. Most work reported to date has focused on the effects of environmental temperature changes, although for many types of equipment power cycling may result in significant stresses. The present paper describes the experimental determination of the actual temperature distribution in a <b>chip</b> <b>resistor</b> assembly when it is powered.
