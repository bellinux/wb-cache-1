At launch, the game featured nine maps.|$|E

Baldwin {{was a young}} {{designer}} and instructor of design at colleges around the San Francisco Bay (San Francisco State University , the San Francisco Art Institute, and the California College of the Arts [...] ). As he recalled in the film Ecological Design (1994), [...] "Stewart Brand came to me because he heard that I read catalogs. [...] He said, 'I {{want to make this}} thing called a [...] "whole Earth" [...] catalog so that anyone on Earth <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> telephone and find out the complete information on anything. ...That’s my goal.'" [...] Baldwin served as the chief editor of subjects in the areas of technology and design, both in the catalog itself and in other publications which arose from it.|$|E

On May 9, 2015, Parks performed what he called his [...] "final piano performance" [...] at the Largo in Los Angeles. Guest performers included singer Gaby Moreno; songwriter-producer Joe Henry; Grizzly Bear's Edward Droste; New Zealand singer-songwriter Kimbra; and jazz guitarist-composer Grant Geissman. On upcoming projects, Parks said: [...] " [...] set poetry to music, to underscore poems. So I will still be performing once I get that done. I will be looking to find a celebrated string quartet to take things to an irreducible minimum. I <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> quartet in Peoria, or in Europe, to perform something like this. I also hope to find a film project that interests me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gifford {{provided}} the first reliable, {{detailed account of}} early comics in works such as Victorian Comics (1976) and The British Comics Catalogue, 1874–1974 (1974), with a detailed overview in his International Book of Comics (1984). He also advanced debate {{on the origins of}} comics, including what the first comic and comic characters were, arguing that [...] "there is no point [...] where we <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> paper and declare it Comic Number One." [...] He identified the first comedic narrative periodical, as an antecedent to the comic as The Comick Magazine (1796) which although all text included a single William Hogarth print per issue, which Gifford suggested when combined formed a [...] "narrative sequence... they could be described [...] as an early form of comic strip." [...] Gifford identified the significant stage of [...] "the first continuing cartoon hero" [...] as Rowlandson's Dr Syntax in the serial The Schoolmaster's Tour in The Poetical Magazine (1 May 1809). He argued that [...] "in Europe, perhaps the world" [...] the first caricature magazine, an important prototypical form of the comic, was Hopkirk's The Glasgow Looking Glass (11 June 1825).|$|E
2500|$|Building on {{an effort}} started in 2001 to {{increase}} scores by providing breakfast before tests, Balboa initiated a pilot breakfast program in 2005 called [...] "Grab N Go." [...] A first for Northern California, {{the program has}} {{increased the number of}} disadvantaged students receiving breakfast. Using magnetic swipe cards, eligible students <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> pre-bagged meal as they enter the building and can eat the meal during the first ten minutes of their first class. Previously, students would have to arrive up to 30 minutes before classes started and finish the meal in the cafeteria. Prior to 2001 participation in the free or reduced fee meal program averaged under 40% of eligible enrollment. Since the pilot program started, breakfast participation has averaged over 55%. Credited with increasing academic performance, the program was nominated by Nancy Pelosi for and subsequently received a Victory Against Hunger Award from the [...] in 2006. Balboa was one of four schools nationwide to receive part of a grant from the [...] campaign in March 2007 to support the program. Balboa has continued to serve subsidized lunch meals in a traditional two-tiered system. The social stratification caused by the separate lunch lines has attracted some criticism and efforts by the district to improve participation by eligible students.|$|E

50|$|Sedimentation is {{the rate}} at which {{floating}} or suspended particulate matter sinks and accumulates on the ocean floor. The faster (more energetic) the current, the more sediment it <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up.</b> <b>As</b> sediment laden currents slow, the particles fall out of suspension and come to rest on the sea floor. In other words, <b>a</b> fast current <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> lots of heavy grains, where as <b>a</b> slow current <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> only tiny pieces. As one can imagine, different places in the ocean vary drastically {{when it comes to the}} amount of suspended sediment and rate of deposition.|$|R
50|$|There are two enemy {{types in}} the {{standard}} rounds, house cats called Tiger and green iguanas called Iggy. These enemies can be simply avoided by running and jumping away, but can also be killed with throwable items, which are available only on certain levels. These items include telephones, flower pots, cups, and bottles. Flicky <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> item by walking into it, and throw it by jumping. Sometimes diamonds may appear, which cannot be thrown but rather provide bonus points.|$|R
5000|$|Ramone and Claudia Tienan (formerly of {{underground}} band the Simplistics) performed as a bluegrass-based folk duo called Uncle Monk. Ramone stated: [...] "There {{are a lot}} of similarities between punk and old-time music. Both are home-brewed music as opposed to schooled, and both have an earthy energy. And anybody <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> instrument and start playing."

There are two enemy types in the standard rounds, house cats called Tigers and green iguanas called Iggys. These enemies can be simply avoided but can also be defeated with throwable items available on some levels. These items include telephones, flower pots, cups, and bottles. Flicky <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> item by walking into it, and throw it by jumping. Sometimes diamonds may appear, which cannot be thrown but rather provide bonus points.

50|$|Each week, the Radio Songs chart ranks the 100 {{songs with}} the most airplay points (frequently {{referred}} to as audience impressions, which is a calculation {{of the number of}} times a song is played and the audience size of the station playing the tune). <b>A</b> song <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> airplay point every time it is selected to be played on specific radio stations that Billboard monitors. Radio stations across the board are used, from Top 40 Mainstream (which plays a wide variety of music that is generally the most popular songs of the time) to more genre-specific radio stations such as urban radio and country music. Paid plays of a song or treatment as bumper music do not count as an impression.|$|R
50|$|Players {{operate from}} a first-person {{perspective}} {{and use the}} mouse to control movement between locations, examining locations and interaction with objects, whether to use an item (i.e. <b>a</b> lift) or <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> something. Each location, ranging from corridors, small rooms, and vast halls, can be viewed in panoramic 360-degree to find objects to examine and interact with, with a still screen used when zooming in to examine an object in more detail. The mouse cursor changes when {{there is something to}} do - if an arrow, the player can either move to a new spot in the location or another location, or pan horizontally/vertically and change between the two; if a gold arrow, the player can interact with it, such as a book for example; if a hand, the player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> item, or use an item being carried. Items <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> <b>up,</b> and multiple items can be cycled through with the right mouse button.|$|R

May Day is also somewhere in the mine.|$|R
5000|$|The level {{selection}} menu is styled as {{a fictional}} website, Crime.net, where missions pop up periodically as contracts in {{a map of}} Washington D.C. The player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> open contract, join a contract another player has started, or buy a contract with in-game money in an offshore bank account. There are seven difficulty levels, with increased money and experience payouts for higher difficulty levels. Independent of difficulty was the [...] "pro job" [...] condition - pro jobs give additional experience, but cannot be retried if the players fail, later removed in an update. Some contracts in Payday 2 take place over multiple days, with each day represented by a separate level with different objectives. After a day is completed (in certain 'heists') the game may add an escape level, where the players' original escape is thwarted and they must survive to reach their backup getaway.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the default weapons, the player <b>can</b> also <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> flamethrower or a laser gun, allowing the character to attack enemies from a safer distance. Other power-ups include a crystal ball that enhances melee weapons, a necklace that increases the player's walking speed, a shield that reduces the amount of damage taken by enemy attacks, and a magic orb that destroy all on-screen enemies.|$|R
