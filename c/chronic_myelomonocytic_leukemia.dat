25|$|Targeted therapies are a {{relatively}} new class of cancer drugs that can overcome {{many of the issues}} seen with the use of cytotoxics. They are divided into two groups: small molecule and antibodies. The massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is {{due to the lack of}} cell specificity of the drugs. They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with {{a relatively}} low dose to other tissues. As different proteins are utilised by different cancer types, the targeted therapy drugs are used on a cancer type specific, or even on a patient specific basis. Although the side effects are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind. An example target for targeted therapy is the protein produced by the Philadelphia chromosome, a genetic lesion found commonly in <b>chronic</b> <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia.</b> This fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by imatinib, a small molecule drug.|$|E

40|$|International audienceGenomic {{studies in}} chronic myeloid malignancies, {{including}} myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and MPN/MDS, have identified common mutations in genes encoding signaling, epigenetic, transcription, and splicing factors. In the present study, we interrogated the clonal architecture by mutation-specific discrimination analysis of single-cell-derived colonies in 28 patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (CMML), {{the most frequent}} MPN/MDS. This analysis reveals a linear acquisition of the studied mutations with limited branching through loss of heterozygosity. Serial analysis of untreated and treated samples demonstrates a dynamic architecture on which most current therapeutic approaches have limited effects. The main disease characteristics are early clonal dominance, arising at the CD 34 (+) /CD 38 (-) stage of hematopoiesis, and granulomonocytic differentiation skewing of multipotent and common myeloid progenitors. Comparison of clonal expansions of TET 2 mutations in MDS, MPN, and CMML, together with functional invalidation of TET 2 in sorted progenitors, suggests a causative link between early clonal dominance and skewed granulomonocytic differentiation. Altogether, early clonal dominance may distinguish CMML from other chronic myeloid neoplasms with similar gene mutations...|$|R
40|$|Myeloproliferative {{neoplasms}} (MPNs) such as chronic myelogenous (CML) and <b>chronic</b> <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (CMML) {{are frequently}} induced by tyrosine kinase oncogenes. Although these MPNs {{are sensitive to}} tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, patients often relapse upon withdrawal of therapy. We used a model of MPN, which is induced by co-expression of the oncoproteins HIP 1 /PDGFβR (H/P) and AML 1 /ETO (A/E) from their endogenous loci, to examine the mechanisms of disease development and recurrence following imatinib withdrawal. Although the MPN displayed a full hematologic response to imatinib, 100 % of the diseased mice relapsed upon drug withdrawal. MPN persistence was not due to imatinib resistance mutations in the H/P oncogene or massive gene expression changes. Within one week of imatinib treatment, more than 98 % of gene expression changes induced by the oncogenes in isolated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (LSKs) normalized. Supplementation of imatinib with G-CSF or arsenic trioxide reduced MPN-initiating cell frequencies and the combination of imatinib with arsenic trioxide cured a large fraction of mice with MPNs. In contrast, no mice in the imatinib-treated control cohorts were cured. These data suggest that treatment {{with a combination of}} arsenic trioxide and imatinib can eliminate refractory MPN-initiating cells and reduce disease relapse...|$|R
40|$|Distinct morphologic and {{clinical}} features associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities {{have been described}} in subgroups of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which often are losses or gains and only rarely translocations. Among 103 consecutive MDS patients diagnosed and karyotyped at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg (ALU) between 1993 and 1999, two <b>chronic</b> <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (CMMoL) displayed trisomy 19 (+ 19) as the sole chromosomal abnormality. Three further CMMoL cases with + 19 as the single abnormality, two of which previously reported, were collected from other centers. Four of the five patients presented with leukocytosis and splenomegaly, and an increased number of ringed sideroblasts was observed in two cases. Treatment was low-dose Decitabine (cases 1 and 2), oral steroids (case 3), hydroxyurea (case 4), and daunorubicin/Ara-C (case 5). Transformation to acute myeloid leukemias (AML) occurred in three/five patients (cases 1, 2, and 4) 26, 12, and 22 months after diagnosis of CMMoL, respectively. We conclude that + 19 as the sole anomaly is a rare but recurrent change in CMMoL, in particular of the proliferative type. It is at present unclear which gene(s) located on chromosome 19 might have a functional role {{for the development of}} this phenotype. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Similar to PDGFRB-ETV6 translocations, these translocations are {{generally}} in-frame and encode for fusion proteins with their PDGFRB-derived tyrosine kinase being continuously active and responsible for causing the potentially malignant growth of its myeloid and/or lymphoid harboring cells.

40|$|Interleukin 3 (IL- 3) {{and other}} hematopoietic cytokines transduce signals that stimulate DNA {{synthesis}} and cell survival. In certain <b>chronic</b> <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> a TEL/platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) fusion protein is produced {{as a consequence}} of the t(5; 12) translocation. It contains the amino terminus of the transcription factor TEL fused to the transmembranous and cytoplasmic domains of the PDGFRβ. It is oncogenic as it substitutes for IL- 3, thus promoting cell growth and preventing apoptotic cell death. The mechanism by which TEL/PDGFRβ generates survival signals remains undefined. Here, we report that both IL- 3 and TEL/PDGFRβ initiate a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of the transcriptional factor NF-κB. In fact, either cytokine deprivation of IL- 3 -dependent Ba/F 3 cells or exposure of TEL/PDGFRβ-expressing cells to the specific inhibitor of the PDGFR tyrosine kinase, CGP 53716, caused a strong decrease in NF-κB activity followed by extensive cell death. Further, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor Z-IE(O-t-Bu) A-leucinal suppressed IL- 3 and TEL/PDGFRβ-dependent survival. The same result was seen upon overexpression of an unphosphorylable form of IκBα. Because both conditions inactivate NF-κB by preventing its translocation into the nucleus, that process seems to be essential for cell survival in response to IL- 3 and TEL/PDGFRβ. Moreover, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of the protooncogene c-Myc, a downstream target of NF-κB, had a similar effect. We conclude that NF-κB plays an important role in maintaining cell survival in response to IL- 3 and TEL/PDGFRβ and that c-Myc may be a downstream effector mediating this effect...|$|R

40|$|Juvenile <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> {{is a rare}} {{myeloproliferative}} disease in young children. While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative therapeutic option for most patients, children with juvenile <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> increasingly receive novel agents in phase I-II clinical trials as pre-transplant therapy or therapy for relapse after transplantation. However, response criteria or definitions of outcome for standardized evaluation of treatment effect in patients with juvenile <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> are currently lacking. Here we propose criteria to evaluate {{the response to the}} non-transplant therapy and definitions of remission status after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For the evaluation of non-transplant therapy, we defined 6 clinical variables (white blood cell count, platelet count, hematopoietic precursors and blasts in peripheral blood, bone marrow blast percentage, spleen size and extramedullary disease) and 3 genetic variables (cytogenetic, molecular and chimerism response) which serve to describe the heterogeneous picture of response to therapy in each individual case.
