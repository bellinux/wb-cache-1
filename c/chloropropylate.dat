40|$|Rhodotorula {{gracilis}} metabolizes Chlorobenzilate (ethyl 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilate) and <b>Chloropropylate</b> (isopropyl 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilate) {{to several}} metabolites in a basal medium supplemented by sucrose and by several intermediates of the citric acid cycle. Three identified metabolites {{resulting from the}} degradation of either acaricide, were 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid, 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone, and carbon dioxide. Chlorobenzilate, i. e., ethyl ester of 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid, was more easily hydrolyzed than <b>Chloropropylate,</b> i. e., isopropyl ester of this acid, so that larger amounts {{of carbon dioxide and}} 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone were obtained from Chlorobenzilate degradation. Regardless of acaricides used, longer incubation caused a higher accumulation of 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone. The probable steps of the degradation pathway are: Chlorobenzilate (or <b>Chloropropylate)</b> → 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid → 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone plus carbon dioxide. It appears that the decarboxylation of 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid to 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone was hindered by α-ketoglutarate and enhanced by succinate...|$|E
