5|$|Insectivorous insects, or {{insects that}} feed on other insects, are {{beneficial}} to humans if they eat insects {{that could cause}} damage to agriculture and human structures. For example, aphids feed on crops and cause problems for farmers, but ladybugs feed on aphids, {{and can be used}} as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid populations. While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects, insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption. Ants also help <b>control</b> <b>animal</b> populations by consuming small vertebrates. Without predators to keep them in check, insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions.|$|E
5|$|After leaving WWE, Moretti {{began working}} in the {{landscaping}} industry. Moretti also worked with her niece to help the pet population affected by Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Moretti volunteered for an organization called Best Friends Animal Society, which is a no-kill animal shelter (a shelter that does not euthanize to <b>control</b> <b>animal</b> populations) in Utah. She also worked with her local animal shelter on San Juan Island in northwestern Washington, where she has resided since 2000. While working at the shelter, she met her eventual business partner Jessica Ray, with whom she opened Downtown Dog in 2007. The facility is an animal daycare, {{as well as a}} training, grooming, and cat boarding company located in Friday Harbor, Washington. In June 2007, they expanded the business to include veterinary care and later the Bow Wow Bus, which takes the dogs on outings. Moretti has taken classes to learn how to groom animals and now grooms them as part of the business.|$|E

40|$|Activity in {{sympathetic}} liver nerves {{has been}} proposed to be important for glucose production in exercising humans. However, liver denervation does not influence the exercise-induced increase in glucose production in the rat and dog. These species have a poor sympathetic liver innervation {{in contrast to the}} rich innervation in humans. The effect of liver denervation on glucose production during exercise was therefore studied in the guinea pig, a species with a rich sympathetic hepatic innervation comparable to that of humans. Guinea pigs were selectively liver denervated (n = 9) or sham operated (n = 8) and instrumented with a carotid and a jugular catheter. One week later they ran on a treadmill at 32 m/min for 20 min. Glucose turnover was evaluated by a primed constant-rate intravenous infusion of [3 -H- 3]glucose. Arterial blood was sampled for analysis of hormones and metabolites. At rest, liver-denervated guinea pigs had lower glucose turnover and plasma concentrations of glucose, glycerol, and cortisol than <b>control</b> <b>animals.</b> During running, the increase in hepatic glucose production was similar in the two groups (4. 1 +/- 0. 8 vs. 3. 8 +/- 0. 7 mu mol. min(- 1). 100 g(- 1) in <b>control</b> <b>animals)</b> and so were hepatic (247 +/- 25 vs. 246 +/- 45 mmol glucose units/kg wet wt in <b>control</b> <b>animals)</b> and muscle glycogen concentrations at the end of exercise. Exercise-induced increases were also similar in the two groups for epinephrine (1. 9 +/- 0. 3 vs. 1. 6 +/- 0. 2 nM in <b>control</b> <b>animals),</b> norepinephrine (13. 0 +/- 1. 9 vs. 11. 1 +/- 2. 3 nM in <b>control</b> <b>animals),</b> cortisol [0. 41 +/- 0. 03 vs. 0. 57 +/- 0. 08 mu M in <b>control</b> <b>animals</b> (P = 0. 09) ], and glycerol [47 +/- 7 vs. 70 +/- 12 mu M in <b>control</b> <b>animals</b> (P = 0. 103) ]. In conclusion, sympathetic liver nerve activity is not a prerequisite for the exercise-induced increase in glucose production in the guinea pig...|$|R

40|$|Ureteral {{obstruction}} causes impaired salt wastage and K+ secretion in {{the distal}} nephron segments, including the cortical collecting duct (CCD). Recently, we demonstrated that conductances of Na+ and K+ in the apical membrane, {{as well as}} the electrogenic Na(+) -K+ pump activity and the relative K+ conductance in the basolateral membrane of the collecting duct cell, were inhibited in the obstructed kidney after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). To examine whether the increased intrarenal pressure might be causally related to these abnormalities in the CCD, the effects of unilateral renal decapsulation, a maneuver that partially blocks the increase in renal pressure, were evaluated with microelectrode techniques in isolated CCDs from UUO and sham-operated (control) rabbits 24 h after operation. Renal decapsulation had no effects on barrier voltages and conductances in the CCD from <b>control</b> <b>animals.</b> The lumen-negative transepithelial (VT) and basolateral membrane (VB) voltages {{as well as the}} transepithelial (GT) and the apical membrane (GA) conductances were decreased in the CCD from UUO <b>animals</b> compared with <b>control</b> <b>animals.</b> Pretreatment of renal decapsulation partially corrected the decreases in VT, VB, GT, and GA seen in the CCD from UUO animals. The changes in apical membrane voltage and GT upon addition of luminal amiloride and Ba 2 +, and the changes in VB upon addition of bath ouabain, were also decreased in the CCD from UUO <b>animals</b> compared with <b>control</b> <b>animals.</b> Pretreatment of renal decapsulation also partially corrected the above abnormalities seen in UUO animals, whereas it had no effect in <b>control</b> <b>animals.</b> The transference numbers for Cl- (tCl) and K+ (tK) in the basolateral membrane were, respectively, increased and decreased in the CCD from UUO <b>animals</b> compared with <b>control</b> <b>animals.</b> Pretreatment of renal decapsulation also partially corrected the changes in tCl and tK seen in UUO animals, whereas it had no effect in <b>control</b> <b>animals.</b> We conclude that, in UUO animals, renal decapsulation partially corrects the inhibition of apical Na+ and K+ conductances as well as basolateral Na(+) -K+ pump activity and relative K+ conductance seen after UUO, whereas in <b>control</b> <b>animals</b> it has no effect. The increased renal pressure may partly contribute to the defects in Na+ and K+ transport in the CCD from obstructed kidneys. Renal decapsulation has protective effects on impaired Na+ and K+ transports in the CCD after ureteral obstruction...|$|R
