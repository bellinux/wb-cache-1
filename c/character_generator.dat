Video camera equipment includes four Sony BVP-700 CCD cameras, and two Sony BVP-750 CCD handheld cameras, both using Vinten pedestals. A GVG 4000-3 digital component production switcher, and GVG 7000 digital component routing switcher {{are used to}} route visual feeds to the control room, with multiple digital and analogue video recorders used to store footage. Graphics are provided by a Chyron Lyric Pro <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> and an Avid Deko <b>character</b> <b>generator.</b> Audio facilities consist of a Calrec T Series digitally controlled analogue mixing console, and a Yamaha digital mixing console used for tape playback support and utility audio work. While exact budgets for other seasons are not known, the 39th season (2013–2014) had a budget of just over $70million, for which it received a subsidy from New York State {{in the amount of}} $12.3million.|$|E
25|$|Later, the FCC {{determined}} which teleport uplink sites {{out of the}} 2,000 licensed transmitters in the United States had {{the capability}} to override the HBO signal. That narrowed it down to 580 uplink sites that had sufficiently large antennas that had the capability of broadcasting the signal. The manufacturer that produced the <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> graphics model used to generate the typeface on the television screen was also identified after studying footage of the jamming. Tape machines were not running during the jamming, but investigators from the commission obtained copies from an FCC engineer and HBO viewers. The FCC removed stations {{from the list of}} 500 that were inoperative on April 27 or transmitting other material. This method brought the number of potential stations down to twelve. After FCC investigators visited these stations, there were now three prime suspects which included MacDougall. The commission later learned an accountant from Wisconsin had overheard MacDougall bragging about the jamming at a payphone in a rest area off Interstate 75 in Gainesville, and obtained a license plate number of a car owned by MacDougall.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{its most}} memorable use was in American {{broadcast}} television graphics.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, [...] "intelligent" [...] {{television}} receivers {{were introduced in}} Japan. The addition of an LSI chip with memory and a <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> to a television receiver enabled Japanese viewers to receive a mix of programming and information transmitted over spare lines of the broadcast television signal. A patent was published in 1994 (and extended the following year) for an [...] "intelligent" [...] television system, linked with data processing systems, {{by means of a}} digital or analog network. Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs. The mass acceptance of digital television in late 2000s and early 2010s greatly improved smart TVs. Major TV manufacturers have announced production of smart TVs only, for their middle-end to high-end TVs in 2015. Smart TVs are expected to become the dominant form of television by the late 2010s. At the beginning of 2016, Nielsen reported that 29 percent of those with incomes over $75,000 a year had a smart TV.|$|E

50|$|Monoscopes {{were used}} as <b>character</b> <b>generators</b> for text mode video {{rendering}} in computer displays {{for a short time}} in the 1960s. The CBS Laboratories Vidiac, and the A. B. Dick 990 System, were among the earliest <b>character</b> <b>generators</b> for broadcast television. CBS Laboratories later developed the more advanced Vidifont system in preparation for the 1968 US presidential elections, where a rapid method of all-electronic character generation was required so that news outlets could identify unexpected interviewees on the spot. A similar generator using analogue electronics, Anchor, was developed by the BBC in 1970 and used in the general election later that year.|$|R
2500|$|On April 26, 1986, MacDougall {{worked at}} his shop as normal, and closed at 4:00p.m. EST. After eating dinner, he {{reported}} to Central Florida Teleport with one other engineer on duty. The second engineer left at 6:00p.m., leaving MacDougall {{to operate the}} building on his own. MacDougall oversaw the uplink of the movie Pee-wee's Big Adventure {{as part of the}} evening's programming for the pay-per-view network People's Choice, which used Central Florida Teleport's facilities. After the film ended, he went through his regular routine. Before logging off, MacDougall set up SMPTE color bars and punched buttons on a Microgen MG-100 <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> that placed letters on the television screen. He spent a couple of minutes composing his message. MacDougall began his message with a polite greeting as he did not wish to be insulting.

5000|$|Lower thirds {{are also}} often known as [...] "CG" [...] (from <b>character</b> <b>generator)</b> or captions, and {{sometimes}} chyrons in North America, {{due to the}} popularity of Chyron Corporation's Chiron I <b>character</b> <b>generator,</b> an early digital solution developed in the 1970s for rendering lower thirds.

5000|$|Character {{generators}} {{are primarily}} {{used in the}} broadcast areas of live television sports or television news presentations, given that the modern <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> can rapidly (i.e., [...] "on the fly") generate high-resolution, animated graphics for use when an unforeseen situation in a broadcast dictates an opportunity for breaking news coverage—for example, when, in a football game, a previously unknown player begins to have what looks to become an outstanding day, the <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> operator can rapidly build a new graphic using the template [...] "shell" [...] of a similarly-designed graphic. The <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> {{is one of many}} technologies used {{to meet the demands of}} live television, where events on the field or in the newsroom dictate the direction of the coverage.
