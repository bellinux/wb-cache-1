50|$|The {{common names}} <b>cape</b> <b>jasmine</b> and cape {{jessamine}} {{derive from the}} earlier belief that the flower originated in Cape of Good Hope, South Africa.|$|E
50|$|He sent various magnolias {{and some}} Gordonia {{specimens}} to London, and wrote descriptions of Stillingia and Fothergilla, but ironically the plant {{named for him}} {{was nothing to do}} with his efforts, and not even American. Linnaeus had to be pushed to name a plant after Garden, and eventually Ellis persuaded him to use Gardenia as a name for the <b>Cape</b> <b>jasmine,</b> also known as Cape jessamine.|$|E
50|$|In 1748 Warner {{received}} {{a visit from}} Pehr Kalm, the disciple of Linnæus, then {{on his way to}} North America. Warner took Kalm to London, to Peter Collinson's garden at Peckham, to visit Philip Miller in Chelsea, and to see the aging Sir Hans Sloane. Warner then received from the Cape of Good Hope the so-called <b>Cape</b> <b>jasmine</b> (Gardenia jasminoides), which flowered in his hothouse. John Ellis in a letter to Linnæus dated 21 July 1758, proposed should be called Warneria; Warner, however, objected, and it was named Gardenia. Miller dedicated a genus to him in 1760, but it had been given the name Hydrastis by Linnæus in the previous year.|$|E
50|$|Gardenia jasminoides, (gardenia, <b>cape</b> <b>jasmine,</b> cape jessamine, danh-danh, or jasmin) is an {{evergreen}} {{flowering plant}} {{of the family}} Rubiaceae. It originated in Asia and is most commonly found growing wild in Vietnam, Southern China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Myanmar, and India. With its shiny green leaves and heavily fragrant white summer flowers, it is widely used in gardens in warm temperate and subtropical climates, and as a houseplant in temperate regions. It has been in cultivation in China {{for at least a}} thousand years, and was introduced to English gardens in the mid 18th century. Many varieties have been bred for horticulture, with low growing, and large-and long-flowering forms.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the book}} Mississippi by Marlo Carter Kirkpatrick, the mansion is {{described}} as, [...] "the finest example of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in the state." [...] In Elmo Howell's book Mississippi Scenes: Notes on Literature and History (page 59), {{the grounds of}} the mansions are described:"The grounds fall off sharply on one side, with a balustraded descent to formal gardens, an arbor and reflecting pool. A good part of the original planting survives: azalea, <b>Cape</b> <b>jasmine,</b> crepe myrtle, and camellia, the Governor's favorite flower."Howell goes on to tell how White went as far as to employ an expert gardener from Japan who was proficient in the cultivation of camellias.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to the {{documents}} and nongovernmental recording, there had been various color names of textiles in Qing dynasty. For example, {{there were at least}} 40 colors recorded in the official documents. Process of dyeing got to be good and stable in Qianlong 19 th, there were at least 30 different dyeing processes at that time, such as direct dyeing, mordant dyeing, deoxidize dyeing and so on, or something more complicate. The dye stuff included indigo, rhubarb, young fustic, safflower, brazilwood, buds of pagoda tree, Amur cork, <b>cape</b> <b>jasmine,</b> gall, hulls of acorn. Dyeing additives included alum, alkali, prunus mume and almond oil. Rules for blue, red, green dyeing were stricter, while that for yellow and other colors were more flexible. The colors of textiles in Qing dynast...|$|E
40|$|Objective(s) : Gardenia jasminoides Ellis (GJ, <b>Cape</b> <b>Jasmine</b> Fruit, Zhi Zi) {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{used for the}} treatment of infectious hepatitis, aphthous ulcer, and trauma; however, the direct evidence is lacking. Materials and Methods:We investigated the effect of the GJ extract(GJ) and gallic acid (GA) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammation of BV- 2 microglial cells and acute liver injury in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Results:Our results showed that the GJ extract and GA reduced LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO), interleukin (IL) - 1, IL- 6, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and prostaglandin (PGE 2) production in BV- 2 cells. The GJ extract and GA significantly decreased serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in LPS-treated rats. Furthermore, the water extract, but not the ethanol extract, of the GJ dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced JNK 2 / 1 and slightly p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression in BV- 2 cells. Conclusion:Taken together, these results indicate that the protective mechanism of the GJ extract involves an antioxidant effect and inhibition of JNK 2 / 1 MAP kinase and COX- 2 expressions in LPS-induced inflammation of BV- 2 cells...|$|E
40|$|Crocetin is {{a natural}} {{carotenoid}} dicarboxylic acid that {{is found in the}} fruit of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis (<b>Cape</b> <b>Jasmine)</b> and in the stamen and pistil of Crocus sativus L. (saffron). It is used worldwide as an important spice, food colorant, and herbal medicine. In the current investigation, we have examined the cardiovascular effects of crocetin using stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs). Male SHRSPs (6 [*]weeks old) were classified into three groups: a control group and two crocetin groups (25 and 50 [*]mg/kg/day). The animals were given crocetin for 3 [*]weeks. Body weights in each group were not significantly different during the treatment period, but the increase in systolic blood pressures observed with age was significantly moderated by crocetin. Thrombogenesis, assessed using a He-Ne laser technique in pial vessels, was significantly decreased. Antioxidant activity, assessed by measuring urinary 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine levels, together with urinary nitric oxide (NO) metabolite levels, was increased significantly after treatment. Acetylcholine-induced vasodilation was measured using the aorta and indicated that endothelial function was significantly improved by crocetin. These results strongly suggest that the antihypertensive and antithrombotic effects of crocetin were related to an increase in bioavailable NO, possibly mediated by decreased inactivation of NO by reactive oxygen species...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of outpatients' medical records {{concerning}} primary liver cancer (PLC), data of 552 patients (with 2 020 effective prescriptions) from the Outpatient Department of Changhai Hospital treated by Professor Ling Changquan were collected. The nature, flavor and meridian distribution of the herbs used in the prescriptions were summarized by frequency method, and {{the features of the}} herbs used according to syndrome differentiation were analyzed by logistic regression. The couple herbs used were analyzed by cluster analysis. All the data were analyzed in combination with the experience of the specialist. It showed that most of the frequently used herbs were herbs for invigorating the spleen to promote appetite, removing toxic materials to inhibit tumor growth, and activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis. These herbs are mostly of plain or cool nature, and mainly of sweet, bitter, or acrid taste. It also showed that the most frequently used herbs for qi deficiency were Astragalus membranaceus, Atractylodes macrocephala, and Pseudostellariae; Caulis Spatholobi and Chinese jujube for blood asthenia; Fructus Corni and Ophiopogon japonicus for yin deficiency; Agastache rugosa, Semen Plantaginis and Poria for water-dampness; <b>cape</b> <b>jasmine</b> fruit and baikal skullcap root for heat excess; peach seed and Radix Paeoniae Rubra for blood stasis; Curcuma wenyujin, Akebia trifoliata and Bupleurum chinense for qi stagnation. A total of 19 pairs of couple herbs were summarized by the cluster analysis...|$|E
