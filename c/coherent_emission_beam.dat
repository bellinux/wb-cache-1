40|$|Nearly a {{dozen of}} Rotating RAdio Transients (RRATs) have been {{discovered}} recently. These objects share similar spin parameters with normal radio pulsars but distinguish themselves from normal pulsars by being quiescent {{most of the time}} and only becoming radio bright occasionally.

40|$|Abstract. Core and conal <b>emission</b> <b>beams</b> {{of radio}} pulsars have been {{identified}} observationally (Rankin 1983, 1993 a,b; Lyne and Manchester 1988). In the inner gap model (Ruderman and Sutherland 1975, hereafter RS 75), the gap continually breaks down (sparking) by forming electron-positron pairs on a time scale of a few microseconds (RS 75). This makes a large amplitude low frequency wave which would be scattered by relativistic particles moving out from the gap. Under this assumption, Qiao (1988 a, 1992) presented an Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) model for both core and conal emissions. This paper develops the model. Retardation and aberration effects due to different radiation components emitted from different heights are considered. The luminosity of pulsar radio emission via the ICS process is discussed. <b>Coherent</b> <b>emission</b> by bunches of particles is adequate to explain pulsar radiation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} pitch-angle {{anisotropy}} of fast electrons on generation of nonthermal radio emission is studied. Incoherent gyrosynchrotron radiation {{is shown to}} depend strongly on the anisotropy. In particular, the spectral index of gyrosynchrotron radiation increases up to a factor of 3 - 4 compared with the isotropic case. The degree of polarization (X-mode) increases for loss-cone distributions, while decreases for beam-like distributions. Ample evidence of the pitch-angle anisotropy effect on (1) spatial distribution of the radio brightness, (2) spatially resolved light curves of the intensity and polarization, (3) spectral hardness of microwave bursts, is found by exploring observations performed with Nobeyama Radioheliograph and Owens Valley Solar Array. Above some threshold in the angular gradient, the electron cyclotron maser instability (<b>coherent</b> gyrosynchrotron <b>emission)</b> can develop, provided that standard gyrosynchrotron emission {{is accompanied by a}} lower-frequency intense <b>coherent</b> <b>emission.</b> The <b>coherent</b> <b>emission</b> is studied in detail for a realistic distribution of fast electrons over the energy and pitch-angle. In agreement with observations of narrowband radio spikes, it is found that (1) hard (power-law) distributions over energy are preferable to produce the <b>coherent</b> <b>emission,</b> (2) the threshold of the instability corresponds to quite an anisotropic electron distribution, thus, the pitch-angle anisotropy derived from the properties of the continuum gyrosynchrotron radiation will not necessarily give rise to <b>coherent</b> <b>emission</b> (either enhanced isotropization implied by quasilnear saturation of the instability) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} a novel two-photon {{excitation}} stimulated emission depletion (2 PE-STED) microscope based on time-gated detection. The time-gated detection allows for the effective silencing of the fluorophores using moderate stimulated <b>emission</b> <b>beam</b> intensity. This opens the possibility of implementing an efficient 2 PE-STED microscope with a stimulated <b>emission</b> <b>beam</b> running in a continuous-wave.

We recover the SNR and the SBR through a multi-image deconvolution algorithm. Indeed, the algorithm simultaneously reassigns early-photons (normally discarded by the time-gated detection) to their original positions and removes the background induced by the stimulated <b>emission</b> <b>beam.</b> We exemplify the benefits of this implementation by imaging sub-cellular structures.
