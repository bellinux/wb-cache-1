40|$|The {{relationship}} of retinoid and carotenoid metabolism with <b>caecotrophy</b> was studied in adult female New Zealand White rabbits kept in individual metabolic cages. <b>Caecotrophy</b> was prevented {{by the use}} of plastic collars. The dry matter, crude protein, fibre, fat and ash contents of hard and soft faecal samples were determined. The retinoid (retinol and retinyl palmitate) and carotenoid (canthaxanthin, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein and zeaxanthin) levels of the blood, liver, kidney, caecal content and faeces were also measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The prevention of <b>caecotrophy</b> resulted in a significant decrease of blood retinol (P < 0. 001) and retinyl palmitate (P < 0. 01) concentration but it did not cause any significant change in the retinol and retinyl palmitate contents of the liver and kidney. The caecal content (25. 78 ± 6. 87 µg/g) and the soft faeces (34. 52 ± 10. 48 µg/g) contained the retinoids in similar amounts. Various carotenoids were found in considerable amounts in different types of faeces, while in the tissues (blood, liver and kidney) these pigments did not occur in substantial amounts. Total carotenoid concentration was similar in the caecal content (11. 23 μg/g) and in the caecotroph (13. 85 μg/g). On the basis of the results it can be assumed that the retinoid content of rabbit feed could be lowered in the presence of adequate caecal function and <b>caecotrophy...</b>|$|E

30|$|Each hare {{stomach was}} dissected, and small {{quantities}} {{of its contents}} were removed systematically from five points along the stomach axis. This method was applied as stomach content includes both newly grazed and re-ingested material that differentiates from {{the entrance of the}} stomach to the exit (pylorus). This is caused mainly due to <b>caecotrophy</b> during the day. As this study aimed to determine hare diet composition during all the feeding period, it was thought more appropriate to acquire samples from five different positions rather than one mixed sample (Sokos and Andreadis 2000; Kontsiotis et al. 2011).|$|E

40|$|Aiming to {{evaluate}} the digestive use and performance of growing rabbits fed with diets con- taining sugarcane bagasse enriched with vinasse, 118 New Zealand white rabbits was used in a digestibility, <b>caecotrophy</b> and performance trials. The experimental design was completely randomized, being applied in the digestibility and <b>caecotrophy</b> three treatments (a reference diet, a diet containing sugarcane bagasse and a diet containing sugarcane bagasse enriched with vinasse) and in performance trial, four treatments (0, 50, 100 and 150 g kg - 1 of bagasse enriched with vinasse). The data were subjected to variance analysis and subsequently carried out comparisons between the averages of the treatments. The bagasse enriched or not with vinasse changes consumption, excretion and the digestibility coefficients of dry matter, mineral matter, organic matter, crude protein, ether extract and gross energy. The inclusion of vinasse promotes {{the improvement of the}} values of digestible energy and digestible protein of bagasse. There was no change in the dry matter of the ceco- trophes, while there wasn’t on the crude protein of cecotrophes by the inclusion of the bagasse enriched or not with vinasse. There was a reduction of the nutritional contribution in dry matter, from the inclusion of test feeds. This did not affect nutritional contribution in crude protein. The use of bagasse enriched with vinasse in diets for growing rabbits proved viable, so that the inclusion did not alter the average daily weight gain of ani- mals and therefore, the time required to reach slaughter weight...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Rate {{of passage}} was {{measured}} on 12 rabbits, either allowed to practice <b>caecotrophy</b> (Control period, from 56 to 60 days of age) or prevented from consuming soft faeces by wearing a plastic collar (without soft faeces intake = WSF periods, 63 - 66 d old and 70 - 73 d old). Measurements of digestive transit {{of the solid}} phase of the digesta were carried out by analysing the kinetics of faecal excretion of a fibre particles labelled with 141 Ce. The excretion pattern of hard and soft faeces, hourly quantified during three complete 24 -h cycle during WSF periods, showed that hard faeces excretion averaged 35. 3 ± 3. 2 g/day DM, while caecotrophes excretion was meanly 10. 7 ± 2. 6 g DM/d for a mean feed intake of 113. 7 g DM/d. During the control period, daily hard faeces excretion was not significantly different (36. 4 ± 3. 0 g DM/d, for a feed intake of 110. 8 g DM/d). The DM digestibility did not differ during control and WSF periods (67. 2 and 67. 8 %). If caecotrophe production {{is included in the}} DM digestibility calculation, coefficient fell by 10. 5 units (mean = 57. 3 %). When soft faeces intake was prevented (period WSF), the mean retention time in the whole tract evolved from 23 h (Control) to 15 h (- 34 %) and the minimal transit time was 50 % shorter. The caecal mean retention time passed from 17 h in Control to 10 h (- 40 %) in WSF period. Caecal retention of large particles seemed less affected (CRlp:- 23 %) than fine (CRfp:- 48 %).

40|$|The {{influence}} of addition {{of different types}} of wooden sticks as gnawing material for environmental enrichment on some behavioural and fattening traits was studied on 48 male New Zealand White rabbits of Slovenian male line SIKA. Animals were housed individually in wire cages equipped with feeder and nipple drinkers. Feed and water were available ad libitum, the duration of lighting was 12 hours. According to the type of wood placed in the cage, rabbits were equally allotted to four groups: control, oak, lime and Norway spruce. Rabbit behaviour was studied on 16 focus animals using continuous 24 hours video recording. Environmental enrichment had no significant influence on fattening traits and behaviour, except for eating, wood gnawing and frequency of <b>caecotrophy.</b> Rabbits in Norway spruce group ate significantly less time and less frequently and gnawed wood significantly longer and more often than rabbits in oak group...|$|E
40|$|Circadian {{variations}} in plasma iron levels were first reported in humans in 1937. Influences {{of the sleeping}} pattern and of plasma cortisol and adrenaline levels on these variations {{as well as the}} reproducibility of the phenomenon itself are discussed controversially in the literature. The influence of food intake, however, was not considered in most of the studies and is therefore subject of this investigation. Circadian plasma iron and plasma transferrin variations were determined in rabbits and compared under free access to food and under starvation (<b>caecotrophy</b> was not prevented). Population-mean-cosinor analysis of circadian plasma iron concentrations showed similar {{variations in}} the fed and starved condition (mesor: 116. 6 micrograms/dl vs 118. 1 micrograms/dl, acrophase 0752 hr vs 0728) except for a significant increase of the circadian amplitude under free access to food (30. 9 micrograms/dl vs 22. 3 micrograms/dl, P less than 0. 05). There was no variation in plasma transferrin, which shows that 24 hr variations in plasma iron are not caused by modulation of plasma transferrin. These findings demonstrate a circadian rhythm for plasma iron, the amplitude of which is increased by food intake...|$|E
40|$|The {{literary}} part of {{the thesis}} deals with the nutrition of rabbits, their digestive system, nutrients, <b>caecotrophy,</b> nutritional requirements and an overview of suitable feed. The second {{part of the}} review describes sorghum, its characteristics, nutritional substances and its use as a feed component in the complete feed mixtures. The experimental part includes evaluating the appropriateness dried plant sorghum as a feed component with low starch for rabbits. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the nutritional value of sorghum as a feed component in the diet of broiler rabbits. Dried and milled green mass sorghum was included in two levels (10 % and 18 %) in the experimental compound feed for fattened Hyla rabbits. Complete feed mixtures have been compiled, based on the nutritional requirements of rabbits in fattening period. It was administered to 27 animals (9 per group), they were weighed and monitored during the experiment. During the experiment were monitored parameters fattening (growth, feed conversion). Based on analyzes of feed and feces was determined by total digestible nutrients selected. Balance digestibility was calculated as the difference between the nutrient content of the feed and the solid feces, expressed by digestibility coefficient (%). The best values in the balance sheet amounted digestibility control mixture K. However, the animals thrived and grew well even when fed experimental mixtures C+ 10 and C+ 18 represented by dried green mass sorghum. On the basis of the nutritional balance examination it was not possible to disprove the hypothesis that sweet sorghum is appropriate component into complete feed mixtures for fattened rabbits...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{anaerobic}} status of the caecal biotope in the rabbit through the measurement of its redox potential (Eh). Since the caecal content has a high viscosity, {{the duration of the}} Eh measurement is high (10 to 20 min) and two methods were compared in 10 week- old rabbits: in vivo vs. post-mortem. In addition, Eh, pH and temperature of the caecal digesta were analysed according to <b>caecotrophy</b> and three periods in the day (soft faeces production: 08 : 00 - 10 : 00 h and 12 : 00 - 14 : 00 h; hard faeces production: 17 : 00 - 19 : 00 h) were compared, using 34 rabbits aged 65 d and weighing 2. 3 kg. Caecal Eh decreased 2 min after measurement began, and then stabilised from 20 min onwards (from − 152 to 221 mV, P< 0. 001), in contrast to caecal pH which remained constant over time. Mean values for Eh (at 20 min) and pH were - 219 mV and 6. 2 respectively, and did not change according to method or collection period. Only the caecal temperature was 2 °C higher (P< 0. 001) for the in vivo (39 °C) than for the post-mortem (37 °C) method. Average caecal dry matter and total volatile fatty acid were on average 22 % and 106 mmol/L, and were affected neither by the method nor by the collection period. Caecal Eh was negatively correlated to caecal pH (R²= 0. 22; P= 0. 006, n= 34), but not to other biotope traits. The Eh measurement in rabbit caecal content could be performed with a minimum recommended duration of 20 min, under anaesthesia or post-mortem. We confi rmed that the rabbit caecal ecosystem is highly anaerobic...|$|E
40|$|Separation of low {{digestible}} fibres and fermentation of the digestible part of {{the food}} in the caecum is an adaptation of some small herbivores to cope with low-quality forage. The caecum content is later re-ingested as soft faeces so that the herbivore can benefit from this protein-rich material. This is known as <b>caecotrophy</b> and is a common phenomenon in species of leporids, although differences exist between hares and rabbits. Hares have amorphous soft faeces {{and the amount of}} soft faeces produced is smaller compared to that of rabbits. Both factors suggest that hares have smaller benefits from re-ingestion of the caecal contents compared with rabbits and, as a consequence, have a less efficient digestion (mainly of nitrogen) compared to rabbits. The assertion was tested whether digestive efficiency is different between the two herbivores and how this affects the choice of food plants in a natural situation. A feeding trial was conducted using hares and rabbits fed with diets with a range of fibre contents. Dry matter digestibility was not different, but nitrogen digestibility was lower in hares than in rabbits, indicating a less efficient digestion of protein. Both taxa showed a different response to increased fibre content in the diet. Rabbits maximized digestibility by increasing retention time of the food, hares maximized digestion rate by increasing the passage rate of the food through the digestive tract. The daily digestible nitrogen intake was higher in hares Lepus europaeus than that in rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, indicating that hares compensated for their lower nitrogen digestibility. Hares were predicted to select for higher quality plant species in a natural situation, but they had, on average, a lower nitrogen and higher total fibre content in their diet compared to sympatrically occurring rabbits. This indicated that hares did not compensate for their lower digestive efficiency by selecting higher quality food plants. The present experiment shows that hares and rabbits have different digestive strategies to cope with low quality forage. Rabbits had a higher N-digestibility by increasing the retention time, whereas hares appeared to compensate for their lower N-digestibility by increasing the processing rate, when food quality deteriorated...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se neste estudo a avaliação da atividade microbiana cecal e a contribuição nutricional da cecotrofia em coelhos alimentados com rações contendo diferentes níveis de amido (22 a 32 % em média) mediante a inclusão de milho grão e diferentes fontes de fibra (feno de alfafa ou casca de soja), em esquema fatorial 2 x 2. No primeiro experimento, 40 coelhos alojados em gaiolas de engorda individuais, em delineamento inteiramente casualizado e alimentados à vontade dos 45 aos 85 dias de idade, foram abatidos para coleta dos conteúdos ileais e cecais. A concentração de ácidos graxos voláteis foi influenciada pela interação entre tratamentos, sendo 93, 82 mmol/l para ração de maior nível de amido com casca de soja e 80, 03 mmol/l para ração de menor nível de amido com feno de alfafa. No segundo experimento, 40 coelhos aos 65 dias de idade, alojados em gaiolas de engorda individuais, em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, foram alimentados à vontade por 10 dias, e receberam colares de madeira para permitir a coleta total de cecotrofos. Houve influência da interação entre tratamentos sobre os teores de proteína e energia dos cecotrofos, sendo de 29, 66 % e 4204, 87 kcal/kg para ração contendo maiores níveis de amido e casca de soja e de 27, 98 % e 4080, 46 kcal/kg para ração contendo menores níveis de amido e feno de alfafa.
