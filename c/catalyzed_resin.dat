40|$|ABSTRACT: Urea-formaldehyde resins {{modified}} by melamine were synthesized by four catalysts (H 2 SO 4, HCl, H 3 PO 4, and NaOH/NH 4 OH) with a F/U/M molar ratio of 1. 38 / 1 / 0. 074. Resin structure and thermal behavior were studied by 13 C-NMR and DSC techniques. For H 2 SO 4, HCl, and H 3 PO 4 catalysts, resins were prepared by two stage pH adjustment: the first pH stage {{was set at}} 1. 25 (H 3 PO 4 pH 1. 60) and second pH stage was set at 5. 0. For the NaOH/NH 4 OH catalyst, the resin was set at pH 5. 0 from the start. Of the four catalysts, HCl <b>catalyzed</b> <b>resins,</b> with the highest free urea and lowest free formaldehyde, consistently yielded the lowest formaldehyde emission; NaOH/NH 4 OH catalyst resulted in the best IB strength tested at dry conditions and also after 24 h cold water soak and the lowest water absorption and thickness swell. The <b>resins</b> <b>catalyzed</b> with H 3 PO 4 had the highest free formaldehyde and no free urea yielding the highest formaldehyde emission. Each DSC thermogram was proceeded by a weak exothermic peak and followed by an obvious endothermic peak. The exothermic peak temperatures were 125. 0, 131. 1, 111. 4, and 125. 2 C, and endothermic peak temperatures were 135. 8, 147. 6, 118. 9, and 138. 4 C, respectively, for H 2 SO 4, HCl, H 3 PO 4, and NaOH/NH 4 OH catalysts.

40|$|Fabrication of {{composite}} parts can be {{done with}} a variety of methods including pultrusion and filament winding for simple geometries, autoclave curing for high quality parts, and liquid composite molding for complex geometries. While each has its own advantage and application domains, liquid molding is a promising technique for rapid fabrication of net-shaped composite parts. Of the liquid composite molding techniques, vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) is renowned for its simplicity and low cost in fabricating large structures. One particular challenge in liquid molding techniques, in general, is the filling of fibrous preform-laden mold with <b>catalyzed</b> <b>resin.</b> The permeability variability causes nonuniformity in the fill patterns, and often leads to entrapped voids and dry spots in the product. The first goal of the dissertation is to devise an active control strategy that overcomes this problem. A novel scheme based on the concept of locally altering the resin viscosity in real time, in areas of low permeability, is explored both numerically and experimentally, by considering the VARTM process. ^ A second focus of the dissertation is on the fabrication of composites with carbon nanotube reinforcements. Effective design and engineering of the process requires fundamental information on the chemorheology and the cure kinetics of the reactive resins filled with carbon nanotubes. Fundamental information on the cure kinetics and chemorheology is determined {{for the first time to}} elucate the role of nano-scale reinforcements, their morphology, and geometry on the viscosity and cure reaction rate. ^ The interface between the carbon nanotubes and the surrounding resin has been the subject of much attention in the literature. Effective load transfer requires a good nanotube/resin interface, which has generally been a challenge to realize. The generally weak interface, however, is attractive for applications of composites that require excellent damping properties of the structures. A systematic experimental study of the effects of carbon nanotube morphology, loading, geometry and the processing of composites with these reinforcements on the damping characteristics is presently lacking, and the third objective of the dissertation is to fill this void. ^ Overall, this dissertation makes fundamental advances in the processing of composites with micron- and nano-scale reinforcements. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the {{interest}} of the aerial and terrestrial transport industry in the fabrication of textile-reinforced composite materials has sensibly grown. This is basically due to the remarkable properties of these materials, which combine high mechanical strength with reduced weight. The manufacturing techniques that provide better control on the final quality of the components rely on autoclave curing: heat and pressure are applied on vacuum bags to achieve high volume fractions of the reinforcement and low number of defects due to the presence of voids. Nevertheless, autoclave curing implies high costs for the acquisition of the vessel and the process is energy and time consuming. To reduce the production costs, the industry has increased its interest in out-of-autoclave processing technologies, that is, liquid composite molding (LCM) techniques. In its most basic version, the technique consists in the injection of a <b>catalyzed</b> <b>resin</b> into a closed cavity, where a pre-placed fiber stack lies. When the resin has completely permeated the preform, the mold is subject to high temperatures to induce the curing of the resin to obtain the composite. The current challenge for this technology is to achieve the same quality standards for the final component as those achievable with in-autoclave processing. In LCM processes, the final quality of the component depends on several factors, such as: the structure of the textile, the arrangement of the layers, the adaption to the mold, the compaction process, the operating conditions, the geometry of the component, the configuration of the injection points for the resin, the physical and chemical interactions between the resin and the textile. All these factors affect the correct saturation of the reinforcement, and therefore process parameters must be adequately controlled in order to guarantee the required quality standards for the composite. In this sense, mold filling simulation software is a valuable tool for the process optimization; however the permeability of the reinforcement is required as an input parameter. An accurate evaluation of the permeability of the reinforcement however, represents a challenging task. Fibrous preforms for LCM generally present a hierarchical structure: the fibers are bunched in yarns, which in turn are bundled in a fabric. This structure, undergoes complex deformations during the production process: 1) during the compaction in the mold and 2) during the injection of the resin. This issue remarkably complicates an accurate evaluation of the permeability of the reinforcement and may be at the origin of the scatter observed in the experimental measurements. From a modeling point of view, the different length scales {{to be taken into account}} (typically ranging between one and three orders of magnitude) hinders a proper simulation of the deformation of the textile. The typical diameter of the fibers ranges indeed in few micrometers, while the characteristic dimension of the yarns is in the order of the millimeter. This issue represents a constraint for standard numerical approaches due to computational limits. In order to account for the effect on the permeability of the deformation of the hierarchical structure of the preform, multi-scale modeling techniques must be adopted. The objective of the thesis is the development of novel theoretical and numerical frameworks to account for the effect on the permeability of the multi-scale deformations that the textile undergoes during the two aforementioned stages of the process. The development focuses on the fiber-yarn level in 2 D, where the yarn is always modeled as suspension of fibers by analogy with a complex fluid. The numerical implementations use computational fluid dynamic (CFD) tools. In order to address the problem, the permeability of a textile preform for LCM is first analyzed by experimental means. A standard CFD approach is then adopted for the simulation of a representative elementary volume of the textile; it is shown that, by means of this approach, the experimental permeability cannot be recovered over the full range of porosities. An X-ray computed microtomography of the textile is then performed. The obtained data are used for the virtual reconstruction of the exact geometry of the textile after its use for LCM. The simulations with this latter geometry provide better results; however the uncertainties on permeability still hold, and the permeability is always overestimated. These uncertainties are discussed in detail and motivate the work described hereafter. The first modeling block of the thesis concerns the analysis of the deformation that the textiles undergo during the compaction in the mold. A continuum model is first developed and validated for the squeeze flow of epoxy-based materials, the rheology of which is given by a viscoplastic constitutive law. The model is then applied to the compaction of yarns, where a viscoplastic behavior for the fiber bundle is assumed in the quasi-static regime of compression and by an analogy with flowing granular media. The rheological parameters are obtained from experimental data by a simplified analytical model for the deformation of the yarns under compaction. The commercial CFD code ANSYS Fluent is adopted for the numerical solution. The model yields information about the evolution of the fiber volume fraction during the compaction and is found to correctly recover the experimental force for high compression ratios. The second modeling block of the thesis concerns the analysis of the deformation that the textiles undergo during the injection of the resin. A numerical framework is first developed and validated for the direct numerical simulation of dilute colloidal suspensions of polymeric molecules. The numerical method consists in a coupled finite-volume/lattice-Boltzmann solution: finite volume method for hydrodynamics and lattice Boltzmann method for the sub-grid-scale physics. For computational efficiency, the lattice Boltzmann solution is accelerated on a graphic processing unit (GPGPU) with a tailored implementation and efficiently coupled with the macroscopic solver (ANSYS Fluent). The numerical method is then exploited for the solution of a mesoscopic model for the flow-induced fiber dynamics during the injection. A statistical model for the fiber dynamics is derived, based on analogy of the yarn with a non-Brownian suspension of particles with confining potentials. The fiber topology during the injection is recovered by a topological invariant and yields information about the change in permeability due to the clustering of fibers in steady-state, fully-saturated conditions. The results are presented in the form of phase diagrams, which show that in the deformable case the permeability can be up to one order of magnitude lower than in the rigid case. On the basis of the results obtained, the following main conclusions can be drawn: 1. The model developed for the compaction in the mold showed to be appropriate for a phenomenological analysis of the deformation of the yarns under compression. The model allows to analyze quantitatively the evolution of the fiber volume fraction, which yields useful information for a better understanding of the distribution of the fibers before the injection. 2. The model developed for the fiber dynamics during the injection, allows to analyze their topology induced by the fluid flow. The clustering of fibers significantly reduces the permeability at the fiber level, which could explain the overestimation obtained with simplified numerical approaches. The phase diagrams obtained for the permeability, both at the yarn and fiber level, allow to identify the best operating conditions for the infiltration of the resin. The proposed models have been developed using fluid dynamic techniques, which opens the possibility for a unified framework for the analysis, and ultimately, for a more precise estimation of the permeability. This work aims to represent a first tentative in this direction...|$|E

Brass (CuZn) does not influence the stability regardless of concentration but the wear characteristics after friction process of brass containing samples were extremely high if compared to other ones.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of ion-exchange resins {{provide the basis}} for many processes of practical interest involving both sorption separations and catalytic reactions. The optimal design and operation of these processes require a proper understanding of the equilibrium behavior of multicomponent liquid mixtures in contact with cross-linked polymeric resins, in terms of both the amount and composition of the sorbed mixture. For this, a model which describes the equilibrium between a polymer phase, described through the extended Flory-Huggins theory, and a liquid phase, which does not contain the polymer, has been developed. This has then been coupled with a kinetic model describing the catalytic reaction inside the resin particles. The model has been validated through an appropriate experimental analysis involving both equilibrium partitioning and reactive experiments, for the case of a highly cross-linked sulfonated resin in the presence of various mixtures of the components involved in the esterification of ethanol with acetic acid. The results indicate the ability of the resin not only to catalyze the esterification reaction but also to, shift the corresponding equilibrium conversion, due to its swelling capability.

40|$|Acrylic acid (AA) is an {{important}} component for the production of acrylate polymer. In a typical acrylic manufacturing unit, waste water contains AA in a range of 4 – 15 wt. % contributes to the high values of chemical oxygen demand. Due to the toxicity of AA to the aquatic organism, this wastewater should be treated before it is discharged to the environment. The waste water could be evaporated before sending to the incineration which was neither economic feasible nor environmental friendly. Esteriﬁcation of wastewater containing carboxylic acid with alcohol could be a promising method to recover the acid by converting it to ester while purifying the wastewater. In the present study, recovery of AA via esteriﬁcation with 2 -ethyl hexanol (2 EH) was investigated. The model industrial wastewater with various concentration of AA (10 – 100 % w/w) was reacted with 2 EH to produce 2 -ethyl hexyl acrylate (2 EHA) in the setups with total reﬂux and continuouslywater removal.

Using the procedures outlined in ASTM D- 2344, each sample set of ten specimens was short-beam shear tested using a 20 mm span with 0. 125 in diameter load nose and supports. The short-beam shear testing of each specimen forced interlaminar shear between the primary and secondary layers, allowing for characterization of the bond strength at different hardnesses. After preliminary testing, all samples showed statistically significant differences with a trend of increasing bond strength with decreasing hardnesses. Twenty percent of the samples delaminated while the other sample failed under flexure loads. The samples that were bonded at higher hardnesses failed under lower loads in tension and compression rather than in shear.

Precisely, we developed a method for the strong immobilization of the HPA onto silica via a link of zirconia and obtained stable-toward-leaching catalysts (first group of catalysts) which can be easily recycled for the further uses. The Si(HIPE) -materials (second group) have convenient shape that makes them easy to operate but they inhibited the reaction due to entrapment of the reagents and products inside their small pores. The work dedicated to MNP (third group) investigated different approaches to protect MNP for the use at the low pH. We found that silica coating of MNP as well as organic silane grafting promote the MNP stability. The surface of coated and grafted MNP was then modified with sulfonic moieties. The MNP-catalysts are recoverable by magnet, active and recyclable. Concerning the ion-exchange resins (fourth group), they possess unique stability and recyclability showing potential for the industrial applications. For the gel-type resin, a so-called “pre-swelling” step was developed to increase the productivity of the resin.

The equilibrium conversion of triglycerides is affected by various factors namely feed Quality (like free fatty acid content, water content etc.),type of alcohol used, molar ratio of alcohol to triglycerides, type of catalyst, amount of catalyst, reaction temperature, reaction time and stirring rates. The present work reports on the characterization of cotton seed oil and production of biodiesel. This study also reports on the optimal operating parameter for cotton seed oil inbatch reactor. The main thrust of present work was to study the kinetics, modeling and simulation of anionic ion exchange <b>resin</b> <b>catalyzed</b> transesterification of cotton seed oil. Experiments were carried out in batch reactor to generate kinetic data and a kinetic model was developed. The effect of temperature, catalyst concentration and molar ratio of methanol to triglycerides and stirring rates were investigated. A few fuel properties were alsomeasured for biodiesel to observe its competitiveness with onventional diesel fuel. The equilibrium conversions of triglycerides were observed {{to be in the}} range of 85 %. It was also observed that higher conversion was achieved at 6 : 1 molar ratio of ethanol to oil, 2 wt. % of anionic resin catalyst,temperature at 338 K, reaction time of 180 minutes with stirring speed 10 Hz. Model parameters such as order, activation energy and rate constants were calculated, the overall activation energy was also estimated. The rate constants werefound to increase with an increase in temperature and catalyst concentration. Various simulations were also carried out at different conditions. Effects of varying parameters were studied in simulations. This simulation leads {{to a better understanding of}} the influence of the interactions between the reaction parameters and alsohelps to improve the efficiency of the transesterification process...|$|R
40|$|The first {{objective}} of this project was to develop, evaluate and compare two different CO 2 separation (capture) systems. The second was to carry the preferred solution to pre-pilot development and testing. To achieve these objectives we undertook several infrastructure enabling elements: (1) development of a preferred catalyst coupled with its immobilization onto a microporous polymer membrane, (2) design and development of a microporous membrane-based, contained liquid membrane permeator and a membrane-based absorber/desorber apparatus, (3) development of a resin-wafer electrodialytic absorber/desorber apparatus, (4) development and demonstration of a pre-treatment process to condition the feed gas stream, (5) and development of computer modeling of the components and of the integrated system. The first technology was an enzyme catalyzed, membrane supported, contained liquid membrane apparatus whose gas capture was pressure/vacuum and temperature driven. A first embodiment was as a permeator, i. e. a combined absorber/desorber in a single housing. The second embodiment was as discrete absorber and desorber units. The second technology was an enzyme <b>catalyzed,</b> ion exchange <b>resin</b> wafer electrodialytically-based separation. For each of these technologies the objective was to design, manufacture, test and demonstrate the apparatus, first in the laboratory and then at pre-pilot scale, and to run it for sufficient time at the pre-pilot scale to demonstrate stability {{even in the face}} of upset. Tests would include several ranks of coal, which had been appropriately pre-treated to remove NOx, SOx and particles, to a pre-determined acceptance level, as a basis for demonstrating efficient CO{sub 2 } capture. The pre-pilot tests would be run at the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) in North Dakota. A larger scale test (400 m{sup 2 } test unit) would later be run also at EERC. An economic goal was to compare the cost of CO{sub 2 } capture by each of these methods with values obtained when using MEA (monoethanolamine) as a baseline case. Other metrics included capital and operating expense, parasitic loss and cost of electricity. A final goal was to carry out an initial examination of market forces to understand what barriers to entry for installation of CO{sub 2 } capture equipment might exist and their relative importance...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis at hand {{was done in}} cooperation with Uhde Inventa-Fischer {{and as part of}} the EuroBioRef project of the European Union and is therefore divided into two parts. On one hand there was the attempt to substitute the current two-step polylactic acid (PLA) precursor production, which includes the prepolymerisation of aqueous lactic acid and the subsequent depolymerisation to lactide, by direct lactide synthesis. The catalytic effect of amorphous y-aluminia and different zeolites was investigated in a continuously running experimental plant in the gaseous phase. In addition to the experimental results catalyst characterizations such as x-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller isotherm (BET), Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) were done. The use of heterogeneous catalysts proved the feasibility of direct lactide synthesis. The H-ZSM- 5 zeolite with a module of 300 reached with 37, 2 % the highest yield of the screening. For the selective lactide production a high BET surface is needed beside a medium amount of low and high acid centers, which are favorable lewis acid centers. The parameter optimization in combination with the y-alumina increased the yield up to 50, 8 %. According to the current state of technology L-lactid isomer is needed for PLA production. Racemisation of ciral aqueous lactid acid occurred with less than 10 %. The results were influenced by a low desorption rate of the heavy adsorbing high molecular products and the side products of the lactid acid. Experiments under subatmospheric pressure increased the isomer selectivity. On the other hand the esterification of renewable acrylic acid and n-butanol to n-butylacrylate was investigated. The liquid phase reaction is the current method of acrylate production and is done either homogeneously (sulfuric and sulfonic acid) or heterogeneously (ion exchange <b>resins)</b> <b>catalyzed.</b> The disadvantages of this process are the separation of the reaction mixture and the catalysts and the high retention times, which result in low space time yields. The innovative approach was to do the esterification in the gaseous phase, which was accomplished in a continuously running experimental plant with a fixed bedded catalyst. The catalyst screening was done with common esterification catalysts under atmospheric pressure. Irrespective of the catalysts, all experiments showed low yields and high catalyst deactivations. The usage of ion exchange resins, which differed in the amount of divinyl benzole and acid centers, was made possible with the help of subatmospheric pressure and low temperatures (75 °C – 120 °C). The resins showed selectivities up to 85 % (Lewatit 2649). The yield was increased to 42, 4 % by the parameter optimization (S 80, 0 %). In addition, even in long time tests desorption problems of the products from the catalyst surface occurred. But after all a continuous and stable test run was accomplished for 24 hours. Also the production of higher molecular oxiesters was totally suppressed...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays petroleum, {{attributed}} as the ‘mother of all commodities’, {{accounts for}} 35 % of energy consumption, 95 % {{of the transportation}} fuels and 100 % {{of a large number}} of industrially important chemicals and materials. The increasing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere due to fossil hydrocarbon combustion has reached alarming levels urging the use of renewable carbon resources for fuels and chemicals. In chemical industry strategies are being developed for producing chemicals from biomass capable to replace petroleum-derived chemicals. Approaches are typically based on fermentation, gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis from carbon monoxide and hydrogen produced from biomass. Ethers are an important class of chemical compounds that can be derived from biomass. They find lots of applications as fuel additives, inert solvent for specialty applications as well as chemical reactions, fragrance and flavor additives, medical ingredients, anesthetics, etc. Etherification of secondary olefins to produce fuel ethers is reported in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes in gas phase as well as liquid phase conditions. But the etherification of α-olefins is less documented in literature. The goal of this work was to develop a liquid phase, heterogeneous catalytic process for the etherification of typical Fischer - Tropsch α-olefins and monoterpenes for use as fuel additives and specialty solvents. Fischer - Tropsch C 6 -C 10 α-olefins are not useful as such and require upgrading process like isomerization for use as fuel. 1 -Hexene, 1 -octene and 1 -decene were selected as model compounds and ethanol as the model bio-alcohol. The reactions were performed at high pressure (6 MPa) to maintain the reaction mixture in liquid state. Zeolites were identified as prospective catalysts. Zeolite beta with Si/Al ratio of 19 was found to be an excellent catalyst for hydroalkoxylation reactions. Identification of reaction products using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and NMR revealed unique selectivity. Etherification reaction of 1 -hexene with ethanol could be performed using an equimolar feed at low temperature, viz. 423 K. Ethoxy hexanes were the major product with ca. 90 % selectivity with respect to 1 -hexene. 2 -Ethoxy hexane was the majority product. Side reactions such as dehydration of ethanol to form diethyl ether, oligomerization of hexenes and hydration of 1 -hexene to form 2 -hexanol were suppressed. Similar product profiles, activities and selectivities were observed for the etherification of 1 -octene and 1 -decene with ethanol. Etherification of 1 -hexene with higher bio-alcohols viz. 1 -propanol and 1 -butanol was also demonstrated. While selectivity for etherification was always excellent, the conversion did not surpass 60 % typically, even with optimized reaction conditions. For the isomerization of 1 -hexene to internal isomers, thermodynamic equilibrium composition was achieved in the absence of 1 -propanol in the feed while presence of 1 -propanol prevented the achievement of equilibrium. For the etherification reaction, a limitation of the maximum achievable conversion by unfavorable thermodynamic equilibrium was evidenced using computational chemistry methods. Terpenes are a class of natural olefins, the ethers of which are valuable to the perfume industry. In view of the immense applications of terpene ethers as fragrance and flavor additives, specialty solvents like in development of photopolymerizable printing plates, etc., etherification of monoterpene β-citronellene with bio-alcohols was also investigated. β-citronellene is a monoterpene containing two types of double bonds, one terminal α-double bond and an internal β-double bond. Among the different zeolites tested, zeolite beta (Si/Al 19) profiled again to be the best. The etherification reaction was found to occur mostly at the β-double bond with a chemoselectivity of ca. 90 %, which was found out by Density Functional calculations to be due to the difference in stability of the carbocations formed on protonation of the two double bonds. Under optimized conditions, maximum citronellene conversions of ca. 50 % with ca. 80 % selectivity for etherification was achieved, which was also found to be limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. Citronellene isomerization and dimerization were the side reactions occurring. In order to identify the reasons for the superior activity of zeolite beta and in general for identifying the prerequisites for a successful hydroalkoxylation catalyst, physicochemical properties of the catalysts were investigated along with performing experiments with selectively poisoned catalysts. Acid site poisons 2, 4, 6 -collidine and 2, 6 -ditertiarybutyl pyridine cannot enter the channels of the zeolite and hence selectively poison the external surface and pore mouth acid sites. Poisoned catalysts exhibited negligible activity indicating the role of pore mouth and external surface acid sites in etherification reactions. Overall this work highlighted the superior activity and selectivity of zeolite beta in hydroalkoxylation of FT α-olefins and monoterpenes using alcohols which can be produced from biomass via fermentation. Zeolite beta particles are composed of very small crystallites measuring hardly 40 nm each. A zeolite material with such very short channels offers a large number of pore mouths, revealed to be the locus of the catalytic activity. 13 C NMR investigations substantiated the occurrence of pore mouth catalysis mechanism induced by competitive adsorption phenomena. The attractiveness of a continuous flow, fixed bed, liquid phase process to produce chemicals out of biomass in replacement of petrochemical derived commodities like fuel additives, specialty solvents, fragrance and flavor additives is an example of greening of the chemical industry.
