40|$|Abstract. In the {{electronics}} packaging industry, Epoxy Mold Compound (EMC) polymer matrix {{is filled with}} fused silica (SiO 2) to obtain the required roughness and hardness. Gate <b>chip</b> <b>off,</b> which occurs during the degating process in transfer molding {{is one of the}} common defects which contributes to the failure in the proper functioning of the package. During the degating process, surface contact between two solid bodies (degating blade and gate) generate a high shear stress on package, thus creating a high potential for the incidence of gate chip of. In this study, the influence of transfer molding parameters and size of fillers (normal and fine) on the gate <b>chip</b> <b>off</b> were investigated. The application of Design of Experiments (DOE) using regression model and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed that molding parameters do not significantly influence the incidence of gate <b>chip</b> <b>off.</b> Numerical simulation was used to investigate effect of two filler sizes and molding parameters on the mold fill time, end pressure of fill and shear stress at the wall. The results showed there were no significant influences on mold fill time but the fine filler showed lower pressure at the end of fill and lower shear stress at the wall. Experimental results of two sizes if filler shown that fine filler mold compound exhibited in reduction of gate <b>chip</b> <b>off</b> formation, compared to normal filler mold compound. Smooth surface of fine mold compound lead to decrease of friction shear stress during degating is expected contribute to this finding...|$|R

40|$|We study a {{chipping}} {{model in}} one dimensional periodic lattice with continuous mass, where a fixed {{fraction of the}} mass is <b>chipped</b> <b>off</b> from a site and distributed randomly among the departure site and its neighbours; the remaining mass sticks to the site. In the asymmetric version, the <b>chipped</b> <b>off</b> mass is distributed among the site and the right neighbour, whereas in the symmetric version the redistribution occurs among the two neighbours. The steady state mass distribution of the model is obtained using a perturbation method for both parallel and random sequential updates. In most cases, this perturbation theory provides a steady state distribution with reasonable accuracy. Comment: 17 pages, 4 eps figure...|$|R
