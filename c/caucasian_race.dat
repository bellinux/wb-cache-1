He still supported natural selection as the engine of social progress, pointing out that [...] "The more civilised so-called <b>Caucasian</b> <b>races</b> have beaten the Turkish hollow in the struggle for existence" [...] and telling Graham that elimination of [...] "lower races" [...] by [...] "higher civilised races" [...] was inevitable in the progress of Malthusian struggle.|$|R

40|$|When {{employing}} between-infant designs young infants' looking {{style is}} related to their development: Short looking (SL) infants are cognitively accelerated over their long looking (LL) peers. In fact, looking style is a within-infant variable, and depends on infant i's look distribution over trials. For the paired array setting, a model is provided which specifies the probability, πi ∈ [0, 1], that i is SL. The model is employed in a face preference study; 74 Caucasian infants were longitudinally assessed at 3, 6, and 9 months. Each i viewed same <b>race</b> (<b>Caucasian)</b> vs. other <b>race</b> (African) faces. Infants become SL with development, but there are huge individual differences in rate of change over age. Three month LL infants, π^i 1 / 2, preferring same race faces at 3, and other race faces at 6 and 9 months. Looking style changes precede and may control changes in face preference.

25|$|Already in the 18th century polygenism {{was applied}} as {{a theory of}} race (see Scientific racism#Blumenbach and Buffon). A variant racist Preadamism was introduced, in {{particular}} by Reginald Stuart Poole (The Genesis of the Earth and of Man, London, 1860) and Dominic M'Causland (Adam and the Adamite, or the Harmony of Scripture and Ethnology, London, 1864). They followed the views of Samuel George Morton, Josiah C. Nott, George Gliddon, and Louis Agassiz; and maintained that Adam was the progenitor of the <b>Caucasian</b> <b>race,</b> while the other races descended from Preadamite ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Following Meiners, Blumenbach {{described}} the <b>Caucasian</b> <b>race</b> as {{consisting of the}} native inhabitants of Europe, West Asia, the Indian peninsula, and North Africa, including toward the south the Moors, Abyssinians and adjacent groups. His idealized Caucasian variety was distinguished by a white complexion, with rosy cheeks; brown or chestnut-colored hair; a subglobular head; an oval and straight face, with moderately defined parts; a smooth forehead; a narrow nose, often slightly hooked; and a small mouth. However, pragmatically, Blumenbach acknowledged that skin color of the Caucasian variety naturally ranged from white to dark brown tones.|$|E
25|$|The term Hamite {{was applied}} to {{different}} populations within North Africa, mainly comprising Ethiopians, Eritreans, Somalis, Berbers, and the ancient Egyptians. Hamites were regarded as Caucasoid peoples who probably originated in either Arabia or Asia {{on the basis of}} their cultural, physical and linguistic similarities with the peoples of those areas. Europeans considered Hamites to be more civilized than Sub-Saharan Africans, and more akin to themselves and Semitic peoples. In the first two-thirds of the 20th century, the Hamitic race was, in fact, considered one of the branches of the <b>Caucasian</b> <b>race,</b> along with the Indo-Europeans, Semites, and the Mediterranean race.|$|E
30|$|In {{the last}} few years, the race {{estimation}} problem has been addressed through several approaches. In [44], the skin color, the forehead area, and the lip color were used in order to estimate ethnicity, whereas in [45] kernel class-dependent feature analysis was used in combination with skin color features to tackle the problem of ethnicity estimation on large scale face databases. PCA was introduced in [46] to perform two-class (Myanmar vs. non-Myanmar) race classification and in [47] to classify, using a feed forward neural network, three (Arabic, Asian, and <b>Caucasian)</b> <b>races.</b> The problem of classifying people into Asian and non-Asian was addressed in [48]. The authors used PCA for features generation and independent component analysis for features extraction. Final classification was performed {{by means of a}} combination of different SVM classifiers. In [49], Gabor features were extracted from facial parts taking into account displacement issues, and SVM was then employed as classifier. A method, referred to as local gradient Gabor pattern, was proposed in [50]. It is based on the use of gradient information on Gabor-transformed images, demonstrating its effectiveness with images having variations in expression and illumination. In [51], faces were represented using elastic graphs labelled with 2 -D Gabor wavelet features, and the system was trained from examples to classify faces on the basis of sex, race, and expression using linear discriminant analysis. In [52], the problem of large-scale ethnicity estimation under variations of gender and age was addressed. Biologically inspired features, with manifold learning, were used to represent faces for ethnicity estimation demonstrating their robustness and high ethnicity classification accuracies within same-gender and same-age groups. An interesting analysis of age estimation performance under variations across race and gender was proposed in [53 – 55], whereas in [56], a joint estimation framework capable to deal with the mutual influence of gender, race, and age was introduced.|$|R
40|$|HIV/AIDS {{has reached}} a {{pandemic}} level across the world with more than 33 million people who are living with HIV. In the United States, {{more than half a}} million people have been victims of AIDS. This study investigates the most vulnerable racial minority population (the African Americans) in the United States and the second least affected (the Caucasians) in order to predict the trends of the epidemic. A Markov chain analysis was used to model the progression of the disease among vulnerable people, infective people and AIDS cases for the two races separately, based on the 2009 Centers of Disease Control and Prevention HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report. Based on the Markov model, our study predicts that the number of African American people living with AIDS diagnosis and HIV infection and dead due to HIV/AIDS will be 662. 2, 1225. 3 and 62. 9 in 2015 and 794. 9, 1566. 5 and 79. 2 in 2030, respectively. The number of Caucasian people living with AIDS diagnosis and HIV infection and dead due to HIV/AIDS will be 96. 4, 160 and 6. 5 in 2015 and 118. 6, 206. 9 and 8. 3 in 2030, respectively. The numbers of deaths due to HIV/AIDS are quite stable over the years in both the races. There is an increasing trend in the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS diagnosis in Caucasians compared with African Americans. The absolute number of Caucasians living with AIDS diagnosis and HIV infection is quite smaller compared with African Americans. The results reveal discrepancy in HIV infection, AIDS diagnosis and deaths due to HIV/AIDS among the African Americans and the <b>Caucasians</b> <b>races.</b> There is a need for interventions focusing on HIV/AIDS prevention and management, optimum resource allocation and development of antiAIDS campaigns to reduce the infection rate. open...|$|R
