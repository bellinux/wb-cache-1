25|$|The inner <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane</b> borders the stroma and regulates {{passage of}} {{materials}} {{in and out}} of the chloroplast. After passing through the TOC complex in the outer <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane,</b> polypeptides must pass through the TIC complex (translocon on the inner <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane)</b> which is located in the inner <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane.</b>|$|E
25|$|The outer <b>chloroplast</b> <b>{{membrane}}</b> is a semi-porous membrane {{that small}} molecules and ions can easily diffuse across. However, {{it is not}} permeable to larger proteins, so chloroplast polypeptides being synthesized in the cell cytoplasm must be transported across the outer <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane</b> by the TOC complex, or translocon on the outer <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane.</b>|$|E
25|$|All chloroplasts have {{at least}} three {{membrane}} systems—the outer <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane,</b> the inner <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane,</b> and the thylakoid system. Chloroplasts that {{are the product of}} secondary endosymbiosis may have additional membranes surrounding these three. Inside the outer and inner chloroplast membranes is the chloroplast stroma, a semi-gel-like fluid that makes up much of a chloroplast's volume, and in which the thylakoid system floats.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTocopherol (vitamin E) {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as a cellular antioxidant. It is essential for human and animal health, but only synthesized in photosynthetic organisms, where it is localized in <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes.</b> While many studies have investigated non-antioxidative effects of tocopherol on phospholipid membranes, nothing is known about its effects on <b>membranes</b> containing <b>chloroplast</b> glycolipids. Here, liposomes resembling plant <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes</b> were used to investigate the effects of α-tocopherol on vesicle stability during freezing and on lipid dynamics. α-Tocopherol had a pronounced influence on membrane dynamics and showed strong interactions in its effects on membrane stability during freezing with the cryoprotectant sucrose. α-Tocopherol showed maximal effects at low concentrations (around 2 mol%), close to its contents in <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Usually, a thin intermembrane space about 10–20 {{nanometers}} thick {{exists between}} the outer and inner <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes.</b>|$|R
25|$|From here, {{chloroplast}} proteins {{bound for}} the stroma must pass through two protein complexes—the TOC complex, or translocon on the outer <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane,</b> and the TIC translocon, or translocon on the inner <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane</b> translocon. Chloroplast polypeptide chains probably often travel through the two complexes at the same time, but the TIC complex can also retrieve preproteins lost in the intermembrane space.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to regulating {{the passage of}} materials, the inner <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane</b> is where fatty acids, lipids, and carotenoids are synthesized.|$|E
25|$|The protein-rich, alkaline, {{aqueous fluid}} within the inner <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane</b> {{and outside of}} the {{thylakoid}} space is called the stroma, which corresponds to the cytosol of the original cyanobacterium. Nucleoids of chloroplast DNA, chloroplast ribosomes, the thylakoid system with plastoglobuli, starch granules, and many proteins can be found floating around in it. The Calvin cycle, which fixes CO into sugar takes place in the stroma.|$|E

When the membranes are isolated unstacked, these particle arrays are lost and the fracture faces have a homogeneous appearance.

25|$|There {{are some}} common misconceptions about the outer and inner {{chloroplast}} membranes. The fact that chloroplasts {{are surrounded by}} a double membrane is often cited as evidence {{that they are the}} descendants of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. This is often interpreted as meaning the outer <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane</b> is the product of the host's cell membrane infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral cyanobacterium—which is not true—both chloroplast membranes are homologous to the cyanobacterium's original double membranes.|$|E
25|$|Next, the two plastid-dividing rings, or PD rings form. The inner plastid-dividing ring {{is located}} in the inner side of the chloroplast's inner membrane, and is formed first. The outer plastid-dividing ring is found wrapped around the outer <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane.</b> It {{consists}} of filaments about 5 nanometers across, arranged in rows 6.4 nanometers apart, and shrinks to squeeze the chloroplast. This is when chloroplast constriction begins. In a few species like Cyanidioschyzon merolæ, chloroplasts have a third plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast's intermembrane space.|$|E
25|$|In plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and phototrophic and chemoautotrophic proteobacteria, {{the enzyme}} usually {{consists}} of two types of protein subunit, called the large chain (L, about 55,000 Da) and the small chain (S, about 13,000 Da). The large-chain gene (rbcL) is encoded by the chloroplast DNA in plants. There are typically several related small-chain genes in the nucleus of plant cells, and the small chains are imported to the stromal compartment of chloroplasts from the cytosol by crossing the outer <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane.</b> The enzymatically active substrate (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate) binding sites {{are located in the}} large chains that form dimers as shown in Figure 1 (above, right) in which amino acids from each large chain contribute to the binding sites. A total of eight large-chains (= 4 dimers) and eight small chains assemble into a larger complex of about 540,000 Da. In some proteobacteria and dinoflagellates, enzymes consisting of only large subunits have been found.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chloroplast</b> <b>membranes</b> of {{wild-type}} Chlamydomonas reinhardi, {{treated with}} digitonin, yield photosystem II-rich and photosystem I-rich fractions; this fractionation {{is accompanied by}} a separation of stacked (grana) lamella from unstacked (stroma) lamellae. Poor fractionation of the photosystems occurs when the treated <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes</b> derive from the ac- 5 strain grown mixotrophically, whereas good fractionation occurs with ac- 5 cells grown phototrophically; the mixotrophic cells possess only unstacked membranes, whereas the phototrophic cells possess stacked membranes. We concluded that digitonin fractionation is dependent on the stacked membrane configuration...|$|R
40|$|In plants, {{chlorophylls}} {{and other}} tetrapyrroles are synthesized from a branched pathway that is located within chloroplasts. GUN 4 (GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4) stimulates chlorophyll biosynthesis by activating Mg-chelatase, the enzyme that commits porphyrins to the chlorophyll branch. GUN 4 stimulates Mg-chelatase by a mechanism that involves binding the ChlH subunit of Mg-chelatase, {{as well as}} a substrate (protoporphyrin IX) and product (Mg-protoporphyrin IX) of Mg-chelatase. We chose to test whether GUN 4 might also affect interactions between Mg-chelatase and <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes,</b> the site of chlorophyll biosynthesis. To test this idea, we induced chlorophyll precursor levels in purified pea chloroplasts by feeding these chloroplasts with 5 -aminolevulinic acid, determined the relative levels of GUN 4 and Mg-chelatase subunits in soluble and membrane-containing fractions derived from these chloroplasts, and quantitated Mg-chelatase activity in membranes isolated from these chloroplasts. We also monitored GUN 4 levels in the soluble and membrane-containing fractions derived from chloroplasts fed with various porphyrins. Our results indicate that 5 -aminolevulinic acid feeding stimulates Mg-chelatase activity in <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes</b> and that the porphyrin-bound forms of GUN 4 and possibly ChlH associate most stably with <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes.</b> These findings are consistent with GUN 4 stimulating chlorophyll biosynthesis not only by activating Mg-chelatase but also by promoting interactions between ChlH and <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Glaucophyte algal chloroplasts have a {{peptidoglycan}} layer {{between the}} <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes.</b> It {{corresponds to the}} peptidoglycan cell wall of their cyanobacterial ancestors, which is located between their two cell <b>membranes.</b> These <b>chloroplasts</b> are called muroplasts (from Latin [...] "mura", meaning [...] "wall").

2500|$|The {{chloroplast}} double membrane is {{also often}} {{compared to the}} mitochondrial double membrane. This is not a valid comparison—the inner mitochondria membrane is used to run proton pumps and carry out oxidative phosphorylation across to generate ATP energy. The only chloroplast structure that can considered analogous to it is the internal thylakoid system. Even so, in terms of [...] "in-out", the direction of chloroplast H ion flow is {{in the opposite direction}} compared to oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. In addition, in terms of function, the inner <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane,</b> which regulates metabolite passage and synthesizes some materials, has no counterpart in the mitochondrion.|$|E
2500|$|Some chloroplasts {{contain a}} {{structure}} called the chloroplast peripheral reticulum. It is {{often found in}} the chloroplasts of [...] plants, though {{it has also been}} found in some [...] angiosperms, and even some gymnosperms. The chloroplast peripheral reticulum consists of a maze of membranous tubes and vesicles continuous with the inner <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane</b> that extends into the internal stromal fluid of the chloroplast. Its purpose is thought to be to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport between its stroma and the cell cytoplasm. The small vesicles sometimes observed may serve as transport vesicles to shuttle stuff between the thylakoids and intermembrane space.|$|E
2500|$|The {{thylakoid}} membrane is {{the site}} of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis with the photosynthetic pigments embedded directly in the membrane. It is an alternating pattern of dark and light bands measuring each 1 nanometre. [...] The thylakoid lipid bilayer shares characteristic features with prokaryotic membranes and the inner <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membrane.</b> For example, acidic lipids can be found in thylakoid membranes, cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic bacteria and are involved in the functional integrity of the photosystems. The thylakoid membranes of higher plants are composed primarily of phospholipids and galactolipids that are asymmetrically arranged along and across the membranes. Thylakoid membranes are richer in galactolipids rather than phospholipids; also they predominantly consist of hexagonal phase II forming monogalacotosyl diglyceride lipid. Despite this unique composition, plant thylakoid membranes have been shown to assume largely lipid-bilayer dynamic organization. Lipids forming the thylakoid membranes, richest in high-fluidity linolenic acid are synthesized in a complex pathway involving exchange of lipid precursors between the endoplasmic reticulum and inner membrane of the plastid envelope and transported from the inner membrane to the thylakoids via vesicles.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of polypeptide composition and freeze-fracture morphology of <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes</b> isolated from different, but photosynthetically active, regions of a romaine lettuce shoot is presented. Chloroplasts prepared from outer dark-green leaves possess a fully developed light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex, have low chlorophyll a:b ratios and display fracture faces {{similar to those found}} in other higher plant chloroplast membranes; chloroplasts from leaves more to the interior of the shoot, have a much lower content of chlorophyll, show high chlorophyll a:b ratios, are depleted in components of the light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex, and exhibit extensive modifications of their fracture faces. We have also re-examined the freeze-fracture morphology of <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes</b> from a barley b-deficient mutant that lacks the light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex. A tentative interpretation of our findings suggests correlating the assembly of the light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex into the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes</b> with the appearance of large freeze-fracture B face particles in the stacked interior-membrane region, and differentiation of typical fracture faces...|$|R
40|$|Freeze-fracture and freeze-etch {{techniques}} have been employed {{to study the}} supramolecular structure of isolated spinach <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes</b> and to monitor structural changes associated with in vitro unstacking and restacking of these membranes. High-resolution particle size histograms prepared from the four fracture faces of normal <b>chloroplast</b> <b>membranes</b> reveal the presence of four distinct categories of intramembranous particles that are nonrandomly distributed between grana and stroma membranes. The large luminal surface particles show a one to one relationship with the EF-face particles. Since the distribution of these particles between grana and stroma membranes coincides with the distribution of photosystem II (PS II) activity, {{it is argued that}} they could be structural equivalents of PS II complexes. An interpretative model depicting the structural relationship between all categories of particles is presented.
