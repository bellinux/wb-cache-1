50|$|Constructing scenery {{involves}} {{preparing a}} sub-terrain using {{a wide variety}} of building materials, including (but not limited to) screen wire, a lattice of <b>cardboard</b> <b>strips,</b> or carved stacks of expanded polystyrene (styrofoam) sheets. A scenery base is applied over the sub-terrain; typical base include casting plaster, plaster of Paris, hybrid paper-pulp (papier-mâché) or a lightweight foam/fiberglass/bubblewrap composite as in Geodesic Foam Scenery.|$|E
40|$|The latex {{agglutination}} kits {{that are}} widely used for grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci in clinical laboratories use liquid latex suspensions. The Oxoid Dryspot kit (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom) uses predispensed latex dried onto reaction cards or <b>cardboard</b> <b>strips.</b> All streptococci of groups A (85 strains), B (87 strains), C (30 strains), D (38 strains), F (23 strains), and G (65 strains) were correctly grouped by using these reagents. The Oxoid Dryspot Streptococcal Grouping kit is a reliable method for grouping of the beta-hemolytic streptococci encountered in clinical laboratories...|$|E
40|$|The oriental fruit moth (OFM), Grapholita molesta (Busck), {{which is}} among the most {{important}} insect pests of peaches and nectarines, has developed resistance {{to a wide range of}} insecticides. We investigated the ability of the entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser), S. feltiae (Filipjev), S. riobrave (Cabanillas et al.), and Heterorhabditis marelatus (Liu and Berry) to control OFM under laboratory and fruit bin conditions. At a dosage of 10 infective juveniles (IJ) /cm 2 in the laboratory, S. carpocapsae caused 63 %, S. feltiae 87. 8 %, S. riobrave 75. 6 %, and H. marelatus 67. 1 % OFM mortality. All four nematode species caused significant OFM larval mortality in comparison to the nontreated controls. Steinernema feltiae was used for the bin assays due to the higher OFM mortality it caused than the other tested EPN species and to its ability to find OFM under cryptic environments. Diapausing cocooned OFM larvae in miniature fruit bins were susceptible to IJ of S. feltiae in infested corner supports and <b>cardboard</b> <b>strips.</b> Treatment of bins with suspensions of 10 or 25 S. feltiae IJ/ml water with wetting agent (Silwet L 77) resulted in 33. 3 to 59 % and 77. 7 to 81. 6 % OFM mortality in corner supports and <b>cardboard</b> <b>strips,</b> respectively. This paper presents new information on the use of EPN, specifically S. feltiae, as nonchemical means of OFM control...|$|E
50|$|Another {{method for}} control and sampling, 'trunk banding', {{consists}} of wrapping a corrugated <b>cardboard</b> <b>strip</b> {{around the tree}} trunk. Larvae making {{their way down the}} tree to pupate after exiting the infested fruits will use bands as pupation sites. Bands may then be removed and burned.|$|R

50|$|The {{realized}} films had 300 to 700 transparent {{pictures of}} successive phases of moving figures with black backgrounds. The pictures were hand painted by Reynaud in aniline inks directly on 6 x 6 cm gelatin plates. The plates were coated with shellac and framed in a <b>cardboard</b> <b>strip</b> {{of which the}} sides were clad in fabric bands attached with split pins. The horizontal film strip could be up to 50 meters long, with black leader tape at the beginning. Central perforations in the cardboard between the images engaged with metal notches protruding from a large central turning wheel. The wheel transferred the strip between two copper 25 cm spools. The film was guided further by pinch rollers {{at the corners of}} the table and passed in front of a magic lantern. The magic lantern projected each image in turn towards one of the 36 rectangular mirrors {{at the center of the}} turning wheel. Each image was in turn reflected to another mirror, which reflected it through a focusing lens towards a movable mirror. The movable mirror could be adjusted to project the moving characters at the desired place within an immobile background image on the screen. The background was projected with a second magic lantern from a painted glass plate. Reynaud would manipulate the speed of the film by hand and repeat movements to produce a visual story that could last longer than 10 minutes. The projectionist operated the machine behind the screen, with only the projection visible to the audience.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} laser {{cleaning}} of soiled natural stone surfaces possibly with unde rlying polychromy was studied {{by means of}} laboratory samples and during the cleaning of a Gothic tympanum at St Martins Church in Brunswick, Germany. Paint layers with pigments (1) frequently encountered in historic polychromies and (2) applied with different binders to <b>cardboard</b> <b>strips</b> and stone tablets (and subse quently coated with an artificial black gypsum crust) were irradiated. Laser light at different wavelengths and fluences was used to (a) determine fluence thre shold values for pigment alteration, and (b) {{to determine if the}} artificial gyps um crust can be ablated from the paint layers without discolouring them. The wavelength-dependent diffuse reflection and scattering of light were measured for the chosen pigment/binding medium combinations and turned into absorption coefficients according to the KubelkaMunk theory. These data served as a basis for theoretical considerations about the laserpigment interaction with respect to less critical wavelength regimes. For the pigments under investigation, the following sequence in order of sensitivity to laser irradiation from highest to lowe st was found: vermilion, massicot, lead antimonate (Naples yellow), minium, malachite, red ochre, yellow ochre, azurite, smalt, green earth. In the case of mal achite, azurite, minium, and vermilion, the chemical reaction which brings about the colour change was deduced from the X-ray diffraction curves of irradiated and altered pigment powders. Observations made during trial laser cleanings in the laboratory and on-site suggest that historic polychromies are more endanger ed by the loss of pigment flakes than by discoloration. The role that the binding medium and ageing effects play in the interaction of the laser with polychromies must be the subject of further investigations...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of mass-rearing techniques is aimed to produce {{large numbers of}} natural enemies of a good quality at a com-petitive price. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate a rearing-system for Orius insidiosus (Say) (Rhynchota Anthocori-dae). Three types of containers and different densities of eggs of the predator per container were tested in a climate room at 26 ± 2 ºC, 70 ± 10 % RH and photophase of 12 h. Also, one type of container and different densities of adults of the predator were tested. The immature stages were reared in plastic bags, Petri dishes, and glass jars at densities of 100, 250, and 400 predator eggs. Glass jars were used to rear adults, at densities of 250, 400, and 550 adults. Both Petri dishes and glass jars were suitable for rearing O. insidiosus at a density of 100 eggs per container, with a mass-production of newly-emerged adults of 55. 2 % and 50. 5 %, respectively. At the density of 250 eggs per container, only glass jars were suitable for nymph rearing with 53. 6 % produc-tion of adults. For adult rearing, the density of 400 adults per container was most suitable, with the highest number of eggs laid per female. The results showed that glass jars were best compared to others containers tested for the O. insidiosus rearing. Corru-gated <b>cardboard</b> <b>strips</b> as hiding places for nymphs and adults, eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller as food, an inflorescence of Bidens pilosa L. as oviposition site and a source of moisture should also be included to maximize the mass-rearing efficiency of O. insidiosus. This rearing-method could be a starting mass-rearing system for O. insidiosus in our conditions and that would be improved in co-operation with a Brazilian producer of natural enemies. Key words: biological control, mass-rearing methods, Orius spp., predator, food, oviposition site...|$|E
