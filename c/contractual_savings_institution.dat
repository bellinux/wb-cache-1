40|$|<b>Contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> include {{national}} provident funds, {{life insurance}} companies, private pension funds, and funded social pension insurance systems. They have long-term liabilities and stable cash flows {{and are therefore}} ideal providers of term finance, not only to government and industry, but also to municipal authorities and the housing sector. Except for Singapore, Malaysia, {{and a few other}} countries, most developing countries have small and insignificant <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> industries that have been undermined by high inflation and inhibited by oppressive regulations and pay-as-you-go social pension insurance systems. <b>Contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> play a much bigger role in the financial systems of developed countries. In some countries, such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, the resources mobilized by life insurance companies and pension funds correspond to well over 100 percent of annual GDP. The authors provide an overview of the structure and the state of development of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> in both high- and low-income countries. They also identify a number of operating characteristics that define the social, economic, financial and regulatory implications of different types of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions.</b> The authors emphasize the fundamental objectives for reforming the <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> and pension systems.

Collective investment vehicles pool resources from individuals and firms into various financial instruments including equity, debt, and derivatives.

40|$|<b>Contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> - {{pension funds}} and life {{insurance}} companies - have long been important institutions in several developing countries. But, with notable exceptions, they have been weak and underdeveloped. Some of this is attributable to low levels of income in developing countries {{and some of it}} to the negative impact of repressive regulations and the existence of pay-as-you-go social security systems. The author briefly reviews the size of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> in selected developed and developing countries and assesses their {{role in the development of}} the financial sector - especially in the development of securities markets. He stresses five points : 1) the structure of a country's financial system depends on the organization of the country's pension system; 2) <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> do not increase the rate of saving but shift the composition of total savings toward long-term financial assets; 3) the role of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> in securities markets reflects historical traditions and differences in regulation; 4) investment regulations mustaim at ensuring the safety and profitability of contractual savings; encouraging investment prudence and developing effective supervision should be basic objectives of public policy; and 5) <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> can have a great impact on securities markets.

40|$|Non-bank {{financial}} intermediaries (NBFIs) comprise {{a mixed bag}} of institutions, ranging from leasing, factoring, and venture capital companies to various types of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> and institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds). The common characteristic of these institutions is that they mobilize savings and facilitate the financing of different activities, {{but they do not}} accept deposits from the public. NBFIs play an important dual role in the financial system. They complement the role of commercial banks by filling gaps in their range of services. But they alsocompete with commercial banks and force them to be more efficient and responsive to the needs of their customers. Most NBFIs are also actively involved in the securities markets and in the mobilization and allocation of long-term financial resources. The state of development of NBFIs is usually a good indicator of the state of development of the financial system. The author focuses on <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions,</b> namely pension funds and life insurance companies, that are by far the most important NBFIs. He also offers a brief review of the role and growth of other NBFIs, such as leasing and factoring companies, as well as venture capital companies and mutual funds. The author covers developments in selected countries in different regions of the world. He also examines the recent growth of NBFIs, especially <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> and securities markets, in Egypt. He discusses the necessary regulatory and other policy reforms for promoting NBFIs [...] in particular, the openness to international markets and foreign presence that is essential for the transfer of skills and technologies.

40|$|While India {{boasts a}} {{world-class}} equity market and increasingly important bank assets, its bond market has not kept up. The government bond market remains illiquid. The corporate bond market, in addition, remains restrictive to participants and largely arbitrage-driven. Securitization, which once had the jump on other Asian markets, {{has failed to}} take off. To {{meet the needs of}} its firms and investors, the bond market must therefore evolve. This will mean creating new market sectors such as exchange-traded interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives contracts. It will mean relaxing exchange restrictions, easing investment mandates on <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions,</b> reforming the stamp duty tax, and revamping disclosure requirements for corporate public offers. This paper reviews the development and outlook of the Indian bond market.

40|$|Mauritius {{belongs to}} {{a select group of}} {{developing}} countries where <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> (i. e., savings with insurance companies and pension funds) exceed 40 percent of GDP and represent a major potential force in the local financial system. Pension funds account for 75 percent of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings.</b> <b>Contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> invest in government securities, housing loans, corporate securities, real estate and bank deposits. They currently hold 35 percent of government securities and also account for 36 percent of total outstanding housing loans. Given their strong demand for longduration assets, they can stimulate the issue of long-term government bonds (both inflation-linked and zero-coupon) and the development of corporate debentures, mortgage bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Mauritius has a balanced and wellmanaged multi-pillar pension system. In addition to several public components, such as the Basic Retirement Pension, the National Pensions Fund, the National Savings Fund, and the Civil Service Pension Scheme, there are over 1, 000 funded occupational pension schemes that play an increasingly important part in the whole system. The funded schemes are divided into two main groups: those insured and/or administered by insurance companies; and those that are self-administered and are registered with the Registrar of Associations. Coverage of the funded schemes is estimated at about 10 percent of the labor force. Together with the unfunded civil service scheme, occupational pension schemes cover about 100, 000 employees or 20 percent of the labor force. All types of pension funds, including the public ones, report low operating costs. This reflects the absence of marketing and selling costs and, in the case of large private pension funds, the assumption of so [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{issues in the}} {{regulation}} {{of a range of}} non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), categorized as Other Financial Intermediaries (OFIs). OFIs refer to those financial corporations that are primarily engaged in financial intermediation—that is, corporations that channel funds from lenders to borrowers through their own account or in auxiliary financial activities that are closely related to financial intermediation—but are not classified as deposit takers (IMF 2004 a). 1 OFIs include insurance corporations; pension funds; securities dealers; investment funds; finance, leasing, and factoring companies; and asset management companies. This chapter discusses considerations in assessing the regulation and supervision of OFIs (other than insurance companies and security market intermediaries) generally, with a focus on specialized finance institutions, leasing and factoring companies, and pension funds. Although OFIs are often dwarfed by commercial banks in terms of volume of business and size of assets, OFIs should receive adequate attention during the assessment process for various reasons. OFIs play an important developmental role through their activity in areas and markets where the presence of commercial banks is not fully felt. Moreover, the development of OFIs could increase bank competition, which could lead to greater access to finance. In many countries, pension funds are major <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> with a significant effect on financial markets and the macroeconomy. Specialized financial institutions (such as thrifts, building societies, and mortgage institutions) have emerged in many countries to carry out real estate finance.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the insurance industry in an economy has been well recognized. Yet there is no extensive study on this area. In this dissertation, the economic role of the Insurance sector has been studied through (1) setting up theoretical models to illustrate how insurance growth may contribute to economic growth and (2) conducting a series of empirical studies to find whether there is empirical {{evidence to support the}} models developed. Although the insurance sector plays several important roles in economic growth, I only focus on two roles here in the dissertation. First, property and liability insurance serve as risk sharing institutions in an economy. Second, life insurance sector can provide more long run capital into an economy. ^ I develop two theoretical models to illustrate the above two roles separately. In the property and liability insurance model, an economy, which is composed of risk-averse agents, without an insurance sector is set up first. It shows that individual utility maximization can not achieve social optimization. After an insurance sector is introduced into the economy, social optimization can be achieved through individual utility maximization. In the life insurance model, <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>institutions,</b> which include life insurance companies, can shift short term savings to long term savings. At the end of this part, a discussion is presented to link insurance sector with the technological progress. ^ Four countries data have been studied to see whether there is empirical evidence for the above models developed. Three empirical methods are employed and compared: OLS, simultaneous equations and fixed effect model. All four countries data show evidence that property and liability insurance promote economic growth. However, two countries data show that life insurance promote economic growth while the other two countries data have just the opposite conclusion. Some possible reasons for this evidence are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the development of insurance, and <b>contractual</b> <b>savings,</b> (the assets and portfolio composition of pension funds, and life and non-life insurance companies) and the development of stock markets (market capitalization and value traded). Their contribution lies in providing cross-country, and time-series on a hypothesis that is very popular - but had not been substantiated - among supporters of funded pension systems, and insurance in which reserves are largely invested in tradable securities (equities and bonds). The authors presenta three-assets model (money, quasi money, and shares) to study the effects of the development of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> (pension funds and life insurance companies) and non-life insurance companies on assets market equilibrium, and on stock market development. They use an unbalanced panel of 21 OECD, and 5 developing countries, and an error components two-stage least squares (EC 2 SLS) estimator, including a test for endogeneity of these institutional investors. The results support the hypothesis that <b>contractual</b> <b>savings,</b> and non-life insurance companies can be treated as exogenous to the development of stock markets; that <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> and non-life insurance companies, as well as their portfolio policies, promote stock market development as measured by stock market capitalization, and value traded as a share of GDP. The results show that stock market capitalization is positively correlated with the return on stocks, the assets of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> and non-life insurance companies, the shares of stocks in the portfolios of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> and non-life insurance companies, and the value traded stocks. Stock market capitalization is negatively correlated with the real interest rate, the real return on money (measured by the inverse of inflation), and stock market volatility. Stock market value traded is positively correlated with the shares of stocks in the portfolios of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> and non-life insurance companies, and the real return on money. It is negatively correlated with the real interest rate. The authors conclude that insurance and <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> are powerful instruments for developing stock markets, providing depth and liquidity. Higher liquidity, in turn, further promotes market capitalization. Economic Theory&Research,Insurance&Risk Mitigation,Contractual Savings,Financial Intermediation,Banks&Banking Reform...|$|R
