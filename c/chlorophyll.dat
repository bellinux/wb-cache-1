5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex {{chemical}} known as <b>chlorophyll,</b> which is involved in photosynthesis. <b>Chlorophyll</b> absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. <b>Chlorophyll</b> absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{stability}} of <b>chlorophylls</b> toward UV irradiation was studied by Vis spectrophotometry in extracts containing mixtures of photosynthetic pigments in acetone and n-hexane. The <b>chlorophylls</b> underwent destruction (bleaching) obeying first-order kinetics. The bleaching was governed by three major factors: the energy input of the UV photons, {{the concentration of}} the <b>chlorophylls</b> and the polarity of the solvent, implying different molecular organizations of the <b>chlorophylls</b> in the two solvents...|$|R
40|$|Soybean leaf Nitrogen (N) status {{correlated}} linearly {{with the}} amount of <b>chlorophylls</b> and SCMR at flowering stage in response to water deficit levels. In addition, SCMR showed significant positive correlation with <b>chlorophylls</b> at flowering stage. Grain yield significantly correlated to the leaf nitrogen {{as well as to the}} <b>chlorophylls</b> and SCMR at flowering stage in response to water deficit levels. These relationships indicated that the water stress decreased leaf nitrogen, <b>chlorophylls</b> and SCMR which in turn caused decreased grain yield of soybean. The results from the study suggest that, flowering stage is the best time for prediction on the adverse effects of water stress on leaf nitrogen assimilation, <b>chlorophylls</b> and SCMR on potential yielding ability of soybean...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{photosynthesis}} {{relies on}} the capacity of <b>chlorophylls</b> and carotenoids to absorb light. One of the roles of carotenoids is to harvest green-blue light and transfer the excitation energy to the <b>chlorophylls.</b> The corresponding dynamics were investigated {{here for the first}} time, to our knowledge, in the CP 26 and CP 24 minor antenna complexes. The results for the two complexes differ substantially. In CP 26 fast transfer (80 fs) occurs from the carotenoid S(2) state to <b>chlorophylls</b> a absorbing at 675 and 678 nm, whereas transfer from the hot S(1) state to the lowest energy <b>chlorophylls</b> is observed i...|$|R

5|$|The {{stems of}} most cacti are some shade of green, often bluish or {{brownish}} green.

Cactus stems are often visibly waxy.|$|E
5|$|Yellow tea: This tea is {{processed}} {{in a similar}} manner to green tea, but instead of immediate drying after fixation, it is stacked, covered, and gently heated in a humid environment. This initiates oxidation in the <b>chlorophyll</b> of the leaves through non-enzymatic and non-microbial means, which results in a yellowish or greenish-yellow colour.|$|E

In C. reinhardtii, the main lifetimes of excitation trapping are about 27 and 68 ps. The overall lifetime of C. reinhardtii is considerably shorter than in A. thaliana.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the idea that plants could {{synthesise}} almost all their tissues from atmospheric gases had not yet emerged. The energy component of photosynthesis, the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by Mayer, but the details of how this was done would take many more years. <b>Chlorophyll</b> was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that starch was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants. The connection between the pigment <b>chlorophyll</b> and starch production was finally made in 1864 but tracing the precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915.|$|E
5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} <b>chlorophyll,</b> restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with <b>chlorophyll</b> or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E
5|$|Pigments are {{coloured}} chemicals (such as melanin) {{in animal}} tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a white coat in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), {{an example of}} seasonal camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, are unable to synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones. For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid pigments synthesized by plants. In {{the case of the}} flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both carotenoids and (green) <b>chlorophyll.</b> Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as <b>chlorophyll</b> does not survive digestion.|$|E
40|$|A {{preparation}} {{consisting of}} isolated dimeric peripheral antenna complexes from green plant photosystem I (light-harvesting complex I or LHCI) has been characterized by means of (polarized) steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy at low temperatures. We show that this preparation can be described reasonably well by a mixture of two types of dimers. In the first dimer about 10 % of all Q(y) absorption of the <b>chlorophylls</b> arises from two <b>chlorophylls</b> with absorption and emission maxima at about 711 and 733 nm, respectively, whereas in the second about 10 % of the absorption arises from two <b>chlorophylls</b> with absorption and emission maxima at about 693 and 702 nm, respectively. The remaining <b>chlorophylls</b> show spectroscopic properties {{comparable to those of}} the related peripheral antenna complexes of photosystem II. We attribute the first dimer to a heterodimer of the Lhca 1 and Lhca 4 proteins and the second to a hetero- or homodimer of the Lhca 2 and/or Lhca 3 proteins. We suggest that the <b>chlorophylls</b> responsible for the 733 nm emission (F- 730) and 702 nm emission (F- 702) are excitonically coupled dimers and that F- 730 originates from one of the strongest coupled pair of <b>chlorophylls</b> observed in nature...|$|R

5|$|Sweltering / Yellowing: Unique {{to yellow}} teas, warm and damp tea leaves from after kill-green {{are allowed to}} be lightly heated in a closed container, which causes the {{previously}} green leaves to turn yellow. The resulting leaves produce a beverage that has a distinctive yellowish-green hue due to transformations of the leaf <b>chlorophyll.</b> Through being sweltered for 6–8 hours at close to human body temperatures, the amino acids and polyphenols in the processed tea leaves undergo chemical changes to give this tea its distinct briskness and mellow taste.|$|E
5|$|The black dragonfish (also {{called the}} {{northern}} stoplight loosejaw) Malacosteus niger {{is believed to}} be one of the only fish to produce a red glow. Its eyes, however, are insensitive to this wavelength; it has an additional retinal pigment which fluoresces blue-green when illuminated. This alerts the fish to the presence of its prey. The additional pigment is thought to be assimilated from <b>chlorophyll</b> derivatives found in the copepods which form part of its diet.|$|E
