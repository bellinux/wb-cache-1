40|$|Abstract: In 2007, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued 276 recalls <b>of</b> <b>toys</b> {{and other}} children's products, a {{sizeable}} increase from previous years. The overwhelming majority <b>of</b> the 2007 <b>toy</b> recalls {{were due to}} high levels of lead content and almost all <b>of</b> these <b>toys</b> were manufactured in China. This period of recalls was characterized by substantial media attention to the issue of consumer product safety and eventually led to the passage of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008. This paper examines consumer demand for toys following this wave <b>of</b> dangerous <b>toy</b> recalls. The data reveal four key findings. First, the types <b>of</b> <b>toys</b> that were involved in recalls in 2007 experienced above average losses in Christmas season sales. Second, Christmas sales <b>of</b> infant/preschool <b>toys</b> produced by manufacturers who did not experience any recalls were about 25 percent lower in 2007 as compared to earlier years, suggesting industry-wide spillovers. Third, a manufacturer’s recall of one type <b>of</b> <b>toy</b> did not lead to a disproportionate loss in sales of their other types <b>of</b> <b>toys.</b> And, finally, recalls <b>of</b> <b>toys</b> that are part of a brand had either positive or negative effects on the demand for other toys in the property, depending on the nature <b>of</b> the <b>toys</b> involved. Our examination of the stock market performance <b>of</b> <b>toy</b> firms over this period also reveals industry wide spillovers. The finding of sizable spillover effects of product recalls to non-recalled products and non-recalled manufacturers has important implications for regulation policy.

Second, it is commonly accepted in international and domestic trade, as concretization of the principle of good faith, that the seller is not liable for any lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> goods if at the time of conclusion of a contract the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of such lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> Seller's liability for the lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> the goods is excluded when the following requirements are fulfilled. The first requirement is that the buyer had positive knowledge of the defects or that he could not have been unaware of their existence.
