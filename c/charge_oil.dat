Mass transfer in mixer-settler has been studied. Mass transfer coefficient of continuous phase, mass transfer coefficient of dispersed phase and the overall mass transfer coefficient extraction of light lubes oil distillate fraction by furfural are calculated {{in addition to all}} physical properties of individual components and the extraction mixtures. The effect of extraction variables were studied such as extraction temperature which ranges from 70 to 110 °C and solvent to oil ratio which ranges from 1 : 1 to 4 : 1 (wt/wt) were studied. The results of this investigation show that the extract yield E decreased with decreasing solvent to oil ratio in extract layer and increased with increasing temperature. The fraction of total solvent in the raffinate phase decreased with increasing oil to solvent ratio in raffinate layer and increased with increasing temperature. Solvent to oil ratio in extract layer decreased with increasing temperature and increased with increasing solvent to <b>charge</b> <b>oil</b> ratio at constant temperature. Oil to solvent ratio in raffinate decreased with increasing temperature and increased with increasing solvent to <b>charge</b> <b>oil</b> ratio at constant temperature.

40|$|Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) {{continues}} to be a proven testing ground for the study of integral membrane proteins (IMPs). It is important to study the stability of the individual helices of bR, as they are postulated to exist as independently stable transmembmne helices (TMHs) and also for their utility as templates for modeling other IMPs with the postulated seven-helix bundle topology. Toward this purpose, the seven helices of bR have been studied by molecular dynamics simulation in this study. The suitability of using the backbone-dependent rotamer library of side-chain conformations arrived at from the data base of globular protein structures in the case TMHs has been tested by another set of ? helix simulations with the side-chain orientations taken from this library. The influence of the residue's net <b>charge</b> <b>oil</b> the helix stability was examined by simulating the helices III, IV, and VI (from both of the above sets of helices) with zero net charge on the side chains. The results of these 20 simulations demonstrate in general the stability of the isolated helices of bR in conformity with the two-stage hypothesis of IMP folding. However, the helices I, II, V, and VII are more stable than the other three helices. The helical nature of certain regions of III, IV, and VI are influenced by factors such as the net charge and orientation of several residues. It is seen that the residues Arg, Lys, Asp, and Glu (charged residues), and Ser, Thr, Gly, and Pro, {{play a crucial role in}} the stability of the helices of bR. The backbone-dependent rotamer library for the side chains is found to be suitable for the study of TMHs in IMP. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{for a series}} of experiments investigating effects which call influence the interpretation of data from ionisation-based dust detectors carried oil spacecraft. First, the variation of the impact ionisation yield with angle of impact was Studied for impacts of iron microparticles onto gold at speeds of 1 - 75 km s(- 1). The angle of incidence was from 0 degrees (normal incidence) to 80 degrees (glancing incidence). Little or no variation was observed at angles up to 60 degrees, but at 80 degrees the total impact ionisation signal was around an order of magnitude lower than at smaller angles. In addition, the fast rising component of the ionisation signal rise time showed no variation with impact angle, but the total signal rise time showed a steady decrease. The effect of secondary impact ionisation resulting from particle impacts on detector side walls was also Studied. Iron microparticles were fired oil to an aluminium target Lit various angles, and the impact ionisation signal on a nearby gold target was measured. It was found that ionisation signals were observed oil the gold target, and that these were very similar in appearance to those observed in direct impacts. The effect of reduction in particle <b>charge</b> <b>oil</b> an impact ionisation signal was investigated. Iron microparticles were fired on to a gold target after passing through a thin film which reduced the charge which was used to accelerate them. It was found that there was a measurable drop in ionisation signal in the reduced-charge case. The empirical relation I-IONISATION = 1. 67 x 10 (- 9) Q(PARTICLE) (0. 35) (units of C) was found. This implies there is a component in the observed ionisation signal that is not related to the impact. To test this, charged tungsten carbide particles were dropped at very low velocity onto a replica of a dust detector used in space whilst placed in a vacuum chamber. lonisation signals were frequently recorded by the detector. It was concluded that this signal originated from the incident particle charge. In the final section of work, as all example, the influence of oblique incidence, side-wall impacts and particle charge effects oil data collected by the Gorid dust detector in Earth orbit were investigated. Corrections were applied to the mass and velocity distributions derived from Gorid data. In extremis, oblique incidence effects were found to shift the mass distribution down by an order of magnitude, and the velocity distribution up by a factor of two to three. If all the data had come from unrecognised side-wall impacts, the mass distribution would be shifted downwards to lower masses by three orders of magnitude. and the velocity distribution upwards by a factor of five. Possible particle charge effects were found to shift the mass distribution down by 30 % and did not alter the velocity distribution. Overall we have investigated a variety of impact-related phenomena and conclude that these call affect the interpretation of data from instruments deployed in space...|$|E

40|$|Deltaic basins of Tertiary age {{constitute}} {{a significant percentage}} of the sedimentary environments of the world's known hydrocarbon reserves and with more prospects of huge discoveries, renewed exploration activities are on-going in the progressively deeper waters of the continental shelf of deltaic basins (e. g. Gulf of Mexico, Niger Delta and Beaufort-Mackenzie Delta). Hydrocarbon exploration success depends on the knowledge of the petroleum systems (source rock, migration pathways, reservoirs, traps and seal) contributing to an oil accumulation. Although oil continues to be found in Tertiary delta reservoirs, multidimensional interpretation of literature data on crude oil geochemistry from these deltaic basins reveals a paradox in the geochemical characteristics of some of the reservoired oils with respect to the alleged Tertiary delta source rocks. Consequently there is no consensus on the origin of most of the deltaic petroleum accumulations. A poor understanding of the petroleum system (in particular the source rocks) escalates the risk of exploration as the presence, let alone the composition and phases, of petroleum could prove difficult to predict in undrilled prospects. Fairly representative crude oil samples taken from accumulations in Tertiary reservoirs of the Assam Delta (India), Beaufort-Mackenzie Delta (Canada), Gulf of Mexico (USA), Niger Delta (Nigeria) and the Kutei Basin (Indonesia) have been characterised for the purpose of predicting their source rock organic facies (organic matter type, depositional environment, age and thermal maturity). Biomarker and stable carbon isotopes analyses have been conducted on 120 samples from these basins in order to better understand the petroleum systems producing them. All the oils contain the angiosperm higher plant biomarker oleanane, in addition to other biomarkers like bicadinane and lupane which are not ubiquitous, thus providing evidence of higher plant inputs. Novel terpenoid biomarkers were discovered in many of the oils, whose relative abundances correlate strongly with those of conventional terrigenous biomarkers. Oils from Assam and the Kutei Basin are compositionally similar with pronounced terrigenous biomarker and stable carbon isotope characteristics that suggest expulsion from coaly to delta top shales deposited under highly oxygenated environments. Conversely, oils from the Gulf of Mexico show mixed marine-terrigenous and high marine algae source input biomarker and stable carbon isotopes signatures that suggest limited higher plant contribution to their organIc matter. Source rock deposition was under sub-oxic conditions (pristane/phytane) below a stratified water column (presence of gammacerane). On the basis of biomarker and stable carbon isotope data, oil accumulations from the Beaufort-Mackenzie and the Niger Deltas show greater diversity, grouping as dominantly terrigenous and dominantly marine algae sourced end-members, reflecting expulsion from source rocks deposited under oxic non-stratified and sub-oxic stratified water column conditions, respectively. These clear variations in the geochemistry of the oil accumulations can be attributed to oil sourcing from two discrete units: 1) Oils expelled from within the lean but thick source rock volume of deltas (intra-delta) which are characterised by abundant terrigenous biomarkers and stable carbon isotope signatures; 2) Oils expelled from source rocks rich in marine algal kerogen and envisaged as being laid down prior to the delta prograde, hence now buried below the Tertiary delta (sub-delta). The evidence suggests that sub-delta source rocks <b>charge</b> <b>oil</b> accumulations in the Gulf of Mexico, Beaufort-Mackenzie Delta and the deepwater Niger Delta. Bitumen extracts of core samples of the organic-rich late Cretaceous Araromi shale, from the Gbekebo well drilled in the Dahomey Basin on the western margin of the Niger Delta, are comparable both molecularly and isotopically to the deepwater Niger Delta oil set. This provides confirmatory evidence that similar sub-delta source facies may charge the deepwater Niger Delta accumulations.

In the past, however, {{the oil and gas}} distribution rules in this area were less studied, so the related understanding was insufficient. In this paper, the reservoirs in Well Block Tubei 1 were analyzed by means of fluid inclusion and quantitative grain fluorescence (QGF) techniques. Based on tectonic evolution history, burial history, thermal history and hydrocarbon generation history, the paleofluid evolution process in this area was reproduced. It is shown that the well block experienced hydrocarbon charge in two periods. The first period is the early–middle stage (16 – 9 Ma) of Miocene Kangcun Fm (N 1 – 2 k), when it was <b>charged</b> with <b>oil,</b> with the corresponding characteristics of yellow and white–yellow fluid inclusion fluorescence and the QGF Index higher than 4, indicating that there were paleo-oil reservoirs at the early stage of the reservoirs. And at the late stage, the fluids that were accumulated at the early stage escaped because the gypsum-salt rocks were cut by faults, and bitumen remained in the reservoirs. It is also the evidence for the escaping of the early <b>charged</b> <b>oil</b> that the total scanning fluorescence (TSF) of the hydrocarbon adsorbed {{to the surface of the}} current reservoirs is generally unimodal. The second period is the late stage (about 3 Ma) of Pliocene Kuqa Fm (N 2 k), when the natural gas and light <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> occurred.
