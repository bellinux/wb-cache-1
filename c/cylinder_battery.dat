40|$|BACKGROUND: Numerous {{mechanical}} ventilators {{are designed}} and marketed {{for use in}} patient transport. The complexity of these ventilators differs considerably, but very few data exist to compare their operational capabilities. METHODS: Using bench and animal models, we studied 15 currently available transport ventilators {{with regard to their}} physical characteristics, gas consumption (duration of an E-size oxygen <b>cylinder),</b> <b>battery</b> life, ease of use, need for compressed gas, ability to deliver set ventilation parameters to a test lung under 3 test conditions, and ability to maintain ventilation and oxygenation in normal and lung-injured sheep. RESULTS: Most of the ventilators tested were relatively simple to operate and had clearly marked controls. Oxygen cylinder duration ranged from 30 min to 77 min. Battery life ranged from 70 min to 8 hours. All except 3 of the ventilators were capable of providing various FIO 2 values. Ten of the ventilators had high-pressure and patient-disconnect alarms. Only 6 of the ventilators were able to deliver all settings as specifically set on the ventilator during the bench evaluation. Only 4 of the ventilators were capable of maintaining ventilation, oxygenation, and hemodynamics in both the normal and the lung-injured sheep. CONCLUSIONS: Only 2 of the venti-lators met all the trial targets in all the bench and animal tests. With many of the ventilators, certain of the set ventilation parameters were inaccurate (differed by> 10 % from the values from a cardiopul-monary monitor). The physical characteristics and high gas consumption of some of these ventilators may render them less desirable for patient transport.

25|$|The {{prototype}} car, SP 618000 {{was turned}} out in December, 1968 and tested through 1969. Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas wouldn't shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready {{to drive to the}} dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 <b>cylinder,</b> <b>batteries</b> had filler caps located high up on the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.|$|R

40|$|Nathan Cosa, 1 Edward Costa Jr 2 1 Department of Respiratory Care, Banner Desert Medical Center, Cardon Children&# 39;s Medical Center, Mesa, AZ, 2 Department of Medical Affairs, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, Hampton, NJ, USA Abstract: Treatment for {{persistent}} {{pulmonary hypertension}} of the newborn (PPHN) aims to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance while maintaining systemic vascular resistance. Selective pulmonary vasodilation may {{be achieved by}} targeting pulmonary-specific pathways or by delivering vasodilators directly to the lungs. Abrupt withdrawal of a pulmonary vasodilator can cause rebound pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, use of consistent delivery systems that allow for careful monitoring of drug delivery is important. This manuscript reviews published studies of inhaled vasodilators used for treatment of PPHN and {{provides an overview of}} safety issues associated with drug delivery and delivery devices as they relate to the risk of rebound pulmonary hypertension. Off-label use of aerosolized prostacyclins and an aerosolized prostaglandin in neonates with PPHN has been reported; however, evidence from large randomized clinical trials is lacking. The amount of a given dose of aerosolized drug that is actually delivered to the lungs is often unknown, and the actual amount of drug deposited in the lungs can be affected by several factors, including patient size, nebulizer used, and placement of the nebulizer within the breathing circuit. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is the only pulmonary vasodilator approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PPHN. The iNO delivery device, INOmax DSIR®, is designed to constantly monitor NO, NO 2, and O 2 deliveries and is equipped with audible and visual alarms to alert providers of abrupt discontinuation and incorrect drug concentration. Other safety features of this device include two independent backup delivery systems, a backup drug <b>cylinder,</b> a <b>battery</b> that provides up to 6 hours of uninterrupted medication delivery, and 27 alarms that monitor delivery, dosage, and system functions. The ability of the drug delivery device to provide safe, consistent dosing is important to consider when selecting a pulmonary vasodilator.

50|$|E1Designated as Experiment 1 in {{the fall}} of 1940, the initial model {{consisting}} of four main components: fuel storage system, compressed gas storage system, igniter, and flame gun. The E1 had a single fuel tank vertical cylinder with two compartments, an upper and lower compartment. The upper compartment contained pressurized nitrogen that pushed the five gallons of fuel oil in the lower compartment through the barrel and into the flame gun. The fuel system for the E1 consisted of either diesel oil, fuel oil, or blends of gasoline and oil. An igniter, consisting of a compressed hydrogen <b>cylinder</b> and <b>battery,</b> was attached to the flame gun. The flame gun had two triggers, dispense fuel and ignition of fuel as it exited the metal barrel.Weighing in at 70 pounds when filled, the E1 was capable of ranges from fourteen to twenty-one yards. Issues - engineer board tests identified that the fuel-compressed gas reservoir was impractical, prone position firing was difficult, and as the E1 was firing, gas pressure decreased in the upper compartment tank lowering gas pressure to push the fuel in the lower compartment through the flame gun, thereby reducing weapon range. Additional issues were identified with the dependability, weight, and maneuverability of the E1 flame thrower system. E1R1The E1 was redesigned by the Chemical Warfare Service and labeled Experiment 1 Revision 1 and was ready for testing in March 1941. The compressed nitrogen was separated away from the fuel reservoir, a feature carried forward in all subsequent models. Additional improvements included the flame gun, valves, and ignition system. The E1R1's filled weight was reduced to 57 pounds and was capable of sustaining 15 to 20 yards for 15 to 20 seconds; the E1R1 weighed 28 pounds when empty. Issues - Weight, easily damaged parts, and access to the control valves were identified during testing as being problematic. M1Test board results {{led to the development of}} the M1 production model, consisting of a heavier weight, the M1 was more rugged and had a longer range as standardized for production in March 1942. The M1 system made it to the South Pacific theater by the end of the year. M1A1The invention of napalm led to its evaluation as a flamethrowing agent. Gasoline and oil mixtures sprayed as it left the barrel of the flame gun, whereas napalm thickened fuel left the barrel in a compact stream capable of ricocheting off of and into openings and subsequently sticking to flat surfaces. Initial tests showed that the current M1 platform was incapable of providing the ideal range with napalm. The Chemical Warfare Service was asked to adapt the napalm fuel system to the M1 platform to avoid procurement issues, thus facilitating the development of the M1A1 platform. Modifications included the fuel system, pressure regulator, valves, and the flame gun to facilitate the higher pressures required to achieve ideal ranges with the napalm. The M1A1 was capable of reliably firing to distances fifty yards away versus the M1's ideal firing range of twenty yards.|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} work investigates experimentally the reversible electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity of activated carbon (aC) made from different precursors. In addition, {{the feasibility of}} running a proton flow battery with an integrated solid activated carbon sample electrode is reported. Considering the outcomes of the literature review {{and the results of}} previous research work on electrochemical hydrogen storage at the RMIT University (including hydrogen storage in metal hydride and activated carbon with solid electrolyte), the hydrogen storage capacities of activated carbon electrodes with a liquid acidic electrolyte have been studied in this thesis. In total thirteen activated carbon samples were investigated in the {{present research}} work: one made from charcoal, five from Victorian brown coal, and seven from phenolic resin were. The solid electrodes from these aC samples were fabricated and then tested to determine their proton conductivity, electron conductivity, double layer capacitance, and reversible electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity. Finally, a candidate aC sample from all the tested electrodes was selected and employed in an experimental proton flow battery to test its feasible running. The proton conductivity of the sample activated carbon electrodes was found to be in the range of 0. 004 &ndash; 0. 09 S/cm. The proton conductivity of the sample electrodes increased with increase in average pore volume because with high pore volume the electrode could accommodate more sulphuric acid leading to enhancement in proton conductivity. The double layer capacitance of the sample activated carbon electrodes was found to be in the range of 28. 3 &ndash; 189. 4 F/g. This capacitance contributed to the equivalent mass% of hydrogen storage in the carbon electrode. This capacitance contribution was found to be in the range of 0. 03 &ndash; 0. 19 mass%. The total reversible electrochemical hydrogen storage capacities of the fabricated aC-PTFE electrodes immersed in 1 mol. dilute sulphuric acid were found to be in the range of 0. 36 &ndash; 1. 6 mass% of equivalent hydrogen in carbon, counting both the contributions from chemical reactions between hydrogen and the storage material (i. e. carbon) and the double-layer capacitance effect. A candidate aC sample (mesoporous carbon 1 : 7 KOH) from all the tested electrodes was selected to be employed in an experimental proton flow battery to test its feasible running. The candidate aC was selected based upon its optimum performance in proton conductivity, double layer capacitance and electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity. The experiments in the specially designed and fabricated proton flow battery resulted in the feasible running of the device with an integrated solid carbon-based hydrogen storage electrode. It was shown successfully that hydrogen could go in and out from the activated carbon electrode soaked in dilute sulphuric acid. The URFCs with the aC electrode was charged at constant current and constant voltage for nine consecutive cycles to study its performance. The highest discharge value was found to be 1. 09 mass% of hydrogen storage, which is comparable to the commercially available metal-hydride based hydrogen <b>cylinders,</b> lithium-ion <b>batteries</b> and lithium-polymer batteries...|$|R
