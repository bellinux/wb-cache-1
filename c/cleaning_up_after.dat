5|$|CCC Camp S-95, {{which opened}} on May 29, 1933 {{on the site}} of an old lumber camp, was able to {{distinguish}} itself over the years it operated in Sullivan County. Two floods swept through the area in 1933 and 1936. The August flood of 1933 caused extensive damage and largely destroyed the newly built camp. During the course of the flooding two young men from Camp S-95 saved the lives of two drowning children at Worlds End State Park. The flood of 1936 covered a large area within the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. The young men of the CCC camp were among the leaders in the <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> the flood and rebuilding many destroyed bridges and roads. In 1936 the park was officially expanded beyond the original small picnic area. Camp S-95 closed in 1941.|$|E
5|$|The {{thousands}} of residents without power celebrated Thanksgiving by cooking turkeys on outdoor grills or smokers. Army and Air Force planes delivered 20,000 Thanksgiving rations {{to the thousands}} left in temporary shelters. The United States military also airlifted generators to Kauai due to several days of power outages. By {{three weeks after the}} hurricane, utility crews restored power to nearly all major areas in Oahu, while 5,000 remained without power in Kauai. By around a month after the hurricane passed the island, utilities were restored to most of the entire island. All roads and highways were cleared, as well. One 25th Infantry Division soldier at Schofield Barracks died while <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> the hurricane. Two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights. Following the storm, significant redevelopment occurred in Poipu, where the hurricane flooded areas several hundred feet inland. Hurricane Iniki struck the same area ten years later. Officials estimate a hurricane similar to Iwa striking Oahu in 1992 could cause up to $7.5billion in damage (USD).|$|E

25|$|Airborne toxic {{materials}} may be gaseous (for example sulfur {{mustard and}} chlorine gas used in World War I) or particulates (such as many biological agents developed for weapons such as bacteria, viruses and toxins). Many gas masks include protection from both types. Gas masks {{are used in}} construction to protect against welding fumes, in demolition to protect against asbestos or other hazardous particles, and in the chemical industry when handling hazardous materials, as in making repairs to leaking equipment or <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> spills; workers are usually issued gas masks as a precaution against leaks.|$|E
5000|$|Only {{a special}} vacuum cleaner that is {{designed}} for asbestos containment (class H) can be safely used when <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> during and <b>after</b> asbestos removal. Ordinary vacuum cleaners cannot be used, even those fitted with a HEPA filter. [...] An ordinary vacuum cleaner will expel the asbestos fibres into the room air.|$|R
50|$|Under German law {{the state}} {{has to pay for}} {{security}} during political demonstrations as well as <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> the streets <b>after</b> the demonstration. In the case of a commercial event however, the organizer must cover these expenses. For a large event like the Love Parade the costs are quite high: an estimated €300,000 to €400,000.|$|R

He may even run off with a shiny keepsake or two. Like an inquisitive child, he leaves a mess behind, which means a red-faced Tarzan and the other family members are usually stuck with <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> him. His mischief, however, sometimes ends up doing more good than first assumed, especially where the villainous Samuel Philander was concerned.|$|E
25|$|The 1851 Yellow River flood deluged {{hundreds}} of thousands of square miles and caused immense loss of life. The Qing government slowly began <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> the disaster but could not provide effective aid, as government finances had been drained during a recent war with Great Britain and the ongoing slaughter of the Taiping Rebellion. The damage created by the disaster had still not been repaired when, in 1855, the river burst its banks again, drowning thousands and devastating the fertile province of Jiangsu. Along with the destruction caused by the floods famine spread. At the time, the Qing government was trying to negotiate a deal with the European powers, and as state finances had been so severely depleted, the regime was again unable to provide effective relief. This enraged the Nian movement, which blamed the Europeans for contributing to China's troubles, and increasingly viewed the Qing government as incompetent and cowardly {{in the face of the}} Western powers.|$|E

After the largest oil spill in history, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, J.P. Morgan analysts concluded that the business generated by clean-up work would very likely be larger than the financial losses to tourism or fishing, resulting in a net increase in GDP.|$|R
500|$|The {{two pages}} in {{question}} {{consisted of the}} short sketch [...] "Roderick O'Conor", concerning the historic last king of Ireland <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> guests by drinking the dregs of their dirty glasses. Joyce completed another four short sketches in July and August 1923, while holidaying in Bognor. The sketches, which dealt with different aspects of Irish history, {{are commonly known as}} [...] "Tristan and Isolde", [...] "Saint Patrick and the Druid," [...] "Kevin's Orisons" [...] and [...] "Mamalujo". While these sketches would eventually be incorporated into Finnegans Wake in one form or another, they did not contain any of the main characters or plot points which would later come to constitute the backbone of the book. The first signs of what would eventually become Finnegans Wake came in August 1923 when Joyce wrote the sketch [...] "Here Comes Everybody", which dealt {{for the first time with}} the book's protagonist HCE.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Mommy Dearest", it is {{discovered}} {{that there is a}} possibility Crowley may have faked his death and might still be alive; suggesting that perhaps Castiel had burned the wrong bones by mistake. Eve reveals this to Sam and Dean when they try to hunt her down. During the hunt, Eve is able to suppress Castiel's powers as she is older than him. After Dean kills Eve, Castiel's powers return and he kills all of her monsters with a blast of white light before transporting the group to the home of the uncle of two young boys who were turned into monsters. There, they find them dead, having been killed by demons, and Castiel promises to look into Crowley's possible survival to find out for sure if he's dead or not. However, Castiel is instead seen with a very alive Crowley who states that he is [...] "tired of <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> [...] messes", implying that Castiel had full knowledge of burning the wrong bones and that both he and Crowley have some sort of agreement between them and/or may be working together as partners.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the memory}} manager can recover {{unreachable}} memory, it cannot free memory {{that is still}} reachable and therefore potentially still useful. Modern memory managers therefore provide techniques for programmers to semantically mark memory with varying levels of usefulness, which correspond to varying levels of reachability. The memory manager does not free an object that is strongly reachable. An object is strongly reachable if it is reachable either directly by a strong reference or indirectly by a chain of strong references. (A strong reference is a reference that, unlike a weak reference, prevents an object from being garbage collected.) To prevent this, the developer is responsible for <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> references <b>after</b> use, typically by setting the reference to null once {{it is no longer}} needed and, if necessary, by deregistering any event listeners that maintain strong references to the object.|$|R
2500|$|NA {{literature}} suggests that service work {{is an essential part}} of a program of recovery. Service is [...] "doing the right thing for the right reason," [...] and is the best example of [...] "good will", which is the basis for the freedom only from active addiction by the NA program. Service work is usually chairing a meeting but may be as simple as <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> the meeting, putting away chairs, or answering a phone. Additionally, there are basic, formalized service positions at the group level to help the group perform its function: examples include treasurer, secretary and Group Service Representative (GSR) who represents the group in the larger service structure.|$|E

Helen's first wifely duty was to insist that she should and could and would help her husband {{with the work of}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> the sumptuous supper. Before they had finished a sound startled them. It came from Roy, evidently high on the darkening slope, and was a long, mellow pealing halloo, that rang on the cool air, burst the dreamy silence, and rapped across from slope to slope and cliff to cliff, to lose its power and die away hauntingly in the distant recesses.|$|E

50|$|The {{drainage}} {{area of the}} river is approximately 712 sq mi with 27 creeks feeding into the Tualatin. Its watershed is 15 percent urbanized, 35 percent agricultural, and 50 percent forested. The river drops 1800 ft in elevation during its first 12 mi and then only an additional 250 ft {{for the remainder of}} its course. This creates a slow river {{for the majority of the}} course, creating problems with pollution. Pollution reached a point that in 1989 local agencies were forced to begin <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> the river <b>after</b> the Tualatin failed water quality standards outlined in the Clean Water Act of 1972. It was the first river in the state to fail overall pollution limits.|$|R

60|$|I {{have told}} {{of my first}} day, when I visited the front trenches, saw the work of 'Mother,' and finally that marvellous spectacle, the Ypres Salient at night. I have passed {{the night at the}} {{headquarters}} of a divisional-general, Capper, who might truly be called one of the two fathers of the British flying force, for it was he, with Templer, who laid the first foundations from which so great an organisation has arisen. My morning was spent in visiting two fighting brigadiers, cheery weather-beaten soldiers, respectful, as all our soldiers are, of the prowess of the Hun, but serenely confident that we can beat him. In company with one of them I ascended a hill, the reverse slope of which was swarming with cheerful infantry in every stage of dishabille, for they were <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> the trenches. Once over the slope we advanced with some care, and finally reached a certain spot from which we looked down upon the German line. It was the advanced observation post, about a thousand yards from the German trenches, with our own trenches between us. We could see the two lines, sometimes only a few yards, as it seemed, apart, extending for miles on either side. The sinister silence and solitude were strangely dramatic. Such vast crowds of men, such intensity of feeling, and yet only that open rolling countryside, with never a movement in its whole expanse.|$|E

He also refuses to have any fun, spending most of his time thinking about Frances. Felix at one point even telephones Oscar at Shea Stadium telling him not to eat any hot dogs at the game, because Felix is preparing franks and beans for dinner; this distraction causes Oscar to miss seeing a rare triple-play at the Mets game on which he is reporting. The two men are shown bowling, shooting pool, and walking the city streets. Felix has a sinus attack, making loud obnoxious noises while seated in a coffee shop. Finally, after Felix drives everyone at the weekly poker game crazy, Oscar convinces Felix to lighten up and join him on a double-date with two British girls who live in the building [...] - [...] the Pigeon sisters, Cecily (Monica Evans) and Gwendolyn (Carole Shelley), who actually [...] "coo" [...] when they laugh.|$|R
25|$|During lunchtime, the rain-gods {{visited the}} Gabba and {{confined}} the players indoors till 4:20 pm. The next session of play after that {{was dominated by}} the Indians. Adam Gilchrist, the next batsman in, was usually known to reply with a furious fifty or hundred, but he too, did not hang around for too long, as he lasted for four balls and did not trouble the scorers at all and departed for a duck with the scoreline being 276/6. Again his manner of dismissal was familiar: caught Laxman, bowled Zaheer. Buoyant and hopeful of their prospects of <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> the tail <b>after</b> Gilchrist's wicket, the Indians scalped the wicket of Andy Bichel(11 runs) caught by Laxman again, off Agarkar's bowling, then Simon Katich, who had contributed 16 runs to the score, before his nervous stay at the wicket was ended by a tentative poke at a Zaheer delivery to wicket-keeper Parthiv Patel.|$|R

She works with a Turkish woman named Hatçe who seems to disappear at the worst times leaving Frau Gramke to do most of the work. It isn’t until she finds Hatçe on the toilet does she realize why. This causes a flashback to when Frau Gramke worked by <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> the rubble <b>after</b> the war. She is reminded of a woman named Hilde who was pulled out of the rubble. Hatçe is seen to be bleeding due to an abortion that she had, and Frau Gramke wants to call a doctor even though Hatçe refuses. A secretary eventually calls the police for her.|$|R
