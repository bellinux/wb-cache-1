50|$|The <b>calabash</b> <b>tree</b> is {{important}} to the Embera, who scoop out the tree's gourds for cups and bowls, as well as spoons.

6000|$|They {{were both}} very happy. According to the strange {{mathematics}} {{of the god}} of mutual affinity, the shadows that clouded their pasts when united became only half as dense instead of darker. They shut the world out and bolted the doors. Each was the other's world. Mrs. Conant lived again. The remembering look left her eyes. Merriam was with her every moment that was possible. On a little plateau under a grove of palms and <b>calabash</b> <b>trees</b> {{they were going to}} build a fairy bungalow. They were to be married in two months. Many hours of the day they had their heads together over the house plans. Their joint capital would set up a business in fruit or woods that would yield a comfortable support. [...] "Good night, my world," [...] would say Mrs. Conant every evening when Merriam left her for his hotel. They were very happy. Their love had, circumstantially, that element of melancholy in it that it seems to require to attain its supremest elevation. And it seemed that their mutual great misfortune or sin was a bond that nothing could sever.|$|R

In 1897, Monodora myristica was introduced to Bogor Botanical Gardens, Indonesia, where the trees flower on a regular basis but no fruit could yet be collected. Due to its large and orchid-like flowers, the tree is also grown as an ornamental.|$|R

As she did so the skull spat upon her hand, and through this act she became pregnant with Hun Hunahpu's twin sons.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} gourds worldwide. The main plants referred to as gourds include several species from the Cucurbita genus (mostly native to North America, including the Malabar gourd and turban squash), Crescentia cujete (the tree gourd or <b>calabash</b> <b>tree,</b> native to the American tropics) and Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd). Other plants with gourd in their name include the luffa gourd (likely domesticated in Asia), which includes several species from the Luffa genus, {{as well as the}} wax gourd, snake gourd, teasel gourd, hedgehog gourd, buffalo gourd/coyote gourd. The bitter melon/balsam apple/balsam pear is also sometimes referred to as a gourd.|$|E

In her hand she carried an empty calabash. Stumbling in the dark over stones and the roots of trees she hurt her shoeless feet and began to abuse the moon, then hidden behind clouds, hurling at it some such epithet as [...] "You old tattooed face, there!" [...] But the moon-goddess heard, and reaching down caught up the insulting Rona, calabash and all, into the sky. In vain the frightened woman clutched, as she rose, the tops of a ngaio-tree. The roots gave way, and Rona with her <b>calabash</b> and her <b>tree</b> are placed {{in the front of}} the moon for ever, an awful warning to all who are tempted to mock at divinities in their haste.|$|R

In 1844-1845 Maizan reached as far as the district of Dege la Mhora, on the Uzaramo plateau about 80-150 kilometers from the coast, where he was seized by Zaramo tribesmen under Hembé, the son of Chief Mazungera, and bound to a <b>calabash</b> <b>tree</b> before being tortured, mutilated and murdered. Hembé amputated Maizan's limbs and sliced off his genitals while still alive before beheading him. Hembé later claimed to be acting on the orders of Arab ivory traders.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, pulque {{is served}} from large barrels on ice. and served into glasses, using a jicara, {{which is a}} half of a <b>calabash</b> <b>tree</b> gourd. The {{bartender}} is called a jicarero. In a pulquería, cruzado, meaning something like [...] "bottoms up", is a frequent salute.Drinking glasses have colorful names and can reflect a customer's ability to drink pulque. Large two-liter glasses are called macetas (flower pots), one-liter glasses are called cañones (cannons), half-liters are called chivitos (little goats), quarter-liter glasses are catrinas (dandies), and eighth-liter glasses are tornillos (screws). Traditionally, these glasses are made from a greenish, hand blown glass. Pulque can be drunk straight from the barrel or can {{have a number of}} additives, such as fruit or nuts, added. Pulque prepared this way is called curado or cured.|$|E
5000|$|The calabash, bottle gourd, or white-flowered gourd, Lagenaria siceraria (synonym Lagenaria vulgaris Ser.), {{also known}} by many other names that include: opo squash (from Tagalog: upo), long melon, suzza melon, New Guinea bean and Tasmania bean is a vine grown for its fruit, which {{can either be}} {{harvested}} young and used as a vegetable, or harvested mature, dried, and used as a bottle, utensil, or pipe. The fresh fruit has a light-green smooth skin and a white flesh. Rounder varieties are called calabash gourds. They grow {{in a variety of}} shapes: they can be huge and rounded, small and bottle shaped, or slim and serpentine, more than a metre long. Because bottle gourds are also called [...] "calabashes", they are sometimes confused with the hard, hollow fruits of the unrelated <b>calabash</b> <b>tree,</b> Crescentia cujete, whose fruits are also used to make utensils, containers, and musical instruments. The gourd {{was one of the first}} cultivated plants in the world, grown not primarily for food, but for use as water containers. The bottle gourd may have been carried from Africa to Asia, Europe, and the Americas in the course of human migration, or by seeds floating across the oceans inside the gourd. It has been proven to be in the New World prior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus.|$|E
40|$|Germplasm of the <b>calabash</b> <b>tree</b> (Crescentia cujete L.) was {{collected}} in five major regions of Colombia, i. e. the Andes, Caribbean, Amazon, Orinoco, and Pacific regions. Collecting this multipurpose tree {{was guided by}} the indigenous knowledge of farmers and artisans in each region. Large variation in fruit shapes and sizes was found, of which some forms were typical for certain regions. Overall 56 accessions were collected and roughly classified into 22 types by eight fruit shapes and eight sizes. Molecular markers (Amplified fragment length polymorphisms) were applied to leaf tip tissue originating from vegetatively propagated plants {{in order to assess}} the diversity available in the germplasm collected as well as to detect patterns of geographical or morphological similarity. One accession each of C. alata H. B. &K. and C. amazonica Ducke were used as outgroups. Overall, genetic diversity was high (mean Nei and Li’s coefficient of 0. 43). No relations could be established between either geographical provenance or fruit morphology and patterns of genetic diversity. Concerning the outgroups, the C. amazonica accession appeared to be a distinct species. The C. alata accession, however, {{did not seem to be}} sufficiently distinct from C. cujete to merit species status. The latter material may in fact be a hybrid or serve to challenge the validity of interspecific organization of the genus Crescentia. Peer-reviewe...|$|E
