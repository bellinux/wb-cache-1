25|$|In Vianu's view, Momente şi schiţe {{was more}} vague in this respect, giving little insight into morals and states of mind, whereas the other, longer, novellas did depict {{feelings}} and occasionally provided additional {{details such as}} physiology or <b>cenesthesia.</b> Also according to Vianu, Ion Luca Caragiale, unlike the Naturalists, was generally not interested in offering the reader access to his characters' psychological background—aside from his Năpasta and Păcat, and O făclie de Paşte, he only adopted the psychological technique in satirical contexts, {{as a means to}} parody its use. A similar view was expressed by Vianu's predecessor, Silvian Iosifescu, who also stressed that Caragiale always avoided applying the Naturalist technique to its fullest, while George Călinescu himself believed that the characters' motivations in O făclie de Paşte are actually physiological and ethnological.|$|E
5000|$|Cenesthopathy {{is a rare}} medical {{term used}} to refer to the feeling of being ill and this feeling is not {{localized}} to one region of the body. Cenesthopathic hallucinatory experiences are caused by the hyperactive neuronal stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex due to a disorder or a damage to this area. There are two theories that are established to portray sensation of unified bodily feeling. One of these theories is called associationism, which states that <b>cenesthesia</b> is an amalgamation of propioceptive and interoceptive sensations. Faculty psychology is the other theory which states that there is a particular brain region where all of the sensory information converged and the integration of this information gives one cenesthetic sensation. The latter theory became more predominant and it established two types of cenestopathic hallucinations namely “painful” and “paraesthetic”. Patients that experience [...] "painful" [...] type of cenesthopathic hallucination felt that their organs were stretched apart and twisted. On the other hand, patients with [...] "paraesthetic" [...] cenesthopathic hallucination experience severe hallucinatory itching.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to define}} the {{concepts}} of "material thought" and "material time," as they are theorized by Proust in the Preface of his Ruskin’s Amiens Bible translation, and as they are developed throughout the Recherche. In Proust’s oeuvre ‘material thought’ manifests itself mostly in linguistic and stylistic features, or in concrete images, like the columns of Venice’s Piazzetta, with their “honey smoothness” and their “pink color," which are then distributed all along the novel in many passages. We analyze here some of them, in order to unveil the ‘rhetoric web’ settled by Proust to represent the depth of sensation and time. Time is not, in effect, an abstract concept for Marcel Proust. On the contrary, time is only conceivable in a total bodily apperception and this does not happen only in the notorious “involuntary memory” episodes. As Malcolm Bowie puts it, “this {{is the time of}} human desire […] This time is not a concept […]. It is a stuff and there for the handling”. Only being perceived by senses, time can be given a conceptual sens. The body is, therefore, a cognitive structure in itself. Keywords: Proust, Material thought, style, sensorial language.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{confused}} conception about so-called cenesthopathy, a pricise clinical and follow-up study was made on 22 patients who presented peculiar cenesthopathic complpints during long terms. Such cases as organic diseases, apparent schizophrenia and depression were excluded. The author could classify them into 5 groups. The 1 st group is neurotic cases. The 2 nd group is schizophrenic cases shifted from so-called borderline cases. The 3 rd group is the cases of paranoid reaction. The 4 th group is borderline cases in adolescence. The last 5 th group is the cases unable to be classified into any groups above mentioned, and shows most characteristic symptoms. The distinguishing traits of 5 th group were as follows. They developed symptoms in middle ages after being affected psychologically or physically. The persistent abnormal <b>cenesthesia</b> full of agony was rather tinged with hallucination, and it was some experience of moving, tense or pulling sensations, or of utterly new strange foreign sensations. Despite the peculiar strange complaints, they did not make pathological interpretations and their insight into their morbid states was preserved to some extent. But, pathological obsessive attitudes (such as skin-rubbing) and temporary abulic states often appeared, so that in their course they wore temporarily psychotic feature. Despite the chronic course, schizophrenic tendency did not appear. The author discussed the psychopathology of cenesthopathy {{and concluded that the}} 5 th group should be diagnosed as typical cenesthopathia...|$|E
