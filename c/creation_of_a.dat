5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that {{the facts of the case}} did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
