The phenomenon such as ethnic group, nation or culture are tigtly adherent to conditions they rise from and sink. For that reason also ethnic, national and cultural identity are legally adherent to conditions in which their holders live. Main factors implicating the preservation of the cultural identity at czech minority group in south Ucraine are particularly the positive economic situation, contact with the authentic culture and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origine</b> and positive valuation of czech culture...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} conduct to {{investigate}} the interrelation between milk production during the first lactation with the age of calving {{and the length of}} pregnancy past in Albania, as well as the relation of milk production with feeding system. There are studied 27 cows imported from Austria during the year 2005, and managed in Nikel-Kruje. The study shows that the heifers aging 32 - 34 months have produced more milk than heifers ageing 28 - 31 months. In addition, the heifers that past more months of their pregnancy in Albania have produced less milk, which is related with the diffrence of feed ration from <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origine.</b> However, for both indicators there is not a statistically significant relationship at the 95. 0 % or higher confidence level. For each kilogram milk produced is spent 1, 15 Milk Unit out of 0, 85 - 0, 90 Milk Unit advised from the literature. The lack of good feeding during the entire lactation has influenced the milk production. So, the production of studied cows is 3735 kg milkin their first lactation while theeir mothers production in the first lactation is 5499 kg. Comparisons were done for the results obtained in our country and the country of origin. However, the results taken by the studied herd compare with the heifers imported in 1972 and from the literature, are aceptablefor the management conditios of our country. Simmental is a well adopted breed in the coastal/plain area of the country making possible the increase of milk production and the improvement of meat traits.
