Ten subjects (aged 8 - 12 years, 5 male- 5 female) refrained from toothbrushing for 2 days. On the third day, they rinsed their mouth for 1 min with 10 ml of a 10 % sucrose solution. They started to chew either parafilm or one and two <b>sticks</b> of <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> for 10 min. Measurements of plaque pH and F- concentrations and salivary samples were evalua-ted. In all three experiment groups (parafilm group, one <b>stick</b> <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> and two <b>sticks</b> <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> groups), plaque pH, salivary flow rate and buffering capacity increased obviously.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a chewing exercise on pain intensity and pressure-pain threshold in patients with myofascial pain. METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive women diagnosed with myofascial pain (MFP) according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria comprised the experimental group and 15 healthy age-matched female were used as controls. Subjects were asked to <b>chew</b> a <b>gum</b> <b>stick</b> for 9 min and to stay at rest for another 9 min afterwards. Pain intensity was rated on a visual analog scale (VAS) every 3 min. At 0, 9 and 18 min, the pressure-pain threshold (PPT) was measured bilaterally on the masseter and the anterior, medium, and posterior temporalis muscles. RESULTS: Patients with myofascial pain reported increase (76 %) and no change (24 %) on the pain intensity measured with the VAS. A reduction of the PPT at all muscular sites after the exercise and a non-significant recovery after rest were also observed. CONCLUSION: The following conclusions can be drawn: 1. {{there are at least two}} subtypes of patients with myofascial pain that respond differently to experimental chewing; 2. the chewing protocol had an adequate discriminative ability in distinguishing patients with myofascial pain from healthy controls.

Despite the awareness, most farmers did not handle pesticides with care and do not adhere to the use of PPE, hence, increasing their risks to danger of exposure to pesticides. Storage of pesticides in bedrooms was reported by 22.5  % of farmers; an indication of a high risk of pesticides exposure through direct inhalation. Cocoa farmers’ in the study area exhibited operational habits such as eating, drinking water and alcohol, smoking cigarette and tobacco pipes, <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> and <b>sticks,</b> talking, using the mouth to remove blockages from sprayer nozzles, stirring pesticides with bare hands, among others during pesticides application. The survey revealed that only 35  % of farmers put on full PPE while 45  % put on partial PPE [which is any or combination of the following; cap/hat, respirator, goggle, rubber glove, overall and wellington boot (rubber boot)] during pesticides application. On the other hand, 20  % of farmers in the study area applied pesticides without wearing PPE. These practices expose farmers to adverse health risks. Factors that influenced farmers’ decision to use PPE included farming experience, age of farmer, access to extension service, availability of a chemical shop, farm size and educational level.|$|R
