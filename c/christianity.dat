5|$|<b>Christianity</b> in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all aspects of}} <b>Christianity</b> in the modern borders of Scotland in the Middle Ages. <b>Christianity</b> was probably introduced {{to what is now}} Lowland Scotland by Roman soldiers stationed in the north of the province of Britannia. After the collapse of Roman authority in the fifth century, <b>Christianity</b> is presumed to have survived among the British enclaves in the south of what is now Scotland, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced. Scotland was largely converted by Irish missions associated with figures such as St Columba, from the fifth to the seventh centuries. These missions founded monastic institutions and collegiate churches that served large areas. Scholars have identified a distinctive form of Celtic <b>Christianity,</b> in which abbots were more significant than bishops, attitudes to clerical celibacy were more relaxed and there were significant differences in practice with Roman <b>Christianity,</b> particularly the form of tonsure and the method of calculating Easter, although most of these issues had been resolved by the mid-seventh century. After the reconversion of Scandinavian Scotland in the tenth century, <b>Christianity</b> under papal authority was the dominant religion of the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The Celtic Church is a {{term that}} has been used by {{scholars}} to describe a specific form of <b>Christianity</b> with its origins in the conversion of Ireland, traditionally associated with St. Patrick. This form of <b>Christianity</b> later spread to northern Britain through Iona. It is also used as a general description for the Christian establishment of northern Britain prior to the twelfth century, when new religious institutions and ideologies of primarily French origin began to take root in Scotland. The Celtic form of <b>Christianity</b> has been contrasted with that derived from missions from Rome, which reached southern England in 587 under the leadership of St. Augustine of Canterbury. Subsequent missions from Canterbury then helped convert the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, reaching Northumbria in the early eighth century, where Iona had already begun to have a presence. As a result, <b>Christianity</b> in Northumbria became a mix of Celtic and Roman influences.|$|E
