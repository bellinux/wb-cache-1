Positive effects {{were obtained by}} the administration of small quantities, namely fractions of milligrams, with 1 : 2 : 4 <b>chlorodinitrobenzene,</b> p-nitrosodimethylaniline, 1 : 2 : 4 trinitrobenzene, picryl chloride, four dichlorodinitrobenzenes, {{and a number of}} other aromatic compounds. Several substances chemically similar to those enumerated gave negative results. The first named compound is known to produce hypersensitiveness in human beings, a large number of cases having been observed in factory workers. The mechanism of these effects is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Bacillithiol (BSH), an α-anomeric {{glycoside}} of L-cysteinyl-D-glucosaminyl-L-malate, {{is a major}} {{low molecular}} weight thiol found in low GC Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus. Like other low molecular weight thiols, BSH is likely involved in protection against a number of stresses. We examined S. aureus transposon mutants disrupted {{in each of the}} three genes associated with BSH biosynthesis. These mutants are sensitive to alkylating stress, oxidative stress, and metal stress indicating that BSH and BSH-dependent enzymes are involved in protection of S. aureus. We further demonstrate that BshB, a deacetylase involved in the second step of BSH biosynthesis, also acts as a BSH conjugate amidase and identify S. aureus USA 300 LAC 2626 as a BSH-S-transferase, which is able to conjugate <b>chlorodinitrobenzene,</b> cerulenin, and rifamycin to BSH...|$|E
40|$|A mutant, T 7, highly {{sensitive}} to oxidative stress as caused by diamide was isolated from a Mycobacterium smegmatis mc 2155 transposon mutant library. While wild-type M. smegmatis {{is able to}} grow well on solid media supplemented with 10 mM diamide, T 7 is only able to grow on solid media containing up to 1 mM diamide. This mutant is also sensitive to other thiol modifying agents such as iodoacetamide and <b>chlorodinitrobenzene.</b> By sequencing the genomic DNA flanking the transposon, T 7 {{was found to be}} mutated in the region upstream of the homolog of M. tuberculosis Rv 0274 open reading frame. Sequence analysis revealed that Rv 0274 is a member of a superfamily of metalloenzymes comprising enzymes such as extradiol dioxygenases, glyoxalases, and fosfomycin resistant glutathione transferases. Cloning and epichromosomal expression of M. tuberculosis Rv 0274 in the mutant resulted in complementation of the sensitivity to diamide...|$|E
40|$|Exposure {{of human}} ovarian tumor cell lines to {{cisplatin}} led to development of cell lines that exhibited increasing degrees of drug resistance, which were closely correlated with {{increase of the}} levels of cellular glutathione. Cell lines were obtained that showed 30 - to 1000 -fold increases in resistance; these cells also had strikingly increased (13 - to 50 -fold) levels of glutathione {{as compared with the}} drug-sensitive cells of origin. These levels of resistance to cisplatin and the cellular glutathione levels are substantially greater than previously reported. Very high cisplatin resistance was associated with enhanced expression of mRNAs for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; immunoblots showed increase of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase but not of glutathione synthetase. Glutathione S-transferase activity was unaffected, as determined with <b>chlorodinitrobenzene</b> as a substrate. These studies suggest the potential value of examining regulation of glutathione synthesis as an indicator of clinical prognosis. The highly resistant cell lines are proving useful for studying the multiple mechanisms by which tumor cells acquire drug- and radiation-resistance...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{studies of}} a 9 -year-old boy with {{recurrent}} pulmonary infections and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis disclosed a severe defect in cell-mediated immunity but normal humoral immune responses. These immunological defects were not improved by initial treatment with transfer factor. After receiving a foetal thymus transplant the patient developed positive delayed-type skin tests, could be sensitized with <b>chlorodinitrobenzene,</b> and showed progressive improvement of in vitro lymphocyte functions including spontaneous formation of rosettes with sheep erythrocytes and positive responses to phytohaemagglutinin, concanavalin A and allogeneic leucocytes. Moreover, lymph node cellularity increased, {{especially in the}} thymus-dependent zones. Though the in vitro responses persisted for over 1 year, skin tests became unreactive at 38 weeks. However, {{in contrast to the}} pre-transplant experience transfer factor was now effective in inducing positive skin tests. These studies provide a chronological account of the effect of the thymus on expression of lymphocyte-mediated immune responses in man and suggest that thymus-derived cells are required for acquisition of transfer factor-induced cellular immunity...|$|E
40|$|Mycothiol (MSH), a {{functional}} analogue of glutathione (GSH) that is found exclusively in actinomycetes, reacts with electrophiles and toxins to form MSH-toxin conjugates. Mycothiol S-conjugate amidase (Mca) then catalyzes the hydrolysis of an amide bond in the S conjugates, producing a mercapturic acid of the toxin, which is excreted from the bacterium, and glucosaminyl inositol, which is recycled back to MSH. In this study, we have generated and characterized an allelic exchange mutant of the mca gene of Mycobacterium smegmatis. The mca mutant accumulates the S conjugates of the thiol-specific alkylating agent monobromobimane and the antibiotic rifamycin S. Introduction of M. tuberculosis mca epichromosomally or introduction of M. smegmatis mca integratively resulted in complementation of Mca activity and reduced levels of S conjugates. The mutation in mca renders the mutant strain {{more susceptible to}} electrophilic toxins, such as N-ethylmalemide, iodoacetamide, and <b>chlorodinitrobenzene,</b> and to several oxidants, such as menadione and plumbagin. Additionally we {{have shown that the}} mca mutant is also more susceptible to the antituberculous antibiotic streptomycin. Mutants disrupted in genes belonging to MSH biosynthesis are also more susceptible to streptomycin, providing further evidence that Mca detoxifies streptomycin in the mycobacterial cell in an MSH-dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|Manganese {{superoxide}} dismutase (MnSOD) is a mitochondrial enzyme that dismutates potentially toxic superoxide radical into hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen. This enzyme {{is critical for}} protection against cellular injury due to elevated partial pressures of oxygen. Thioredoxin (TRX) is a potent protein disulfide reductase found in most organisms that participates in many thiol-dependent cellular reductive processes and {{plays an important role}} in antioxidant defense, signal transduction, and regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Here we describe induction of manganese {{superoxide dismutase}} by thioredoxin. MnSOD mRNA and activity were increased dramatically by low concentrations of TRX (28 �M). Elevation of Mn-SOD mRNA by TRX was inhibited by actinomycin D, but not cycloheximide, occurring both in cell lines and primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells. mRNAs for other antioxidant enzymes including copper–zinc superoxide dismutase and catalase were not elevated, demonstrating specificity of induction of MnSOD by TRX. Thiol oxidation by diamide or alkylation by <b>chlorodinitrobenzene</b> inhibited MnSOD induction, further indicating a requirement for reduced TRX. Because both oxidized and reduced thioredoxin (28 �M) induced MnSOD mRNA, the intracellular redox status of externally added Escherichia coli oxidized TRX was determined. About 45 % of internalized E. coli TRX was reduced, with 8 % in fully reduced form and about 37 % in partially reduced form. However, when TRX reductase and nicotinamid...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{value of}} antimonial drugs, the mainstay therapy for leishmaniasis, is now {{threatened by the}} emergence of acquired drug resistance, and a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms is required. Using the model organism Leishmania tarentolae, we have examined the role of trypanothione S-transferase (TST) in trivalent antimony [Sb(III) ] resistance. TST has S-transferase activity with substrates such as <b>chlorodinitrobenzene</b> as well as peroxidase activity with alkyl and aryl hydroperoxides but not with hydrogen peroxide. Although S-transferase activity and TST protein levels were unchanged in Sb(III) -sensitive and -resistant lines, rates of metabolism of hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and cumene hydroperoxide were significantly increased. Elevated peroxidase activities were shown to be both trypanothione and tryparedoxin dependent and were associated with the overexpression of classical tryparedoxin peroxidase (TryP) in the cytosol of L. tarentolae. The role of TryP in Sb(III) resistance was verified by overexpression of the recombinant Leishmania major protein in Sb(III) -sensitive promastigotes. An approximate twofold increase in the level of TryP activity in this transgenic cell line was accompanied by a significant decrease in sensitivity to Sb(III) (twofold; P < 0. 001). Overexpression of an enzymatically inactive TryP failed to result in Sb(III) resistance. This indicates that TryP-dependent resistance is not due to sequestration of Sb(III) and suggests that enhanced antioxidant defenses may well be a key feature of mechanisms of clinical resistance to antimonial drugs...|$|E
40|$|CaCo 2 cells, {{cultivated}} in a synthetic, serum-free nutritive medium on poly (ethylene terephthalate) membranes, form a confluent monolayer of differentiated cells, with the apical and basolateral poles {{exposed to the}} upper and lower compartments, respectively, of bicameral culture inserts (Halleux and Schneider, In Vitro Cell Dev Biol, 27 A: 293 - 302, 1991). This cell culture system allows the passage of intact mannitol by the paracellular route and the transcellular diffusion of testosterone which appears mainly as a biotransformed unconjugated metabolite. When ethoxyresorufin is added to either the apical or basolateral poles of living CaCo 2 cells, resorufin is formed, and more than 80 % is excreted at the apical pole. Under our experimental conditions, no detectable amounts of glucurono- or sulfconjugates are found. Methylcholanthrene and phenobarbital increase the biotransformation of ethoxyresorufin 50 and 3 times, respectively, and induce that of benzoxyresorufin, but not of pentoxyresorufin which remains absent under all conditions. These substances do not affect the proportion of resorufin recovered at the apical role. Verapamil inhibits by 25 % the release of resorufin but does not affect its distribution. <b>Chlorodinitrobenzene</b> is conjugated with glutathione and at least two-thirds of the product is excreted at the apical pole; methylcholanthrene and phenobarbital do not increase this activity. These results demonstrate that differentiated CaCo 2 cells, under serum-free conditions, perform phase I and II reactions and that the biotransformation products are selectively excreted at the apical pole...|$|E
40|$|Hepatocytes in vivo express Alpha and Mu but not Pi {{forms of}} {{glutathione}} S-transferase (GST). GST P (a fetal Pi form) appears in rat hepatocytes after 2 days in primary culture, {{which suggests that}} hepatocytes may undergo dedifferentiation [Abramovitz, Ishigaki and Listowsky (1989) Hepatology 9, 235 - 239]. However, in this and other studies, primary rat hepatocyte cultures were shown by immunohistochemistry to contain significant numbers of lipocytes (Ito cells). Freshly isolated lipocytes contained GST activity when assayed with <b>chlorodinitrobenzene</b> (680 nmol/min per mg), and expression of Alpha, Mu and Pi forms of GST was detected by Western-blot analysis. Expression of GST P persisted during culture of the lipocytes. In situ hybridization of the cultured cells was performed to define whether hepatocytes, lipocytes or both expressed the enzyme. Lipocytes in culture contained abundant GST P transcripts. Hepatocytes contained no GST P transcripts after 12 h in culture, and after 24 h, only a few hepatocytes expressed this enzyme. After 48 h in culture all hepatocytes contained GST P transcripts, {{and the number of}} transcripts continued to increase up until 72 h. Therefore, in freshly isolated preparations of hepatocytes and early in hepatocyte culture, measurable levels of GST P protein or message appeared to reflect the presence of lipocytes. After 48 h in culture almost all of the GST P reflected expression by the hepatocytes. Lipocytes constitutively expressed Alpha-, Mu- and Pi-class GSTs and had significant intracellular levels of GSH (5. 2 nmol/mg of protein). Lipocytes are capable therefore of detoxifying a number of injurious compounds...|$|E
40|$|The multidrug {{resistance}} protein 2 (MRP 2) {{has been shown}} {{to play an important role}} in the transport of glutathione conjugates in the liver. Its importance in renal excretion, however, is still uncertain and other organic anion transporters may be involved. The objective of the present study was to characterize glutathione conjugate efflux from rat kidney proximal tubule cells (PTC), and to determine the contribution of Mrp 2. We used isolated PTC in suspension, as well as grown to monolayer density. For comparison, transport characteristics were also determined in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco- 2, an established model to study MRP 2 -mediated transport. The cells were loaded with monochlorobimane (MCB) at 10 °C. MCB enters the cells by simple diffusion and is conjugated with glutathione to form the fluorescent glutathione-bimane (GS-B). In primary cultures of rat PTC, no indications for a transporter-mediated mechanism were found. The efflux of GS-B from Caco- 2 cells and freshly isolated PTC was time- and temperature-dependent. Furthermore, GS-B transport in both models was inhibited by <b>chlorodinitrobenzene</b> (CDNB), with an inhibitory constant of 46. 8 ± 0. 9 [*]μM in freshly isolated PTC. In Caco- 2 cells, the inhibitory potency of CDNB was approximately 20 fold higher. Finally, efflux of GS-B from freshly isolated PTC from Mrp 2 -deficient (TR−) rats was studied. As compared to normal rat PTC, transport characteristics were not different. We conclude that in freshly isolated rat PTC glutathione conjugate excretion is mediated by other organic anion transporters rather than by Mrp 2...|$|E
40|$|Sulfasalazine is characterised by low oral bioavailability. In this study, its {{intestinal}} transport {{characteristics were}} studied in an in-vitro, ex-vivo and in-situ system. The absorptive transport of sulfasalazine across Caco- 2 monolayers {{appeared to be}} lower than the secretory transport (P(app-abs) = 0. 21 +/- 0. 02 x 10 (- 6) cm s(- 1) and P(app-secr) = 2. 97 +/- 0. 30 x 10 (- 6) cm s(- 1), respectively). This polarity in transport of sulfasalazine was not mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as inclusion of verapamil (100 microM) {{did not have any}} effect on the transport polarity of sulfasalazine. However, inclusion of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) inhibitors benzbromarone (50 microM) and sulfinpyrazone (1 mM), and the glutathione-depleting agent <b>chlorodinitrobenzene</b> (100 microM), resulted in an increased absorptive transport of sulfasalazine in the Caco- 2 system (P(app-abs) = 0. 64 +/- 0. 02, 0. 51 +/- 0. 04 and 0. 60 +/- 0. 03 x 10 (- 6) cm s(- 1), respectively). The interference of carriers implies that, during absorption, interactions with food components may occur at the level of this carrier. Therefore, the effect of food extracts was studied in a parallel set of experiments. For two standardized nature-identical fruit extracts (pineapple and apricot extract) a concentration-dependent absorption-enhancing effect could be observed in the Caco- 2 system. The functional expression of similar carriers was also demonstrated in rat ileum in the Ussing chamber system. Interaction studies with fruit extracts in the Ussing chamber system, {{as well as in the}} in-situ intestinal perfusion study, revealed a 2 - to 4 -fold increase in the absorptive transport of sulfasalazine. These results indicate that food components in the intestinal lumen can have a significant impact on the intestinal absorption characteristics of sulfasalazine by modulating the biochemical barrier function of the intestinal mucosa. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{combinatorial}} chemistry (DCC) {{is a novel}} approach to medicinal chemistry which integrates the synthesis and screening of small molecule libraries into a single step. The concept uses reversible chemical reactions to present a dynamic library of candidate structures to a template which selects and removes the best binder from equilibrium. Using this evolutionary process with a biopolymer template, such as a protein, leads to the protein directing the synthesis of its own best ligand. Biological DCC applications are extremely challenging since the thermodynamic criterion of reversibility has to be met under physiological conditions to ensure stability of the biomolecular template. The list of reversible reactions satisfying these stringent criteria is limited and is a major constraint on achieving both reaction and structural diversity in adaptive dynamic libraries. This thesis reports {{the development of a}} catalysed version of acylhydrazone dynamic libraries which are truly adaptive under protein-friendly conditions. In the presence of aniline as a trans-imination catalyst, acylhydrazone dynamic combinatorial libraries equilibrate rapidly at pH 6. 2 and are switched off by an increase in pH. We designed acylhydrazone libraries targeting the enzyme superfamily Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) using a scaffold aldehyde, 4 -chloro- 3 -nitrobenzaldehyde, which is structurally related to a known GST substrate <b>chlorodinitrobenzene.</b> On interfacing these dynamic libraries with two different GST enzymes (SjGST from the helminth worm Schistosoma japonicum and hGSTP 1 - 1, a human isoform and an important oncology drug target) we observed isoformselective amplification effects with two different acylhydrazones selected by the proteins. To explore the potential of anchoring in our DCC methodology we conjugated the endogenous GST ligand, glutathione (GSH) onto the scaffold chloronitrobenzaldehyde. The GSH recognition motif acts as an anchor and allows us to explore the hydrophobic binding site of the enzyme in a fragment-based approach. The presence of the glutathione moiety led to increased solubility of the library members and a DCC experiment with the enzymes led to the selection of conjugate hydrazones with significant binding ability. Multi-level dynamic libraries use multiple exchange processes in the same system to increase their accessible structural diversity. These exchange reactions may be orthogonal, where the different chemistries can be activated or deactivated independently of each other, or simultaneous, where all the processes are dynamic and crossover under the same conditions. Together, these interacting molecular networks provide an exciting experimental approach to the emerging field of systems chemistry. We demonstrate that two reversible reactions, conjugate addition of thiols to enones and hydrazone formation, are fully compatible and orthogonal to one another in a single dynamic library. Hydrazone exchange takes place at acidic pH, while conjugate addition operates at basic pH. Simple pH change can be used to switch between each process and establish two channels of reactivity...|$|E
