50|$|In contrast, the {{dew point}} {{measurement}} is considerably more complex. The original dew point sensor deployed on ASOS systems utilized a chilled mirror that is cooled {{to the point where}} a fine film of condensation forms on the mirror's surface. The temperature of the mirror at this condition is equal to {{the dew point}} temperature. The hygrometer measures the dew point by directing a light beam from a small infrared diode {{to the surface of the}} mirror at an angle of 45 degrees. Two photo transistors are mounted so they measure a high degree of reflected light when the mirror is clear (direct) and scattered light when the mirror is clouded with visible condensation (indirect). With the formation of condensation on the mirror, the degree of cloudiness of the mirror surface increases with the direct transistor receiving less light and the indirect transistor more light. The output from these photo transistors controls the mirror <b>cooling</b> <b>module</b> which is an electronic heat pump that operates much like a thermocouple in reverse, producing a heating or cooling effect. When the sensor is first activated, the mirror is clear. As the mirror surface temperature is cooled to the dew point temperature, condensations forms on the mirror. The electronics continuously tries to stabilize the signal levels to the power amplifier to maintain the mirror temperature at the dew point. If the dew point of the air changes or if the circuit is disturbed by noise, the loop makes the necessary corrections to restabilize at the dew point and maintaining continuous operation.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project {{was based on}} the Design, Implementation and Evaluation of a Photovoltaic Water heating system in South Africa, Eastern Cape Province. The {{purpose of the study was}} to design and investigate the scientific and economic contribution of direct water cooling on the photovoltaic module. The method involved performance comparison of two photovoltaic <b>modules,</b> one naturally <b>cooled</b> (M 1) and the other, direct water <b>cooled</b> <b>module</b> (M 2). Module M 2 was used to produce warm water and electricity, hence, a hybrid system. The study focused on comparing the modules’ efficiency, power output and their performance. The temperatures attained by water through <b>cooling</b> the <b>module</b> were monitored as well as the electrical energy generated. A data logger and a low cost I/V characteristic system were used for data collection for a full year. The data were then used for performance analysis of the modules. The results of the study revealed that the directly water <b>cooled</b> <b>module</b> could operate at a higher electrical efficiency for 87 % of the day and initially produced 3. 63 % more electrical energy each day. This was found to be true for the first three months after installation. In the remaining months to the end of the year M 2 was found to have more losses as compared to M 1 as evidenced by the modules’ performance ratios. The directly water <b>cooled</b> <b>module</b> also showed an energy saving efficiency of 61 %. A solar utilization of 47. 93 % was found for M 2 while 8. 77 % was found for M 1. Economically, the project was found to be viable and the payback period of the directly <b>cooled</b> <b>module</b> (M 2) system was found to be 9. 8 years. Energy economics showed that the system was more sensitive to the price changes and to the energy output as compared to other inputs such as operation and maintenance and years of operation. A generation cost of R 0. 84 /kWh from the system was found and when compared to the potential revenue of R 1. 18 per kWh, the system was found to enable households to make a profit of 40. 5 %. Use of such a system was also found to be able to contribute 9. 55 % towards carbon emission reduction each year. From these results, it was concluded that a directly cooled photovoltaic/thermal heating (PV/T) system is possible and that it can be of much help in terms of warm water and electricity provision...|$|R

40|$|The results {{presented}} in this thesis showed {{that there are many}} areas on a complete truck-trailer combination where substantial drag reductions may be acquired. It has been seen that for longer vehicle combinations, the gap between the cargo-units and the chassis level of the trailer units were large sources of drag, especially in yawed-wind conditions. By design changes of these areas, drag was reduced by significant amounts. Working with the front-end of the COE cab, an elongation of the grille area could result in both improved aerodynamic properties, but also cooling airflow can be enhanced if also considering the layout of the components in the under hood. Without a ducting system, guiding the flow from the grille towards the <b>cooling</b> <b>module,</b> or a movement of the <b>cooling</b> <b>module</b> by the same magnitude as the SN elongation, {{a large portion of the}} airflow in the under hood leaked around the <b>cooling</b> <b>module</b> and reduced cooling capacity.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is a continuing}} analysis of cooling performance and aerodynamic properties of a rear mounted <b>cooling</b> <b>module</b> on a semi generic commercial vehicle, which {{was carried out by}} Larsson, Löfdahl and Wiklund [1]. In the previous study two designs of the cooling package installation were positioned behind the rear wheelhouse and the results were compared to a front mounted <b>cooling</b> <b>module.</b> The investigation was mainly focused on a critical cooling situation occurring at lower vehicle speeds for a distribution vehicle. The conclusion from the study was that the cooling performance for one of the rear mounted installation was favorable compared to the front mounted cooling package. This was mainly due to the low vehicle speed, the high fan speed and to fewer obstacles around the <b>cooling</b> <b>module</b> resulting in a lower system restriction within the installation. The main purpose with the present investigation was to determine the power needed to overcome the aerodynamic drag together with the power needed by the fan to obtain a specific cooling performance at a higher vehicle speed. One front and three rear mounted cooling package installations with a vehicle operating at 90 km/h were included in the analysis. The study the vehicle geometry was modified to be able to implement the changes for the rear <b>cooling</b> <b>module</b> installations. The design of the air inlet, air outlet and the duct in front of and after the cooling package were changed for the rear mounted cooling package installation to improve the airflow and as a result the cooling performance. The investigation was performed by the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics. It was found that the total power required due to aerodynamic drag and fan operation to obtain a specific cooling performance was reduced for two of the rear mounted compared to the front mounted <b>cooling</b> <b>module.</b> Even though the fan for these installations required more power, the total power needed by the vehicle was decreased due to a lower aerodynamic resistance. The total power demand was decreased by 1. 9 kW for one of the rear mounted installations compared to the front mounted cooling package. Furthermore it was established that the design of the air inlet for a rear mounted cooling package was important to obtain a low total power demand, a high mass flow of air through the <b>cooling</b> <b>module</b> and to obtain an uniform flow over the heat exchangers. For a critical driving situation due to cooling performance, occurring at lower vehicle speeds, the rear mounted cooling packages were also favorable due to cooling performance compared to the front mounted <b>cooling</b> <b>module</b> installation. This was mainly due to the lower system resistance and higher static fan efficiency received for these installations. To increase the cooling performance and decrease the required power even more the air inlet, the fan choice and the duct geometry can be further developed...|$|E

40|$|Heavy {{vehicles}} are major emitters of noise. Especially at idle or low vehicle speeds {{a large portion}} of the noise emanates from the fan that forces the ﬂow through the <b>cooling</b> <b>module.</b> The aim of this work is to investigate and reveal aerodynamic and acoustic installation effects linked to the cooling package. This introduces a multidisciplinary approach involving examination of the ﬂow ﬁeld, sound generation and sound propagation. The work includes two main parts: an experimental and a numerical part. The <b>cooling</b> <b>module</b> used throughout this work, named reduced <b>cooling</b> <b>module,</b> primarily includes a radiator, a shroud, a fan and a hydraulic engine to simplify the aeroacoustics analysis.

Also, a separate determination of the transmission loss of the radiator is performed. The impact of the radiator on the transmitted noise was found to be negligible.
