40|$|International audienceThis paper {{considers}} the capital {{structure of a}} bank in a continuous-time regime-switching economy. The modeling framework takes into account various categories of instruments, including equity, <b>contingent</b> convertible <b>debts,</b> straight debts, deposits and deposits insurance. Whereas previous researches concentrate on {{the determination of the}} capital structure that maximizes shareholders' equity, this work focuses on the fair pricing of liabilities that ensures no cross-subsidization among stakeholders. This is discussed in a case study where the bank's EBIT is modeled by a four-regime process and is fitted to real market data. A numerical analysis reveals that convertible debts can significantly reduce the cost of deposits insurance and straight debts as well as probabilities of bankruptcy. Although it is found that the risk of dilution for shareholders is important, paradoxically, a high conversion rate for the <b>contingent</b> convertible <b>debt,</b> compensated by a low interest cost before conversion, can delay this dilution. Finally, we find that in case of change of economic regime, there exists an optimal capital structure from the shareholder's perspective...|$|R
40|$|Modern finance is {{increasingly}} dominated by derivatives and similar contracts that create contingent debts, which become payable only upon {{the occurrence of}} an uncertain future event. This Article identifies a pervasive opportunism hazard created by <b>contingent</b> <b>debt</b> that lawmakers and scholars have overlooked. If liability on a firm 2 ̆ 7 s <b>contingent</b> <b>debt</b> is especially likely to be triggered when the firm is insolvent, the contract that creates the debt transfers wealth from the firm 2 ̆ 7 s creditors to its shareholders. A firm therefore has incentive to engage in correlation-seeking - that is, to incur contingent debts that correlate, or that through asset purchases {{can be made to}} correlate, with the firm 2 ̆ 7 s insolvency risk. The consequence is an overuse of <b>contingent</b> <b>debt</b> that destroys social wealth through overinvestment, higher borrowing costs, financial distress, and potential systemic risk. Correlation-seeking is especially pernicious because, unlike other forms of shareholder opportunism such as asset substitution, it can reduce risk to shareholders even as it increases shareholder returns. Conduct that is consistent with correlation-seeking {{played a central role in}} the 2008 financial crisis, causing the deep losses suffered by the three firms to receive the biggest bailouts: AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.

40|$|A tax-smoothing {{objective}} {{is used to}} assess the optimal composition of public debt with respect to maturity and contingencies. This objective motivates the government to make its debt payouts contingent on the levels of public outlay and the tax base. If these contingencies are present, but asset prices of non-contingent indexed debt are stochastic, then full tax smoothing dictates an optimal maturity structure of the non-contingent debt. If the certainty equivalent outlays are the same for each period, then the government should guarantee equal real payouts in each period, that is, the debt takes the form of indexed consols. This structure insulates the government¡¯s budget constraint from unpredictable variations in the market prices of indexed bonds of various maturities. If <b>contingent</b> <b>debt</b> is precluded, then the government may want to depart from a consol maturity structure to exploit covariances among public outlay, the tax base, and the term structure of real interest rates. However, if moral hazard is the reason for the preclusion of <b>contingent</b> <b>debt,</b> then this consideration also deters exploitation of these covariances and tends to return the optimal solution to the consol maturity structure. The issue of nominal bonds may allow the government to exploit the covariances among public outlay, the tax base, and the rate of inflation. But if moral-hazard explains the absence of <b>contingent</b> <b>debt,</b> then the same reasoning tends to make nominal debt issue undesirable. The bottom line is that an optimal-tax approach to public debt favors bonds that are indexed and long term. Indexed debt, Nominal debt...|$|E

40|$|The large {{wealth and}} {{consumption}} inequality in the U. S. is usually attributed to two market frictions: debt constraints and incomplete markets. Recent literature {{has argued that}} debt constraints are the critical friction while market incompleteness plays only a secondary role. We evaluate the independent role of debt constraints versus market incompleteness to explain U. S. inequality. We introduce full insurance opportunities in a standard model of inequality {{along the lines of}} Aiyagari (1994). Debt constraints are the only friction in such model. We find that for a quite standard calibration of the income process, that of Heaton and Lucas (1996), debt constraints alone can explain none of the observed inequality. The reason is that the U. S. capital stock would be enough to secure all required <b>contingent</b> <b>debts</b> if markets were completed. Using various non-standard calibrations, we find that debt constraints can play an important role to explain inequality but still market incompleteness remains as the main friction.

S. government relative to gross domestic product increased substantially since the financial crisis and the Great Recession that began in 2007, but the debt ratio has been increasing since 2001. Gross debt relative to GDP increased from 55 percent in 2001 to 67 percent in 2007 to 107 percent in 2012 Comparable figures for debt held by the public (net debt or gross debt minus debt held by various government agencies) were 80 percent in 2011 and 84 percent in May 2012 (IMF 2012). As a result, the debt ratio is now the highest in U. S. history, except for World War II, when it reached 125 percent of GDP (Bohn 2010). U. S. debt is also high relative to the debt of other high-income countries, and projections of future debt place the U.
