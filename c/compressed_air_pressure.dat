Erosion is a phenomenon that occurs in pneumatic conveying pipeline due to the inherent nature of conveying process.

40|$|Thermoplastics are {{increasingly}} being used in biomedical, automotive and electronics industries due to their excellent physical and chemical properties. Due to the localized and non-contact process, use of lasers for cutting could result in precise cut with small heat-affected zone (HAZ). Precision laser cutting involving various materials is important in high-volume manufacturing processes to minimize operational cost, error reduction and improve product quality. This study uses grey relational analysis to determine a single optimized set of cutting parameters for three different thermoplastics. The set of the optimized processing parameters is determined based on the highest relational grade and was found at low laser power (200 W), high cutting speed (0. 4 m/min) and low <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> (2. 5 bar). The result matches with the objective set in the present study.

40|$|Emptying of an {{initially}} water-filled horizontal PVC pipeline {{driven by}} different upstream <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> and with different outflow restriction conditions, with motion of an air-water front through the pressurized pipeline, is investigated experimentally. Simple numerical modeling {{is used to}} interpret the results, especially the observed additional shortening of the moving full water column due to formation of a stratified water-air 2 ̆ 2 tail 2 ̆ 2. Measured discharges, water-level changes and pressure variations along the pipeline during emptying are compared using Control Volume model results. The CV model solutions for a non-stratified case are shown to be delayed {{as compared with the}} actual measured changes of flow rate, pressure and water level, but by considering water-column mass loss due to the water-air tail and residual motion, the calibrated CV model yields solutions that are qualitatively in good agreement with the experimental results. A key interpretation is that the long air-cavity celerity is close to its critical value at the instant of minimum flow acceleration. The influences of driving pressure, inertia and friction predominate, with the observed water hammer caused by the initiating downstream valve opening not significantly influencing the water-air front propagation.

The simulations were carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results showed that the exhaust-gas recycling efficiency and the merger flow energy are significantly dependent on the optimal adjustments of A and CSA for the change in Pair. The optimal conditions for higher exhaust-gas recycling efficiency and the best energy merging process can be achieved at A of around 25 - 100 % and a CSA of around 5 - 40 % for a full range of Pair. Under these conditions, the exhaust-gas recycling efficiency reached approximately 80 - 88 %.
