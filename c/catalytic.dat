5|$|In 2007, Gerhard Ertl won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for {{determining}} the detailed molecular mechanisms of the <b>catalytic</b> oxidation of carbon monoxide over platinum (<b>catalytic</b> converter).|$|E
5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, {{by the turn}} of the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way <b>catalytic</b> converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous <b>catalytic</b> converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way <b>catalytic</b> converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{divergent}} {{evolution of}} function (and even the triad's nucleophile), <b>catalytic</b> triads show {{some of the}} best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same <b>catalytic</b> solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Circular {{permutations}} {{are routinely}} engineered {{in the laboratory}} to improve their <b>catalytic</b> activity or thermostability, or to investigate properties of the original protein.|$|E
5|$|Despite these methods, {{much work}} {{remains to be}} done with regard to <b>catalytic</b> {{installation}} of α-β unsaturation.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{are usually}} {{much larger than}} their substrates. Sizes range from just 62 amino acid {{residues}}, for the monomer of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, to over 2,500 residues in the animal fatty acid synthase. Only {{a small portion of}} their structure (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis: the <b>catalytic</b> site. This <b>catalytic</b> site is located next to one or more binding sites where residues orient the substrates. The <b>catalytic</b> site and binding site together comprise the enzyme's active site. The remaining majority of the enzyme structure serves to maintain the precise orientation and dynamics of the active site.|$|E
5|$|Improve <b>catalytic</b> activity. Circularly permuting {{a protein}} can {{sometimes}} increase {{the rate at}} which it catalyzes a chemical reaction, leading to more efficient proteins.|$|E
5|$|Most serpins are {{protease}} inhibitors, targeting extracellular, chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. These proteases {{possess a}} nucleophilic serine residue in a <b>catalytic</b> triad in their active site. Examples include thrombin, trypsin, and human neutrophil elastase. Serpins act as irreversible, suicide inhibitors by trapping an intermediate of the protease's <b>catalytic</b> mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioactive}} isotope 46Sc {{is used in}} oil refineries as a tracing agent. Scandium triflate is a <b>catalytic</b> Lewis acid used in organic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of improvements to this reaction have focused on rendering the transformation <b>catalytic</b> {{with respect to the}} palladium salt, primarily due to its high cost. The original conditions, though technically <b>catalytic,</b> still require 50 mol% of palladium(II) actetate, raising the cost to prohibitively high levels for large scale syntheses.|$|E
5|$|Threonine proteases use {{the amino}} acid {{threonine}} as their <b>catalytic</b> nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a methyl group). This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes {{with either the}} enzyme backbone or histidine base. Consequently, the <b>catalytic</b> residue of a threonine protease is located at it N-terminus.|$|E
5|$|Within {{protease}} superfamilies {{that contain}} {{a mixture of}} nucleophiles (e.g. the PA clan), families are designated by their <b>catalytic</b> nucleophile (C=cysteine proteases, S=serine proteases).|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of RNA-based {{biological}} catalysts called ribozymes exist, which again can act alone or in complex with proteins. The most common {{of these is the}} ribosome which is a complex of protein and <b>catalytic</b> RNA components.|$|E
5|$|Aaron and Abe require {{palladium}} {{to build}} their machine. This is the reason they take the <b>catalytic</b> converter containing {{a small amount of}} palladium from a car.|$|E
5|$|<b>Catalytic</b> {{variants}} employing stoichiometric diallylcarbonate {{and other}} allylic carbonates {{have also been}} developed, primarily by Jiro Tsuji. For these the choice of solvent is essential: nitrile solvents produce the desired enones while ethereal solvents produce α-allyl ketones instead.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors are {{molecules}} that reduce or abolish enzyme activity, while enzyme activators are {{molecules that}} increase the <b>catalytic</b> rate of enzymes. These interactions can be either reversible (i.e., removal of the inhibitor restores enzyme activity) or irreversible (i.e., the inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme).|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{are known}} to {{catalyze}} more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types. Most enzymes are proteins, although a few are <b>catalytic</b> RNA molecules. The latter are called ribozymes. Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes may use {{several of}} these {{mechanisms}} simultaneously. For example, proteases such as trypsin perform covalent catalysis using a <b>catalytic</b> triad, stabilise charge build-up on the transition states using an oxyanion hole, complete hydrolysis using an oriented water substrate.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Ronald Breslow {{proposed}} that a relatively stable nucleophilic carbene, a thiazol-2-ylidene derivative, {{was involved in}} the <b>catalytic</b> cycle of vitamin B1 (thiamine) that yields furoin from furfural.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Carl Woese {{hypothesized}} that RNA might be <b>catalytic</b> {{and suggested that}} the earliest forms of life (self-replicating molecules) could have relied on RNA both to carry genetic information and to catalyze biochemical reactions—an RNA world.|$|E
5|$|In archaea, the Rrp41 subunit of {{the complex}} is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Three copies of this protein {{are present in the}} ring and are {{responsible}} for the activity {{of the complex}}. In eukaryotes, none of the RNase PH subunits have retained this <b>catalytic</b> activity, meaning the core ring structure of the human exosome has no enzymatically active protein. Despite this loss of <b>catalytic</b> activity, the structure of the core exosome is highly conserved from archea to humans, suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function. In eukaryotes, the absence of the phosphorolytic activity is compensated by the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes, which are responsible for the ribonuclease activity of the exosome in such organisms.|$|E
5|$|In biochemistry, {{physical}} and chemical constraints on mechanisms have caused some active site arrangements such as the <b>catalytic</b> triad to evolve independently in separate enzyme superfamilies.|$|E
5|$|In some enzymes, no {{amino acids}} are {{directly}} involved in catalysis; instead, the enzyme contains sites to bind and orient <b>catalytic</b> cofactors. Enzyme structures may also contain allosteric sites where the binding of a small molecule causes a conformational change that increases or decreases activity.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{possible}} to achieve <b>catalytic</b> activation using a donating or withdrawing group alone, although {{the efficiency of}} the reaction (yield, reaction time, etc.) is typically lower.|$|E
5|$|Like rhenium and palladium, {{technetium}} {{can serve}} as a catalyst. In processes such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe <b>catalytic</b> applications.|$|E
5|$|Since {{no natural}} amino acids are {{strongly}} nucleophilic, the base in a <b>catalytic</b> triad polarises and deprotonates the nucleophile {{to increase its}} reactivity. Additionally, it protonates the first product to aid leaving group departure.|$|E
5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the <b>catalytic</b> cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the <b>catalytic</b> threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E
5|$|The major {{advances}} in <b>catalytic</b> {{versions of this}} reaction have steered towards co-oxidants that regenerate the palladium(II) species effectively. Specifically, conditions using atmospheric oxygen as well as stoichiometric allylcarbonate have been developed.|$|E
5|$|This method {{suffers from}} long {{reaction}} times and often produces significantly lower yields than the stoichiometric equivalent as showcased in {{the synthesis of}} platyphillide by Nishida. The contrast of the two methods highlights the <b>catalytic</b> method's shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|Three works XJ220-Cs {{were entered}} in the 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans race, in the newly created Grand Touring Class. John Nielsen, David Brabham and David Coulthard won the GT class, beating Porsche by two laps; the other two cars retired, both through engine failure. However, the class win was revoked when the Jaguar XJ220-C was {{controversially}} disqualified for failing to run with <b>catalytic</b> converters. The Jaguars had passed scrutiny and completed {{the first day of}} qualifying when senior steward Alain Bertaut complained that Jaguar were not running <b>catalytic</b> converters. The cars had been entered under the IMSA GT category and Bertaut claimed that they needed to run with catalysts. The cars ran in the race under appeal.|$|E
5|$|With {{respect to}} the former, the method {{developed}} by Larock in 1995 represents an environmentally and cost-attractive method as a <b>catalytic</b> substitute for the Saegusa–Ito oxidation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>catalytic</b> domain {{contains}} two zinc ions {{and at least}} one calcium ion coordinated to various residues. One of the two zinc ions is present in the active site and is involved in the <b>catalytic</b> processes of the MMPs. The second zinc ion (also known as structural zinc) and the calcium ion are present in the <b>catalytic</b> domain approximately 12 Å away from the <b>catalytic</b> zinc. The <b>catalytic</b> zinc ion is essential for the proteolytic activity of MMPs; the three histidine residues that coordinate with the <b>catalytic</b> zinc are conserved among all the MMPs. Little is known about the roles of the second zinc ion and the calcium ion within the <b>catalytic</b> domain, but the MMPs are shown to possess high affinities for structural zinc and calcium ions.|$|E
25|$|Zeolites {{are applied}} in drying of process air, CO2 removal from natural gas, CO removal from {{reforming}} gas, air separation, <b>catalytic</b> cracking, and <b>catalytic</b> synthesis and reforming.|$|E
25|$|Related {{to this is}} <b>catalytic</b> de{{hydrogen}}ation, {{where an}} alkane loses hydrogen at high temperatures to produce a corresponding alkene. This is the reverse of the <b>catalytic</b> hydrogenation of alkenes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>catalytic</b> {{mechanism}} of enzymes within a superfamily is typically conserved, although substrate specificity may be significantly different. <b>Catalytic</b> residues {{also tend to}} occur in the same order in the protein sequence. The families within the PA clan of proteases, although there has been divergent evolution of the <b>catalytic</b> triad residues used to perform catalysis, all members use a similar mechanism to perform covalent, nucleophilic catalysis on proteins, peptides or amino acids. However, mechanism alone is not sufficient to infer relatedness, since some <b>catalytic</b> mechanisms have been convergently evolved multiple times independently, and so form separate superfamilies.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1950s, {{the first}} noble metal <b>catalytic</b> {{reforming}} process (the Platformer process) was commercialized. At the same time, the <b>catalytic</b> hydrodesulfurization of the naphtha feed to such reformers was also commercialized. In the decades that followed, various proprietary <b>catalytic</b> hydrodesulfurization processes, {{such as the}} one depicted in the flow diagram below, have been commercialized. Currently, virtually all of the petroleum refineries worldwide have one or more HDS units.|$|E
