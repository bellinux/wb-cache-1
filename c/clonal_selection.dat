5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The <b>Clonal</b> <b>Selection</b> Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{resignation}} from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an {{office at the}} University of Melbourne in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books {{on a variety of}} topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography, which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published Cellular Immunology, considered his magnum opus on immunity, attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> theory. The following year, he wrote Immunological Surveillance, which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.|$|E
40|$|<b>Clonal</b> <b>selections</b> {{occurring}} {{during the}} progression of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) -induced T-cell lymphomas in mice were examined in primary and transplanted tumors by monitoring various molecular markers: proviral integration patterns, MuLV insertions near c-myc and pim- 1, and rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and beta-chain T-cell receptor genes. The results were as follows. Moloney MuLV frequently induced oligoclonal tumors with proviral insertions near c-myc or pim- 1 in the independent clones. Moloney MuLV acted as a highly efficient insertional mutagen, able to activate different (putative) oncogenes in one cell lineage. <b>Clonal</b> <b>selections</b> during tumor progression were frequently marked by the acquisition of new proviral integrations. Independent tumor cell clones exhibited a homing preference upon transplantation in syngeneic hosts and were differently affected by the route of transplantation...|$|R

25|$|Early {{results in}} the late 20th century, were not very {{promising}} for California winemakers.

The Antinori family, which once owned Atlas Peak Vineyards located in the Atlas Peak AVA in the foothills of Napa Valley found that the greater intensity of sunlight in California may have been one possible factor for the poorer quality. Today the style of these Californian Sangiovese tend to be more fruit-driven than their Tuscan counterparts with some floral notes. Recent years have focused on improving vineyard site and <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> as well as giving the vines time to age and develop in quality.|$|E

Initial percent plot cover in May ranged from 8 % to 42 % among clonal accessions. Accessions which produced the highest unmowed canopy heights had the greatest initial cover in May. This trend reversed itself by August and September whereby entries which exhibited less elevated foliage tended to produce turfs which had higher shoot densities, greater percent plot cover, visual estimates of density and more acceptable overall turfgrass quality under accumulated mowing pressure. The "treatment" (clonal accession) affect was significant on all dates for all field variables demonstrating clearly that differences exist for growth parameters of Distichlis screened under mowing stress...|$|R
25|$|Naive {{cytotoxic}} T {{cells are}} activated when their T-cell receptor (TCR) strongly interacts with a peptide-bound MHC class I molecule. This affinity {{depends on the}} type and orientation of the antigen/MHC complex, and is what keeps the CTL and infected cell bound together. Once activated, the CTL undergoes a process called <b>clonal</b> <b>selection,</b> in which it gains functions and divides rapidly to produce an army of “armed” effector cells. Activated CTL then travels throughout the body searching for cells that bear that unique MHC Class I + peptide.|$|E
25|$|A {{theoretical}} framework explaining {{the workings of}} the adaptive immune system is provided by immune network theory, based on interactions between idiotypes (unique molecular features of one clonotype, i.e. the unique set of antigenic determinants of the variable portion of an antibody) and 'anti-idiotypes' (antigen receptors that react with the idiotype {{as if it were a}} foreign antigen). This theory, which builds on the existing <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> hypothesis and since 1974 has been developed mainly by Niels Jerne and Geoffrey W. Hoffmann, is seen as being relevant to the understanding of the HIV pathogenesis and the search for an HIV vaccine.|$|E
25|$|The thymus and {{the bone}} marrow {{constitute}} the primary lymphoid organs involved in the production and early <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> of lymphocyte tissues.

T cells, on the other hand, travel from the bone marrow to the thymus, where they develop further. Mature T cells join B cells in search of pathogens.

Recently, methods using dependence-based measures have attracted much attention due to their ability to deal with very high dimensional datasets. However, these methods are based on Cramers V test, which has performance issues with large datasets. In this paper, we propose a parallel approach to improve their performance. We evaluate our approach on hyper-spectral and high spatial resolution images and compare it to the proposed methods with a centralized version as preliminary results.

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a {{heterogeneous}} disease, developing through a multipathway {{sequence of events}} guided by <b>clonal</b> <b>selections.</b> Pathways included {{in the development of}} CRC may be broadly categorized into (a) genomic instability, including chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI), and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), (b) genomic mutations including suppression of tumour suppressor genes and activation of tumour oncogenes, (c) microRNA, and (d) epigenetic changes. As cancer becomes more advanced, invasion and metastases are facilitated through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with additional genetic alterations. Despite ongoing identification of genetic and epigenetic markers and the understanding of alternative pathways involved in the development and progression of this disease, CRC remains the second highest cause of malignancy-related mortality in Canada.

25|$|Barbera {{can adapt}} {{to a wide range}} of {{vineyard}} soils but tends to thrive most in less fertile calcareous soils and clay loam. Sandy soils can help limit the vigor and yields. The grape rarely thrives in very alkaline or saline soils. Like many grape varieties with a long history, the Barbera vine has seen mutation and clonal variation arise with different clones of the variety found in Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and the Mezzogiorno. The different clones can be identified by the size and shape of their grape clusters with the smaller cluster clones producing the highest quality wine. In recent years, viticulturalists have been working with <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> to increase Barbera's resistance to the leafroll virus.|$|E
500|$|There is some {{contention}} over Burnet's {{publication of}} {{his version of the}} theory in the Australian Journal of Science in 1957. Some commentators argue he published in an Australian journal to fast-track his hypothesis and obtain priority for his theory over ideas that were published later that year in a paper written by David Talmage, which Burnet had read prior to its publication. In his paper Burnet cited Talmage's review, and in a later interview, Talmage said he believed that Burnet [...] "truthfully had developed the idea before he received my paper". The theory is now sometimes known as Burnet's <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> theory, which overlooks the contributions of Ehrlich, Jerne, Talmage, and the contributions of Lederberg, who conceptualised the genetics of <b>clonal</b> <b>selection.</b>|$|E

50|$|Pinot noir {{from the}} Carneros {{is known for}} its crisp acidity and tight {{structure}} and frequently exhibits spicy berry fruit. The Carneros region was one of the early pioneers of cool-climate Pinot noirs in California-long before it became a significant planting in the Russian River, Anderson Valley, Santa Rita Hills and Santa Lucia Highlands AVAs. In recent years there has been a focus by Carneros Pinot noir producers on the changing style of the region's Pinot due, in part, on emerging modern philosophies in winemaking and on <b>clonal</b> <b>selections.</b> The older clones found in Carneros include the Martini and Swan clones which produce wines that are lighter, more elegant with some earthy complexity. They are also noted for their distinctive aromas of green herbs, beets and mint.

5000|$|Force Majeure holds a 40 acre site in Washington state's Red Mountain AVA, {{about half}} of which is planted to vines. Development started in 2006, and is ongoing. Force Majeure's Red Mountain {{vineyard}} was the first hillside vineyard {{of its kind in}} Washington state, planted with gobelet-trained Syrah as found in the northern Rhône. The hillside is steep, and rises in elevation from 950 to 1230 feet, on a piece of land that includes 9 distinct soil types {{due in part to the}} Missoula Floods. The soils are diverse and well-drained, ranging from deep Warden to very rocky Kiona soils. Calcium carbonate, a chief component of limestone, is present in much of the vineyard. Varietals grown include Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Syrah, Grenache, Cinsault, Counoise and Mourvèdre.

500|$|In the mid-1950s, Frank Burnet, {{inspired}} by a suggestion made by Niels Jerne, formulated the <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> theory (CST) of immunity. On the basis of CST, Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction: [...] "self" [...] constituents (constituents of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while [...] "nonself" [...] entities (pathogens, an allograft) trigger a destructive immune response. The theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex [...] "two-signal" [...] activation of T cells. The self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized, but remain very influential.|$|E
500|$|The late 1950s to {{the early}} 1970s {{was a period of}} intense {{research}} and institutional expansion for molecular biology, which had only recently become a somewhat coherent discipline. In what organismic biologist E. O. Wilson called [...] "The Molecular Wars", the methods and practitioners of molecular biology spread rapidly, often coming to dominate departments and even entire disciplines. Molecularization was particularly important in genetics, immunology, embryology, and neurobiology, while the idea that life is controlled by a [...] "genetic program"—a metaphor Jacob and Monod introduced from the emerging fields of cybernetics and computer science—became an influential perspective throughout biology. Immunology in particular became linked with molecular biology, with innovation flowing both ways: the <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> theory developed by Niels Jerne and Frank Macfarlane Burnet in the mid-1950s helped shed light on the general mechanisms of protein synthesis.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} account for the wide range of antigens the immune system can recognize, Paul Ehrlich in 1900 had {{hypothesized}} that preexisting [...] "side chain receptors" [...] bind a given pathogen, and that this interaction induces the cell exhibiting the receptor to multiply and produce more copies of the same receptor. This theory, called the selective theory was not proven for next five decades, and had been challenged by several instructional theories which were based on the notion that an antibody would assume its effective structure by folding around the antigen. In the late 1950s however, the works of three scientists—Jerne, Talmage and Burnet (who largely modified the theory)—gave rise to the <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> theory, which proved all the elements of Ehrlich's hypothesis except that the specific receptors that could neutralize the agent were soluble and not membrane-bound.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{importance}} of the "genotype" factor on the expression of aromatic characteristics in Cabernet Sauvignon, 12 <b>clonal</b> <b>selections</b> of the variety, of which 9 were French selections (15, 188, 190, 335, 336, 337, 338, 340, 341) and 3 Italian (R 5, R 7, R 10), were examined. The vines were cultivated on a gravely soil in the "Friuli Grave" AVA zone (Friuli-Venezia Giulia). During the vegetative season, the main vine vegeto-productive parameters (number of buds, middle weight of bunch, middle weight of plant, number of grapes per plant, weight of pruned wood, Ravaz index and diameter of berry) were investigated, as was the methoxypyrazine content, which is a notorious characteristic of the variety responsible for the vegetable aromas of the wine. The analysis of the above factors clearly distinguished the behaviour of the Italian selection R 5, which had a different accumulation of sugars and acidity level in comparison with all the other clonal families. It was also confirmed that the genotype has an effect on the methoxypyrazine content at maturation...|$|R
50|$|As {{commercial}} winemakers usually want to {{work with}} a desired grape variety that dependably produces a particular crop, most grapevines are propagated by <b>clonal</b> or massal <b>selection</b> of plant material. This can be accomplished in one of three ways.|$|R
40|$|During the {{initiation}} {{and execution of}} a rootstock breeding programme to overcome the financially crippling disease, Phytophthora root rot of avocado, various constraints have been identified for both the breeding {{as well as the}} screening aspect of the programme. A review of the literature revealed a complex host-pathogen interaction that should be taken into account in the recombination and screening of genetic material. With the detection of beneficial genotypes being the crux of a breeding programme, this dissertation was focused on the screening of rootstock material for tolerance to Phytophthora cinnamomi. Screening should be scientific {{but at the same time}} also be time and cost effective. Specific attention was given to (i) the correct medium for screening mass numbers of seedlings, (ii) fast and effective cloning of single selections, and (iii) evaluation of clonal material for tolerance to P. cinnamomi. Soil as a screening medium was compared with three inert hydroponic media as well as one aeroponic system. Only soil was found to be ineffective due to its properties. The other media tested, namely, sand, vermiculite, water and the aeroponic system were equal in performance. The medium to be used will depend on the preference of the breeder as each medium has its own pro's and con's. It was, however, found that the evaluation criterion to be applied depends on the medium that is used. With regard to cloning of single selections, a definite difference with regard to the cloning ability of the different selections was found. An inability to be etiolated was displayed by some of the selections and these could thus not be vegetatively propagated and were not further tested. One of the tolerance mechanisms in the standard cultivar Duke 7, is root regeneration. It was thus expected that this characteristic cloning would give an indication of the rootstock's ability to tolerate P. cinnamomi. This could not be confirmed, but most of the selections did, however, perform better than Duke 7. Comparison of feeder root percentage in non-inoculated and inoculated treatments was not sufficient for facilitating the final selection of candidate rootstocks from a large number of potential <b>clonal</b> <b>selections.</b> Four selections were made, based on the hypothesis that a larger root system will be a better forager and thus enhance the horticultural aspects of the rootstock-scion combination. Valuable information was obtained with regard to various mediums and criteria to be used during mass screening and final screening of <b>clonal</b> <b>selections.</b> This knowledge must be taken into account in the planning of future breeding projects. During this project a total of 38 984 seedlings were screened and four selections were made. For both the nursery and the producer, knowledge of the clonal ability of a potential new rootstock is important from a financial point of view.
