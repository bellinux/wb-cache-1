2500|$|... "The Big Show was {{not just}} more grand than most radio shows---it was also more witty, {{smoothly}} produced, smart, and ambitious, with an interesting juxtaposition of guests, but it wasn't significantly different," [...] wrote radio historian Gerald Nachman in Raised on Radio. [...] "It was just a more lavish, inflated revival of radio's earliest form---the variety showcase; you <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sequins." [...] Yet Nachman admired the show, which he said was [...] "as close to a Broadway show as radio could whip together each week." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Jack Kerouac's 1955 novel, On The Road, the book's narrator Sal Paradise {{and other}} {{prominent}} character Dean Moriarty (an alias of Kerouac's friend Neal Cassady) encounter the Sabine River. [...] It is recorded as an [...] "evil old river," [...] and [...] "the mansion of the snake...we <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> slither {{of a million}} copperheads." [...] A novel in which the theme rests heavily on familiarity with the American continent, {{it is interesting that}} Kerouac labels the region as [...] "a manuscript of the night we couldn't read." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a tense silence. Beverley <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{voice of}} the referee uttering the count.|$|E
60|$|Still no sound. My {{heart beat}} {{so fast that}} I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> it. <b>The</b> night was very dark. A thin mist-like drizzle was falling; in fact the weather {{conditions}} were absolutely perfect for my purpose. With utmost wariness I allowed myself to drop from the window-ledge on to the soft ground below.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{admitted}} {{that in spite}} of this brave margin an irritation, after he had gone, remained with her; a sense that presently became one with a still sharper hatred of Mr. Buckton, who, on her friend's withdrawal, had retired with the telegrams to the sounder and left her the other work. She knew indeed she should have a chance to see them, when she would, on file; and she was divided, as the day went on, between the two impressions of all that was lost and all that was re-asserted. What beset her above all, and as she had almost never known it before, was the desire to bound straight out, to overtake the autumn afternoon before it passed away for ever and hurry off to the Park and perhaps be with him there again on a bench. It became for an hour a fantastic vision with her that he might just have gone to sit and wait for her. She <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> him, through <b>the</b> tick of the sounder, scatter with his stick, in his impatience, the fallen leaves of October. Why should such a vision seize her at this particular moment with such a shake? There was a time--from four to five--when she could have cried with happiness and rage.|$|R
6000|$|... "D'you {{want to wake}} 'em up? Is {{that your}} game?" [...] she asked, and began to fumble at her belt. Overcoming with an effort a disgust amounting to nausea, Janet {{approached}} her sister again, little by little undressing her, and finally getting her into bed, when she immediately fell into a profound slumber. Janet, too, got into bed, but sleep was impossible: the odour lurked like a foul spirit in the darkness, mingling with the stagnant, damp air that came in at the open window, fairly saturating her with horror: it seemed {{the very essence of}} degradation. But as she lay {{on the edge of the}} bed, shrinking from contamination, in the throes of excitement inspired by an unnamed fear, she grew hot, she <b>could</b> feel and <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> pounding of her heart. She rose, felt around in the clammy darkness for her wrapper and slippers, gained the door, crept through the dark hall to the dining-room, where she stealthily lit the lamp; darkness had become a terror. A cockroach scurried across the linoleum. The room was warm and close, it reeked with the smell of stale food, but at least she found relief from that other odour. She sank down on the sofa.|$|R
60|$|The artful dodger! he {{had drawn}} and {{coloured}} a beautiful little {{sketch of a}} bridge; not an engineer's plan with sections and measurements, vexatious to a woman's eye, but a graceful little bridge {{with a string of}} cars running under it. You <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> bell going.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she stood}} aside, having made a cold bow to Mme. de Pompadour; the fair Marquise was {{accompanying}} His Majesty to Versailles; {{she stepped into}} the coach beside him, surrounded by murmurs of flattery and adulation. Even Charles Edward made her a final speech of somewhat forced gallantry; he was the last to kiss her hand, and Lydie <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> softly whispered words of entreaty with which he bade her not to forget.|$|E
60|$|He {{shut his}} eyes; {{he could not}} bear to look at the {{brightness}} of the world outside the window of the car. Under his closed lids there came to him visions, sometimes of Margery and sometimes of the forests of New Mexico. Sometimes the visions were wavering, uncertain, and transitory, and again they were strong and vivid--so plain to him that he <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> leaves rustle as some wild creature turned a startled look upon him.|$|E
60|$|Another went up more quickly; {{and then}} another; they <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> it twist and roar.|$|R
6000|$|As Louisa read on, she <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> Lord Radclyffe's whispered words, whilst {{she herself}} sang Tosti's melancholy song: [...] "Good-bye!" ...|$|R
60|$|Joan shot {{a glance}} from over her cup. The poor puzzled face was staring into <b>the</b> fire. Joan <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> him saying it.|$|R
6000|$|The {{long line}} of camels moved as noiselessly as ghosts across the desert. Before and behind were the silent, swaying white figures of the Arabs. Not a sound anywhere, not the very faintest sound, until far away behind them they heard a human voice singing in a strong, droning, unmusical fashion. It had the strangest effect, this far-away voice, in that huge inarticulate wilderness. And then there came a {{well-known}} rhythm into that distant chant, and they <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> words-- ...|$|E
6000|$|He was plainly in high good humor. The {{thought of}} the {{distinguished}} company he was to entertain that night had changed him temporarily, as with some wave of a fairy wand, into a thing of joviality and benevolence. One <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> milk of human kindness gurgling and splashing within him. The irony of fate! Tonight, such was his mood, a dutiful nephew could have come and felt {{in his pockets and}} helped himself--if circumstances had been different. Oh, woman, woman, how you bar us from paradise! ...|$|E

60|$|Marguerite {{felt as if}} she <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> {{them talking}} it over and vowing that she should not escape, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel should soon be captured.|$|R
6000|$|... "Abnormal? I don't call it abnormal," [...] I began, and I was {{sensible}} of my wife's thoughts {{leaving her}} own injuries for {{my point of}} view so swiftly that I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> them whir.|$|R
60|$|The {{house was}} so still {{and the air}} was so oppressive. When she paused in her fumbling--since her fingers refused her service--she <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> that {{movement}} again behind the acacia tree outside, and that rustling among the leaves.|$|R
60|$|Never shall I {{forget the}} look of horror which came in Mme. la Marquise's eyes {{when she saw me}} {{entering}} our miserable attic {{in the company of a}} stranger. The last of the little bit of tallow candle flickered in its socket. Madame threw her emaciated arms over her child, just like some poor hunted animal defending its young. I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> cry of terror which died down in her throat ere it reached her lips. But then, monsieur, to see the light of hope gradually illuminating her pale, wan face as the stranger took her hand and spoke to her--oh! so gently and so kindly--was a sight which filled my poor, half-broken heart with joy.|$|E
60|$|The wondrous green {{transparency}} {{had almost}} gone, the dew touched the wheat, and we stood {{alone in the}} emptiness, under the hush that crept up with the dimness from the east, and through which one <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> thirsty grasses drink. I knew now that I had never loved Beatrice Haldane as a man usually loves a woman, but had offered an empty homage to an unreality. Still, the semblance had once been real enough to me, and I could not wholly hold my peace and let her go. Furthermore, both {{she and her sister}} possessed the gift of forcing one's inmost thoughts, and there was a power in the quiet voice stronger than my will.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{she looked}} at the backs of her hands which she could not see because of the {{gathering}} darkness, and as they were invisible, kissed them instead, just as though they belonged to someone else. After this she sat a while brooding and listening to the pulsing of her heart, which was beating with unusual strength this night. As she did so in that mysterious hour which sometimes comes to us in English summers, a great change fell upon her. When she sat down upon that fallen tree she was still a girl and virginal; when she rose from it she was a developed, loving woman. It was as though a spirit had visited her and whispered in her ear. She <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> words. They were: ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, {{you don't}} know. Last Tuesday he was dining there, {{and you should}} have seen the state he was in. He was so restless he couldn't sit still. He looked at his watch every minute. His eyes simply glittered with excitement, and I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> his heart beating.|$|R
6000|$|We {{had been}} moving onward for some little time, when the girl's {{companion}} addressed an observation to her. She heard it imperfectly, {{and lifted her}} veil while it was being repeated. How painfully my heart beat! I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> it--as her face was, for the first time, freely and fairly disclosed! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, Essie and Ellie were promenading {{a select}} party about <b>the</b> gardens. I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> Mackintyre gnashing his teeth at their inroads on the forced strawberries, {{and the park}} and Elmwood Spinney were dotted so thick with people, {{that we had to}} look sharp not to fall in with any one." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Grace Carrington sang, and I {{would have}} given {{years of my life}} for Harry's skill, which seemed a bond between them as she smiled gratefully upon him. The words were simple, as became the work of a master who loved the open, and the music flowed with them like the ripple of a glancing water; so a deeper silence settled upon all, and I was back in England where a {{sparkling}} beck leaped out from the furze of Lingdale and sped in flashing shallows under the yellow fern, while somewhere beyond the singer's voice I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> alders talking to the breeze. When it ceased the sound grew louder, but it was only a bitter blast that came from the icy Pole moaning about the homestead of Lone Hollow.|$|E
60|$|She {{made one}} last quest round {{the house before}} she started, and found that she had {{overlooked}} nothing. It began to mist {{as soon as she}} had skirted Vegg's Heath, where Wynn used to descend--it seemed to her that she <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> beat of his propellers overhead, but there was nothing to see. She hoisted her umbrella and lunged into the blind wet till she had reached the shelter of the empty village. As she came out of Mr. Kidd's shop with a bottle full of paraffin in her string shopping-bag, she met Nurse Eden, the village nurse, and fell into talk with her, as usual, about the village children. They were just parting opposite the 'Royal Oak,' when a gun, they fancied, was fired immediately behind the house. It was followed by a child's shriek dying into a wail.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Thornbury made {{a little}} exclamation, drew her lips together, and the tears rose in her eyes. Through them {{she looked at the}} hall which was now laid with great breadths of sunlight, and at the careless, casual groups of people who were {{standing}} beside the solid arm-chairs and tables. They looked to her unreal, or as people look who remain unconscious that some great explosion is about to take place beside them. But there was no explosion, and they went on standing by the chairs and the tables. Mrs. Thornbury no longer saw them, but, penetrating through them as though they were without substance, she saw the house, the people in the house, the room, the bed in the room, and the figure of the dead lying still in the dark beneath the sheets. She could almost see the dead. She <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> voices of the mourners.|$|E
25|$|But as fame {{of their}} unbeaten status spread, {{so did the}} status of their haka. At the {{beginning}} of their 22nd game in Wales at Llanelli, we read On the appearance of the men in red, 'Sosban Fach' was sung with great enthusiasm. Nepia then led the All Blacks in their famous war dance, which was very impressive. One <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> a pin drop while it was rendered. The crowd again sang 'Sosban Fach' in reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "I succeeded--I {{generally}} do--in securing one of {{the front}} seats among the audience, and was already comfortably installed in my place in court when through the trap door I saw {{the head of the}} prisoner emerge. She was very becomingly dressed in deep black, and, led by two policemen, she took her place in the dock. Sir James Fenwick shook hands with her very warmly, and I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> him instilling words of comfort into her.|$|R
60|$|His little piggy eyes {{travelled}} {{from her}} face to her feet, to {{the walls of the}} room, to his own watch-chain, to his hands that had begun to rub themselves together, back to her breast, higher than which they dared not mount. Their infinite embarrassment struck Gyp. She <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> him thinking: 'Now, how can I discuss it with this attractive young female, wife of the scoundrel who's ruined my daughter? Delicate-that's what it is!' Then the words burst hoarsely from him.|$|R
60|$|The {{inspector}} stepped forward--afterwards he {{said that}} it was for the purpose of stopping Sabatini. He was too late, however. The crowd thronging the end of the street, and the hundreds of people who peered from the windows, had a moment of wonderful excitement. One <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> thrill which stirred from their throats. Across the empty street, straight towards the window behind which the doomed man lay, Sabatini walked, strangest of figures amidst those sordid surroundings, in his evening clothes, thin black overcoat, and glossy silk hat. Step by step he approached the door. He was about three yards from the curbstone when the window behind which Isaac was crouching was suddenly smashed, and Isaac leaned out. The crowd, listening intently, could hear the crash of falling glass upon the pavement. They had their view of Isaac, too--a wan, ghostlike figure, with haggard cheeks and staring eyes, eyes which blazed out from between the strands of black hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to say," [...] {{he began}} in a low voice, [...] "that I had no {{intention}} of coming to this meeting. And I am going to confess--I am going to confess that I was afraid to come." [...] He raised his voice a little defiantly a the words, and paused. One <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> people breathing. [...] "I was afraid to come for fear that I should do the very thing I am going to do now. And yet I was impelled to come. I want to say that my conscience has not been clear since, {{as a member of the}} prudential committee, I gave my consent to the dismissal of Miss Wetherell. I know that I was influenced by personal and selfish considerations which should have had no weight. And after listening to Miss Penniman I take this opportunity to declare, of my own free will, that I will add my vote to that of Judge Graves to reinstate Miss Wetherell." ...|$|E
60|$|Across Soho, {{threading}} his {{way with}} devilish ingenuity through mazes of narrow streets, scattering with his hooter little groups of gibbering, swarthy foreigners, Aaron Thurnbrein, bent double over his ancient bicycle, sped on his way towards the Commercial Road and eastwards. With narrow cheeks smeared with dust, yellow teeth showing behind his parted lips, through which the muttered words came with uneven vehemence, ragged clothes, a ragged handkerchief around his neck, a greasy cap upon his head--this messenger, charged with great tidings, proclaimed himself, by his visible existence, one of the submerged clinging to his last spar, fighting still with hands which beat the air, yet carrying the undaunted light of battle in his blazing eyes, deep-sunken, almost cavernous, the last refuge, perhaps, of that ebbing life. Drops of perspiration were upon his forehead, his breath came hard and painfully. Before he had reached his destination, one <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> rattle in his throat. He even staggered as at last he dropped from his bicycle and, wheeling it across a broad pavement, left it reclining against a box of apples exposed {{in front of a}} small greengrocer's shop.|$|E
5000|$|Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe {{gave the}} song a B+ grade, saying that [...] "you can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> guy smirking as he sings this {{swinging}} hit, running down {{a list of}} jilted lovers {{from all over the}} Lone Star state." ...|$|R
60|$|Could we {{ever hope}} to {{eradicate}} it? Was not the survival of this fighting instinct proof that war was still needful to us? In the sculpture-room of an exhibition she came upon a painted statue of Bellona. Its grotesqueness shocked her at first sight, the red streaming hair, the wild eyes filled with fury, the wide open mouth--one <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> it screaming--the white uplifted arms with outstretched hands! Appalling! Terrible! And yet, as she gazed at it, gradually the thing grew curiously real to her. She seemed to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> gathering of the chariots, the neighing of the horses, the hurrying of many feet, {{the sound of an}} armouring multitude, the shouting, and the braying of the trumpets.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Such is the fact. As I was hastening to you, {{knowing full}} well the danger to which I was subject:--but what danger will I not affront at the call of such a benefactor as Mr. Warrington hath been to me?--I was seized by two villains who had a writ against me, and who have lodged me at Naboth's, hard by, and so close to your honour, that we <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> {{each other across the}} garden walls of the {{respective}} houses where we are confined.|$|R
