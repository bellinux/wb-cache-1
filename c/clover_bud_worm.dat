40|$|A {{workshop}} {{held at the}} end of {{the symposium}} reviewed the need for future research and development. There is a need to develop our under-standing of insect population dynamics, the interaction of insect populations with the host and jack pine stands, and to improve the array of tools available for direct control of populations. The emerging need to view insect population irruptions in terms of ecosystem function has changed the outlook of forest managers. The consequences of this change have to be reflected in prescriptions used in managing the jack pine resource.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} and humidity on the toxicity of propoxur to adult female German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.), was examined. With high humidity, propoxur {{was found to be}} least toxic near 25 °C. At either temperature extreme (10 or 35 °C), increased mortality indicated a quadratic relationship between temperature and mortality. Mortality also increased at low humidities. In contrast, the effect of temperature on the toxicity of propoxur to western spruce <b>bud</b> <b>worm,</b> Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman, was a simple linear relationship which increased with increasing temperature. Exposure time was also related to changes in the toxicity of propoxur to the spruce budworm in both a linear and quadratic fashion.

40|$|The {{variability}} in the developmental rates for the embryos, larvae, and pupae of the western spruce <b>bud</b> <b>worm,</b> Choristoneura occidentalis, was skewed and was well described by a gamma probability density function. At extreme temperatures, {{the shapes of the}} frequency distributions for the embryos and pupae were not unimodal, suggesting the presence of thermal biotypes. Variability increased markedly towards the temperature extremes (15 and 31 °C) and was greater for female than for male larvae. The shapes of the frequency distributions for larvae terminating diapause ranged from a skewed curve for second-instar larvae held in diapause at O 2 ̆ 7 C to a negative exponential curve for larvae held at 5 °C.

40|$|Plant {{architectural}} {{characteristics are}} under strong genetic regulation. Economically important traits for forage {{crops such as}} biomass yield, ground cover and persistence can be improved by selecting for particular aerial architectural characteristics. Here, we present an easily applicable method for the spatiotemporal description of branching patterns in red clover (Trifolium pratense) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), {{two of the most}} important forage crops in Europe. A detailed analysis of genotypes with contrasting branching phenotypes demonstrates that in these species different factors are the main determinants of shoot branching characteristics. In red <b>clover,</b> <b>bud</b> outgrowth {{and to a lesser extent}} bud formation explain inter-genotype branching differences. In perennial ryegrass, differences in the capacity to form new buds determined largely the differences between forage and turf types. However,when a set of four forage types was compared in a separate experiment, variation in quantity and pace of bud formation and bud outgrowth explained the differences in aerial architecture. In both crops, branching patterns are likely determined by several processes, and highly branched phenotypes can result from the formation of more buds, an increased probability of bud outgrowth, or a combination of these processes. Furthermore, the presence of more buds is partly caused by more bud outgrowth...|$|R
40|$|The clover seed weevils Apion fulvipes Geoffroy, 1785 and Apion trifolii L., 1768 (Coleoptera: Apionidae) cause major {{losses to}} seed {{production}} of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), respectively. Clover is important as animal forage and {{an alternative to}} inorganic fertilizers. Because clover is mainly pollinated by bees, the use of insecticides in management of these weevils is discouraged. To gain basic knowledge for development of alternative management strategies, we investigated weevil field abundance over two growing seasons, as well as feeding and olfactory host preferences by A. fulvipes and A. trifolii. Field trap catches in southern Sweden revealed that white clover was dominated by A. fulvipes and red clover by A. trifolii. For both weevil species, female catches were positively correlated {{to the number of}} <b>clover</b> <b>buds</b> and flowers in the field. In feeding and olfactory bioassays, females of A. fulvipes and A. trifolii showed a preference for T. repens and T. pratense, respectively. However, the feeding preference was lost when the antennae were removed, indicating a significant role of olfaction in host choice. Male weevils of both species did not show clear olfactory or feeding preferences for host plant species. The field study and laboratory bioassays demonstrate that, at least for female weevils, olfaction is important for selection of host plants. We discuss these novel results in the context of managing these important pests of clover by exploiting olfaction and behavioral attraction to host plant volatiles...|$|R

The flower is used for various purposes viz., making garlands, bouquets, decorating hair of women, religious offerings etc. Scientific cultivation of jasmine {{is one of the}} important prerequisites for increasing the production and productivity among the jasmine growers.  The technology adoption of jasmine cultivation by the jasmine growers has not received the attention of both the extension functionaries of State Department of Horticulture and Agriculture to the required level and hence, the present study was undertaken with the objective to study the adoption behavior of jasmine growers in Tiurnelveli District.

40|$|The {{history of}} insect control on cotton since World War II {{can be divided}} into three periods based on the types of {{insecticides}} used to control the major cotton insect pests such as the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.), the bollworm, Helicove 1 pa zea (Boddie) and the boll weevil Anthonomus grcmdis grandis Boheman. The first period was the DDT and organochlorine period, lasting from their introduction just after World War II to the mid- 1960 s when widespread resistance and environmental concems began to outweigh benefits derived from their continued use (Sparks, 1981; also see Chapter 13). The second period was that of the organophosphoms insecticides as exemplified by methyl parathion which came into prominent use as the utility of DDT and other organochlorines declined during the mid- 1960 s. Although still widely used for control of some cotton insect pests, the organophosphoms insecticide pe 1 iod of predominance declined during the late 1 970 s when the tobacco <b>bud</b> <b>worm</b> developed resistance to many of the organophosphoms insecticides then in use (Sparks, 1981; Sparks eta/., 1993 a) and the third period, that of the pyrethroid insecticides, began. Currently, pyrethroids are the predominant insecticides used for the control of the primary cotton insect pests such as the bollwonnltobacco budworm. However, because pyrethroid resistance is now present {{in many parts of the}} United States (Martinez-Carrillo and Reynolds, 1983; Nicholso...|$|R

40|$|Model organisms such as <b>budding</b> yeast, <b>worms</b> {{and flies}} have proven {{instrumental}} in the discovery of genetic determinants of aging, and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a promising new system for these studies. We devised an approach to directly select for long-lived S. pombe mutants from a random DNA insertion library. Each insertion mutation bears a unique sequence tag called a bar code that allows one to determine the proportion of an individual mutant in a culture containing thousands of different mutants. Aging these mutants in culture allowed identification of a long-lived mutant bearing an insertion mutation in the cyclin gene clg 1 (+). Clg 1 p, like Pas 1 p, physically associates with the cyclin-dependent kinase Pef 1 p. We identified a third Pef 1 p cyclin, Psl 1 p, and found that only loss of Clg 1 p or Pef 1 p extended lifespan. Genetic and co-immunoprecipitation results indicate that Pef 1 p controls lifespan through the downstream protein kinase Cek 1 p. While Pef 1 p is conserved as Pho 85 p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and as cdk 5 in humans, genome-wide searches for lifespan regulators in S. cerevisiae have never identified Pho 85 p. Thus, the S. pombe system {{can be used to}} identify novel, evolutionarily conserved lifespan extending mutations, and our results suggest a potential role for mammalian cdk 5 as a lifespan regulator...|$|R
40|$|The yeast Sir 2 protein mediates {{chromatin}} silencing {{through an}} intrinsic NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity. Sir 2 is a conserved protein and was recently shown to regulate lifespan extension both in <b>budding</b> yeast and <b>worms.</b> Here, {{we show that}} SIRT 1, the human Sir 2 homolog, is recruited to the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies of mammalian cells upon overexpression of either PML or oncogenic Ras (Ha-rasV 12). SIRT 1 binds and deacetylates p 53, a component of PML nuclear bodies, and it can repress p 53 -mediated transactivation. Moreover, we show that SIRT 1 and p 53 co-localize in nuclear bodies upon PML upregulation. When overexpressed in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), SIRT 1 antagonizes PML-induced acetylation of p 53 and rescues PML-mediated premature cellular senescence. Taken together, our data establish the SIRT 1 deacetylase as a novel negative regulator of p 53 function capable of modulating cellular senescence...|$|R
40|$|Red clover is {{a highly}} productive, protein-rich fodder crop, with more “bypass” {{proteins}} and more digestible fibres than alfalfa providing more energy dense forage to lactating dairy cows diets. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of inoculation of three red clover cultivars with two strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii, as well as the effect of cutting them in two different maturity stages on yield and chemical composition. Delaying harvest time of red <b>clover</b> from early <b>budding</b> to early flowering increased DM yield in two out of three cultivars in the sowing year, and in all three cultivars in the last year of study. An increase in relative proportion of stem in total DM yield, and a reduction in the relative proportion of leaf and flowers in all three years of research was observed. Cutting of red clover in the early budding stage resulted in 15. 4 % more crude protein content than in the early flowering, whereas differences in neutral and acid detergent fibre were not significant. Red clover cultivars showed significant variation in all traits, while inoculation had no significant effect on any trait of red clover...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene (C 2 H 4) {{biosynthesis}} {{has been}} investigated during leaf ontogeny in white clover (Triforium repens L. cv. Glassland challenge, genotype 10 F) with a particular emphasis on {{the production of the}} hormone in the apex and newly initiated leaves (designated as leaves 1 and 2). In these developing tissues, a relatively higher rate (5 to 6 -fold) of ethylene production (0. 5 to 0. 9 nL C 2 H 4 gFwt- 1 hr- 1) was associated with a higher accumulation (1. 5 -fold) of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate (ACC), when compared with mature green leaves. Genes encoding the ethylene biosynthetic enzymes, ACC synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO) have been cloned to characterise ethylene biosynthesis at the molecular level. The partial protein-coding regions of ACS genes have been cloned using reverse transcriptase-dependent polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with degenerate nested primers using cDNA templates from RNA isolated either the apex or leaf 2. These ACS genes were identified and designated as TRACS 1, TRACS 2 and TRACS 3. TRACS 1 (680 bp) is 72 % and 64 % homologous to TRACS 2 (674 bp) and TRACS 3 (704 bp), respectively, and TRACS 2 and TRACS 3 are 63 % homologous, in terms of nucleotide sequence. TRACS 1 shows highest homology with PS-ACS 2, an ACS cloned from etiolated pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings which is induced by IAA and wounding. TRACS 2 shows highest homology with MI-ACS 1, an ACS cloned from mature mango (Mangifera indica) fruit. TRACO 3 shows highest homology with VR-ACS 7, an ACS cloned from etiolated hypocotyls of mung bean (Vigna radiata) and also PS-ACS 1, an ACS cloned from etiolated pea seedlings which is induced by IAA, but not by wounding. The TRACS 3 gene was expressed as a 1. 95 kb transcript mainly in the apex and newly initiated leaves as determined by northern analysis. TRACS 1 has not been detected in the tissues examined. The expression of TRACS 2 has not been determined. Three ACO genes, comprising ca. 1100 bp of the protein-coding region and 3 '-untranslated region (3 '-UTR) have been cloned using a combination of RT-PCR and 3 '-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3 '-RACE), and designated as TRACO 1, TRACO 2 and TRACO 3. Comparison of a 813 bp protein-coding region of TRACO 1, generated by RT-PCR using degenerate primers on cDNA templates from RNA isolated from the apex shows 77 % and 75 % homology to the protein-coding region sequences of TRACO 2 (804 bp) and TRACO 3 (816 bp), respectively, generated by RT-PCR using degenerate primers on cDNA templates from RNA isolated from leaf 2. The TRACO 2 and TRACO 3 protein-coding region sequences show 84 % homology. The technique of 3 '-RACE generated 3 '-UTR sequences of 301 bp (TRACO 1), 250 bp (TRACO 2), and 92 bp (TRACO 3) each amplified using mRNA extracted from the apex. The 92 bp 3 '-UTR of TRACO 3 {{has been shown to be}} a truncated version of a 324 bp sequence amplified from TRACO 3 expressed in senescent leaf tissue of white clover (Dr. D. Hunter, IMBS, Massey University, personal communication), and it is this full-length version that was used in further experiments. The 3 '-UTR sequences of the three ACO genes are more divergent, when compared with the protein-coding regions, showing 61 %, 55 %, and 59 % homology between TRACO 1 and TRACO 2, TRACO 1 and full-length TRACO 3, and TRACO 2 and full-length TRACO 3, respectively. Using these 3 '-UTR sequences as gene-specific probes, Southern analysis revealed that the three ACO genes are encoded by distinct genes in the white clover genome. Northern analysis, using either protein-coding regions or 3 '-UTRs as probes, determined that the TRACO 1 gene was expressed as a 1. 35 kb transcript almost exclusively in the apex and the TRACO 2 gene was expressed as a 1. 35 kb transcript mainly in newly initiated leaves and mature green leaves, with maximum expression in newly initiated leaves. This pattern of gene expression coincides with the high rate of ethylene production from the apex and newly initiated leaves in white clover. The apex tissue-specific TRACO 1 gene was also detected in axillary buds, and the mature leaf-associated TRACO 2 gene was expressed in other mature vegetative tissues, including internodes, nodes and petioles. Both TRACO 1 and TRACO 2 genes are highly expressed in roots. TRACO 3 gene expression was not detected in apex and mature green leaf tissues examined using the 3 '-UTR gene-specific probe, but two transcripts (1. 17 kb and 1. 35 kb) were visualised using the protein-coding region probe and with an extended exposure time. ACO enzyme activity, in vitro, was highest in just fully expanded mature green leaves (leaf 3 and leaf 4) during leaf ontogeny in white <b>clover.</b> Apex, axillary <b>bud</b> and floral bud tissues show a relatively higher enzyme activity, when compared with mature nodes and internode tissues, but lower than that measured in petiole tissue. Highest activity of ACO, in vitro, has been detected in root extracts. Polyclonal antibodies, raised against the TRACO 1 gene product expressed in E. coli, recognised a high molecular weight (ca. 205 kD) protein complex with highest accumulation in the apex. This complex was also detected in axillary bud, floral bud, and leaf 1 tissue. Immunoaffinity-based purification of the ca. 205 kD protein was carried out to obtain sufficient protein for amino acid sequencing. However, no sequence was obtained. Polyclonal antibodies, raised against the TRACO 2 gene product in E. coil, recognised ACO protein (ca. 36 kD) in newly initiated leaves and mature green leaves as well as petioles and roots. This recognition pattern coincides with ACO enzyme activity, in vitro, as well as TRACO 2 gene expression in the tissue. Expression of the TRACO 2 and TRACO 3 genes has been characterised in response to a combination of wounding, ethylene, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), and 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) treatments using mature green leaves. Expression of TRACO 2 gene is enhanced in response to ethylene and IAA. Ethylene-induced TRACO 2 gene expression was not blocked by 1 -MCP. Expression of TRACO 3 was induced in response to wounding in mature green leaves. Wound-induced TRACO 3 gene expression was not induced by the ethylene produced in the leaf tissue, indicating ethylene-independent ACO expression in the wounded leaves. Induction of either TRACO 2 by IAA treatment or TRACO 3 by wounding was delayed with AVG treatment of mature green tissue, suggesting that changes in ACS activity in the tissue is associated with induction of ACO gene expression...|$|R
