5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K selection theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more <b>crowded,</b> it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under <b>crowded</b> conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E

50|$|Psychological aspects are {{concerned}} with the psychology of the <b>crowd</b> as a group and the psychology of those who allow their will and emotions to be informed by the <b>crowd</b> (both discussed more comprehensively under <b>crowd</b> psychology), and other individual responses to <b>crowds,</b> such as claustrophobia, agoraphobia and social anxiety. At a general level, <b>crowd</b> psychology is concerned with the behaviour and thought processes of individual <b>crowd</b> members and the <b>crowd</b> as a whole.

The <b>crowd</b> control can predict the status and position of moving objects by using <b>crowd</b> model. The <b>crowd</b> control model can design the mobile constraints and <b>crowd</b> optimization objectives based on the real-time mobile trajectory information. The model can generate the target state matrix and the target <b>crowd</b> information for the relationship mapping. The real-time continuous optimization is realized by <b>crowd</b> control with output information. The <b>crowd</b> algorithm can transform the tracking problem of moving objects to the target of the <b>crowd</b> optimization problem. This conversion is realized by using the <b>crowd</b> information of each moving target in the time domain to reset the optimization objective and the real-time optimal control conditions.|$|R

Unlike previous studies that examine specific design elements in pure <b>crowds</b> (such as project length and community functionality), this study examines a high-level <b>crowd</b> design issue: choosing between pure and hybrid <b>crowds</b> {{in the context of}} crowdfunding. Our comparisons of pure and hybrid <b>crowds</b> can shed light on the evolution of <b>crowd</b> design in crowdfunding. In addition, both crowdfunding researchers and practitioners can benefit from our list of key driving factors behind the <b>crowd</b> design. Our discussion on the management of lead investors points to ways in which agency relationships in hybrid <b>crowds</b> could be further examined and opens a new door for the application of agency theory in crowdfunding.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Crowd</b> {{behavior}} {{recognition is}} becoming an important research topic in video surveillance for public places. In this paper, we first discuss the <b>crowd</b> feature selection and extraction and propose a multiple-frame feature point detection and tracking based on the KLT tracker. We state that behavior modelling of <b>crowd</b> is usually coarse compared to that for individuals. Instead of developing general <b>crowd</b> behavior models, we propose to model <b>crowd</b> events for specific end-user scenarios. As a result, a same type of event may be modelled slightly differently from one scenario to another and several models are to be defined. Consequently, fast modelling is required and this is enabled {{by the use of}} an extended Scenario Recognition Engine (SRE) in our approach. <b>Crowd</b> event models are defined; particularly, composite events accommodating evidence accumulation allow to increase detection reliability. Tests have been conducted on real surveillance video sequences containing <b>crowd</b> scenes. The <b>crowd</b> tracking algorithm proves to be robust and gives reliable <b>crowd</b> motion vectors. The <b>crowd</b> event detection on real sequences gives reliable results of a few common <b>crowd</b> behaviors by simple dedicated models. Key words: Automatic video-based surveillance, <b>crowd</b> tracking, dedicated modelling, <b>crowd</b> behavior recognition...|$|R

5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation. These plants have <b>crowded</b> out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, <b>crowded</b> out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals.

40|$|<b>Crowd</b> {{safety is}} a major concern for those {{attending}} and managing mass gatherings such as the annual Hajj or pilgrimage to Makkah. One threat to <b>crowd</b> safety at such events is <b>crowd</b> density. However, recent research also suggests that psychological membership of <b>crowds</b> can have positive benefits. We tested the hypothesis that the effect of density on safety might vary depending on whether there is shared social identification in the <b>crowd.</b> We surveyed 1194 pilgrims at the Holy Mosque, Makkah, during the 2012 Hajj. Analysis of the data showed that the negative effect of <b>crowd</b> density on reported safety was moderated by social identification with the <b>crowd.</b> Whereas low identifiers reported reduced safety with greater <b>crowd</b> density, high identifiers reported increased safety with greater <b>crowd</b> density. Mediation analysis suggested that a reason for these moderation effects was the perception that other <b>crowd</b> members were supportive. Differences in reported safety across national groups (Arab countries and Iran compared to the rest) were also explicable in terms of <b>crowd</b> identification and perceived support. These findings support a social identity account of <b>crowd</b> behaviour and offer a novel perspective on <b>crowd</b> safety management...|$|R

30|$|Motivated by {{the several}} inefficiencies of <b>crowds</b> in {{crowdfunding}} platforms, this study documents and compares two <b>crowd</b> designs: a popular pure <b>crowd</b> design and an emerging hybrid <b>crowd</b> design. Based on our observations of industry practices and {{the roles of}} <b>crowds</b> in crowdfunding platforms, we identify several of the shortcomings of pure <b>crowds,</b> including their ineffectiveness in providing heavy-duty due diligence, distortion in {{the wisdom of the}} <b>crowds</b> due to herding, social influence, and home bias, and high management costs associated with a lack of a single voice. Thus, pure <b>crowds</b> must be operated cautiously so that these shortcomings may be remedied. Based on our analysis of crowdfunding processes and the characteristics of <b>crowd</b> and lead investors, we identify a host of factors that may determine the optimal choice of <b>crowd</b> designs and present them in a framework for choosing between pure and hybrid <b>crowds.</b> Finally, given the potential problems in managing lead investors in hybrid <b>crowds,</b> we explore the issues of lead investor selection, compensation, and disciplining mechanisms and propose possible solutions.|$|R
