5000|$|... <b>cDNA</b> <b>cloning</b> {{is a major}} {{technology}} for analysis of the expression of genomes. The full-length first-strand can be synthesized through the commercially available reverse transcriptases. Synthesis of the second-strand was once a major limitation to <b>cDNA</b> <b>cloning.</b> Two groups of methods differing by the mechanism of initiation were developed to synthesize the second-strand. In a first group of methods, initiation of second-strand synthesis takes place within the sequence of the first strand. However, the digestion of the 3' {{end of the first}} strand is required and therefore results in the loss of the sequences corresponding to the 5'end of the mRNA. In a second group of methods, initiation of second-strand synthesis takes place outside the sequence of the first strand. This group of methods does not require digestion of the 3' end of the first strand. However, the limitation of this group of method lies upon the elongation. Cloning with T7 DNA polymerase helps overcome this limitation by allowing digestion of the poly(dT) tract during the second-strand synthesis reaction. Therefore, the size of the tract synthesized with terminal transferase is not required to be within a given size range and the resulting clones contain a tract of a limited size. Moreover, due to high 3’ exonuclease activity of T7 DNA polymerase, high yield of the full-length second-strand can be obtained.|$|E

50|$|The {{absence of}} Neu5Gc in humans {{is due to}} a {{deletion}} within the human gene CMAH encoding cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase, an enzyme responsible for Neu5Gc biosynthesis.

However, the homologous human cDNA differs from these cDNAs by a 92-bp deletion in the 5' region.

It seems unlikely that the truncated human hydroxylase mRNA encodes for an active enzyme explaining why Neu5Gc is undetectable in normal human tissues.|$|E

50|$|Protein C's {{anticoagulant}} role in {{the human}} body was first noted by Seegers et al. in 1960, who gave protein C its original name, autoprothrombin II-a. Protein C was first isolated by Johan Stenflo from bovine plasma in 1976, and Stenflo determined it to be a vitamin K-dependent protein. He named it protein C because it was the third protein ("peak C") that eluted from a DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromotograph. Seegers was, at the time, searching for vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors undetected by clotting assays, which measure global clotting function. Soon after this, Seegers recognised Stenflo's discovery was identical with his own. Activated protein C was discovered later that year, and in 1977 it was first recognised that APC inactivates Factor Va. In 1980, Vehar and Davie discovered that APC also inactivates Factor VIIIa, and soon after, Protein S was recognised as a cofactor by Walker. In 1982, a family study by Griffin et al. first associated protein C deficiency with symptoms of venous thrombosis. Homozygous protein C deficiency and the consequent serious health effects were described in 1984 by several scientists. <b>cDNA</b> <b>cloning</b> of protein C was first performed in 1984 by Beckmann et al. which produced a map of the gene responsible for producing protein C in the liver.
