5000|$|A second {{captured}} NSG2 {{was brought}} to the American army by the British, improved on and issued as the SCR-578-A [...] "Gibson Girl" [...] survival radio in 1942. It was carried by United States Army Air Forces aircraft and intended for use in life rafts. It included the M-277-A <b>collapsible</b> <b>box</b> kite to raise the antenna, which was also included in some of the later SCR-578-B sets. It was similar to the kite included with the NSG2 but did not include the wings. The 17 x 17 x 36 inch frame of the M-277-A was made up of 4 aluminum rods, each rod end was attached at the ends by a hinge to 4 shorter rods, and each of these met in the middle, attached by a locking mechanism, so that the whole thing could be opened up like an umbrella. The yellow cloth was treated with water repellent and part of one section filled with kapok to add buoyancy if it fell into the water. It was designed to be simple to assemble, and could fly in winds from 7 to 40 miles per hour. It packed into a cardboard tube, on which were also printed the assembly instructions.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{there are}} <b>collapsible</b> pallet <b>boxes</b> {{from which the}} pallet walls can be laid flat on the pallet. In this way, less space is {{required}} during empty return transport.|$|R
2500|$|The Big Mac, {{along with}} many other McDonald's products, was first served in a [...] "clamshell" [...] {{styrofoam}} container that was phased out beginning in 1990 due to environmental concerns. The product is now sold in a <b>collapsible</b> cardboard <b>box.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It was {{fortunate}} to avoid being bombed during the war though a few nearby streets suffered direct hits. It set up a very popular amateur boxing club and was the venue for local tournaments {{as well as for}} training. A <b>collapsible</b> <b>boxing</b> ring was erected inside one of the main rooms for this. The club produced a few boxing champions as well such as Amateur Boxing Association middleweight J. Hockley in 1944 and lightweight A. Lewis in 1949, as well as S. Lewis, Middleweight Champion in 1949. The club's proximity to the nearby Harringay Arena may well have encouraged an interest in the sport. Lack of outdoor facilities meant that an indoor one was preferable. In the 1960s the club committee thought the original boxing ring might be stored under the stage but they found only some old Christmas decorations. Many previous artefacts and documents were destroyed by a fire.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether training with a simple <b>collapsible</b> mobile <b>box</b> trainer leads to improved performance of fundamental laparoscopic skills (FLSs) during a 6 -month interval versus validated laparoscopic box trainers and virtual-reality trainers, only accessible at a simulation training center. Methods: With institutional review board approval, 20 first- and second-year general surgery residents were ran-domized to scheduled training sessions in a surgical sim-ulation laboratory or training {{in the use of}} a portable, collapsible Train Anywhere Skill Kit (TASKit) (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Cincinnati, OH, USA) trainer. Training was geared toward the FLS set for a skill assessment examina-tion at a 6 -month interval. Results: The residents who trained with the TASKit per-formed the peg-transfer, pattern-cut exercise, Endoloop, and intracorporeal knot-tying FLS tasks statistically more efficiently during their 6 -month assessment versus their initial evaluation as compared with the group randomized to the simulation laboratory training. Conclusions: Using a simple <b>collapsible</b> mobile <b>box</b> trainer such as the TASKit can be a cost-effective method of training and preparing residents for FLS tasks consid-ering the current cost associated with virtual and high-definition surgical trainers. This mode of surgical training allows residents to practice in their own time by removing barriers associated with simulation centers...|$|R
40|$|Project CPR/ 87 / 008 {{enabled the}} Xinqing Timber Multi Processing Factory (XTMPF) to {{establish}} a blockboard production line and provide specialized consultancies in mill management, quality control and alternative wood utilization (other than blockboard). Training of technicians and staff, locally and abroad, {{in the manufacture of}} blockboard was also achieved. Since blockboard is not well known in China and the free market only became officially effective for the wood industry in Heilongjiang Province {{at the end of the}} project (November 1992), it is recommended that a marketing study for blockboard be formulated before the plant reaches full production. To assist the Xinqing Timber Multi Processing Factory in this new task, it is suggested that links with the Chinese Research Institute of the Wood Industry (CRIWI) be strengthened in order {{to establish a}} sound marketing strategy and to implement it. CRIWI could serve as a promoter of blockboard to other parts of the country, and assure the dissemination of information about the blockboard production unit at Xinqing in order to attract other investors or entrepreneurs. Since the blockboard production unit will consume only a part of the wood waste generated by the Xinqing Timber Multi Processing Factory, it is recommended that XTMPF create alternative products (other than blockboard) by developing items from ordinary timber, i. e. flooring, laminated furniture, laminated parquet, <b>collapsible</b> <b>boxes,</b> tooth picks, chopsticks, etc. Furthermore, maximizing the use of the existing wood drying kilns would enable kiln-dried wood to be sold at a higher price to local craftsmen who are always in need of dry wood for furniture making and other purposes. In conclusion, it was felt that the project had achieved its objectives. It is hoped that these achievements may enable Xinqing Timber Multi Processing Factory to obtain full industrial production of good quality blockboard in the near future...|$|R
5000|$|Features {{added in}} 2011 {{included}} original publication dates, forum topics and a blog, mostly promotional {{but also with}} authoritative [...] "Ask the Archivist" [...] posts exploring comic strip history. The [...] "Last 7" [...] feature enables the reader to see a week's worth of comics on a single page. On {{the right side of}} the home page, <b>collapsible</b> activity <b>boxes</b> show what’s happening on the site: “Most Saved Today” lists the strips DailyINK users have added to their scrapbooks. “Most Active” indicates which strips are being shared on Facebook, Twitter and StumbleUpon. “Recent Comments” shows what users are saying about the strips. The [...] "Scrapbook" [...] feature allows one to save individual favorites to a personalized scrapbook for later viewing. A tiny calendar above each strip makes it possible to read or reread all strips of the previous year.|$|R
40|$|A small, lightweight, <b>collapsible</b> glove <b>box</b> enables its user {{to perform}} small {{experiments}} and other tasks. Originally {{intended for use}} aboard a space shuttle or the International Space Station (ISS), this glove box could also be attractive for use on Earth in settings in which work space or storage space is severely limited and, possibly, {{in which it is}} desirable to minimize weight. The development of this glove box was prompted by the findings that in the original space-shuttle or ISS setting, (1) it was necessary to perform small experiments in a large general-purpose work station, so that, in effect, they occupied excessive space; and it took excessive amounts of time to set up small experiments. The design of the glove box reflects the need to minimize the space occupied by experiments and the time needed to set up experiments, plus the requirement to limit the launch weight of the box and the space needed to store the box during transport into orbit. To prepare the glove box for use, the astronaut or other user has merely to insert hands through the two fabric glove ports in the side walls of the box and move two hinges to a locking vertical position (see figure). The user could do this while seated with the glove box on the user fs lap. When stowed, the glove box is flat and has approximately the thickness of two pieces of 8 -in. (. 20 cm) polycarbonate...|$|R
5000|$|A mobile cine section {{typically}} comprised around seven 16mm {{units and}} two 35mm units. The 16mm units operated out of 15-cwt Bedford trucks, carrying two projectors, a generator and a portable screen. The 35mm units used 3-ton Bedford trucks, as {{the equipment and}} film were much bulkier and heavier; additionally, the 35mm units had to carry their own <b>collapsible</b> fireproof projection <b>box,</b> owing to the combustibility of nitrate film. The two crew - a corporal and private - endured a nomadic life, going almost daily to different venues and being [...] "in the field" [...] {{for up to a}} month at a time. During this period they not only had to make do with what they found to show their films - damaged buildings, barns and sometimes just the open air - but also depended on their location for food and billet. This sometimes meant going without and on occasions coming under fire.|$|R
