50|$|The loss in 1980 of the MV Derbyshire during Typhoon Orchid {{south of}} Japan {{with the loss}} of all crew marked a turning point for ship design. The Derbyshire was an ore-bulk-oil <b>combination</b> <b>carrier</b> built in 1976 and was only a few years old. The carrier was {{relatively}} new and at 91,655 gross register tons, she was—and remains—the largest British ship ever to have been lost at sea. The wreck was found in June 1994. The survey team deployed a remotely operated vehicle to photograph the wreck. A private report was published in 1998 which prompted the British government to reopen a formal investigation into the sinking. The British government investigation included a comprehensive survey by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution which took 135,774 pictures of the wreck during two surveys. The formal forensic investigation concluded that the ship sank because of structural failure and absolved the crew of any responsibility. Most notably, the report determined the detailed sequence of events that led to the structural failure of the vessel. A third comprehensive analysis was subsequently done by Douglas Faulkner, professor of marine architecture and ocean engineering at the University of Glasgow. His highly analytical and scientific report published in 2001 examined and linked the loss of the MV Derbyshire with what he called the emerging body of scientific evidence regarding the mechanics of freak waves. Professor Faulkner concluded that it was almost certain that Derbyshire would have encountered a wave of sufficient size to destroy her. Faulkner's conclusions have not been refuted in the more than 15 years since they were first presented (as of 2016). Indeed, subsequent analysis by others has corroborated his findings. Faulkner's finding that the Derbyshire was lost because of a rogue wave has had widespread implications on ship design. Faulkner has subsequently proposed the need for a paradigm shift in thinking for the design of ships and offshore installations to include what he calls a Survival Design approach additional to current design requirements. There is however no evidence that his recommendations have yet been adopted (as of 2016).|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of genetics and epigenetic {{changes in the}} pathogenesis of non {{alcoholic fatty liver disease}} (NAFLD) has been increasingly recognized. Adiponectin has a central role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and controlling inflammation in insulin-sensitive tissues and low adiponectin levels have been linked to NAFLD. APPL 1 and APPL 2 are adaptor proteins that interact with the intracellular region of adiponectin receptors and mediate adiponectin signaling and its effects on metabolism. The aim of our study was the evaluation of a potential association between variants at APPL 1 and APPL 2 loci and NAFLD occurrence. The impact on liver damage and hepatic steatosis severity has been also evaluated. To this aim allele frequency and genotype distribution of APPL 1 - rs 3806622 and -rs 4640525 and APPL 2 -rs 11112412 variants were evaluated in 223 subjects with clinical diagnosis of NAFLD and compared with 231 healthy subjects. The impact of APPL 1 and APPL 2 SNPs on liver damage and hepatic steatosis severity has been also evaluated. The minor-allele combination APPL 1 -C/APPL 2 -A was associated with an increased risk of NAFLD (OR =  2. 50 95 % CI 1. 45 - 4. 32; p< 0. 001) even after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides and adiponectin levels. This allele <b>combination</b> <b>carrier</b> had higher plasma alanine aminotransferase levels (Diff =  15. 08 [7. 60 - 22. 57] p =  0. 001) and an increased frequency of severe steatosis compared to the reference allele combination (OR =  3. 88; 95 % CI 1. 582 - 9. 531; p< 0. 001). In conclusion, C-APPL 1 /A-APPL 2 allele combination is associated with NAFLD occurrence, with a more severe hepatic steatosis grade and with a reduced adiponectin cytoprotective effect on liver...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an overview of the US air cargo industry since airline deregulation in 1978, including a brief overview of the historical evolution of air cargo transport in the US from the early 1900 s until the late 1970 s and a discussion about the major international factors affecting global air cargo. A deeper analysis of the US air cargo industry follows these background discussions, emphasizing the growth of all-cargo carrier traffic in the past 30 years while noting the decline of <b>combination</b> <b>carrier</b> traffic within the past decade. Furthermore, operating cost analyses for the past 20 years reveal that major improvements in labor productivity have helped all-cargo carriers and combination carriers decrease unit costs, even while the price of fuel has risen dramatically. Productivity of US air cargo carriers is explored from 1990 to 2010 through two types of metrics, single-factor productivity (SFP) and multi-factor productivity (MFP). SFP metrics measure an airline's ability to turn inputs, such as fuel, labor, and capital, into outputs, such as available ton-miles (ATMs) and revenue ton-miles (RTMs). The MFP metric presented measures how effectively an airline produces an output from multiple inputs, essentially combining the SFP metrics. Single-factor productivity results show that the US air cargo industry has made significant improvements in labor productivity and capital productivity, with minor improvements in fuel productivity. FedEx and UPS have achieved the smallest improvements over the past 20 years, while other all-cargo carriers and combination carriers realized substantial advancements in the past two decades. Multi-factor productivity results echo the SFP results. Over the past 20 years, FedEx and UPS improved MFP 18 %, combination carriers became approximately twice as productive, and the other all-cargo carriers increased MFP dramatically. However, questionable data reported by all-cargo carriers and methods used to determine only cargo-related data for combination carriers limit the accuracy of these results and caused difficulties calculating productivity throughout this thesis. by David J.

Vascular risk and inflammation, which increase with age, may contribute to white matter deterioration and proliferation of WMH. We investigated whether circulating biomarkers and genetic variants associated with elevated vascular risk and inflammation are associated with WMH volume in healthy adults (144 volunteers, 44 – 77 years of age). We examined association of WMH volume with age, sex, hypertension, circulating levels of total plasma homocysteine (tHcy), cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein), and C-reactive protein (CRP), and four polymorphisms related to vascular risk and inflammation: Apolipoprotein ε (ApoE ε 2, 3, 4), Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C 677 T, C-reactive protein (CRP) - 286 C>A>T, and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) C- 511 T. We found that larger WMH volume was associated with advanced age, hypertension, and elevated levels of homocysteine and CRP but not with low-density lipoprotein levels.

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of two candidate gene polymorphisms for insulin resistance and lipid levels in obese children and adolescents. Methods. Two markers of insulin resistance and lipid levels, Pro 12 Ala in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma 2 (PPARG) and G 276 T in adiponectin (ADIPOQ), were genotyped in 285 obese children and adolescents. As the apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms C 112 R and R 158 C are known to have a profound impact on lipid levels in both children and adults, results were adjusted for APOE genotype. Results. We found no association for PPARG or ADIPOQ polymorphisms with Body Mass Index (BMI), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol, triglycerides or Insulin Resistance estimated by Homeostasis Model of Assessment (HOMA-IR). Wild type carriers of PPARG Pro 12 Ala (p< 0. 05), homozygous carriers of the variant allele of ADIPOQ G 276 T (p< 0. 001) and epsilon 4 carriers of APOE (p< 0. 001) had higher total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol levels adjusted for age, gender, BMI and insulin sensitivity. A PPARG/ADIPOQ risk genotype combination was identified by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) comparing all existing <b>combinations.</b> <b>Carriers</b> of PPARG Pro/Pro and ADIPOQ 276 T/T had higher total (5. 0 [4. 1 - 5. 8] vs. 4. 1 [3. 6 - 4. 6]mmol/l) and LDL-cholesterol levels (3. 7 [2. 9 - 4. 5] vs. 3. 0 [2. 5 - 3. 5]mmol/l) compared with <b>carriers</b> of other <b>combinations</b> (p< 0. 001).
