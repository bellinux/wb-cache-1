40|$|Quota-share and stop-loss/excess-of-loss reinsurances are two {{important}} reinsurance strategies. An important question, both {{in theory and}} in application, is to determine optimal retentions for these reinsurances. In this thesis, we study the optimal retentions of quota-share and stop-loss/excess-of-loss reinsurances under ruin-related optimization criteria. We attempt to balance the interest for a ceding company and a reinsurance company and employ an optimization criterion that considers the interests of both a cedent and a reinsurer. We also examine the influence of interest, dividend, <b>commission,</b> <b>expense,</b> and diffusion on reinsurance retentions...|$|E

5000|$|Loss {{ratios for}} {{property}} and casualty insurance (e.g. motor car insurance), range typically from 40% to 60%. Such companies are collecting premiums more than the amount paid in claims. Conversely, insurers that consistently experience high loss ratios may be in bad financial health.

The terms [...] "permissible", [...] "target", [...] "balance point", or [...] "expected" [...] loss ratio are used interchangeably {{to refer to the}} loss ratio necessary to fulfill the insurer's profitability goal. This ratio is 1 minus the expense ratio, where the expenses consist of general and administrative <b>expenses,</b> <b>commissions</b> and advertising <b>expenses,</b> profit and contingencies, and various other expenses.

5000|$|Managed futures have {{historically}} displayed very low correlations to traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds. Following modern portfolio theory, {{this lack of}} correlation builds the robustness of the portfolio, reducing portfolio volatility and risk, without significant negative impacts on return. This lack of correlation {{stems from the fact}} that markets tend to [...] "trend" [...] the best during more volatile periods, and periods in which markets decline tend to be the most volatile. From 1980 to 2010, the compound average annual return for managed futures was 14.52%, as measured by the CASAM CISDM CTA Equal Weighted Index, while the return for U.S. stocks was 7.04% (based on the S&P 500 total return index).

These nonmembers, or [...] "hillbillies," [...] believed a better price could be obtained by refusing to join the association, and, in many instances, actually succeeded in obtaining significantly higher prices from the ATC representatives due to the shortage of tobacco.

Dickinson left his post in 1713 and was replaced by James Gibbs. Gibbs was removed in 1716 and replaced by John James. James and Hawksmoor remained in office until the commission was wound up in 1733. The declining enthusiasm of the <b>Commission,</b> and the <b>expense</b> of the buildings, meant that only twelve churches were completed, six designed by Hawksmoor, and two by James in collaboration with Hawksmoor. The two collaborations were St Luke Old Street (1727-33) and St John Horsleydown (1727-33), to which Hawksmoor's contribution seems to have been largely confined to the towers with their extraordinary steeples.|$|R
50|$|Period costs, such as office {{salaries}} {{or selling}} expenses, are immediately recognized as expenses (and offset against revenues {{of the accounting}} period) also when employees are paid in the next period.

An example is a commission earned at the moment of sale (or delivery) by a sales representative who is compensated {{at the end of the}} following week, in the next accounting period. The company recognizes the <b>commission</b> as an <b>expense</b> incurred immediately in its current income statement to match the sale proceeds (revenue), so the commission is also added to accrued expenses in the sale period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a fictitious profit, and it is deducted from accrued expenses in the next period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a fictitious loss, when the rep is compensated.|$|R

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) digunakan untuk mengetahui kontribusi dari perubahan teknis dan efisiensi terhadap pertumbuhan produktifitas pada perusahaan asuransi go public di Indonesia dengan menerapkan orientasi output dalam Malmquist index selama periode 2009 - 2012. Variabel input dan variabel output yang digunakan untuk mengukur efisiensi relatif ini berturut-turut adalah komisi dan beban manjemen, serta premi bersih dan hasil investasi. Dalam teknik DEA, efisiensi diukur dengan indeks Malmquist. Ukuran efisiensi dalam Malmquist index terbagi kepada dua komponen: yaitu indeks perubahan efisiensi ({{efficiency}} change) dan perubahan teknis (technical change). Perubahan efisiensi selanjutnya terbagi lagi ke dalam pure efficiency dan scale efficiency. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa, rata-rata, TFP pada industri asuransi tersebut sama-sama dipengaruhi baik oleh perubahan efisiensi maupun perubahan teknis, di mana pada nilai perubahan efisiensi tersebut lebih cenderung dipengaruhi oleh pure efficiency daripada scale efficiency.

MEASURING EFFICIENCY OF GO PUBLIC INSURANCE COMPANIES IN INDONESIA: DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS(DEA) APPROACHby:Faradilla 0901102010003 Supervisor:DR. Muhammad Shabri Abdul Majid, SE, M. EcABSTRACTThis study {{focuses on the}} efficiency of go public insurances industry in Indonesia. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to explore the contributions of technical and efficiency change {{to the growth of}} productivity in the Indonesia insurance industries by applying the generalized output-oriented Malmquist index for the year 2009 to 2012. The output-input data consist of a panel data of 9 general insurance firms in Indonesia that were chosen as the sample of the study. This study utilized two inputs and two outputs, namely, <b>commission</b> and management <b>expenses</b> as well as premium and net investment income, respectively. In the DEA technique, efficiency is measured by the Malmquist index. The Malmquist efficiency measures are decomposed into two components: the efficiency change and technical change index. Efficiency change is again decomposed into pure efficiency and scale efficiency. It was found that, on average, the TFP of the go public insurance companies in Indonesia was mainly due to both efficiency and technical changes where the main source of the efficiency change was pure efficiency rather than scale efficiency.
