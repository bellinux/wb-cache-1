5|$|The May-Johnson bill soon {{ran into}} difficulties. Although the Interim Committee was {{discharged}} in November, it met {{one more time}} in December to discuss amendments to the May-Johnson bill. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative Senate bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> of atomic energy. In 1946, several major revisions were made to the McMahon bill in order to appease the more conservative elements in the Senate. The resulting bill passed both the Senate and the House without major modifications. On August 1, 1946, Truman signed the McMahon bill into law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study methods from {{cognitive}} work analysis (CWA) were applied aiming to generate interface requirements for ground control stations (GCS) of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) operated in <b>civilian</b> <b>controlled</b> airspace. <b>Civilian</b> use of RPAS is a key interest of industry and concepts for integrating RPAS into <b>civilian</b> <b>controlled</b> airspace are required. The first two phases of CWA, namely work domain analysis (WDA) and control task analysis (ConTA), were conducted for an Airbus A 320 operated in <b>civilian</b> <b>controlled</b> airspace {{in order to identify}} the constraints related to the work domain and to the activity to be carried out within the work system. Since aircraft systems of manned and remotely piloted aircraft have common purposes (i. e. maneuvering the aircraft through controlled airspace), the work system of a manned aircraft was selected for exploring constraints of the work system of future civilian RPAS operators. For the WDA an abstraction-decomposition-space (ADS) was created. Its decomposition dimension was developed in accordance to the ATA 100 chapter classification of aircraft systems. For the ConTA, a contextual activity template was created. Flight phases of a flight through <b>civilian</b> <b>controlled</b> airspace where mapped onto the horizontal axis, visualizing work situations. Work functions for each sub-system that was modelled within the ADS were derived and mapped onto the vertical axis. Finally, for reasonable combinations of work situations and work functions decision ladders were developed. They were used as a structured framework for identifying crucial information operators rely on when flying and maneuvering an aircraft through <b>civilian</b> <b>controlled</b> airspace and, most importantly, for identifying what information RPAS operators lack due to their remote location. Future steps will include careful evaluation of safety critical information, which essentially has to be considered in the development of requirements for GCS interfaces for operators of future civilian RPAS...|$|R

40|$|Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that {{is associated with}} structural and functional alterations in several brain areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Here, we examine resting state functional connectivity of ACC subdivisions in PTSD, using a seed-based approach. Resting state magnetic resonance images were obtained from male veterans with (n[*]=[*] 31) and without (n[*]=[*] 25) PTSD, and healthy male <b>civilian</b> <b>controls</b> (n[*]=[*] 25). Veterans with and without PTSD (combat controls) had reduced functional connectivity compared to healthy controls between the caudal ACC and the precentral gyrus, and between the perigenual ACC and the superior medial gyrus and middle temporal gyrus. Combat controls had increased connectivity between the rostral ACC and precentral/middle frontal gyrus compared to PTSD patients and healthy <b>civilian</b> <b>controls.</b> The resting state functional connectivity differences in the perigenual ACC network reported here indicate that veterans differ from healthy controls, potentially due to military training, deployment, and/or trauma exposure. In addition, specific alterations in the combat controls may potentially be related to resilience. These results underline the importance of distinguishing trauma-exposed (combat) <b>controls</b> from healthy <b>civilian</b> <b>controls</b> when studying PTSD...|$|R
5|$|The War Department envisaged {{that the}} Manhattan Project would be {{superseded}} by a statutory authority. Legislation {{to create it}} was drafted by two War Department lawyers, Kenneth C. Royall and William L. Marbury. Their draft bill ran into strong opposition, particularly from the influential Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for <b>civilian</b> <b>control.</b> Section 10 assigned the patent for any invention related to atomic energy to the commission.|$|E

5|$|Dissension {{resulting}} from inadequate government attention to Army needs was restrained under {{the generation of}} officers who had begun their careers during the 1820s. These officers were loyal to the monarchy, believed the military should be under <b>civilian</b> <b>control,</b> and abhorred the caudillism (Hispanic-American dictatorships) against which they had fought. But by the early 1880s, this generation (including commanders such as the Duke of Caxias, the Count of Porto Alegre, and the Marquis of Erval) had died, were retired, or no longer exercised direct command.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{domestic}} {{debate over the}} permanent management of the nuclear program, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was created by the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project. It established <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic weapons from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District would remain until it too was abolished on 15 August 1947.|$|E

5|$|Legislators found {{themselves}} in an unusual and uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature of}} nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> of the military.|$|E

5|$|On , {{a senior}} army officer on active duty, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, {{prompted}} a second crisis {{when he went}} public with allegations that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament on military matters. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal). While Asquith's presentation was poor, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote of confidence. He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> of the military. Meanwhile, the German offensive stalled and was ultimately reversed. Victory came on 11 November 1918.|$|E

5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.|$|E
5|$|A small {{ministry}} of defence (which was renamed the Ministry of Defence and Security in 2007) was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's defence policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F-FDTL also limited {{the extent to which}} foreign countries are willing to provide assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 the Ministry of Defence and Security was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited {{the extent to which the}} ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> over the security forces at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.|$|E

Huntington identified two shaping forces or imperatives for <b>civilian</b> <b>control</b> – (1) functional and (2) societal. He broke the societal imperative into two components, ideology and structure. By ideology, he meant a world-view or paradigm: liberal anti-military, conservative pro-military, fascist pro-military, and Marxist anti-military. By structure, he meant the legal-constitutional framework that guided political affairs generally and civil-military affairs specifically.|$|E
