BiCMOS and Dynamic <b>CMOS</b> <b>circuits</b> are used in many new high performance VLSI ICs. Fault models for BiCMOS and Dynamic <b>CMOS</b> <b>circuits</b> are discussed first. Shorted and open transistor terminals, the most common failure modes in MOS and bipolar transistors, are simulated for BiCMOS and Dynamic CMOS logic gates. Simulations show that a faulty behavior similar to data retention faults in memory cells can occur in BiCMOS and Dynamic CMOS logic gates. We explain here why it is important to test for these faults, and present test techniques that can detect these faults.

50|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} a <b>CMOS</b> <b>circuit</b> is the duality that exists between its PMOS transistors and NMOS transistors. A <b>CMOS</b> <b>circuit</b> is created to allow a path always to exist from the output to either the power source or ground. To accomplish this, the set of all paths to the voltage source must be the complement of the set of all paths to ground. This can be easily accomplished by defining one {{in terms of the}} NOT of the other. Due to the De Morgan's laws based logic, the PMOS transistors in parallel have corresponding NMOS transistors in series while the PMOS transistors in series have corresponding NMOS transistors in parallel.|$|E

50|$|The term is {{also used}} as a verb to {{describe}} the act of short-circuiting the output of a power supply, or the malfunction of a <b>CMOS</b> <b>circuit</b> -- the PMOS half of a pair lingering in a near on-state when only its corresponding NMOS {{is supposed to be}} on (or the NMOS when the PMOS is supposed to be on) -- resulting in a near short-circuit current between supply rails.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the output}} voltage is by {{definition}} fixed around 1.25 V for typical bandgap reference circuits, the minimum operating voltage is about 1.4 V, as in a <b>CMOS</b> <b>circuit</b> at least one drain-source voltage of a FET (field effect transistor) has to be added. Therefore, recent work concentrates on finding alternative solutions, in which for example currents are summed instead of voltages, resulting in a lower theoretical limit for the operating voltage (Banba, 1999).|$|E

50|$|Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) is a {{non-volatile}} medium. It {{is used in}} microprocessors, microcontrollers, static RAM, {{and other}} digital logic circuits. Memory is read {{through the use of}} a combination of p-type and n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). In CMOS logic, a collection of n-type MOSFETs are arranged in a pull-down network between the output node and the lower-voltage power supply rail, named Vss, which often has ground potential. By asserting or de-asserting the inputs to the <b>CMOS</b> <b>circuit,</b> individual transistors along the pull-up and pull-down networks become conductive and resistive to electric current, and results in the desired path connecting from the output node to one of the voltage rails.|$|E
50|$|His {{industrial}} {{career in}} solid-state electronics began with William Shockley in 1956 and continued at Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation in Palo Alto from 1959 to 1964 until {{he became a}} professor of physics and electrical engineering at the University of Illinois for 25 years (1962-1988). Under the management of Gordon E. Moore, Victor H. Grinich and Robert N. Noyce at Fairchild, Sah directed a 64-member Fairchild Physics Department {{on the development of}} the first generation manufacturing technologies (oxidation, diffusion, epitaxy growth, and metal conductor thin film deposition) for volume production of silicon bipolar and MOS transistors and integrated circuit technology including oxide masking for impurity diffusion, stable Si MOS transistor, the <b>CMOS</b> <b>circuit,</b> origin of the low-frequency noise, the MOS transistor model used in the first circuit simulator, thin film integrated resistance and Si epitaxy process for bipolar integrated circuit production.|$|E
5000|$|A GALS circuit {{consists}} {{of a set of}} locally synchronous modules communicating with each other via asynchronous wrappers. Each synchronous subsystem ("clock domain") can run on its own independent clock (frequency). Advantages include much lower electromagnetic interference (EMI). The <b>CMOS</b> <b>circuit</b> (logic gates) requires relatively large supply current when changing state from 0 to 1. These changes are aggregated for synchronous circuit as most changes are initialised by an active clock edge. Therefore, large spikes on supply current occur at active clock edges. These spikes can cause large electromagnetic interference, and may lead to circuit malfunction. In order to limit these spikes large number of decoupling capacitors are used. Another solution is to use a GALS design style, i.e. design (locally) is synchronous (thus easer to be designed than asynchronous circuit) but globally asynchronous, i.e. there are different (e.g. phase shifted, rising and falling active edge) clock signal regimes thus supply current spikes do not aggregate at the same time. Consequently, GALS design style is often used in system-on-a-chip (SoC).|$|E

50|$|Boahen {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the pioneers of neuromorphic engineering, a field founded by Carver Mead in the 1980s. In contrast to the field of artificial intelligence, which merely takes inspiration from the brain, neuromorphic engineers seek to develop a new computing paradigm based on the brain's organizing principles. The brain employs a computing paradigm that is fundamentally different from digital computers. Instead of using digital signals for computation as well as communication, the brain uses analog signals (i.e., graded dendritic potentials) for computation and digital signals (i.e., all-or-none axonal potentials) for communication. Having explored this unique hybrid of digital and analogue techniques over the past three decades, neuromorphic engineers are now beginning to understand and exploit its advantages. Potential applications of their work include brain-machine interfaces, autonomous robots, and machine intelligence. Boahen often speaks of the promise of efficient computing as an inspiration for his work, writing “A typical room-size supercomputer weighs approximately 1,000 times more, occupies 10,000 times more space and consumes a millionfold more power than does the cantaloupe-size lump of neural tissue that makes up the brain.”With contributions in circuit design, chip architecture, and neuroscience, Boahen has brought together ideas from many disciplines to build novel computer chips that emulate the brain. Widely renowned for his engineering accomplishments, Boahen was named an IEEE fellow in 2016. Specific contributions throughout his career include the development of the current-mode subthreshold <b>CMOS</b> <b>circuit</b> design paradigm, the address-event approach to communicating spikes between neuromorphic chips, and the scalable design of multi-chip systems. Boahen’s chips are mixed-mode: they employ analog circuits for computation and digital circuits for communication.|$|E
