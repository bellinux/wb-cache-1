25|$|There was no {{plausible}} {{reason why}} Manoj Prabhakar {{had to wait}} 3 to 6 years to report match-fixing allegations.

The judge concluded that Manoj's allegation was a result of his getting back at Mohammad Azharuddin. The judge had no hesitation in rejecting the allegations made by Manoj Prabhakar.|$|E
