5|$|Dementia {{caregivers}} {{are subject}} to high rates of physical and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the <b>carer</b> being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 {{per year in the}} United States, depending on the study.|$|E
5|$|John Neville's {{upbringing}} and <b>carer</b> was {{entwined with}} that of the north of England and specifically, the marcher areas, the eastern and western borders between Scotland and England, controlled from Berwick and Carlisle respectively. His Early activity there consisted of diplomatic meetings with the Scots, at which he acted as a witness, between 1449 and 1451. He was also one of three men who were instructed, in a letter of 3 February 1449, to not attend the forthcoming parliament and remain in the north guarding the border. He was knighted by King Henry VI at Greenwich on 5 January 1453, alongside Edmund and Jasper Tudor, his brother Thomas Neville, William Herbert, Roger Lewknor, and William Catesby.|$|E
5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one of Attachment (1969), {{makes it}} quite clear that infants become attached to carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this {{does not have to}} be the mother or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore are more likely to be the primary attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any <b>carer</b> and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E

5|$|Charles Spencer Chaplin {{was born}} on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. There is no {{official}} record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London. His mother and father had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal <b>carer</b> of Hannah's illegitimate son, Sydney John Hill. At {{the time of his}} birth, Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker, had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, while Charles Sr., a butcher's son, was a popular singer. Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891. The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son – George Wheeler Dryden – fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Ramona Ramirez is {{introduced}} the Marsdens' Spanish nanny, originally a minor character that {{was intended to}} only be in the programme for only 2 episodes believing that the Mardens' would regularly replace their son's <b>carer.</b> She subsequently became a series regular and an important supporting character and friend to the main 6 characters eventually appearing in all 5 series of Cold Feet's original run and appeared in nearly every episode. Ramona was developed to be the complete opposite of the typically English Karen and David. David finds her continental personality annoying but Karen enjoys it. Ramona's role in Series 2 developed beyond just child-caring—in Episode 2, she bribes David for £30 to cook dinner for his former boss. By Series 3, she has a major storyline where she dates Pete. In Series 4, she gets caught up in Karen and David's deteriorating marriage and briefly quits to work for their neighbours, and to work part-time at a strip club. In Series 5, she dates Lee, a fitness instructor who is the catalyst of Pete and Jo's break-up when he sleeps with Jo.|$|E
5|$|Chris befriends Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell) and {{she asks}} him to father her child, to which Chris replies {{that he needs}} time to decide. Chris meets Nate Kinski and they arrange to go a picnic for their first date. Chris is shocked when Nate attacks a drunk guy for harassing Paige Smith (Olympia Valance), but Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) convinces him to give Nate a second chance. When Chris asks Nate to open up about {{his time in the}} army and Afghanistan, Nate gets {{physical}} with him. Nate promises that it will not happen again and asks Chris not to push him about opening up until he is ready. During Georgia and Kyle's joint hen and bucks night, Chris is punched by an unseen assailant and he hits his head. Kyle and Georgia find him and he is rushed to hospital, and placed in an induced coma. Josh later confesses to punching Chris. When Chris wakes up, he struggles to remember words and his right side is weakened. Chris is allowed leave from the hospital to attend Georgia and Kyle's wedding. After he is discharged from hospital, Nate becomes Chris's <b>carer.</b> Chris decides to return to work at the garage but is unable to do the work and is sent home. Chris later suffers a seizure and is admitted to hospital. He is forced to quit his job as he can no longer handle the workload due to his injuries. Josh's mother, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), offers Chris a job as a trainee manager at Lassiter's Hotel, which Nate persuades him to accept.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to explore {{existing}} knowledge about former <b>carers.</b> These are individuals who were previously unpaid <b>carers</b> but for whom caregiving has now ended. Research {{has focused on the}} phase of caregiving when <b>carers</b> are actively providing care. Thus, while there is an extensive literature about caregiving, there is limited understanding about the post-caregiving experiences of former <b>carers.</b> Electronic searches of major bibliographic databases found relatively little literature on ‘former’ <b>carers</b> but much on ‘bereaved’ <b>carers</b> who are by virtue of bereavement, also former <b>carers.</b> This review explores existing knowledge on former <b>carers</b> with the intention of increasing understanding about their experiences post-caregiving. It reviews the evidence to determine what impact caregiving has on carers’ lives in the post-caregiving period. Findings suggest that former <b>carers</b> experience high levels of psychological distress and that caregiving has a profound and long lasting impact on their lives...|$|R

40|$|Objective. The authors {{wished to}} {{determine}} how much <b>carers</b> from different settings caring for patients with dementia knew about the disorder and elicit their main concerns about the disease. Design. A survey questionnaire was administered to 136 <b>carers.</b> Setting. Two old age psychiatric services and an Alzheimer's support group in urban areas of the UK. Participants. The <b>carers</b> came from one of three categories: (1) <b>carers</b> with no prior contact with elderly mental health services (preassessment group); (2) <b>carers</b> who had been in contact with mental health care professionals (postassessment group); (3) <b>carers</b> in contact with an Alzheimer's Disease Society support group. Measures. A questionnaire on the subject of dementia. Carers' worries about the disorder were also recorded. Results. <b>Carers</b> in contact with an Alzheimer's support group were the most knowledgeable and <b>carers</b> in the preassessment group were the least knowledgeable on the subject of dementia. While <b>carers</b> in the postassessment group had a level of knowledge above that of the preassessment group, this difference failed to reach statistical significance. Conclusion. The study highlights the need for elderly mental health teams to evaluate their methods of dissemination of knowledge to <b>carers,</b> develop educational packages for <b>carers</b> and evaluate their effectiveness. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
