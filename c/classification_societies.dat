5|$|Since 1 April 2006, the International Association of <b>Classification</b> <b>Societies</b> {{has adopted}} the Common Structural Rules. The rules apply to bulkers more than 90meters {{in length and}} require that scantlings' {{calculations}} take into account items such as the effect of corrosion, the harsh conditions often found in the North Atlantic, and dynamic stresses during loading. The rules also establish margins for corrosion, from 0.5 to 0.9mm.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} forming a German <b>classification</b> <b>society</b> was to achieve transparency.

25|$|Many {{international}} <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> {{have incorporated}} the Finnish-Swedish ice class rules {{to their own}} rulebooks and offer ice class notations that are recognized by the Finnish and Swedish authorities. These ice classes are, in turn, used by nations such as Estonia and Latvia to assign traffic restrictions. Since the ice class rules have been revised and amended several times over the years, a list of equivalent ice class notations is used to assign the correct official ice class for older vessels when they visit Finnish and Swedish ports. Although mainly used in the Baltic Sea, the Finnish-Swedish ice classes and the equivalent ice class notations from <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> are sometimes used when discussing ships operating in other ice-infested seas of the world.|$|E
25|$|Open {{registries}} {{have been}} branded as flags of convenience by ITF (International Transport Workers' Federation) {{to have lower}} standards for vessel, equipment, and crew than the traditional maritime countries and often have <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> certify and inspect the vessels in their registry, instead of by their own shipping authority. This made it attractive for ship owners to change flag, whereby the ship lost the economic link and the country of registry. With this, also the link between classification society and traditional maritime country became less obvious - for instance Lloyd's with the United Kingdom and ABS with the United States. This {{made it easier to}} change class and introduced a new phenomena; class hopping. A ship owner that is dissatisfied with class can change to a different class relatively easily. This has led to more competition between classes and a relaxation of the rules. This has led to the shipping industry losing confidence in the <b>classification</b> <b>societies,</b> but also by the European Commission.|$|E

25|$|John G. Diefenbaker will be {{classified}} by Lloyd's Register of Shipping. Her ice class is Polar Class 2, {{the second highest}} ice class according to the International Association of <b>Classification</b> <b>Societies</b> (IACS) Polar class rules.

25|$|While the Finnish-Swedish ice classes can be {{assigned}} to icebreakers {{for the purpose of}} collecting fairway fees, the rules are intended primarily for merchant ships operating under icebreaker escort. Because the engine output and the level of ice-strengthening in ships designed to operate independently in ice-infested waters, especially in the presence of multi-year ice, usually exceeds the requirements of the Finnish-Swedish ice class rules, the <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> use different ice class notations, such as the IACS Polar Class, for icebreakers. The two highest Finnish-Swedish ice classes, 1A and 1A Super, are somewhat equivalent to the two lowest Polar Classes, PC 7 and PC 6, respectively.|$|E

To this end, in 1982 the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (Paris MoU) was agreed upon, establishing Port State Control, nowadays consisting of 24 European countries and Canada.

25|$|In 1970 a {{workgroup}} {{consisting of}} the Finnish Maritime Administration, Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard and the association of the Finnish shipowners began working on the new ice class rules in close co-operation with major <b>classification</b> <b>societies.</b> Shortly after the work started the Swedish Maritime Administration joined and the new regulations, published in 1971, {{became known as the}} Finnish-Swedish ice class rules. According to the new rules the requirements for a ship with ice class 1A, deadweight tonnage of 3,500 tons and engine output of 1,500hp were kept largely the same, but the requirements for ships of the lowest ice class, 1C, were increased considerably as in the past such ships had been essentially open-water vessels with a strengthened bow. The minimum requirements for the highest ice class, 1A Super, were lowered to make the ships more attractive to shipowners and the requirements for ships with deadweight tonnage below 3,500 tons were increased in all classes to steer shipowners towards bigger vessels that were deemed better for navigation in ice.|$|E

The shipbuilding contract, worth US$483 million, was signed in July 2009. Initially the ships were to be named Jazer, Yanqul, Al Kamil and Wafi, but instead they will be named Vale Liwa, Vale Sohar, Vale Shinas and Vale Saham. The steel cutting ceremony for the first two vessels was held on 8 July 2010 and they were launched on 19 March 2012. Vale Liwa entered service in August 2012, followed by Vale Sohar in September 2012, Vale Saham in January 2013, and Vale Shinas in March 2013. The ships reportedly received additional strengthening due to the Vale Beijing incident.

500|$|Regulations {{regarding}} {{hatch covers}} have evolved since the investigation following {{the loss of}} the [...] The Load Line Conference of 1966 imposed a requirement that hatch covers be able to withstand load of 1.74tons/m2 due to sea water, and a minimum scantling of 6mm for the tops of the hatch covers. The International Association of <b>Classification</b> <b>Societies</b> then increased this strength standard by creating its Unified Requirement S21 in 1998.

500|$|There {{are various}} ways {{to define the}} term bulk carrier. As of 1999, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea defines a bulk carrier as [...] "a ship {{constructed}} with a single deck, top side tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces and intended to primarily carry dry cargo in bulk; an ore carrier; or a combination carrier." [...] However, most <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> use a broader definition where a bulker is any ship that carries dry unpackaged goods. Multipurpose cargo ships can carry bulk cargo, but can also carry other cargoes and are not specifically designed for bulk carriage. The term [...] "dry bulk carrier" [...] is used to distinguish bulkers from bulk liquid carriers such as oil, chemical, or liquefied petroleum gas carriers. [...] Very small bulkers are almost indistinguishable from general cargo ships, and they are often classified based more on the ship's use than its design.|$|E
2500|$|Full load {{displacement}} and loaded displacement have almost identical definitions.

2500|$|The first Finnish {{ice class}} rules that {{included}} the fairway fees were published in 1920.

In 1923 a circular about the classification of ice-strengthened ships {{was sent to the}} largest <b>classification</b> <b>societies.</b> The ice strengthening of the hull was defined as a percentage that was added to the minimum requirements set by the <b>classification</b> <b>societies,</b> such as 45% increase in shell plating thickness.|$|E
