50|$|Central {{facial palsy}} is often {{characterized}} by either hemiparalysis or hemiparesis of the <b>contra-lateral</b> muscles in facial expression. Muscles {{on the forehead}} are left intact. Also, most patients have lost voluntary control of muscle movement in the face—however, muscles in the face involved in spontaneous emotional expression often remain intact. Central Facial palsy occurs in patients who are hemiplegic. Such patients not only have dysfunctions in the facial expression but also a difficulty in communication.

5000|$|In {{domestic}} chicks {{and other}} species of birds exhibiting USWS, one eye remained open <b>contra-lateral</b> (on the opposite side) to the [...] "awake" [...] hemisphere. The closed eye was shown to be opposite the hemisphere engaging in slow-wave sleep. Learning tasks, such as those including predator recognition, demonstrated the open eye could be preferential. This {{has also been shown}} to be the favored behavior of belugas, although inconsistencies have arisen directly relating the sleeping hemisphere and open eye. Keeping one eye open aids birds in engaging in USWS while mid-flight as well as helping them observe predators in their vicinity.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, if {{a patient}} reports {{weakness}} of hip extension (rare in itself, even {{in the case of}} hemiparesis, in which hip extension is relatively preserved) and appears to have weakness upon direct testing of hip extension, Hoover's test can also be applied. If an examiner places one hand behind the heel of the patient's weak leg and asks her or him to push against it, no movement will be felt. If the patient is asked to raise the other leg (i.e. flexion at the <b>contra-lateral</b> hip), the examiner will feel pressure on his or her hand as the patient involuntarily extends the weak hip. This can be pointed out to the patient in a non-confrontational manner, to help persuade the patient of the functional nature of the weakness. In the context of a positive Hoover's sign, functional weakness (or [...] "conversion disorder") is much more likely than malingering or factitious disorder.|$|E
50|$|Reptiles, such as {{sea turtles}} {{spend most of}} their lives in the ocean. However, their life cycle {{requires}} the females to come on shore and lay their nests on the beach. Consequently, the hatchlings emerge from the sand and have to run toward the water. Depending on their species, sea turtles are described to have either a symmetrical gait (diagonally opposite limbs are moving together) or an asymmetrical gait (<b>Contra-lateral</b> limbs move together). For example, loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings are commonly seen exhibiting symmetrical gait on sand, whereas, leatherback sea turtles employ the asymmetrical gait while on land. Notably, leatherbacks employ their front (pelvic) flippers more during forward terrestrial locomotion. Sea turtles can be seen nesting on subtropical and tropical beaches all around the world and exhibit such behavior such as arribada (Collective animal behavior). This is a phenomenon seen in Kemp's Ridley turtles which emerge all at once in one night only onto the beach to lay their nests.|$|E
5000|$|The mallard is one {{bird that}} has been used {{experimentally}} to illustrate the [...] "group edge effect". Birds positioned {{at the edge of the}} flock are most alert, scanning often for predators. These birds are more at risk than the birds in the center of the flock and are required to be on the lookout for both their own safety and the safety of the group as a whole. They have been observed spending more time in unihemispheric slow-wave sleep than the birds in the center. Since USWS allows for the one eye to be open, the cerebral hemisphere that undergoes slow-wave sleep varies depending on the position of the bird relative to the rest of the flock. If the bird's left side is facing outward, the left hemisphere will be in slow-wave sleep; if the bird's right side is facing outward, the right hemisphere will be in slow-wave sleep. This is because the eyes are <b>contra-lateral</b> to the left and right hemispheres of the cerebral cortex. The open eye of the bird is always directed towards the outside of the group, in the direction from which predators could potentially attack.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveAnti-catabolic disease modifying drugs (DMOADs) aim {{to reduce}} {{cartilage}} loss in knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Testing such drugs {{in clinical trials}} requires sufficient rates of loss in the study participants to occur, preferably at a mild disease stage where cartilage can be preserved. Here we analyze a “progression” model in mild radiographic KOA (RKOA), based on <b>contra-lateral</b> radiographic status. MethodsWe studied 837 participants (62. 4  ±  9  yrs; 30  ±  4. 9  kg/m²; 61. 8 % women) from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) with mild to moderate RKOA (Kellgren Lawrence grade [KLG] 2 – 3) and with/without Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) atlas radiographic joint space narrowing (JSN). These had quantitative measurements of subregional femorotibial cartilage thickness from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and 1 -year follow-up. They were stratified by <b>contra-lateral</b> knee status: no (KLG 0 / 1), definite (KLG 2) and moderate RKOA (KLG 3 / 4). ResultsKLG 2 knees with JSN and moderate <b>contra-lateral</b> RKOA had (P =  0. 008) greater maximum subregional cartilage loss − 220  μm [95 % confidence interval (CI) − 255, − 184  μm] than those without <b>contra-lateral</b> RKOA − 164  μm [− 187, − 140  μm]. Their rate of subregional cartilage loss was similar and not significantly different (P =  0. 61) to that in KLG 3 knees without <b>contra-lateral</b> RKOA (− 232  μm; [− 266; − 198  μm]). The effect of <b>contra-lateral</b> RKOA status was less in KLG 2 knees without JSN, and in KLG 3 knees. ConclusionKLG 2 knees with JSN and moderate <b>contra-lateral</b> RKOA, display relatively high rates of subregional femorotibial cartilage loss, despite being at a relatively mild stage of RKOA. They may therefore provide a unique opportunity for recruitment in clinical trials that explore the efficacy of anti-catabolic DMOADs on structural progression...|$|E

The data included demographic information, causes of amputation and occurrence of various levels of re-amputation. Two hundred and five subjects with diabetes underwent 316 amputations, 44 were foot amputations and 272 major amputations on the ipsilateral and <b>contra-lateral</b> sides.

Methods: Eight male subjects performed right arm (ipsilateral) and left arm (<b>contra-lateral)</b> bench press movements. The power output (and force and velocity) of the concentric phase of movement was measured {{before and during}} muscle pain induced by a standardised intramuscular injection of levo-ascorbic acid in the right pectoralis major muscle (prime mover muscle) and in the lateral head of the right triceps brachii muscle (synergist). Results: The power output of ipsi- and <b>contra-lateral</b> arm bench press movements was significantly decreased during pain of the right pectoralis major muscle, but not during pain of the right lateral triceps muscle. The velocity and force were both affected {{and contributed to the}} decrease in power output. Conclusions: Acute muscle pain of a prime mover muscle reduces ipsi- and <b>contra-lateral</b> motor performance of ballistic upper limb extension. This is not a generalised or non-specific inhibitory effect on the motor system, since pain failed to modify motor performance when applied to a synergist, non-prime mover, muscle.

Intra-operative data for one hundrad eight non-palpable testes were collected. Operative success was defined as a testis comparable in size or slightly smaller than the <b>contra-lateral</b> testis with normal consistency on the last follow-up. Results: There were seventy (65 %) viable testes at exploration, thirty one nubbins (29 %) removed and 7 (6 %) absent. In the seventy six unilateral cases, <b>contra-lateral</b> hypertrophy was found in twinty five (33 %) testes. Of which, twinty one (84 %) were associated with absent testes or finding of a nubbin rather than a viable testis.

Methods: In 112 patients, data related to 1725 peri-implant sites and 1020 <b>contra-lateral</b> dental sites were retrospectively obtained. To analyse the association between patient-, implant- and site-related factors and BoP+ probability, a logistic, three-level model was built with BoP as the binary outcome variable (+/−). Results: BoP+ probability for a peri-implant site with probing depth (PD) of 4  mm was 27 %, and the odds ratio increased by 1. 6 for each 1 -mm increment in PD (p <  0. 001). Also, BoP+ probability was higher in females compared to males (OR =  1. 61; p =  0. 048), and lower at posterior compared to anterior dental implants (OR =  0. 55; p <  0. 01). No significant difference in BoP+ probability was observed between peri-implant and <b>contra-lateral</b> dental sites when controlling for the difference in PD. Conclusions: The probability of a peri-implant site to bleed upon probing is (i) associated with PD, implant position and gender, and (ii) similar to that observed at <b>contra-lateral</b> dental sites when controlling for the effect of PD...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In daily life, we {{are exposed}} to {{different}} sound inputs simultaneously. During neural encoding in the auditory pathway, neural activities elicited by these different sounds interact with each other. In the present study, we investigated neural interactions elicited by masker and amplitude-modulated test stimulus in primary and non-primary human auditory cortex during ipsi-lateral and <b>contra-lateral</b> masking by means of magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results We observed significant decrements of auditory evoked responses and a significant inter-hemispheric difference for the N 1 m response during both ipsi- and <b>contra-lateral</b> masking. Conclusion The decrements of auditory evoked neural activities during simultaneous masking {{can be explained by}} neural interactions evoked by masker and test stimulus in peripheral and central auditory systems. The inter-hemispheric differences of N 1 m decrements during ipsi- and <b>contra-lateral</b> masking reflect a basic hemispheric specialization contributing to the processing of complex auditory stimuli such as speech signals in noisy environments. </p...|$|E

Based on the superimposition of the digitally slice-wise DICOM-segmentation of the digitally flipped (mirrored) <b>contra-lateral</b> tooth and the STL-file of the IOS, an individualized healing abutment was CAD/CAM-fabricated out of PMMA-based restoration material in a fully digital workflow and seated at the stage of reopening surgery. One single treatment step was necessary for final modulation of the supra-implant mucosa architecture in order to mimic the morphological emergence profile of the <b>contra-lateral</b> tooth within a short-span time frame of four days after insertion of the individualized healing abutment.

MethodsForty-eight subjects (31 women; 17 men; age 45 – 78 years) were drawn from 4, 796 Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) participants, in whom both knees displayed the same radiographic stage (KLG 2 or  3), one with frequent pain (most days of the month within the past 12 months) and the <b>contra-lateral</b> one without pain. Axial MR images {{were used to determine}} MCSAs of extensors, flexors and adductors at 35 % femoral length (distal to proximal) and in two adjacent 5  mm images. Maximal isometric extensor and flexor forces were used as provided from the OAI database. ResultsPainful knees showed 5. 2 % lower extensor MCSAs (P =  0. 00003; paired t-test), and 7. 8 % lower maximal extensor muscle forces (P =  0. 003) than <b>contra-lateral</b> painless knees.

40|$|Background Individuals with a {{unilateral}} severe-to-profound hearing loss, or single-sided deafness, report difficulty with listening in many everyday situations despite {{having access to}} well-preserved acoustic hearing in one ear. The standard of care for single-sided deafness available on the UK National Health Service is a <b>contra-lateral</b> routing of signals hearing aid which transfers sounds from the impaired ear to the non-impaired ear. This hearing aid {{has been found to}} improve speech understanding in noise when the signal-to-noise ratio is more favourable at the impaired ear than the non-impaired ear. However, the indiscriminate routing of signals to a single ear can have detrimental effects when interfering sounds are located {{on the side of the}} impaired ear. Recent published evidence has suggested that cochlear implantation in individuals with a single-sided deafness can restore access to the binaural cues which underpin the ability to localise sounds and segregate speech from other interfering sounds. Methods/Design The current trial was designed to assess the efficacy of cochlear implantation compared to a <b>contra-lateral</b> routing of signals hearing aid in restoring binaural hearing in adults with acquired single-sided deafness. Patients are assessed at baseline and after receiving a <b>contra-lateral</b> routing of signals hearing aid. A cochlear implant is then provided to those patients who do not receive sufficient benefit from the hearing aid. This within-subject longitudinal design reflects the expected care pathway should cochlear implantation be provided for single-sided deafness on the UK National Health Service. The primary endpoints are measures of binaural hearing at baseline, after provision of a <b>contra-lateral</b> routing of signals hearing aid, and after cochlear implantation. Binaural hearing is assessed in terms of the accuracy with which sounds are localised and speech is perceived in background noise. The trial is also designed to measure the impact of the interventions on hearing- and health-related quality of life. Discussion This multi-centre trial was designed to provide evidence for the efficacy of cochlear implantation compared to the <b>contra-lateral</b> routing of signals.

This study aimed to determine if the <b>contra-lateral</b> bone is a suitable control for the purpose of quantifying bone remodelling. CT scans of 8 pairs of ovine tibia were used to determine the likeness of left and right bones. The deviation between the outer surfaces of the bone pairs was used to quantify geometric similarity.

Methods Plans for 10 patients who met all dosimetry constraints on a prospective APBI protocol when using PBC calculations were recomputed with AAA and MC, keeping the monitor units and beam angles fixed. Similar calculations were performed for WBI plans {{on the same}} patients. Doses to target and normal tissue volumes were tested for significance using the paired Student's t-test. Results For WBI plans the average dose to target volumes when using PBC calculations was not significantly different than AAA calculations, the average PBC dose to the ipsilateral breast was 10. 5 % higher than the AAA calculations and the average MC dose to the ipsilateral breast was 11. 8 % lower than the PBC calculations. For ABPI plans {{there were no differences}} in dose to the planning target volume, ipsilateral breast, heart, ipsilateral lung, or <b>contra-lateral</b> lung. Although not significant, the maximum PBC dose to the <b>contra-lateral</b> breast was 1. 9 % higher than AAA and the PBC dose to the clinical target volume was 2. 1 % higher than AAA. When WBI technique is switched to APBI, there was significant reduction in dose to the ipsilateral breast when using PBC, a significant reduction in dose to the ipsilateral lung when using AAA, and a significant reduction in dose to the ipsilateral breast and lung and <b>contra-lateral</b> lung when using MC. Conclusions There is very good agreement between PBC, AAA and MC for all target and most normal tissues when treating with APBI and WBI and most of the differences in doses to target and normal tissues are not clinically significant.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Complete {{unilateral}} {{cleft lip}} and palate (UCLP) is a hereditary or multifactorial malformation {{that can be}} corrected successfully with a combined orthodontic, surgical and restorative treatment. Such multidisciplinary treatment takes many years and demands {{a lot of attention}} to both patients' teeth and periodontium. OBJECTIVES: This split-mouth study aimed to compare the periodontal health as well as the microbial parameters between cleft and non-cleft region. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 75 patients (52 males, 23 females) between 8 and 20 years with a complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (before (n = 30), during (n = 34) and after (n = 11) the active orthodontic treatment) volunteered for this study. Four regions were defined for the split-mouth comparison: teeth neighbouring cleft (site 1), tooth in cleft (site 2), and the corresponding <b>contra-lateral</b> teeth, respectively, in the unaffected quadrants (sites 3 and 4). At all sites the following periodontal parameters were recorded: plaque and gingivitis indices, pocket depth, attachment loss, bleeding on probing, tooth mobility (visual and Periotest), radiographic bone loss and gingival width. In addition, three pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken (around tooth in cleft, teeth facing the cleft, and <b>contra-lateral</b> teeth of the latter). RESULTS: The differences between the teeth neighbouring the cleft and the corresponding <b>contra-lateral</b> opponents were of borderline significance (P <or= 0. 05) for the plaque index, the approximal probing depths and the attachment loss (teeth facing the cleft always had slightly higher parameters). When the tooth in the cleft was compared to the <b>contra-lateral</b> tooth, differences were only found for both the approximal probing depths, attachment loss and bone loss, which were significantly higher for the tooth in the cleft. The microbial analysis did not reveal differences between the different sites, neither in the proportion of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (differences < 0. 5 log), nor in the detection frequency of periopathogens. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the periodontium in UCLP patients can cope well with a long-term orthodontic treatment, even in unfavourable conditions (like absence of attached gingiva and poor oral hygiene). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Visual and {{auditory}} systems use two sensory organs {{to monitor the}} external sensory signals. In olfactory systems, odors are inhaled through the nostrils into two segregated nasal passages and processed by two, right and left olfactory pathways. Anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) of the adult rat olfactory cortex receives excitatory axonal inputs from ipsi-lateral olfactory bulb and also receives inputs from <b>contra-lateral</b> olfactory cortex via the anterior commissure (AC), suggesting that it receives converging inputs from ipsi-lateral and <b>contra-lateral</b> olfactory epithelia. To study the functional interactions between right and left olfactory pathways, I recorded extracellular single unit activity of AON neurons and examined their responses to ipsi-nasal and contra-nasal stimulation with 10 odorant categories. I found 1) that about 60 % neurons in the AON received converging excitatory inputs from both olfactory epithelia, 2) that these binasal neurons were preferentially located in the deep part of the layerⅡ in the AON, and 3) that binasal neurons in the AON respond to ipsi-nasal and contra-nasal inputs with nearly-equivalent odorant category selectivity. Furthermore, deprivation of ipsi-nasal inputs by unilateral nostril obstruction greatly enhanced the response to <b>contra-lateral</b> odor stimulation, in a reversible manner, in about 33 % of AON neurons within only several minutes. In 27 % of AON neurons that showed spike responses induced by the inspiration of room air, ipsi-lateral nasal obstruction initially suppressed respiration phase-locked spike discharges and, several minutes later, induced respiration phase-locked discharges with longer delays between inspiration and response. Recordings from AON neurons in rats with AC transection indicated that the resumed respiration phase-locked discharges with longer delays were mediated by the <b>contra-lateral</b> pathway via the AC. The ipsi-nasal occlusion-induced switching of nasal inputs to individual AON neurons shows that a subset of AON neurons in the adult rat has neuronal mechanisms for rapid nostril dominance plasticity, which may enable both right and left olfactory cortices to preserve their responsiveness to the external odor world, despite reciprocal changes in nasal airflow報告番号: 甲 24894; 学位授与年月日: 2009 - 03 - 23; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(医学); 学位記番号: 博医第 3314 号; 研究科・専攻: 医学系研究科外科学専...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: A {{method is}} {{presented}} to radiobiologically compare sequential (SEQ) and simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) breast radiotherapy. Methods: The method is based on identically prescribed biologically effective dose (iso-BED) which was achieved by different prescribed doses due to different fractionation schemes. It is performed by converting the calculated three-dimensional dose distribution to the corresponding BED distribution taking into consideration the different number of fractions for generic α/β ratios. A cumulative BED volume histogram (BEDVH) is then derived from the BED distribution and is compared for the two delivery schemes. Ten breast cancer patients (4 right-sided and 6 left-sided) were investigated. Two tangential intensity modulated whole breast beams with two other oblique (with different gantry angles) beams for the boost volume were used. The boost and the breast target volumes with either α/β[*]=[*] 10 or 3  Gy, and ipsi-lateral and <b>contra-lateral</b> lungs, heart, and <b>contra-lateral</b> breast as organs at risk (OARs) with α/β[*]=[*] 3  Gy were compared. Results: Based on the BEDVH comparisons, the use of SIB reduced the biological breast mean dose by about 3 %, the ipsi-lateral lung and heart by about 10 %, and <b>contra-lateral</b> breast and lung by about 7 %. Conclusion: BED based comparisons should always be used in comparing plans that have different fraction sizes. SIB schemes are dosimetrically more advantageous than SEQ in breast target volume and OARs for equal prescribed BEDs for breast and boost...|$|E
