60|$|Duchenne {{states that}} the {{pyramidal}} muscle of the nose is less {{under the control of}} the will than are the other muscles round the eyes. He remarks that the young man who could so well act on his grief-muscles, as well as on most of his other facial muscles, could not contract the pyramidals.[5] This power, however, no doubt differs in different persons. The pyramidal muscle serves to draw down the skin of the forehead between the eyebrows, together with their inner extremities. The central fasciae of the frontal are the antagonists of the pyramidal; and if the action of the latter is to be specially checked, these central fasciae must be contracted. So that with persons having powerful pyramidal muscles, if there is under the influence of a bright light an unconscious desire to prevent the lowering of the eyebrows, the central fasciae of the frontal muscle must be brought into play; and their contraction, if sufficiently strong to overmaster the pyramidals, together with the contraction of the <b>corrugator</b> and orbicular muscles, will act in the manner just described on the eyebrows and forehead.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{the mouth}} of this lady began, involuntarily and unconsciously on her part, to assume the proper form for a crying-fit, we may feel almost sure that some nerve-influence would have been {{transmitted}} through the long accustomed channels to the various respiratory muscles, {{as well as to}} those round the eyes, and to the vaso-motor centre which governs the supply of blood sent to the lacrymal glands. Of this latter fact we have indeed clear evidence in her eyes becoming slightly suffused with tears; and we can understand this, as the lacrymal glands are less {{under the control of the}} will than the facial muscles. No doubt there existed at the same time some tendency in the muscles round the eyes at contract, as if for the sake of protecting them from being gorged with blood, but this contraction was completely overmastered, and her brow remained unruffled. Had the pyramidal, <b>corrugator,</b> and orbicular muscles been as little obedient to the will, as they are in many persons, they would have been slightly acted on; and then the central fasciae of the frontal muscle would have contracted in antagonism, and her eyebrows would have become oblique, with rectangular furrows on her forehead. Her countenance would then have expressed still more plainly than it did a state of dejection, or rather one of grief.|$|E
60|$|The firm {{closing of}} the eyelids and {{consequent}} compression of the eyeball,--and this is a most important element in various expressions,--serves to protect the eyes from becoming too much gorged with blood, as will presently be explained in detail. With respect to {{the order in which}} the several muscles contract in firmly compressing the eyes, I am indebted to Dr. Langstaff, of Southampton, for some observations, which I have since repeated. The best plan for observing the order is to make a person first raise his eyebrows, and this produces transverse wrinkles across the forehead; and then very gradually to contract all the muscles round the elves with as much force as possible. The reader who is unacquainted with the anatomy of the face, ought to refer to p. 24, and look at the woodcuts 1 to 3. The corrugators of the brow (<b>corrugator</b> supercilii) seem to be the first muscles to contract; and these draw the eyebrows downwards and inwards towards the base of the nose, causing vertical furrows, that is a frown, to appear between the eyebrows; {{at the same time they}} cause the disappearance of the transverse wrinkles across the forehead. The orbicular muscles contract almost simultaneously with the corrugators, and produce wrinkles all round the eyes; they appear, however, to be enabled to contract with greater force, as soon as the contraction of the corrugators has given them some support. Lastly, the pyramidal muscles of the nose contract; and these draw the eyebrows and the skin of the forehead still lower down, producing short transverse wrinkles across the base of the nose.[2] For the sake of brevity these muscles will generally be spoken of as the orbiculars, or as those surrounding the eyes.|$|E

60|$|Here then, as I cannot doubt, we {{have the}} key to the problem why the central fasciae of the frontal muscle and the muscles round the eyes {{contract}} in opposition to each other under the influence of grief;--whether their contraction be prolonged, as with the melancholic insane, or momentary, from some trifling cause of distress. We have all of us, as infants, repeatedly contracted our orbicular, <b>corrugator,</b> and pyramidal muscles, in order to protect our eyes whilst screaming; our progenitors before us have done the same during many generations; and though with advancing years we easily prevent, when feeling distressed, the utterance of screams, we cannot from long habit always prevent a slight contraction of the above-named muscles; nor indeed do we observe their contraction in ourselves, or attempt to stop it, if slight. But the pyramidal muscles seem to be less under the command of the will than the other related muscles; and if they be well developed, their contraction can be checked only by the antagonistic contraction of the central fasciae of the frontal muscle. The result which necessarily follows, if these fasciae contract energetically, is the oblique drawing up of the eyebrows, the puckering of their inner ends, and the formation of rectangular furrows on the middle of the forehead. As children and women cry much more freely than men, and as grown-up persons of both sexes rarely weep except from mental distress, we can understand why the grief-muscles are more frequently seen in action, as I believe to be the case, with children and women than with men; and with adults of both sexes from mental distress alone. In some of the cases before recorded, as in that of the poor Dhangar woman and of the Hindustani man, the action of the grief-muscles was quickly followed by bitter weeping. In all cases of distress, whether great or small, our brains tend through long habit to send an order to certain muscles to contract, as if we were still infants on the point of screaming out; but this order we, by the wondrous power of the will, and through habit, are able partially to counteract; although this is effected unconsciously, as far as the means of counteraction are concerned.|$|E
60|$|When {{children}} scream or cry out, they contract, as we know, the orbicular, <b>corrugator,</b> and pyramidal muscles, {{primarily for}} the sake of compressing their eyes, and thus protecting them from being gorged with blood, and secondarily through habit. I therefore expected to find with children, that when they endeavoured either to prevent a crying-fit from coming on, or to stop crying, they would cheek the contraction of the above-named muscles, {{in the same manner as}} when looking upwards at a bright light; and consequently that the central fasciae of the frontal muscle would often be brought into play. Accordingly, I began myself to observe children at such times, and asked others, including some medical men, to do the same. It is necessary to observe carefully, as the peculiar opposed action of these muscles is not nearly so plain in children, owing to their foreheads not easily wrinkling, as in adults. But I soon found that the grief-muscles were very frequently brought into distinct action on these occasions. It would be superfluous to give all the cases which have been observed; and I will specify only a few. A little girl, a year and a half old, was teased by some other children, and before bursting into tears her eyebrows became decidedly oblique. With an older girl the same obliquity was observed, with the inner ends of the eyebrows plainly puckered; and at the same time the corners of the mouth were drawn downwards. As soon as she burst into tears, the features all changed and this peculiar expression vanished. Again, after a little boy had been vaccinated, which made him scream and cry violently, the surgeon gave him an orange brought for the purpose, and this pleased the child much; as he stopped crying all the characteristic movements were observed, including the formation of rectangular wrinkles in the middle of the forehead. Lastly, I met on the road a little girl three or four years old, who had been frightened by a dog, and when I asked her what was the matter, she stopped whimpering, and her eyebrows instantly became oblique to an extraordinary degree.|$|E
60|$|On {{the cause}} of the {{obliquity}} of the eyebrows under suffering.-- During several years no expression seemed to me so utterly perplexing as this which we are here considering. Why should grief or anxiety cause the central fasciae alone of the frontal muscle together with those round the eyes, to contract? Here we seem to have a complex movement {{for the sole purpose of}} expressing grief; and yet it is a comparatively rare expression, and often overlooked. I believe the explanation is not so difficult as it at first appears. Dr. Duchenne gives a photograph of the young man before referred to, who, when looking upwards at a strongly illuminated surface, involuntarily contracted his grief-muscles in an exaggerated manner. I had entirely forgotten this photograph, when on a very bright day with the sun behind me, I met, whilst on horseback, a girl whose eyebrows, as she looked up at me, became extremely oblique, with the proper furrows on her forehead. I have observed the same movement under similar circumstances on several subsequent occasions. On my return home I made three of my children, without giving them any clue to my object, look as long and as attentively as they could, at the summit of a tall tree standing against an extremely bright sky. With all three, the orbicular, <b>corrugator,</b> and pyramidal muscles were energetically contracted, through reflex action, from the excitement of the retina, so that their eyes might be protected from the bright light. But they tried their utmost to look upwards; and now a curious struggle, with spasmodic twitchings, could be observed between the whole or only the central portion of the frontal muscle, and the several muscles which serve to lower the eyebrows and close the eyelids. The involuntary contraction of the pyramidal caused the basal part of their noses to be transversely and deeply wrinkled. In one of the three children, the whole eyebrows were momentarily raised and lowered by the alternate contraction of the whole frontal muscle and of the muscles surrounding the eyes, so that the whole breadth of the forehead was alternately wrinkled and smoothed. In the other two children the forehead became wrinkled in the middle part alone, rectangular furrows being thus produced; and the eyebrows were rendered oblique, with their inner extremities puckered and swollen,-- in the one child in a slight degree, in the other in a strongly marked manner. This difference in the obliquity of the eyebrows apparently depended on a difference in their general mobility, and in the strength of the pyramidal muscles. In both these cases the eyebrows and forehead were acted on under the influence of a strong light, in precisely the same manner, in every characteristic detail, as under the influence of grief or anxiety.|$|E

40|$|Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a {{degenerative}} {{neurological disorder}} {{of the central}} nervous system with a strong impact on both social and emotional level. Parkinson patients typically present with emotional processing impairment in emotional experience and emotion recognition. However, it is not yet known whether these patients have lost the capability to feel the emotions intrinsically, to modulate to emotional experience associating subjective response with physiological modulations, or to decipher emotions in others. The present research aims at investigating the contribution of central, peripheral and facial feedback measures in PD patients when they processed emotional cues using a multilevel approach, comparting selfreport (appraisal), autonomic (Skin Conductance Response, SCR) and motor electromyographic (EMG zygomaticus and <b>corrugators</b> facial muscles) measures. The integration of these measures allowed firstly a direct comparison between the explicit appraisal of emotions (with specific reference to the two parameters of valence and arousal) and the autonomic responsiveness to emotions. Secondly the role of EMG (zygomaticus and <b>corrugators</b> muscle) in determining the central and peripheral modulation was explored. Indeed the facial feedback model supposed that the autonomic facial response by facial muscles may affect both the emotional appraisal and the physiological modulation. 20 patients have been selected and 34 healthy volunteers (HC), matched for age and education. PD patients observed and evaluated affective pictures that were chosen from International Affective Picture System (IAPS). These pictures concerned four types of stimuli: 10 pleasant – low and high arousal; 10 unpleasant – low and high arousal, 5 neutral. PD patients seemed to not adequately answer to the emotional categories which were considered salient in standard conditions (HC). Indeed, there was an autonomic impairment for a category- specific emotion (negative and high arousal). Particularly, patients have revealed an inadequate sensibility (reduced SCR) only for negative emotional condition. In parallel EMG behavior was disrupted (reduced <b>corrugators</b> activity) in response to negative high arousal emotional cues. However, PD patients were able to correctly categorize the emotional cues based on their valence/arousal, probably due to a “gap” between this central process and the autonomic system activity. Then, the regression analysis pointed out the predictive role of the <b>corrugators</b> activity to explain the impaired autonomic response: a reduced <b>corrugators</b> mimic was linked to a reduced peripheral responsiveness toward the negative and high arousal emotional stimuli...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} research, we {{manipulated}} the perceived superior/inferior status during a competitive cognitive task. In two experiments, we created an explicit and strongly reinforced social hierarchy based on incidental rating on an attentional task. Based on our hypotheses, social rank may influence nonverbal cues (such as facial mimic related to emotional response), cortical lateralized activity in frontal areas (brain oscillations), and cognitive outcomes {{in response to}} rank modulation. Thus, the facial mimic (<b>corrugators</b> vs. zygomatic muscle activity), frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta), and real cognitive performance [(error rate (ER); response times (RTs) ] were considered. Specifically, a peer-group comparison was enrolled and an improved (experiment 1, N = 29) or decreased (experiment 2, N = 31) performance was artificially manipulated by the experimenter. Results showed a significant improved cognitive performance (decreased ER and RTs), an increased zygomatic activity (positive emotions), and a more prefrontal left-lateralized cortical response {{in the case of}} a perceived increased social ranking. On the contrary, a significant decreased cognitive performance (increased ER and RTs), an increased <b>corrugators</b> activity (negative emotions), and a less left-lateralized cortical response were observed as a consequence of a perceived decreased social ranking. Moreover, the correlational values revealed a consistent trend between behavioral (RTs) and EMG and EEG measures for both experiments. The present results suggest that social status not only guides social behavior, but it also influences cognitive processes and subjects’ performance...|$|R

6000|$|Obliquity of the eyebrows.--Two points {{alone in}} the above {{description}} require further elucidation, and these are very curious ones; namely, the raising of the inner ends of the eyebrows, and the drawing down of {{the corners of the}} mouth. With respect to the eyebrows, they may occasionally be seen to assume an oblique position in persons suffering from deep dejection or anxiety; for instance, I have observed this movement in a mother whilst speaking about her sick son; and it is sometimes excited by quite trifling or momentary causes of real or pretended distress. The eyebrows assume this position owing to the contraction of certain muscles (namely, the orbiculars, <b>corrugators,</b> and pyramidals of the nose, which together tend to lower and contract the eyebrows) being partially checked by the more powerful action of the central fascim of the frontal muscle. These latter fasciae by their contraction raise the inner ends alone of the eyebrows; and as the <b>corrugators</b> at the same time draw the eyebrows together, their inner ends become puckered into a fold or lump. This fold is a highly characteristic point in the appearance of the eyebrows when rendered oblique, as may be seen in figs. 2 and 5, Plate II. The eyebrows are at the same time somewhat roughened, owing to the hairs being made to project. Dr. J. Crichton Browne has also often noticed in melancholic patients who keep their eyebrows persistently oblique, [...] "a peculiar acute arching of the upper eyelid." [...] A trace of this may be observed by comparing the right and left eyelids of the young man in the photograph (fig. 2, Plate II.); for {{he was not able to}} act equally on both eyebrows. This is also shown by the unequal furrows on the two sides of his forehead. The acute arching of the eyelids ...|$|R

40|$|Problem creases of {{the face}} such as frontal lines and frown lines, crow's feet, deep nasolabial and {{perioral}} folds, and cervical bands {{may be caused by}} the aging process, excessive exposure to the sun, disease, or genetic disposition.
