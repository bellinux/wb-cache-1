5|$|In August 2013 Whitepages {{purchased}} all {{the interests}} in the company owned by investors for $80 million. In 2015, WhitePages acquired San Francisco-based NumberCorp to improve the database of phone numbers used for scams in the <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> app. In April 2016, Whitepages spun-off its <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> business into a separate company called Hiya {{with a staff of}} 40 in Seattle. In September 2016, Alex Algard stepped down as CEO of WhitePages, in order to focus on the mobile spam-blocking spin-off Hiya. He appointed Rob Eleveld as the new WhitePages CEO.|$|E
5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points {{to the construction of}} a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{we propose}} a {{methodology}} to develop OD matrices using mobile phone Call Detail Records (CDR) and limited traffic counts. CDR, which consist of time stamped tower locations with <b>caller</b> <b>IDs,</b> are analyzed first and trips occurring within certain time windows {{are used to}} generate tower-to-tower transient OD matrices for different time periods. These are then associated with corresponding nodes of the traffic network and converted to node-to-node transient OD matrices. The actual OD matrices are derived by scaling up these node-to-node transient OD matrices. An optimization based approach, {{in conjunction with a}} microscopic traffic simulation platform, is used to determine the scaling factors that result best matches with the observed traffic counts. The methodology is demonstrated using CDR from 2. 87 million users of Dhaka, Bangladesh over a month and traffic counts from 13 key locations over 3 days of that month. The applicability of the methodology is supported by a validation study...|$|R
5000|$|The Mojave phone booth's number, 760-733-9969, was {{acquired}} from the CLEC by phone phreak Lucky225 on July 31, 2013 and now rings using voice over IP. Originally, callers joined a conference where strangers could once again connect {{just like when}} the phone booth was active. At some point before May 27, 2015, it was reconfigured to play the audio book of [...] "Exploding the Phone" [...] by Phil Lapsley {{if there were no}} other people in a given conference. Now the booth plays music if there are no other people in the conference. All the music is telephone related. The number does not accept calls from numbers whose <b>caller</b> <b>IDs</b> are blocked or otherwise unobtainable. At some point before March 31, 2017, it was reconfigured to play a playlist of songs related to phone calls if there were no other people in a given conference. As well, an SMS is sent to the caller after joining, reading [...] "The end draws near..." [...] followed by a sequence of characters.|$|R
30|$|The {{empirical}} {{evaluation of}} this work is based on mobile phone and epidemiological data. We analysed an anonymised set of mobile phone data collected by Orange Côte d’Ivoire. It consists of billing information of about 8 million mobile phone users (i.e., 35 % of the country population), collected between February and October 2014 in Ivory Coast, {{for a total of}} about 4.5 billion records. Mobile phone operators continuously collect such data for billing purposes and to improve the operation of their cellular networks. Every time a person uses a phone, makes a call, sends an SMS or goes online, a Call Data Record is generated. The record contains the <b>caller</b> and callee <b>IDs,</b> timestamp, duration and type of communication, as well as an identifier of the cellular tower that handled the call. The approximate spatio-temporal trajectory of a mobile phone and its user can be reconstructed by linking the CDRs associated with that phone with the geographic location of the cellular towers that handled the calls.|$|R
25|$|The use by {{marketers}} {{of customer}} {{information has been}} criticized. In the United States, there has been widespread community anger against telemarketers {{which led to the}} United States National Do Not Call Registry (2003). Similar issues have been raised in other countries leading to setting up of Do not call lists, such as Canada's National Do Not Call List (2004), and Australia's Do Not Call Register (2006). Some people also object to the display of <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> on the called party's phone, especially if this finishes being used for commercial purposes by the recipient or sold on to a third party. Some people turn off the <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> feature on their phone.|$|E
25|$|Weigman {{learned to}} phreak phones and phone networks; {{consequently}} {{he was able}} to shut off one’s phone service, dig up unlisted numbers, and listen in on conversations. Weigman also extensively employed the use of <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> spoofing by purchasing commercial services such as spoof cards.|$|E
25|$|Emerson began {{manufacturing}} and selling television and video products bearing the Emerson and G Clef trademark to U.S. retailers in 1999.

40|$|It is now {{possible}} to record and collect {{a large amount of}} phone calls in a city. Each phone call record usually contains the <b>caller</b> and callee <b>IDs,</b> date and time, and the base station where the phone calls are made. As mobile phones are widely used in our daily life, many human behaviors can be revealed by analyzing mobile phone data. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive visual analysis system which can be used to analyze the population's mobility pattern from millions of phone call records. Our system consists of three major components: 1) visual analysis of user groups in a base station; 2) visual analysis of the mobility pattern of different user groups making phone calls in certain base stations; 3) visual analysis of handoff phone call records. Some well established visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates and pixel-based representations have been integrated into our system. We also develop some novel visualization schemes such as Voronoi-diagram-based visual encoding to reveal the unique features of mobile phone data. We have applied our system to real mobile phone data collected in a large city and some interesting findings regarding people's mobility pattern have been obtained. Keywords: Visual analysis, mobility pattern, mobile phone...|$|R
25|$|A scammer {{contacts}} {{consumers with}} a bogus claim to collect an outstanding payday loan {{for thousands of}} dollars. When the consumer objects, the scammer retaliates by flooding the victim's employer with thousands of automated calls. In some cases, displayed <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> is spoofed to impersonate police or law enforcement agencies.|$|E

25|$|On {{the day the}} {{licensing}} agreement with Otake expired, Emerson replaced the company with Daewoo Electronics Co. Ltd., which entered into a four-year agreement with Emerson to manufacture and sell television and video products bearing the Emerson and G Clef trademark to U.S. retailers. In 1999, Emerson also signed five-year license and supply agreements with Cargil International covering the Caribbean and Central and South American markets, along with WW Mexicana for certain consumer products to be sold in Mexico. They also had a licensing agreement with Telesound Electronics for telephones, answering machines, and <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> products in the United States and Canada.|$|E
500|$|As of 2013 Whitepages {{provides}} {{its data}} and related services through seven web properties, ten mobile apps and [...] through multiple web properties, including 411.com and Switchboard.com. The Hiya app (previously known as WhitePages <b>Caller</b> <b>ID)</b> checks incoming calls against {{a database of}} phone numbers known for spam or scam calls and helps users report scams to the Federal Trade Commission. Hiya mobile app replaces the Android user interface for making and receiving phone calls.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Whitepages said {{it would}} start working on options for users to control their {{information}} on the site. That same year, it acquired VoIP developer Snapvine in order to add features where users could be called through the website without giving out their phone number. It also introduced an api, [...] which gave third-party developers access to Whitepages' data. Whitepages released an iOS app that August, followed by the Whitepages <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> app for Android devices [...] in February 2009 and for Blackberry that May.|$|E
500|$|Whitepages {{released}} the Localicious app in July 2011. The app {{was released on}} Android first, because Whitepages was frustrated with Apple's approval process for iPhone apps. Whitepages PRO was also introduced that same year. An updated Android app called [...] Current <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> was released in August 2012. Within a year of its release, 5 billion calls and texts had been transmitted using the app. It was updated in July 2013 with new features, {{such as the ability}} to customize the layout of caller information for each caller and the ability to [...] "Like" [...] Facebook posts from within the app. In June 2013, Whitepages acquired Mr. Number, an Android app for blocking unwanted callers.|$|E
500|$|Harper visits Michael in jail. When Michael {{notices the}} <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> of an {{incoming}} call matching Kessel's hotel room pseudonym, he realizes Harper {{is part of}} the conspiracy and attempts to strangle her. Later, Michael is visited by himself from the [...] "green reality" [...] who leads him to the jail door. Past the door, Michael first witnesses Kessel's murder and Detective Vega, in a penguin suit, shows Harper's heel breaking in the process hinting that this can be used as hard evidence to place Harper at Kessel's murder. Next Michael briefly meets his wife, Hannah (Laura Allen) in a restaurant before he finds his [...] "green reality" [...] self sleeping in his bedroom.

500|$|Windows Mobile 5 {{comes with}} Microsoft Office Mobile which {{includes}} PowerPoint Mobile, Excel Mobile with graphing capability and Word Mobile {{with the ability}} to insert tables and graphics. Media management and playback was enhanced with Picture and Video package, which converged the management of videos and pictures and Windows Media Player 10 Mobile. Among new hardware features were enhanced Bluetooth support, default QWERTY keyboard-support and a management interface for [...] Global Positioning System (GPS). Improvements were made to [...] ActiveSync 4.2 with 15% increased synchronization speed. Business customers benefited from a new error reporting facility similar to that present in desktop and server Windows systems. <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> now supports photos so a user can apply an image to each contact to show when a call is received. DirectShow was also natively added. This release was the first to include DirectDraw with hardware acceleration, replacing the deprecated graphics component of GAPI.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Kheradpir formed small {{teams that}} were each {{responsible}} for {{coming up with}} and developing new products. Kheradpir implemented a 30-day prototype cycle to rapidly test and modify new technologies in development. His team of approximately 10,000 staff often worked late hours, but positions at Verizon were in high demand, because of the department's rapid pace. According to InfoWorld, he led technology development for strategic initiatives such as FiOS(fiber to the home), process and systems transformation, and many new customer-facing products." [...] In 2003 his team created iobi, which manages address books, <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> and other features across devices over the internet. The Verizon One, a combination phone, router, modem and smart portable device, was developed from his department the following year. His division also reengineered many of Verizon's core network systems, including call center, website, automated customer service systems, and integrated formerly separate systems from predecessor companies GTE, Bell Atlantic and NYNEX.|$|E
2500|$|This {{allowed him}} to hide the {{identity}} of the phone number he was using, and also to choose any number he wished to display on the <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> {{on the receiving end of}} the call.|$|E
2500|$|Cellphone {{owners have}} {{encountered}} similar problems, {{forcing them to}} hide their <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> or switch their numbers altogether.

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 14, Weigman {{had already}} gained a {{considerable}} amount of skill and knowledge about phone hacking via party lines but had not yet used these skills to do anything illegal. However, when a girl refused phone sex with him during a party line session, Weigman initiated a call to 911 with a forged <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> pretending to be a gunman holding her and her father at gunpoint. Weigman was not indicted for his crime, marking the beginning of a [...] "life long obsession" [...] for Weigman who performed as many as 60 other forged SWAT calls prior to his indictment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, an {{emergency}} service can identify the telephone number that a call has been placed from. This is normally done using the system that the telephone company uses to bill calls, making the number visible even for users who have unlisted numbers or who block <b>caller</b> <b>ID.</b> For an individual fixed landline telephone, the caller's number can often be associated with the caller's address and therefore their location. However, with mobile phones and business telephones, the address may be a mailing address rather than the caller's location. The latest [...] "enhanced" [...] systems, such as Enhanced 911, are able to provide the address the cell phone tower a mobile telephone is bouncing off of. This is often specifically mandated in a country's legislation.|$|E
50|$|An orange box is a {{piece of}} {{hardware}} or software that generates <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> frequency-shift keying (FSK) signals to spoof <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> information on the target's <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> terminal. It takes advantage of call waiting <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> (also called off-hook <b>caller</b> <b>ID)</b> by mimicking the phone company's central office equipment and sending the call waiting tone followed by the audible <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> data. An orange box {{can also be used to}} spoof <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> information sent after an incoming call rings, if the user has direct access to the target's phone line. One proposal to accomplish this involves an orange box used in conjunction with a magenta box, which in combination is called a vermilion box.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, telemarketers are {{required}} to transmit <b>caller</b> <b>ID.</b> [...] This requirement went into effect on January 29, 2004. Courts have ruled that <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> is admissible. [...] Providers {{are required}} by FCC rules to offer [...] "per-call" [...] blocking of <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> to their customers. Legislation in the United States in [...] would make it illegal to [...] "spoof" [...] <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> for fraudulent purposes. See <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> spoofing.|$|E
5000|$|Support for <b>Caller</b> <b>ID,</b> if needed. [...] "Type-1 caller ID" [...] {{as used in}} North America {{is missing}} from the vast {{majority}} of modems. Nearly all modem chipsets support <b>caller</b> <b>ID,</b> but because the typical dial-up Internet user doesn't need <b>caller</b> <b>ID,</b> the extra components needed to support <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> are often omitted for cost reasons.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> {{information}} {{is sent to}} the called party by the telephone switch as an analogue data stream (similar to data passed between two modems), using Bell 202 modulation {{between the first and second}} rings, while the telephone unit is still on hook. If the telephone call is answered too quickly after the first ring, <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> information will not be transmitted to the recipient. There are two types of <b>caller</b> <b>ID,</b> number only and name+number. Number-only <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> is called Single Data Message Format (SDMF), which provides the caller's telephone number, the date and time of the call. Name+number <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> is called Multiple Data Message Format (MDMF), which in addition to the information provided by SDMF format, can also provide the directory listed name for the particular number. <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> readers which are compatible with MDMF can also read the simpler SDMF format, but an SDMF <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> reader will not recognize an MDMF data stream, and will act as if there is no <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> information present, e.g. as if the line is not equipped for <b>caller</b> <b>ID.</b>|$|E
50|$|When a {{cell phone}} {{receives}} a call made to an office number, the <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> display would normally show the office as the caller, since the call is routed though the PBX. When the client software {{on the cell phone}} can pre-empt the built-in phone software (depends on the handset and client software vendor) this <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> is suppressed and the mobility controller passes the correct calling number and name to the client software on the handset using the cellular data channel. Alternatively, depending on the PBX and carrier, the system may be able to insert the <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> of the person calling into the regular <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> notification (<b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> spoofing). This will show the 'correct' <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> even on the built-in handset interface.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> {{spoofing}} is {{the practice}} of causing the telephone network to display a number on the recipient's <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> display that is not that of the actual originating station. Many telephone services, such as ISDN PRI based PBX installations, and voice over IP services, permit the caller to configure customized <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> information. In corporate settings this permits the announcement of switchboard number or customer service numbers. <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> spoofing may be illegal in some countries or situations.|$|E
50|$|An {{element of}} dynamic content can be {{introduced}} to the recording so that it responds to the <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> in an intelligent way e.g. it could simply read out the <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> of the caller, it could specifically advise what location the call is coming from, based on the <b>caller</b> <b>ID,</b> or it could check the <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> against a customer database and therefore advise the agent which customer is calling in and what their account number is.|$|E

50|$|Different {{countries}} {{often use}} different standards for transmitting <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> information. As a result, phones purchased {{in one country}} may not be compatible with the local <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> standard when the phone is used in a different country. For example, the US uses Bellcore FSK, whereas Taiwan uses ETSI FSK, so a phone purchased in the US will not understand Taiwan's <b>caller</b> <b>ID</b> standard. There are even cases where individual state/provinces will use different protocols within a country. <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> converters {{can be used to}} translate from one standard to another.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> is spoofed {{through a}} variety of methods and {{different}} technology. The most popular ways of spoofing <b>Caller</b> <b>ID</b> are through the use of VoIP or PRI lines.|$|E
