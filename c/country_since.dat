5|$|As Jennings {{was also}} {{achieving}} success in country {{music in the}} early 1970s, the pair were combined into a genre called outlaw <b>country,</b> <b>since</b> it did not conform to Nashville standards.

5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Gulf of Oman, the cyclone briefly re-intensified slightly, possibly {{due to the}} warm waters. However, increasing wind shear and entrainment of dry air from the Arabian Peninsula continued to remove deep convection from its eastern semicircle. On June 6, the cyclone turned to the north-northwest, and later that day the JTWC downgraded Gonu to tropical storm status. The IMD followed suit by downgrading Gonu to severe cyclonic storm status and later to cyclonic storm status early on June 7. Gonu crossed the Makran coast in Iran six hours later and the IMD stopped issuing advisories on the cyclone. This made it the first tropical cyclone on record to hit the <b>country</b> <b>since</b> 1898. After landfall, Gonu persisted as a remnant low over Iran through June 8.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all species}} in the genus Myrmecia are found in Australia and its coastal islands. M. apicalis is the only species not native to Australia, and is only found in the Isle of Pines, New Caledonia. Only one ant has ever {{established}} nests outside its native range; M. brevinoda was first discovered in New Zealand in 1940, and the ant was recorded in Devonport in 1948, 1965 and 1981, where a single nest was destroyed. Sources suggest the ant was introduced to New Zealand through human activity; they were found inside a wooden crate brought from Australia. While no eradication attempt {{was made by the}} New Zealand government, the ant has not been found in the <b>country</b> <b>since</b> 1981 and is presumed to have been eradicated.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Erica (RSMC Nadi designation: 10F, JTWC designation: 23P) of March 2003 was a {{powerful}} cyclone that severely affected New Caledonia and was considered the worst to affect the <b>country</b> <b>since</b> Cyclone Beti. The system was the eighth cyclone and the fifth severe tropical cyclone of the 2002-03 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone Erica developed from a monsoonal trough on 4 March just off of Queensland. Originally, the storm moved slowly towards the east and then north early in its existence. However, increasing wind shear caused the storm to be degenerated into a tropical low. After conditions once again became more favorable for development, the remnants regenerated into a tropical cyclone on 10 March. Steadily intensifying, Erica reached peak intensity on 13 March as a Category 5 equivalent on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E
