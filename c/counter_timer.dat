40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{relationship}} of flexibility, strength and anthropometric measurements of the lower limbs to the skating speed of hockey players. Seventeen university varsity hockey players were assessed for: leg and grip strengths using cable-tension methods; lower limb flexibility using Leighton?s flexometer and technique; anthropometry of the legs; and skating speed under standing and flying start conditions with and without a stick over two distances, 40 feet and 25 metres. Time was recorded using photoelectric cells and a Universal <b>Counter</b> <b>Timer</b> Model 604 A. The strength, flexibility, and anthropometric measures were the independent variables and the skating speeds were the dependent variables. Using a significance level of. 05 the data were analyzed using the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient and Stepwise Multiple Regression statistical methods. The resulting r*s indicated that 1) flexibility was specific to each Joint measured, 2) there was a general strength factor and a general skating body type, 3) two of the skating speed tests encompassed many factors of the other six, 4) flexibility was related to a little degree to strength and anthropometry, 5) strength and anthropometry were related, and 6) flexibility and anthropometry were not related to skating speed. The regression analyses accounted for all of the variance in each dependent variable but the variables entered were different in order and in contributory weight in each analysis. Skating speed was indicated as being specific to the distance and conditions under which it was performed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Packet {{sampling}} {{can greatly}} reduce traffic measurement overhead in high-speed broadband networks. At the same time, this operation introduces estimation errors {{that have to}} be carefully handled to ensure a reasonable measurement accuracy. Recently, a frequency-based approach has been proposed to catch the impact of such errors in bitrate estimation of a generic IP traffic flow, binned at both small and high time-scales. In particular, a closed-form expression for the signal-to-noise ratio has been derived {{as a function of the}} packet sampling probability, the bin size, and some basic information about the flow (i. e., first and second order moments of the packet size, and long term average packet-rate). In this work, we adopt such a model to design a real-time algorithm, that sets the IPFIX <b>counter</b> export <b>timers</b> in order to grant, to each flow, a target estimation accuracy.

30|$|The ARF {{scheme in}} [20] determines the {{required}} packet transmission rate {{based on the}} success of transmission attempts. Two counters are utilized to trace the consecutively received correct and missed ACK frames, respectively, which are adopted to reflect the corresponding channel conditions. If the successive ACK frames that are correctly received have reached the number of ten, the packet transmission rate for next transmission attempt will be upgraded to a higher-level rate. On the other hand, as the number of consecutively missed ACK frames reaches two, the packet transmission rate will fallback to a lower-level rate. The advantage of adopting the ARF algorithm is its simple computation which only involves the design of several <b>counters</b> and <b>timers</b> within the MAC layer protocol. However, without the consideration of PHY layer information (e.g., the channel SNR values), the adaptation scheme within the ARF protocol is in general insensitive to the channel variations. As the degree of channel variation is raised, considerable delayed performance will be incurred by exploiting the ARF algorithm.|$|R
