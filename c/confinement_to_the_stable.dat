40|$|We {{construct}} the Hermitian Schrödinger Hamiltonian of spin-less {{as well as}} the gauge-covariant Pauli Hamiltonian of spin one-half particles in a magnetic field that are confined to cylindrical and spherical surfaces. The approach does not require the use of involved differential-geometrical methods and is intuitive and physical, relying on the general requirements of Hermicity and gauge-covariance. The surfaces are embedded in the full three-dimensional space and <b>confinement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surfaces is achieved by strong radial potentials. We identify the Hermitian and gauge-covariant (in the presence of a magnetic field) physical radial momentum in each case and set it <b>to</b> zero upon <b>confinement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surfaces. The resulting surface Hamiltonians are seen to be automatically Hermitian and gauge-covariant. The well-known geometrical kinetic energy also emerges naturally. Comment: 8 pages, no figure...|$|R

40|$|In order <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> {{relationship}} between anxiety and reinforcing effects of alcohol, drug-naive male Wistar rats weighing 250 - 300 g {{were classified as}} "anxious" and "non-anxious" in the elevated plus-maze test. A conditioned place preference test was then used <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> reinforcing effects of ethanol (EtOH) on these animals. On 2 alternate days, groups of "anxious", "non-anxious" and "normal" rats received intraperitoneal (ip) injections of EtOH (0. 5, 1. 0 or 1. 5 g/kg) immediately before a 15 -min <b>confinement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> white compartment.

On day 5, a 15 -min free-choice test was carried out with no injections. Rats classified as "anxious" showed a significant, though not dose-dependent preference for all doses of ethanol compared to saline-treated animals. These data demonstrate that rats regarded as "anxious" are more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reinforcing effects of EtOH than "non-anxious" and "normal" Wistar rats and emphasize {{the relevance of the}} basal levels of anxiety of rats when trying <b>to</b> detect <b>the</b> reinforcing effects of EtOH...|$|R
