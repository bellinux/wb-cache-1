5|$|After the {{practice}} of lynching was suppressed in <b>central</b> <b>Texas,</b> it received little attention from local historians. However, Waco developed a reputation for racism—propagated in part by American history textbooks—to the vexation of the city's white residents. In the years following the lynching, African Americans often held Waco in disdain, and some viewed the 1953 Waco tornado outbreak as divine retribution. White leaders of Waco took a non-violent approach in response to demonstrations during the Civil Rights Movement, possibly owing to a desire to avoid stigmatizing the city again.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to expand and stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, <b>Central</b> <b>Texas,</b> the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E
5|$|Most of Tender Mercies {{was filmed}} in Waxahachie and Palmer, two towns in Ellis County in north <b>central</b> <b>Texas.</b> Beresford largely avoided the Victorian {{architecture}} and other picturesque elements of Waxahachie and instead focused on relatively barren locations more characteristic of West Texas. The town {{portrayed in the}} film is never identified by name. Foote said when he wrote the script {{he did not have}} the same isolated and lonely vision for the setting Beresford did, but he felt the atmosphere the director captured served the story well.|$|E

5|$|Bernstein {{states that}} Washington's lynching {{was a unique}} event because it {{occurred}} {{in a city with}} a reputation for progressiveness, but was attended by thousands of people who were excited by the brutal torture. Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller towns with fewer spectators. William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of <b>central</b> <b>Texas</b> had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington's lynching, maintaining that this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated. Hale posits that Washington's death signaled a transition in the practice of lynching, demonstrating its acceptance in modernized, 20th-century cities. She notes that Washington's lynching illustrates how technological innovations, such as telephones and inexpensive photographs, could empower lynch mobs but also increase society's condemnation of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Cave and archeological remains {{indicate}} that {{the range of the}} marsh rice rat has extended substantially further north and west earlier in the Holocene, into <b>central</b> <b>Texas,</b> eastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, central Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, West Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania. Most northern archeological sites date from about 1000CE and are associated with corn cultivation, but in some older cave sites the rice rat is found with the extinct giant armadillo Dasypus bellus, suggesting warm climatic conditions. Perhaps a warm period during the Quaternary enabled the rice rat to disperse northward and when the climate cooled, relict populations were able to survive in the north as commensals in corn-cultivating Native American communities. Some subfossil animals are slightly larger than living marsh rice rats, possibly because environmental constraints were relaxed in commensal populations.|$|E

5|$|Claudette wobbled to the {{northwest}} over the Gulf of Mexico and gradually restrengthened. Upper-level winds steadily decreased, and Claudette again became a hurricane late on July 14. Just prior to landfall, it strengthened quickly and picked up its forward motion in a more westerly direction, striking Port O'Connor, Texas, on July 15 as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 90mph (150km/h) winds. Residents along and inland of the <b>central</b> <b>Texas</b> coast were caught off guard both by its intensity and its time of arrival. The hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of July 15, but instead came ashore before noon. Furthermore, some initial estimates suggested that Claudette had reached Category2 status, with sustained winds of up to 100mph (155km/h); these were based on unofficial observations which were not backed up by official data.|$|E
5|$|Hooper {{produced}} the film {{for less than}} $300,000 (about $ adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from <b>central</b> <b>Texas,</b> where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, {{so that he could}} finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor. Louis Perano of Bryanston Pictures eventually purchased the distribution rights. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, a {{low-level}} low-pressure area developed west of Wichita Falls {{at the intersection}} of a dry line extended southward across <b>Central</b> <b>Texas</b> and the stationary front extended eastward across the Red River valley. With the low-pressure system now in place, the air mass over the Red River valley became increasingly unstable, featuring surface temperatures near 90°F (32°C) and high dew points caused by the northerly surge of moisture induced by the subtropical jet. The combination of high temperatures and a moist atmosphere resulted in a favorable environment for thunderstorm development. However, despite the heat, temperatures alone were insufficient in breaking the capping inversionan area of warmer air aloft that prevents the relativity cooler air near the surface from rising. Instead, the approaching shortwave trough provided the impetus necessary to force convection to occur, allowing for the formation of showers and thunderstorms.|$|E

5|$|The East Pacific's Tropical Depression Eleven-E {{moved across}} Mexico and {{degenerated}} into a remnant low on September4. The mid-level circulation {{associated with the}} remnant storm entered the southern Bay of Campeche and formed a new tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September5. Steered north to north-northwest, the newly formed cyclone quickly strengthened as deep convection fired over its center; it intensified into Tropical Storm Hermine by 06:00UTC on September6 and attained peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) by 02:00UTC the following day as it made landfall near Matamoros, Mexico. Despite being well inland, Hermine continued to maintain an inner core and only slowly weakened. It fell to tropical depression status over <b>central</b> <b>Texas</b> by 00:00UTC on September8 and ultimately dissipated over southeastern Kansas by 06:00UTC on September10.|$|E
5|$|The species' usual {{habitats}} include drylands, coastal sage scrub, {{and desert}} ecosystems. It also grows in lawns and fields. The {{range of the}} fungus is restricted to southwestern and western North America, where it fruits throughout the year, typically during or following cold, wet weather. Zeller gives a range that includes as its eastern border <b>central</b> <b>Texas,</b> and extends westward to San Diego County, California, and north to Josephine County, Oregon. The mushroom used to be common in the San Francisco Bay area before land development reduced its preferred habitats. A.deserticola has been collected in several states in northwestern Mexico, including Sonora, Chihuahua, and Baja California.|$|E
5|$|Chorioactis geaster has a disjunct distribution, and {{has only}} been {{collected}} from Texas and Japan. The first reported collection in Japan was in Kyushu in 1937, {{and then it was}} not collected again in that location until thirty-six years later. In 2006, it was observed in a humid forest near Kawakami, Nara Prefecture. The fungus's natural habitat in Japan is disappearing because of the practice of deforestation and replanting with Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). This rare mushroom has been put on the list of threatened species in Japan. In Texas, the fungus has been reported in Collin, Hays, Travis, Dallas, Denton, Guadalupe, Tarrant and Hunt counties. Travis, Hays, and Guadalupe counties are in <b>central</b> <b>Texas,</b> while the remainder are clustered together in the northeastern part of the state. Although the species is considered rare due to its globally restricted distribution, it may be locally abundant.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Nora was {{the final}} of five {{tropical}} cyclones to make landfall in the 2003 Pacific hurricane season. The fourteenth named storm and fifth hurricane of the season, Nora developed on October1 from a tropical wave. It slowly intensified as it moved northwestward, intensifying into a hurricane on October4. That day, Nora rapidly intensified to its peak of 100mph (160km/h), but the larger Hurricane Olaf to its east prevented further strengthening. An approaching trough turned the rapidly weakening system to the east toward Mexico. By October7, it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Although it no longer met the criteria for being a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center continued issuing advisories due to the cyclone's proximity with land. Nora unexpectedly redeveloped an area of thunderstorms and moved ashore near Mazatlán, Sinaloa on October9 before dissipating. The depression dropped locally heavy rainfall in western Mexico, {{but there were no}} reports of damage. Later, the remnants combined with Olaf and an upper-level low to produce flooding and a tornado in <b>central</b> <b>Texas.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1840s and early 1850s, the {{communities}} of Selma, Sutherland Springs, Boerne, La Vernia, and Bulverde were established along the creek. Later on, Cibolo Schertz, and Universal City were founded. These settlements dealt with torrential floods that cost many their homes and lives in later years. The destruction was prominently witnessed during the October 1998 <b>Central</b> <b>Texas</b> floods, and four years later during the flood of July 2002. The San Antonio River Authority authorized $114,599 to help clean debris from the creek in 2003, hoping to improve water quality. Above-average levels of bacteria {{have been found in}} certain areas of the creek, leading to such initiatives as the Upper Cibolo Watershed Protection plan, which began in 2010. Another plan to create a Cibolo Reservoir near Stockdale aimed to control flooding and provide fresh water met fierce opposition from local citizens concerned about the destruction of historic sites along the creek, and the loss of taxable land.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats, {{especially}} in temperate areas, prey on insects. The diet of an insectivorous bat may span {{a wide range}} of species, including flies, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, bees, wasps, mayflies and caddisflies. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) fly hundreds of meters above the ground in <b>central</b> <b>Texas</b> to feed on migrating moths. Species that hunt insects in flight, like the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), may catch an insect in mid-air with its mouth, and eat it in the air or use their tail membranes or wings to scoop up the insect and carry it to the mouth. The bat may also take the insect back to its roost and eat it there. Slower moving bat species such as the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and many horseshoe bat species, may take or glean insects from vegatation or hunt them from perches. Insectivorous bats living at high latitudes have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bats.|$|E
