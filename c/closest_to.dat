Though described by contemporaries as fearfully {{devoted to the}} Queen, {{to the point that}} she did not have a mind of her own, she actively campaigned for women's rights, a field the Queen abhorred. Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the Queen, and Helena remained close to her mother's side until the latter's death. Her name was the last to be written in the Queen's seventy-year-old journal.|$|E

At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it is <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E

5|$|Voronoi or Dirichlet tilings are tessellations {{where each}} tile {{is defined as}} the set of points <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> one of the points in a {{discrete}} set of defining points. (Think of geographical regions where each region is defined as all the points <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> a given city or post office.) The Voronoi cell for each defining point is a convex polygon. The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation that is the dual graph of a Voronoi tessellation. Delaunay triangulations are useful in numerical simulation, in part because among all possible triangulations of the defining points, Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum of the angles formed by the edges. Voronoi tilings with randomly placed points can be used to construct random tilings of the plane.|$|E
