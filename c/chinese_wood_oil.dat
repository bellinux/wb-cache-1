At the temperature of 65 degrees C, methanol/oil molar ratio of 6 : 1 and KOH load of 1. 2 wt% of oil, the optimum residence time was found to be 19 min. A type of ion-exchange resin was used to fill in the fixed-bed reactor and used as the esterification catalyst for pretreating on the high-acidified oil. For the fresh catalyst, the acid value of trap grease could be reduced from 114 mg KOH/g to about 2 mg KOH/g after 13 h at temperature 75 degrees C, catalyst load of 15 wt% of oil, methanol addition of 20 wt% of oil. The lifetime test for the catalyst indicated that its life is over 30 days. The quality of biodiesel derived from three feedstock oils is compared with newly published China BD 100 standard of GB/T 20828 - 2007.

The sensory evaluations were conducted by seven male perfumerists using the SD method and {{they were asked to}} describe freely their impressions of the scents. These results showed that: (1) all three types of <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> had a significant effect on making D. pteronyssinus inactive at 0.1 % concentration; and (2) the <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> of T. dolabrata evoked refreshing, natural, rich, and intellectual feelings; C. obtusa oil evoked vivacious, rich, and intellectual feelings; and C. taiwanensis evoked refreshing, natural, rich, rough, masculine feelings.

The participants were six male university students aged between 21 and 22  years, and the experiment was conducted in an artificial climate chamber with the temperature set at 25  °C and humidity at 60 %. The strength of perceptibility of the stimulus was adjusted from “easily sensed” to “slightly sensed” on average, and the stimulation was administered for a duration of 30  min. After olfactory stimulation by the Taiwan cypress <b>wood</b> <b>oil,</b> the systolic blood pressure of the participants decreased by 6 %, which is considered a meaningful reduction (for comparison, {{the difference between the}} high-normal blood pressure of 130  mmHg and normal blood pressure of 120  mmHg is 8.3 %).

In contrast, in tests using eugenol, a component of the clove oil used in dental disinfectants and rated as “uncomfortable” to smell, olfactory stimulation resulted in an increase in pulse rate of 6 %.
