5|$|Vanadinite {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral in the oxidized zone of lead-bearing deposits, the vanadium is leached from wall-rock silicates. Associated minerals include mimetite, pyromorphite, descloizite, mottramite, wulfenite, <b>cerussite,</b> anglesite, calcite, barite, and various iron oxide minerals.|$|E
5|$|The main lead-bearing mineral is galena (PbS), {{which is}} mostly found with zinc ores. Most other lead {{minerals}} {{are related to}} galena in some way; boulangerite, Pb5Sb4S11, is a mixed sulfide derived from galena; anglesite, PbSO4, {{is a product of}} galena oxidation; and <b>cerussite</b> or white lead ore, PbCO3, is a decomposition product of galena. Arsenic, tin, antimony, silver, gold, copper, and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is usually}} {{found in nature}} {{combined}} with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally {{in the form of}} sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or <b>cerussite</b> (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process. Lead melts at 327°C, lead oxide at 888°C and silver melts at 960°C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960°C to 1000°C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as litharge, which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings.|$|E
25|$|The {{deposits}} include diverse secondary minerals such as arsenopyrite, anglesite, baryte, bournonite, <b>cerussite,</b> chalcopyrite, freibergite, galena, mimetite, pyrite, pyromorphite, quartz, semseyite, sphalerite, stannite, tetrahedrite and wulfenite.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of historic mining activity on the north bank of Beckstones Gill, below the east face and also near Woodend. Small amounts of lead and zinc were raised between 1532 and 1891, the principal ores being blende, <b>cerussite</b> and galena.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of historic mining activity on the eastern slopes, particularly below Seat How. Four mines operated in this area:- Ladstock, Rachel Wood, Thornthwaite and Beckstones. Most were abandoned in the 1870s but Thornthwaite and Rachel Wood operated until December 1920. The main yields were lead and zinc ores, in particular galena, blende, <b>cerussite</b> and gossan.|$|E
25|$|Much {{less common}} than colorless zircon is colorless scheelite. Its {{dispersion}} (0.026) is also {{high enough to}} mimic diamond, but although it is highly lustrous its hardness is much too low (4.5–5.5) to maintain a good polish. It is also anisotropic and fairly dense (SG 5.9–6.1). Synthetic scheelite produced via the Czochralski process is available, but {{it has never been}} widely used as a diamond simulant. Due to the scarcity of natural gem-quality scheelite, synthetic scheelite is much more likely to simulate it than diamond. A similar case is the orthorhombic carbonate <b>cerussite,</b> which is so fragile (very brittle with four directions of good cleavage) and soft (hardness 3.5) that it is never seen set in jewelry, and only occasionally seen in gem collections because it is so difficult to cut. <b>Cerussite</b> gems have an adamantine luster, high RI (1.804–2.078), and high dispersion (0.051), making them attractive and valued collector's pieces. Aside from softness, they are easily distinguished by cerussite's high density (SG 6.51) and anisotropy with extreme birefringence (0.271).|$|E

2500|$|Paddys River Mine or Cowley copper mine {{is located}} 700m {{upstream}} on Paddys River. [...] The host rock is a skarn where Shannons Flat Adamellite baked limestone from the Paddy's River Volcanics. [...] The {{bulk of the}} mineral here is magnetite, but other sulfide and minerals of copper, lead zinc and silver attracted miners. [...] Thomas Coyle operated the mine in 1895, producing 2.6 tons of copper and 26.1kg of silver. In 1907 the Cowley Copper Syndicate Ltd started more work cutting two more adits and winzes. However it was abandoned by 1909 as the ore was too low grade. [...] More than a million tons of magnetite remain. [...] Many minerals such as aurichalcite, bronchanite, caledonite, <b>cerussite,</b> hemimorphite, hydrozincite, linarite, native silver, rozenite, and zincsilite have been found at the location.|$|E
5000|$|The Light of the Desert is a <b>cerussite</b> gem in the Royal Ontario Museum's collection. It is the world’s largest faceted {{example of}} <b>cerussite,</b> {{weighing}} 898 carats (6.3 ounces). [...] The word “cerussite” {{comes from the}} Latin meaning “white lead”; the mineral is a lead carbonate with the chemical formula of PbCO3.The raw <b>cerussite</b> was discovered in Tsumeb in northern Namibia and acquired by a gem cutter from Arizona who then cut the raw material into the gem on display. The cutting and transport of this gem is a delicate business as <b>cerussite</b> is extremely fragile and sensitive to changes in temperature changes and vibration.

50|$|<b>Cerussite</b> (also {{known as}} lead {{carbonate}} or white lead ore) is a mineral consisting of lead carbonate (PbCO3), {{and an important}} ore of lead. The name is from the Latin cerussa, white lead. Cerussa nativa was mentioned by Conrad Gessner in 1565, and in 1832 F. S. Beudant applied the name cruise to the mineral, whilst the present form, <b>cerussite,</b> is due to W. Haidinger (1845). Miners' names in early use were lead-spar and white-lead-ore.|$|E
