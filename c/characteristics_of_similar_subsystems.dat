40|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} {{is derived}} from the principle that the universe contain as much variety as possible, in the sense of maximizing the distinctiveness of each subsystem. The quantum state of a microscopic system is defined to correspond to an ensemble of subsystems of the universe with identical constituents and similar preparations and environments. A new kind of interaction is posited amongst such <b>similar</b> <b>subsystems</b> which acts to increase their distinctiveness, by extremizing the variety. In the limit of large numbers <b>of</b> <b>similar</b> <b>subsystems</b> this interaction is shown to give rise to Bohm's quantum potential. As a result the probability distribution for the ensemble is governed by the Schroedinger equation. The measurement problem is naturally and simply solved. Microscopic systems appear statistical because they are members of large ensembles <b>of</b> <b>similar</b> systems which interact non-locally. Macroscopic systems are unique, and are not members of any ensembles <b>of</b> <b>similar</b> systems. Consequently their collective coordinates may evolve deterministically. This proposal could be tested by constructing quantum devices from entangled states of a modest number of quits which, by its combinatorial complexity, can be expected to have no natural copies.

In this paper, the relative deformation of guide interface was analyzed based on Hertz theory and normal contact stiffness of guide joint was calculated first.

Based on Lagrange’s approach, motion equilibrium equations of different vibration modes were derived. At last, vibration test was designed to get natural frequencies and mode shapes of the carriage. The natural frequencies agreed well with the values calculated by analytical approach.
