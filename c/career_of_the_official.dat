Its purpose was to ascertain {{whether or not the}} official had faithfully executed his duties and it served to clear him if he was found to have acted honestly, giving him a clean certificate of recommendation. If he was found guilty of official misconduct, dishonesty or any other crimes, he was apprehended, degraded, and punished, according to his wrongdoings.|$|E

Despite almost 30 years <b>of</b> reform, <b>the</b> Chinese state's functioning continues to revolve around <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which suffuses the entire state apparatus, providing it with leadership, purpose and strategy. The party has a range of tools at its disposal to maintain its grip over government, but <b>the</b> key component <b>of</b> continued Leninist supervision is its control over <b>the</b> <b>careers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> (cadres) that populate the government, public services, state-owned enterprises, the judiciary, <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> representative government (people's congresses and political consultative conferences) and indeed the party apparatus itself. This study interrogates the efforts to use cadre training to standardize, modernize and sanitize the practice and ethos of administration. Cadres, while {{they continue to be}} bound by the ideology and practice prescribed by Leninist party discipline, should also become modern, competent managers of increasingly complex organizations. Interviews were conducted with students, teachers and administrators, along with state and communist party officials. These were fully transcribed in Chinese and personal names of informants have been removed from all transcripts and notes. <b>The</b> collection consists <b>of</b> 85 interview transcripts in Chinese and 9 interview notes in English.

In particular, attention is paid to the decoration and meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serdab and room F. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serdab this leads to the suggestion that we can construct <b>the</b> outline <b>of</b> a biography for Pepyankh, as well as identifying potential acquaintances. <b>The</b> interpretation <b>of</b> room F leads us to reattribute it to Pepyankh’s son, Heny. The tomb is then examined as a whole in order to ascertain the likely order in which it was constructed. This leads to an interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> connection between the tomb and that of Pepyankh’s father, Niankh-Pepy, as being of principally religious and filial significance.

40|$|<b>The</b> complex {{character}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polis <b>of</b> Delphi sets {{it apart}} from most poleis in Greece during the Classical and Hellenistic periods. Besides serving as <b>the</b> seat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most respected oracle {{in the ancient}} world, Delphi exhibited all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> a Greek polis, utilizing councils, assemblies and magistrates to decide her affairs. In addition, <b>the</b> sanctuary <b>of</b> Apollo was <b>the</b> common meeting place for the Amphiktyony, a religious association {{of a number of}} poleis which oversaw the Pythian festivals and <b>the</b> administration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary. ^ From the archaic period until <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> Alexander we possess an abundance of evidence, mostly epigraphic, which acquaints us with <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> Delphi, including <b>the</b> vast majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eponymous archontes and therefore a basic chronological framework. From 323 until 279, the period during which the Aitolian koinon first established her supremacy over the sanctuary and then successfully defended the sanctuary against Brennos and the Gauls, the evidence for fixing the chronology has been frequently examined but little understood. The discovery in 1893 - 1894 <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts which records Phokian reparations from the Third Sacred War, plus a few supporting documents, has provided sufficient evidence to reconstruct some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polis and the Amphiktyony from Alexander 2 ̆ 7 s death until 314 / 3. The view has been that from 313 until 279 a reliable chronological list of archontes was unachievable. The period between the terminus post quem of 314 / 3 and <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> Aitolian supremacy at the sanctuary, c. 300, is <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> this thesis. I intend to demonstrate that a comprehensive analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevant inscriptions and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>careers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Delphic <b>officials</b> named in these texts will permit assigning eponymous archontes to most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> years between these two parameters. ...|$|R
