50|$|The UK Intellectual Property Office radically {{altered the}} way UK {{national}} trade mark applications were examined in October 2007. Previously, UK {{national trade mark}} applications underwent a full examination both on absolute (distinctiveness) and relative (prior rights) grounds. In October 2007, the search which formed {{a part of the}} examination of applications on prior rights grounds became an advisory search in a similar fashion to the Community Trade Mark system, bringing into force Section 8 of the Trade Marks Act 1994. No longer will the UKIPO unilaterally be able to prevent the grant of a UK national trade mark application on the basis of an earlier pending application or prior registration for a <b>conflicting</b> <b>mark.</b> Instead, {{it will be up to}} the proprietor of that right to oppose the application when it advertised for opposition purposes, although the UKIPO will still advise owners of conflicting application where citations including their marks have been sent to the applicant to assist them in making an opposition.|$|E

40|$|At this time, {{financial}} communication faces various obstacles {{concerning the}} homogenization of communication types. Moreover, due to globalization, communication on capital markets confronts {{with a very}} visible changing process. Thus, people {{from different parts of}} the world managed to pass over language barriers but still face the ones in the financial communication field. It is well known that most financial decisions are based on the information from the financial statements. But, both the form and the conceptual language used in order to elaborate these financial statements present numerous <b>conflict</b> <b>marks.</b> In order to attenuate these <b>conflict</b> <b>marks,</b> the IASB, having as main target the financial reporting homogenization, elaborated the IFRS. At this time, Romania also faces economic, politic, social and cultural irreversible processes, of great interest for accounting: the growth of number and economic power of multinational companies; the economic globalization, especially of the financial markets; the growth of capitalization and the appearance and development of new financial products...|$|R

40|$|Using rare field research, {{this book}} investigates {{whether and how}} talking may {{transform}} terrorist violence. Given the failings of today’s dominant counterterrorism strategy, is talking a viable policy option to transform <b>conflicts</b> <b>marked</b> by terrorist violence? This book examines the reasons why "negotiating with terrorists" is so often shunned by decision-makers and scholars as a policy response, concluding that such objections are primarily based on a realist and statist understanding of terrorism that has dominated the field so far. Based on interviews with top rebel and military commanders in the southern Philippine region of Mindanao and interviewing key actors in Northern Ireland, Terrorism, Talking and Transformation investigates how talking {{may contribute to the}} transformation of <b>conflicts</b> <b>marked</b> by terrorist violence. The result of this analysis is a theoretically grounded, empirically recognizable and emancipation oriented framework {{that can be used to}} investigate the potential of talking in transforming not only terrorist (and counterterrorist) violence, but also the underlying structural violence that often surrounds it. This book will be of much interest to students in the fields of terrorism studies, security studies, Southeast Asian studies, conflict resolution/transformation and IR in general, and of use to practitioners in the field...|$|R

25|$|The growing {{power of}} Wei caused Zhao {{to back away}} from the alliance. In 383 it moved its capital to Handan and {{attacked}} the small state of Wey. Wey appealed to Wei which attacked Zhao on the western side. Being in danger, Zhao called in Chu. As usual, Chu used this as a pretext to annex territory to its north, but the diversion allowed Zhao to occupy a part of Wei.

50|$|In 1939, Italy {{occupied}} Albania, and in 1940 invaded Greece. The Italians {{were driven}} back into Albania, however, and Greek forces again {{took control of}} northern Epirus. The <b>conflict</b> <b>marked</b> the first tactical victory of the Allies in World War II. Benito Mussolini himself supervised the massive counter-attack of his divisions in spring 1941, only to be decisively defeated again by the poorly equipped, but determined, Greeks. Nazi Germany then intervened in April 1941 to avert an embarrassing, wholesale Italian defeat. The German military performed rapid military maneuvers through Yugoslavia and forced the encircled Greek forces of the Epirus front to surrender.|$|R

50|$|The {{end of the}} <b>conflict</b> <b>marked</b> {{the end of an}} era, {{the dawn}} of a new {{political}} system and a new social reality that affected all Spain. The rise of the new regime came about at the cost of much violence and little negotiation. The modern constitutional monarchy based its power on a military and paramilitary police force solidified during the 19th century both in the defense of the centralist state and stamping out popular uprisings. It thus guaranteed the preservation and extension of the interests of Spain's political and economic oligarchy, i.e. the agrarian aristocracy and the industrial burgoisie.|$|R
5000|$|The good versus evil {{fighting}} {{against each other}} is a common theme in high fantasy, and the character of evil is often an important theme in a work of high fantasy, as in The Lord of the Rings. Indeed, {{the importance of the}} concepts of good and evil can be regarded as the distinguishing mark between high fantasy and sword and sorcery. In many works of high fantasy, this <b>conflict</b> <b>marks</b> a deep concern with moral issues; in other works, the conflict is a power struggle, with, for instance, wizards behaving irresponsibly whether they are [...] "good" [...] or [...] "evil".|$|R
5000|$|The Naning <b>conflict</b> <b>marked</b> {{one of the}} {{earliest}} attempts by the British to safeguard their interests in Malaya through intervening into the interior Malay chiefdoms. However, the high cost, difficulties encountered as well as the limited monetary returns from the conflict resulted in the British adopting a less aggressive and military-based policy towards dealing {{with the rest of the}} Malay states for the next few decades. Instead, the British sought to expand their influence politically among the Malay rulers, culminating in with the signing of the Pangkor treaty and the creation of the [...] "residential" [...] system in 1874.|$|R

5|$|A {{growing sense}} of church-state <b>conflicts</b> <b>marked</b> the 14th century. To escape {{instability}} in Rome, Clement V in 1309 became the first of seven popes to reside in the fortified city of Avignon in southern France during a period known as the Avignon Papacy. The Avignon Papacy ended in 1376 when the pope returned to Rome, but was followed in 1378 by the 38-year-long Western schism with claimants to the papacy in Rome, Avignon and (after 1409) Pisa. The matter was finally resolved in 1417 at the Council of Constance where the cardinals called upon all three claimants to the papal throne to resign, and held a new election naming Martin V pope.|$|R

40|$|Civil <b>conflicts</b> <b>marked</b> {{by human}} rights {{violations}} leave devastated communities in their wake.

This Article explores the potential tensions among such mechanisms, including national human rights trials, truth commissions, and community-based gacaca, and emphasizes the importance of consult-ing victims in resolving these tensions. The authors conclude that the ICC should take the lead in coordinating the different mechanisms discussed in the Article as part of post-conflict reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|This paper reexamines {{the current}} legal {{landscape}} regarding {{the protection of}} trade marks and other industrial property rights in signs on the Internet.

This juxtaposition yields two basic approaches. Whereas trade <b>mark</b> <b>conflicts</b> within closed legal systems are generally adjudicated according to a binary either/or logic, transnational disputes are and should indeed be solved in a way that leads to a fair coexistence of <b>conflicting</b> trade <b>mark</b> laws and rights under multiple laws.

50|$|The Arab-Israeli <b>conflict</b> <b>marked</b> some of {{the highest}} armour-to-armour kill ratios {{achieved}} with the AML platform to date, including the destruction of at least 13 Egyptian and Jordanian tanks. Especially notable were several T-54 kills credited to an AML-90 platoon in the Sinai Peninsula: as late as the 1980s, military scholars continued to maintain that the 90mm DEFA cannon lacked the muzzle velocity to penetrate the thick steel hull of a T-54/55. More well-documented cases have since verified this was possible, though only with multiple shots or a direct hit on the turret rim near the driver's hatch. Israeli AML crews also sustained losses of their own during this engagement, and some AML-90s may have been captured intact by the Egyptian defenders.|$|R
