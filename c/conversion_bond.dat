40|$|Contingent Capital bonds — {{known as}} {{contingent}} convertibles (CoCos) — are bonds that automatically write-down or convert to equity when the financial {{health of the}} issuer (typically a bank) deteriorates to a pre-defined trigger. Using a dy-namic model of capital structure we show that if conversion terms are dilutive for existing shareholders, banks will have incentive to reduce likelihood of triggering by pursuing lower leverage, leading to less defaults and lower borrowing costs. Conversely, if at <b>conversion,</b> <b>bond</b> principal is written down without diluting shareholders, then banks will have perverse incentives to pursue higher leverage and capital destructive policies (money burning) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} ex post {{returns to}} emerging market debt by combining secondary-market prices with observed flows based on World Bank data. From 1970 - 2000, returns averaged 9 percent per annum, {{about the same}} as returns on a ten-year U. S. treasury bond. This reflects the combined effect of the 1980 s debt crisis and much higher returns during 1989 - 2000. Annual returns since 1986 have been less volatile than emerging market equity returns but more volatile than returns on U. S. corporate or high-yield bonds. However, unlike returns on these bonds, emerging market debt returns do not seem significantly correlated with U. S. or world stock markets.

40|$|Abstract. Porous {{silicon carbide}} (SiC) {{ceramics}} were fabricated by a polycarbosilane (PCS) <b>conversion</b> <b>bonding</b> technique, in which PCS {{was used as}} a binder to bond SiC particles with each other. In the preparing process, SiC particles were first coated with PCS, and then the powder compacts were heat-treated in an inert atmosphere.

The pyrolysis process of PCS, the pore structures and flexural strength of the as-prepared specimens were analyzed and discussed. Preparing temperature as low as 1100 °C was adopted in this process and the porous SiC ceramics with a flexural strength of 20 MPa at an open porosity of 43 % was obtained.

Because the properties of these materials depend critically on how the components are combined, we present calculations of the size and structure of silica building blocks that may be prepared as precursors to nanocomposites. By fitting existing silicon- 29 NMR data, we find kinetic parameters applicable for acid catalyzed hydrolytic polycondensation of tetraethoxysilane and tetramethoxysilane precursors. In {{a wide range of}} conditions, the local connectivity of silicon sites evolves in approximately the same way with respect to the siloxane <b>bond</b> <b>conversion.</b> Using dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, including nearest-neighbor effects and cyclization, we calculate the molecular weight distribution of silica as a function of conversion, in reasonable agreement with available experiments.

According to dielectric spectroscopy measurements, two different relaxations were determined, one beginning above 130 degrees C (with peak above 180 degrees C) attributed to alpha-relaxation (dielectric glass transition) and a second one at lower temperatures, attributed to beta-relaxation. The peak of beta-relaxation is at around 130, 75 - 80, and 30 degrees C for the rigid, intermediate rigidity/flexibility, and flexible polyesters, respectively.

The kinetics of photopolymerization was measured by photoisothermal calorimetry (photo-DSC), which allowed the measurement of the rate of polymerization (Rp), maximum rate of polymerization (Rpmax), time of inhibition (tinh), time at which Rpmax was obtained (tmax), double <b>bond</b> <b>conversion</b> (p) and maximum double <b>bond</b> <b>conversion</b> (pmax). The monomers that have been employed in this work are: tris[2 -(acryloyloxy) ethyl] isocyanurate (TAEI), Poly(melamine-co-formaldehyde) acrylate monomer (PMFA), hydroxyethyl. acrylate (BEA), glycidyl. methacrylate (GMA), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDM), polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA). Effectiveness of polymerization of different monomers (W depends on their chemical structure, functionalities, purities and also on their physical properties. Acrylate monomers are more reactive than methacrylates. Reactivities of monomers increase when their functionalities are increased. The most reactive is tri-functional tris[2 (acryloyloxy) ethyl] isocyanurate. Oxygen present in ambient air generally inhibits photopolymerization {{and an increase in}} the tinh, because it reacts with the free amine radicals and monomer propagation radicals giving peroxy radicals. Oxygen also quenches the triplet state of CQ (3 CQ*). The studies of the mechanism of photocuring of monomers indicated that photocuring reaction can be carried out in the presence of CQ alone; in this case monomers act as hydrogen-atom donors; addition of amines (AMH) clearly accelerate the polymerization reaction, for each monomer, there is an optimal CQ and AMH concentration The type of monomers and AMIH, as well as the concentration of CQ and AMH all affect the polymerization kinetics.
