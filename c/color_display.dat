5|$|Final Fantasy Tactics Advance {{uses the}} {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy Tactics, but introduced certain {{changes such as}} a customizable map for the world of Ivalice. While built for the Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy Tactics Advances graphics are vibrantly colored and extensively detailed, and though environments and characters are wholly sprite-based, facial expressions are easily identifiable and many motion frames {{have been given to}} create a smooth animation. The game also introduced an option to switch between three display modes. Two of the modes are optimized for gameplay on Game Boy Advance and the new Game Boy Advance SP respectively, and there's also a TV mode for better <b>color</b> <b>display</b> while playing this game into a television screen by using a Game Boy Player which, must be attached to a Game Cube for this to work.|$|E
25|$|The Color Graphics Adapter (CGA), {{originally}} {{also called}} the Color/Graphics Adapter or IBM Color/Graphics Monitor Adapter, introduced in 1981, was IBM's first graphics card and first <b>color</b> <b>display</b> card for the IBM PC. For this reason, it also became that computer's first color computer display standard.|$|E

25|$|The Sansa Fuze+, {{announced}} on August 31, 2010, in capacities of 4GB (US$79), 8GB (US$89) & 16GB (US$119), is a portable media player with a 2.4inch <b>color</b> <b>display</b> (QVGA) and touch capability. It also features an FM radio with FM recording and RDS capability, a voice recorder, and 24hours of audio playback {{from a single}} charge. It supports the following audio formats: MP3, WMA, Secure WMA, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Audible, Podcasts. For video it supports MPEG-4, H.264, and WMV. Storage is expandable via a microSDHC slot, {{and it can be}} used to play slotMusic and slotRadio cards.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} IBM CGA {{graphics card}} {{was equipped with}} 16kilobytes of video memory and could be connected either to a dedicated direct-drive CRT monitor using a 4-bit digital (TTL) RGBI interface, such as the IBM 5153 <b>color</b> <b>display,</b> or to an NTSC-compatible television or composite video monitor via an RCA connector. The RCA connector provided only baseband video, so to connect the CGA card to a standard television set required a separate RF modulator unless the TV had an RCA jack though with the former combined with an amplifier sometimes was more practical since one could then hook up an antenna to the amplifier and get wireless video.|$|E

This is the first Pebble smartwatch to have a <b>color</b> <b>display,</b> and still retains a LED backlight as well. The watch also has a vibrating motor for silent alarms, and smart notifications. The watch {{comes with a}} redesigned charging cable that, like its predecessor's cable, magnetically attaches itself to the watch {{in order to maintain}} its water resistance. Unlike its predecessor, the cable attaches {{to the back of the}} watch rather than the side, and has the potential to transfer data rather than just power. The band attaches with standard 22mm pins. The watch is also equipped with an ambient light sensor and 6 axis accelerometer.|$|E
25|$|All-round pilot {{vision was}} {{provided}} by a wrap-around windshield and bubble canopy. Unlike the F-16's steeply raked seat and sidestick controller, however, the Lavi employed a conventional upright seat and central control column. The cockpit employed HOTAS (hands-on-throttle and stick) controls, while a Hughes Aircraft wide-angle diffractive optics head up display (HUD) was integrated onto a single El-Op up-front control panel. There were {{a total of three}} conventional display units, two of which were <b>color.</b> <b>Display</b> redundancy was ensured via data-sharing between the HMDs. A fully computerised Elta ARC-740 ultra high frequency (UHF) radio was incorporated along with a navigation suite, the latter of which included the Tuman TINS 1700 advanced inertial navigation system. Aspects such as flexibility and situational awareness were emphasized to reduce pilot workload while under high g-forces and within a dense threat environment.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the great}} {{technical}} challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three {{times that of the}} existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee approved an all-electronic Compatible color system developed by RCA, which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution <b>color</b> <b>display.</b> The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.|$|E

25|$|In {{its most}} basic form, a color {{broadcast}} can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images, one each in the three colors of red, green, and blue (RGB). When displayed together or in rapid succession, these images will blend together to produce a full-color image as seen by the viewer. One of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three {{times that of the}} existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee approved an all-electronic system developed by RCA which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth.

25|$|Apple did {{not develop}} the iPod {{software}} entirely in-house, instead using PortalPlayer's reference platform {{based on two}} ARM cores. The platform had rudimentary software running on a commercial microkernel embedded operating system. PortalPlayer had previously been working on an IBM-branded MP3 player with Bluetooth headphones. Apple contracted another company, Pixo, to help design and implement the user interface under the direct supervision of Steve Jobs. As development progressed, Apple continued to refine the software's look and feel. Starting with the iPod Mini, the Chicago font was replaced with Espy Sans. Later iPods switched fonts again to Podium Sans—a font similar to Apple's corporate font, Myriad. <b>Color</b> <b>display</b> iPods then adopted some Mac OS X themes like Aqua progress bars, and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock. In 2007, Apple modified the iPod interface again {{with the introduction of}} the sixth-generation iPod Classic and third-generation iPod Nano by changing the font to Helvetica and, in most cases, splitting the screen in half by displaying the menus on the left and album artwork, photos, or videos on the right (whichever was appropriate for the selected item).|$|E

[...] In January 2013, Boeing delivered the first integrated battle station (IBS) equipped B-1. This replaced several displays with new multi-function <b>color</b> <b>display</b> units, an upgraded central integrated test system, and a newer aircraft performance monitoring computer.

The system specifications of the Classic were very similar to its predecessors, with the same [...] monochrome CRT display, 512×342pixel resolution, and 4megabyte (MB) memory limit of the older Macintosh computers. Apple's decision to not update the Classic with newer technology such as a 68010 CPU, higher RAM capacity or <b>color</b> <b>display</b> resulted in criticism from reviewers, with MacWorld describing it as having [...] "nothing to gloat about beyond its low price" [...] and [...] "unexceptional". But, it ensured compatibility with the Mac's by-then healthy software base as well as enabled it to fit the lower price Apple intended for it. Nevertheless, the Classic featured several improvements over the aging Macintosh Plus, which it replaced as Apple's low-end Mac computer. It was up to 25percent faster than the Plus and included an Apple SuperDrive [...] floppy disk drive as standard.|$|E
