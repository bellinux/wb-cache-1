Recently, acidification of exhaled breath condensate pH (EBC-pH) has been suggested as marker of inflammation in airway disease. We investigated pH, ammonia, lactate, pCO 2, HCO 3 −, IL- 6 and IL- 8 in EBC of 35 ventilated patients (AECC-classification: ARDS: 15, ALI: 12, no lung injury: 8). EBC-pH was decreased in ventilated patients compared to volunteers (5. 85 ± 0. 32 vs. 7. 46 ± 0. 48; P< 0. 0001). NH 4 +, lactate, HCO 3 −, pCO 2, IL- 6 and IL- 8 were analyzed in EBC and correlated with EBC-pH. We observed correlations of EBC-pH with markers of local (EBC IL- 6 : r=− 0. 71, P< 0. 0001, EBC IL- 8 : r=− 0. 68, P< 0. 0001) but not of systemic inflammation (serum IL- 6, serum IL- 8) and with indices of severity of lung injury (Murray's Lung Injury Severity Score; r=− 0. 73, P< 0. 0001, paO 2 /FiO 2; r= 0. 54, P< 0. 001). Among factors potentially contributing to pH of EBC, EBC-lactate and EBC-NH 4 + were found to correlate with EBC-pH.

40|$|Abstract This {{contribution}} {{attempts to}} investigate the channels though which financial liberalization (FL) policies might affect poverty. Surprisingly little {{work has been done}} so far on this relationship. One channel of interaction between FL and poverty is the growth channel. This literature has been, to a great extent, based on the view that FL mobilizes savings and allocates capital to more productive uses, both of which help increase the amount of physical capital and its productivity. The trickle-down effect of economic growth <b>caused,</b> or <b>accompanied,</b> <b>by</b> FL increases incomes, reduces poverty and improves income distribution. However, one would expect the economic and institutional changes brought about by FL to have a more complex effect on the living conditions of the poor. We suggest that three further channels should be added to the list: the financial crises channel, the access to credit and financial services channel, and the income share of labour channel. As far as we know, no attempt has been made previously in the literature to go beyond the ‘growth channel’. Thus, the originality of this contribution is to make the case of these extra three channels, explain them, and comment on their significance...|$|R

The mechanisms of necrosis are still unclear. In this study, we examined how high doses of cisplatin induce cell injury and whether a high affinity sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT 1) has a cytoprotective function in renal epithelial LLC-PK 1 cells. Cisplatin decreased in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and increased {{in the number of}} necrotic dead cells in a time dependent manner. Phloridzin, a potent SGLT 1 inhibitor, enhanced both TER decrease and increase of necrotic dead cells caused by cisplatin. Cisplatin increased in the intracellular nitric oxide, superoxide anion and peroxynitrite productions. Phloridzin enhanced the peroxynitrite production caused by cisplatin. The intracellular diffusion of ZO- 1 and TER decrease caused by cisplatin were inhibited by N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Protein kinase C was not involved in the cisplatin-induced injury. 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetrakis-(4 -sulfonatophenyl) -porphyrinato iron (III) and reduced glutathione, peroxynitrite scavengers, inhibited the cisplatin-induced ZO- 1 diffusion, TER decrease, and increase of necrotic dead cells.

Benzbromarone displayed affinity for PPARÃŽÂ± and PPARÃŽÂ³, and promoted binding of PPARs to PPRE. Furthermore, cultured cells with benzbromarone added showed upregulated expression of LPL and ACS.

Replication fork arrest is not random but occurs at specific sites close to two cis-elements known as O(H) and O(L). Pausing at these sites may be enhanced in the case of exonuclease-deficient POLG owing to delayed resumption of DNA replication, or replisome instability.

However, it is still debated whether infiltrated monocytes contribute to injury-induced expansion of the microglial population.

Pharmacological inhibition of SNT-induced microglial proliferation correlated with attenuated neuropathic pain hypersensitivities. Microglial proliferation is partially controlled by purinergic and fractalkine signaling, as CX 3 CR 1 −/− and P 2 Y 12 −/− mice show reduced spinal microglial proliferation and neuropathic pain. These results suggest that local microglial proliferation is the sole source of spinal microgliosis, which represents a potential therapeutic target for neuropathic pain management...|$|R
