40|$|How {{does one}} become a "futurist " – in one's own eyes {{and in the}} eyes of other people? What life {{experiences}} and professional experiences provide relevant learning for aspiring futurists; and for practising futurists who wish to develop their skills and their ability to deliver value to their employing organisations or <b>consulting</b> clients? <b>Why</b> do many futurists ignore the challenges involved in the personal journey that must be undertaken by leaders who wish to act on the insights that emerge from futures studies work in their organisations? Finally, why do there seem to be so few rich futurists? The author reflects on these and other questions in this article...|$|R
50|$|None of {{the sources}} <b>consulted</b> clarifies <b>why</b> the family lived in the French Bayonne, a usual {{location}} for Carlist exiles and refugees fleeing Spain {{in the aftermath of}} defeat suffered during the First Carlist War. Ramón was one of 8 siblings and the second oldest son. His older brother, José María, upon return to Aragón followed the family path and also engaged in Carlist activities, which did not prevent him from becoming comisario regio for Zaragoza in 1869; he inherited all family titles in 1870. Ramón as a youngster moved from France to Spain and entered Real Seminario Científico Industrial, a state-ran and highly esteemed Gipuzkoan educational establishment in Bergara. He is reported as enrolled in 1854, though it is not clear when he completed the curriculum; the standard cycle lasted 5 years.|$|R
2500|$|None of {{the sources}} <b>consulted</b> clarifies <b>why</b> Cortina left the {{regional}} jefatura. At the time Carlism was divided into supporters of de Mella and those standing by the claimant, but in historiography he is only marginally mentioned as a somewhat disoriented Mellista sympathizer. It seems that the circumstances were strictly personal. Third Carlist War broke {{the back of the}} family; while other Marchena representatives of [...] "burguesia agraria" [...] kept growing into wealth, Cortina struggled. Turning 60 and with health problems, he concluded that he would be better off on the state payroll possibly earning a pension and perhaps assumed that moving to Madrid would facilitate his return to public service. Starting 1917 he was already noted as resident of the capital. As Ministerio de Ultramar no longer existed he knocked at the doors of Ministerio de Hacienda and got finally restored as 3. class administrative official in Ministerio de Fomento, success probably conditioned by distant family ties.|$|R
5000|$|On December 14, 2016, the DOT {{cancelled}} {{the fashion}} show originally scheduled on January 19, 2016 at the SMX Convention Center in Davao City {{to prevent further}} [...] "controversy" [...] following the claim of local-based designers led by the Davao Fashion and Design Council Foundation, Inc. (DFDCFI) {{that they have been}} [...] "brushed off" [...] by the pageant organizers. The group claimed that they were never <b>consulted</b> and questioned <b>why</b> they were asked to dress up local models instead of being in charge of pre-show cocktail of the main event which is tasked to non-Mindanaoan designer, Renee Salud. Following the cancellation announcement, the DFDCFI said that they respect the decision but urged the organizers that Davao City to remain as one of the places to be visited by the candidates. On December 22, 2016, it was announced that the fashion show will push through after Salud and the DFDCFI cleared their misunderstandings and decided to help each other.|$|R
40|$|This {{article will}} {{describe}} the collection {{known as the}} William Suhr Papers in the Getty Research Institute and its contents, explain who Suhr was and when and where he was active, what his papers have to offer, and <b>why</b> <b>consulting</b> them should be considered by both researchers interested in twentieth-century paintings and painting restoration and by art historians and historians engaged with Germany and the vicissitudes of immigration between the two World Wars. I will also address my involvement with the Suhr Papers {{within the context of}} Pieter Bruegel’s Wedding Dance painting in the Detroit Institute of Arts and how the richness of the Suhr papers, in addition to its photo documentation, has led my own investigations and research on the Bruegel painting in most unexpected directions. The Detroit painting will offer focus while exploring the Suhr Papers and what they offer. Little has been published on Mr. Suhr and his work and papers, although a recent article by Joyce Hill Stoner (2005), who interviewed Suhr in 1977, and Edgar Munhall’s remembrance from 1996, offer a helpful, informative beginning...|$|R
2500|$|Don McKellar {{said about}} {{adapting}} the story, [...] "None {{of the characters}} even have names or a history, which is very untraditional for a Hollywood story. The film, like the novel, directly addresses sight and {{point of view and}} asks you to see things from a different perspective." [...] McKellar wrote the script so audiences would see the world {{through the eyes of the}} protagonist, the doctor's wife. He sought to have them question the humanity of how she observes but does not act in various situations, including a rape scene. He <b>consulted</b> Saramago about <b>why</b> the wife took so long to act. McKellar noted, [...] "He said she became aware of the responsibility that comes with seeing gradually, first to herself, then to her husband, then to her small family, then her ward, and finally to the world where she has to create a new civilization." [...] The screenwriter wrote out the [...] "actions and circumstances" [...] that would allow the wife to find her responsibility. While the completed script was mostly faithful to the novel, McKellar went through several drafts that were not. One such saw him veer away from the novel by creating names and backstories for all the characters. Another significantly changed the chronology. Only after these abortive attempts did McKellar decide to cut the backstories and focus primarily on the doctor and his wife. He attempted to reconnect with what originally drew him to the novel: what he called its [...] "existential simplicity". The novel defines its characters by little more than their present actions; doing the same for the adaptation became [...] "an interesting exercise" [...] for McKellar.|$|R
