The reserve includes the largest area of salt marsh in Somerset, and large expanses of mudflats exposed at low tide, important feedingand roosting sites for waterfowl and wading birds.

Adjoining the reserve are three <b>coastal</b> <b>commons</b> — from west to east these are Catsford Common, Wall Common and Steart Common.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic {{diversity}} {{is also an}} important component of agricultural biodiversity. The conservation and sustainable use of local aquatic ecosystems, ponds, rivers, <b>coastal</b> <b>commons</b> by artisanal fisherfolk and smallholder farmers is important to the survival of both humans and the environment. Since aquatic organisms, including fish, provide much of our food supply as well as underpinning the income of coastal peoples, it is critical that fisherfolk and smallholder farmers have genetic reserves and sustainable ecosystems to draw upon as aquaculture and marine fisheries management continue to evolve.|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper {{describes}} the nature of the oceans and human use of the living natural assets therein. It discusses the technology and institutional arrangements through which coastal communities interacted with these living resources, and the political economy of the movement from small-scale to large-scale fishing operations and from community rights to open access. The second part of the paper examines the potential of natural asset-building strategies. This draws upon examples from the Asia-Pacific region to highlight how small-scale, community-based fishing is both ecologically and economically suited to make a blessing of the <b>coastal</b> <b>commons</b> that will simultaneously ensure sustainable natural resource use and community well-being.

50|$|Although a sport most {{associated}} with Scotland, golf has {{a tradition in}} Wales stretching back to the late 19th century. The first recognised golf courses were constructed in Wales in the 1880s, though a short course was built in Pontnewydd in Cwmbran in 1875. Most of these early courses were built on <b>coastal</b> <b>common</b> land, including Tenby (1880), Borth and Ynyslas (1885). As tourism developed in Wales, the golf clubs helped attract visitors, which was further advertised by the newly constructed passenger rail links.|$|R

In: ‘Undersea’, The Atlantic Monthly, September 1947. Abstract Coasts- the littoral- have features that make them ‘liminal’, that is, nei-ther one thing nor the other, transitory, and on the threshold. Such features of in-between-ness are often treated culturally as problematic, even taboo. I explore the liminality of ocean and <b>coastal</b> <b>commons,</b> including their dynamics and their boundaries, landward and seaward and side-by-side and issues related to their management. This leads to the value-laden and contentious domain of ‘property rights ’ analysis, including the familiar domain of privatized property, the still poorly charted territory of commonly held property, and the mythical terrain of no property or ‘open access, ’ the lands and seas where res nullius is the rule, and our imaginations run wild with visions of fabulous wealth, whether fish or gold, or of fabulous monsters, once depicted in explorers ’ charts and now seen as illegal and undocumented fishing vessels. I conclude with a turn to the more familiar coastal waters and shores and the rough charts of the commons, as yet frontiers, with a view toward how anthropological analyses can contribute to improved policy for ocean and coastal management...|$|E

50|$|The {{sport of}} golf in Wales traces its origins to the 1880s. The {{earliest}} course {{was constructed in}} Pontnewydd in Monmouthshire in 1875, {{but this was a}} short course. By the mid-1880s nine-hole courses were built at several sites in Wales on <b>coastal</b> <b>common</b> land where the turf was acceptable. Several sites claim to be home to the oldest golf club in Wales, though it is generally accepted that Tenby, formed in 1888, was the first, with evidence that the game was played there from at least 1875. Another early course is found stretching between Borth and Ynyslas being in use from 1885. Other 19th-century courses, again all coastal, include Conwy (1890), Penarth (1890), Porthcawl (1891) and Aberdovey (1892). The opening of the early railway lines and the growing tourism in Wales gave these new courses opportunities to attract visitors. Though, as the golf clubs of Wales were initially created and run by the middle class, the sport suffered from a view as being English and elitist.|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{molecular}} mechanism of adaptive evolution in plants provides {{insights into the}} selective forces driving adaptation and the genetic basis of adaptive traits with agricultural value. The genomic resources available for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) make it well suited to the rapid molecular dissection of adaptive processes. Although numerous potentially adaptive loci {{have been identified in}} Arabidopsis, the consequences of divergent selection and migration (both important aspects of the process of local adaptation) for Arabidopsis are not well understood. Here, we use a multiyear field-based reciprocal transplant experiment to detect local populations of Arabidopsis composed of multiple small stands of plants (demes) that are locally adapted to the coast and adjacent inland habitats in northeastern Spain. We identify fitness tradeoffs between plants from these different habitats when grown together in inland and <b>coastal</b> <b>common</b> gardens and also, under controlled conditions in soil excavated from coastal and inland sites. Plants from the coastal habitat also outperform those from inland when grown under high salinity, indicating local adaptation to soil salinity. Sodium can be toxic to plants, and we find its concentration to be elevated in soil and plants sampled at the coast. We conclude that the local adaptation that we observe between adjacent coastal and inland populations is caused by ongoing divergent selection driven by the differential salinity between coastal and inland soils...|$|R

40|$|Canada {{contains}} several recognizable landscape icons {{such as the}} concession, township {{and range}} system, long lot system, seigneurial system and the prairie section that exemplify connections between resident populations and property. Attachment to life space is nurtured through bonds with place, community and region, and in western culture is exemplified by property ownership of varying spatial arrangements, functions or appearance. In Newfoundland, a land use form called the fishing room evolved from <b>coastal</b> <b>common</b> property connecting marine resource distributions with shoreline from which such resources could be most efficiently exploited. This thesis explores fishing room development from European discovery in 1497 to 1805, and details how areas of coastal land were transformed into small, enclosed properties adaptable for settlement. Fishing rooms were originally defined, managed and seasonally transferred under the British fishing admiralty system which favoured an equitable sharing of coastal land among stakeholders, and promoted stability in a generally unstable trade environment. Fishing rooms were not the product of land use systems imposed arbitrarily upon an uninhabited frontier, but developed as a practical land use strategy to provide adequate shore space for living, working and production. Extended occupation of land within these systems integrated human occupancy into distinct socio-environmental entities, invited a cultural relationship with immediate bio-physical surroundings, and promoted a singular sense of place and belonging. Fishing rooms provided a proven and legitimate land use strategy in which Newfoundland inhabitants were linked through heritage and tradition to a landscape perched physically and culturally between land and sea...|$|R
