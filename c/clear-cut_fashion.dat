This is a key concept since people acquired the notion that they were conditioned to view everything in a linear and <b>clear-cut</b> <b>fashion.</b> Now, art is stepping out of that form and allowing for people to build their own experiences with the piece. Non-linearity describes a project that escape from the conventional linear narrative coming from novels, theater plays and movies. Non-linear art usually requires audience participation or at least, the fact that the [...] "visitor" [...] is taken into consideration by the representation, altering the displayed content. The participatory aspect of new media art, which for some artists has become integral, emerged from Allan Kaprow's Happenings and became with Internet, a significant component of contemporary art. Art is not produced as a completed object submitted to the audience appreciation, it is a process in permanent mutation.|$|E
40|$|Based on over 400 {{character}} {{readings in}} the Nancheng city dialect of Eastern Jiangxi, a synchronie phonology is outlined and some sound correspondences with the Qie Yun system are worked out. Nancheng city dialect has the general {{characteristics of a}} Gan dialect and some Min-like developments in its rhyme system. Its principal feature of interest is the glottalization of upper Departing, a shortish tone with a sharp, metallic, ringing voice quality, ending in a <b>clear-cut</b> <b>fashion,</b> though not in a glottal stop. A comparison of the spectral properties of this and other tones shows upper Departing to be characterized by a weaker first harmonic. This dialect, {{as well as others}} in the same area, bears witness to the claim, made elsewhere, that Middle Chinese Departing tone was characterized by glottalized phonation.

40|$|The {{electronic}} marketplace offers {{great potential for}} the recommenda-tion of supplies. In the so called recommender systems, {{it is crucial to}} apply matchmaking strategies that faithfully satisfy the predicates specified in the demand, and take into account as much as possible the user preferences. We focus on real-life ontology-driven matchmaking scenarios and identify a number of challenges, being inspired by such scenarios. A key challenge is that of presenting the results to the users in an understandable and <b>clear-cut</b> <b>fashion</b> in order to facilitate the analysis of the results. Indeed, such scenarios evoke the opportunity to rank and group the results according to specific criteria. A further challenge consists of presenting the results to the user in an asynchronous fashion, i. e. the ’push ’ mode, along with the ’pull’ mode, in which the user explicitly issues a query, and displays the results. Moreover, an important issue to consider in real-life cases is the possibility of submitting a query to multiple providers, and collecting the various re-sults. We have designed and implemented an ontology-based matchmaking system that suitably addresses the above challenges. We have conducted a comprehensive experimental study, in order to investigate the usability of the system, the performance and the effectiveness of the matchmaking strategies with real ontological datasets. 1 a...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the social and psychocultural dimensions of medical pluralism and treatment seeking in Santarém, a rapidly growing municipality in the Brazilian Amazon. Based on a year-and-a-half of ethnographic fieldwork in urban and rural settings, it comparatively examines how popular religions and cosmopolitan health institutions define and manage (or fail to manage) sickness, psychosocial impairment, and emotional distress. It also reveals lived experiences of informants who seek out these therapeutic options and the processes through which quests for healing shape personal understandings of affliction and selfhood. This study contributes to emerging scholarship in anthropology that theorizes medical pluralism, {{not in terms of}} discrete cultural systems set in opposition to one another (e. g., traditional versus cosmopolitan medicine), but rather as an open system of dynamic relations between institutions and between institutions and care-seekers. This dissertation situates these processes within broader historical trends in the Amazon that have lead to significant patterns of urbanization, migration, and sociocultural complexity, contrary to popular stereotypes of the region. In this context, religious institutions such as Pentecostalism, Spiritism, Candomblé, and Umbanda have flourished and, along with secular health institutions, provide diverse social and symbolic resources for the needs of care-seekers. However, an examination of the ways that santarenos in these communities cognize illness and distress and seek care reveals how blurred the boundaries are between institutional ideologies and therapeutic practices. These domains are characterized as much by complementarity as by contradiction. In similar light, individual treatment seeking efforts do not unfold in any <b>clear-cut</b> <b>fashion.</b> Rather, informants find themselves caught up within epistemic entanglements, as they navigate moral worlds oriented to medicalized care, ritual forms of healing, and spirit mediumship. Case studies convey personal dilemmas that emerge from these entanglements, in which individuals strive to regain control of symptoms, of self- and social efficacy, and moral development. Psychocultural theories, including the work of culture and embodiment, provide a framework for understanding how differing cultural idioms articulate with these life-course themes, emotions, and sensory experiences, which together underpin expressions of flexibility in selfhood in response to social conditions of pluralis...|$|E
