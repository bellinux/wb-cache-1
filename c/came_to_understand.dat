5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. It's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the more they worked with Team Bondi management, the more they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{that this was a}} terrible idea.|$|E
5|$|While in Mexico, Cameron began {{performing}} blood rituals in {{the hope}} of communicating with Parsons' spirit; during these, she cut her own wrists. As part of these rituals, she claimed to have received a new magical identity, Hilarion. When she learned that an unidentified flying object had been seen over Washington D.C.'s Capitol Building she considered it a response to Parsons' death. After two months, she returned to California and attempted suicide. Increasingly interested in occultism, she read through her husband's papers. Embracing his Thelemic beliefs, she <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> his purpose in carrying out the Babalon Working and also came to believe that the spirit of Babalon had been incarnated into herself. She came to believe that Parsons had been murdered by the police or anti-zionists, and continued her attempts at astral projection to commune with his spirit.|$|E
5|$|When Tillman {{entered the}} Senate in 1895, he {{was opposed to}} {{expansion}} of the United States Navy, fearing the expenditure would cause the issuance of bonds by the president, which he felt would only enrich the wealthy. Tillman sat on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and soon <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that South Carolina could benefit from naval appropriations steered towards her. A flow of federal funds to his home state resulted, beginning in 1900, followed by the establishment, in 1909, of the Charleston Naval Shipyard. Once Democrats {{took control of the}} Senate {{for the first time in}} Tillman's tenure, in 1913, he became chairman of the committee and allied with others from the southeast (such as Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, a North Carolinian) to see that the bulk of naval appropriations would be spent there. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims (57th through 59th Congresses) and on the Committee on Five Civilized Tribes of Indians (61st and 62nd Congresses). Strokes in 1908 and 1910 decreased his influence and ability in the Senate; his seniority entitled him to become Senate Appropriations Committee chairman in 1913, but his health did not permit it.|$|E

5|$|Attempting {{his usual}} tactic, the British crew {{approached}} {{from behind and}} below. Suddenly the Heinkel lurched into a tight left-hand turn allowing the gunners to fire a broad-side. The bomber disappeared into the mist. Cunningham asked GCI for help. They tracked the Heinkel flying north near Shaftesbury. Engaging again the German pilot managed {{to turn into a}} head-on position and dive past almost upside down. He continually evaded Cunningham by turning in underneath him at near-impossible angles. Cunningham and Rawnsley <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> they were not dealing with a novice. Soon a turning match began and then the German attempted to escape by twisting and diving. Cunningham forced him down to 900 feet but Rawnsley and GCI lost contact when the ground clutter hid the Heinkel's signal. Cunningham returned to base. News soon came through the He 111 had crashed onto the slopes on Cranborne Chase. Apparently, the Heinkel had broken through the clouds at only a hundred feet and dived vertically into the ground near the isolated village of Alvediston at 17:05. Intelligence later determined that the machine was a He 111H-6, Werknummer 4627, code 6N+FR, from 7./KGr 100. The bomber disintegrated upon impact. The pilot, Staffelkapitän ("squadron leader") Hauptmann Siegried Langer was killed along with his crew; Oberfeldwebel G. Schmidt, Feldwebel D. Hoffmann, P. Gaidies and Gefreiter W. Worring. It was a unique victory for Cunningham. He had not fired his guns in the 150-minute chase.|$|E

25|$|Fish Hawk was {{designed}} to work year-round in an annual cycle in which she engaged in scientific research involving trawling and dredging in the summer, then steamed north to collect and hatch cod eggs in late autumn. With the arrival of winter, she steamed south to hatch shad eggs, moving to various points along the coast during the winter and spring {{in accordance with the}} natural timing of shad runs. With those completed, she renewed the cycle by returning to research work during the following summer. As fisheries researchers later <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the reproduction of Spanish mackerel and striped bass, Fish Hawk added hatching of these species to her annual routine.|$|E

25|$|The Sultan, {{upon hearing}} of the debacle, {{dispatched}} three armies to Albania. Skanderbeg, upon learning of the sultan's plans, immediately marched into Macedonia. A large force under Hasan bey set out to march into Albania through the same pass as Sinan a month before, unaware that Skanderbeg was ready to meet him. While the Ottomans were idle, Skanderbeg ordered the enemy guards to be killed and a full-scale battle soon ensued. Most of the Ottoman soldiers were killed and Hasan himself was wounded by an arrow piercing through his right arm. Despite {{the fact that most}} of his army was annihilated and that it was late at night, he took some of his most loyal soldiers up into a more secure place. Skanderbeg <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> this the next morning and immediately set off to find him. Out of desperation, Hasan came out unarmed and surrendered to Skanderbeg asking for mercy. Skanderbeg gave Hasan what he was asking for and the latter was taken prisoner.|$|E

In Autobiography Cardus says he found his Kingdom of Heaven in the arts, [...] "the only religion that is real and, once found, omnipresent"—though his rationalism was shaken, he confesses, when he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the late string quartets of Beethoven. He ends his autobiography by declaring: [...] "If I know that my Redeemer liveth it {{is not on the}} church's testimony, but because of what Handel affirms".|$|E

After his father's death, he looked to religion to help him cope, writing to his cousin Augustus Noble Hand: [...] "If you could imagine one half the comfort my religion has given to me in this terrible loss, you would see that Christ never forsakes those who cling to him." [...] The depth of Hand's early religious convictions was in sharp contrast to his later agnosticism.|$|E

[...] He described his father as a [...] "confirmed atheist" [...] {{by the time his}} parents met, and his stepfather as [...] "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful."

[...] Later, as she revised her diary, Frank felt ashamed of her harsh attitude, writing: [...] "Anne, is it really you who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?" [...] She <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that their differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother's, and saw that she had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering.

500|$|Zenna was {{replaced}} in the soap by her daughter Chancer, {{who was in}} turn succeeded by her own daughter, Kyte. Kyte played Wellard for seven years, longer than Zenna and Chancer. The dog, whose pedigree name is Minka [...] Kyte, came to the soap from Raddings' company Stunt Dogs, along with another EastEnders dog, Terence. She had previous experience in the television and film industry, having appeared on A Touch of Frost, The Jonny Vaughan Show, 102 Dalmatians and Gladiator. Raddings revealed that Kyte <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the words [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut", meaning the director would sometimes have to give an alternate cue such as [...] "go" [...] during scenes featuring Wellard, as the dog would become instantly alert upon hearing the usual commands, which appeared incongruous in scenes which called for Wellard to be relaxed. Kyte worked closely with Mohammed George, who played Wellard's owner Gus. George was afraid of dogs as a child, but after working with Kyte for three years, commented that they were so close he [...] "sometimes [...] like [...] dad." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} their early success in Australia, Paul Field {{reported}} that the band was unable to produce a television program on the ABC, where they felt they would receive the most exposure to the pre-school market. [...] "Around 1996–1997", they filmed a television pilot for the ABC, but as The Sydney Morning Herald reported in 2002, [...] "the project never {{got off the ground}} due to irreconcilable artistic differences". [...] As a result, The Wiggles financed a TV program of 13 episodes themselves and sold it to the Disney Channel in Australia and to Channel Seven, where it became a hit. [...] By 1998, The Wiggles were ready to move on to international markets, despite its members' health issues, especially Field's. [...] The reaction of producers in the UK was less positive than the group would have liked, although they were eventually able to make inroads there, but their real success came in the US. [...] Disney arranged for them to perform at Disneyland in California, where they were discovered by Lyrick Studios, the producers of Barney & Friends. [...] Both Anthony and Paul Field reported that Lyrick, despite their initial misgivings about whether American audiences would accept the band's Australian accents, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> The Wiggles and their goals, and after successful tests with American children, enthusiastically promoted them.|$|E
