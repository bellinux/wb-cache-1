50|$|The {{landscape}} has {{a rugged}} topography with gorges, valleys {{and a number}} of mountains above 700 m with the highest peak being Mount Langley at 868m. Throughout the park there are scenic waterfalls such as Booloumba Creek Falls, cascades and numerous boulder strewn creeks. The Conondale range forms a <b>catchment</b> <b>divide</b> between the Brisbane River and Mary River with the southernmost tributaries of the Mary river forming in Booloumba and Yabba creek. The park also contains wetlands of national significance. These tributaries are important for the threatened Mary river cod which has declined in these creeks. The region has a sub-tropical climate with a mean annual rainfall of 1,500 mm, the majority of rainfall occurs seasonally in summer (December-March) usually with heavy downpours and winters generally cold and dry with occasional frosts. Major vegetation types include a mix of complex notophyll vine forest, sub-tropical rainforest, woodlands, bangalow palm forests, wet sclerophyll and dry sclerophyll forest with rainforest occurring mainly at higher altitudes and along watercourses.|$|E

The catchment, with a {{drainage area}} of a 6. 37 km 2, collects the discharge from five first order streams, and encompasses the most common landscape forms (and their associated soil types) {{that occur in the}} region. The instrumental layout provides measurements of rainfall and water discharge at high resolution. In addition, a hydrological transect was installed along a characteristic slope. This transect includes neutron probe access tubes to measure soil water content to depths of up to 4. 8 m, and wells for monitoring the groundwater level from the floodplain to the plateau (<b>catchment</b> <b>divide).</b> We present results showing the effects of interannual variability of climate on the soil water and groundwater stores and on the streamflow. Preliminary results suggest a strong interannual signal, with still unknown implications for the hydrological functioning of the catchment on a longer time scale: During 2003, the groundwater storage increase as a result of deep recharge was 500 mm less than in 2002. Since groundwater is crucial to sustaining baseflow in the dry season, we will analyse the potential implications for the overall discharge of the river system in the longer term...|$|E

On the main face of these pyramids a series of symbols or alphabetical characters is drawn.

The prevailing figure is the so-called “ramo secco” (withered branch), that here is thought {{to be a kind of}} conifer characterizing the Celtic ethnicity settled in this geographic area up to the 2 nd century B. C. A number of comparisons was found to be available all over the main core of the Po-river alluvial plain and from the surrounding regions, i. e. Veneto, Lombardia and Trentino Alto Adige. This kind of interpretation appears to be partly supported by onomastic elements and, above all, by a conspicuous series of iconographic elements of comparison existing in the transalpine Gaul, i. e. the original settlement area of the Celtic people. It is noteworthy, in fact, that the central area of the Po plain probably was the settling zone of the Padinates ethnical group, whose name was recalling the form of the conifer trees living all around the <b>catchment</b> <b>divide</b> of the big river, as explicitly recorded by Pliny the Elder...|$|E

40|$|Ten years' {{hydrological}} investigations at Danum have provided strong {{evidence of the}} effects of extremes of drought, as in the April 1992 El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) event, and flood, as in January 1996. The 1. 5 km 2 undisturbed forest control catchment experienced a complete drying out of the stream for the whole 1. 5 km of defined channel above the gauging station in 1992, but concentrated surface flow along every declivity from within a few metres of the <b>catchment</b> <b>divide</b> after the exceptional rains of 19 January 1996. Under these natural conditions, erosion is episodic. Sediment is discharged in pulses caused by storm events, collapse of debris dams and occasional landslips. Disturbance by logging accentuates this irregular regime. In the first few months following disturbance, a wave of sediment is moved by each storm, but over subsequent years, rare events scour sediment from bare areas, gullies and channel deposits. The spatial distribution of sediment sources changes with time after logging, as bare areas on slopes are revegetated and small gullies are filled with debris. Extreme storm events, as in January 1996, cause logging roads to collapse, with landslides leading to surges of sediment into channels, reactivating the pulsed sediment delivery by every storm that happened immediately after logging. These effects are not dampened out with increasing catchment scale. Even the 721 km 2 Sungai Segama has a sediment yield regime dominated by extreme events, the sediment yield in that single day on 19 January 1996 exceeding the annual sediment load in several previous years. In a large disturbed catchment, such road failures and logging-activity-induced mass movements increase the mud and silt in floodwaters affecting settlements downstream. Management systems require long-term sediment reduction strategies. This implies careful road design and good water movement regulation and erosion control throughout the logging process...|$|E
40|$|A {{history of}} soil erosion, {{alluvial}} and colluvial deposition is presented {{for a small}} catchment in NW Greece. The role of climatic events, tectonics and human disturbance of the landscape are examined. A major valley aggradation, named the Syndendron alluvium, was deposited in the valley floor during {{the close of the}} last glaciation. The 15, 000 – 10, 000 cal yr BP period was a time of dramatic climate fluctuations and associated changes in vegetation, fluctuating between steppe and oak woodland. The Syndendron alluvial deposit is associated with significant fires in the mid and upper catchment, as indicated by ash layers and charcoal in soils dated from this time. Regular fires were clearly an important part of landscape modification in sediments and soil deposited after about 15, 000 cal yrs BP. The deposition of the Syndendron alluvium may have began as early as 14, 200 cal yr BP but more likely was deposited between ca 12, 250 and 9, 300 cal yr BP (sites C 11, C 12, C 13 and P 37). The alluvium buries distinctive charcoal-rich paleosols dated between 14, 700 and 14, 200 cal yr BP (sites C 6, C 9 and C 19). Debris flow deposits and slope wash from adjacent hill slopes provided the sediment source for the alluvium and slope wash has buried several distinctive late Pleistocene hill soils (sites C 11, C 12, C 19). Alluvial sedimentation and hill slope erosion continued until at least 11, 000 cal yrs BP, as indicated by an eroded hill soil at C 11 that is buried by the aggrading Syndendron alluvium. Deposition had, however,ceased by ca. 9, 300, as indicated by distinct alluvial soils that developed on the deposit (sites C 12 and P 37). Several colluvial soils dated to about 8, 000 cal yr BP (C 9 and C 17) also cap the alluvium. The Syndendron alluvial event may in part relate to the arrival of humans during the climatic amelioration associated with the late glacial interstadial (Bolling-Allerod interstadials). Certainly there is increased burning of the catchment after about 15, 000 cal yrs BP. Palaeolithic stone tools have been found in the catchment and along with others in the Grevena and Epirus regions, indicating humans were present. This period is also associated with colluvial soil deposition on lower slopes (sites C 6 and C 19). However, after about 12, 250 cal yr BP there is a dramatic acceleration in the erosion rate and associated deposition on the valley floor and lower slopes. While fire appears to be important, a change to drier and cooler conditions, recorded in the Greenland ice cores as the Younger Dryas phase, may have caused denudation between 12, 800 and 11, 600 cal yrs BP. The climate change toward wetter conditions after 10, 000 cal yr BP and increasing tree cover appears to have led to a more stable landscape indicated by soil development and associated soil creep. However, there have been no Mesolithic sites identified in Grevena, and it is generally a period of low human activity in Greece. Following the hill slope erosion and deposition of the Syndendron alluvium the catchment seems to have become relatively stable as indicated by the development of moderately deep and well structured fertile black silty clay loam soils on the Syndendron alluvium. This is also supported in the upper catchment, as soil colluvium caps the Syndendron alluvium after 10, 000 cal yr BP (site C 12), and the stream re-incised the alluvium before 7, 500 cal yr BP (site C 11). The stream incision and also the arrival of Neolithic farmers in the valley are associated with a series of landslides and debris flow deposits between 7, 500 and 6, 500 cal yrs BP. In the lower catchment 2 m of fine-textured alluvium buries well-developed dark soils formed on the Syndendron alluvium sometime after 9, 300 cal yrs BP. The landslide deposits dating between about 7, 500 and 6, 500 cal yr BP in the upper catchment contain large (4 x 1 m), intact pieces of highly weathered soil similar in chemical composition to those preserved on the upper slopes and <b>catchment</b> <b>divide.</b> The renewed incision of the Syndendron alluvium may have over-steepened some slopes and triggered land sliding at this time. The large size of the landslides and paucity of charcoal within them may implicate increased seismic activity as a trigger, as occurred during the 1995 Grevena earthquake. Fault displacements have been noted in both the Tertiary bedrock and the upper Plio-Pleistocene sediments within the catchment, although no active (Holocene) fault scarps were noted. Work in the base of the catchment indicates that the Neolithic impact was generally minor, with 1. 5 m of alluvial deposition occurring between 5, 900 and about 4, 700 cal yrs BP. However, this alluvium was then abruptly buried by over 2 m of slope deposits derived from erosion of adjacent hills at after about 4, 400 cal yrs BP. Thin, 0. 2 m, A/C soils formed on the alluvial sediments during two stable periods each of about 500 years duration, indicating topsoils can develop rapidly in this environment. Other dark, loamy soil-like colluvial materials begin to be transported down-slope at about 5, 000 through to 2, 750 cal yrs BP. However, between 2, 200 and 1, 300 cal yr BP dark greyish-brown calcareous colluvium containing bedrock debris was deposited in depressions and gullies. This hill slope erosion and deposition was associated with the latter phase of the Sirini alluvium, which is the second major Holocene alluvial valley fill. This alluvium is dated near its base to ca. 4, 150 cal yrs BP, but the major deposition occurs after 3, 100 cal yr BP with 5 m of sediment being deposited after this date. At another site more than 6 m of fine-textured alluvium is deposited after 2, 450 cal yrs BP. Sheep/goat vertebrae and bovine teeth (male) were located in two of the alluvial sections and suggest agricultural grazing practises were very well established after about 3, 100 cal yrs BP. The Sirini alluvial deposition continues until at least 2, 000 cal yr BP as indicated at one site and 1, 700 cal yr BP at another. The Sirini alluvial deposition coincides with a series of colluvial deposits on the valley sides dated between 2, 750 and 1, 390 cal yrs BP. This Sirini alluvial filling appears to be staggered. At one site a distinct alluvial soil separates the alluvium into two phases Sirini A and Sirini B. Re-incision of the Sirini alluvium occurred sometime after about 1, 700 cal yrs BP. Thin and incipient A/C soils form on the top of this alluvium supporting its youthfulness. In the modern valley floor a very young alluvial deposit named the Leipsokouki alluvium occurs 1 - 4 m above the modern flood plain. This alluvial fill has very weakly expressed topsoil development and is largely composed of raw weakly weathered alluvium. It is dated as modern (140 + 130 cal yr BP Wk 9926) on charcoal taken from the upper fine-textured alluvium in the mid catchment, but elsewhere it contains Ottoman sherds...|$|E

Our aims were to examine, if vegetation types are valid in comparing wetlands, what kind of ecological major pattern the vegetation type composition of wetlands shows and how vegetation types distribute across altitudes. On those ground we discuss the wetland succession of the study area. We used the Finnish mire site types as vegetation types. Mire site types {{could be used for}} an ecological classification and ordination of the wetlands. As was expected, the major gradient consisted of the transition from mire margin (swamp) to expanse. The distribution of the Major Vegetational Wetland Groups (MVWG) responded to a general water-flow pattern in the landscape. Partly different peatland succession sequences occur in areas with small mire basins and in areas with larger mire basins with evolving mire complexes. Sequences of small wetlands and those of mire complexes follow the same trajectory only as far as the major gradient is considered while they differ with regard to the vegetation type composition of locally rare vegetation types and with regard to peatland morphology. Trajectories of mire complexes at <b>catchment</b> <b>divides</b> differ from those at catchment centers where the waters in the landscape tend to gather.

40|$|The endorheic Lake Eyre Basin drains 1. 2 {{million square}} {{kilometres}} of arid central Australia, yet provides habitat for only 30 species {{of freshwater fish}} due to the scarcity of water and extreme climate. The majority are hardy riverine species that are adapted to the unpredictable flow regimes, and capable of massive population booms following heavy rainfall and the restoration of connectivity between isolated waterholes. The remainder are endemic specialists from isolated springs with very restricted ranges, and many are listed under relevant state and national endangered species legislation and also by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). For these spring communities, which are sustained by water from the Great Artesian Basin, survival is contingent on suitable habitat persisting alongside extractive mining, agriculture and the imposition of alien species. For the riverine species, which frequently undertake long migrations into ephemeral systems, preservation of the natural flow regime is paramount, as this reinstates riverine connectivity. In this study, fish were sampled from the Bulloo River in the east to the Mulligan River in the west, along a temporal timeframe and using a standard set of sampling gears. Fish presence was influenced by factors such as natural <b>catchment</b> <b>divides,</b> sampling time, ephemerality and the occurrence of connection flows and flooding. Despite the comparatively low diversity of species, the aquatic systems of this isolated region remain in good ecological condition, and as such they offer excellent opportunities to investigate the ecology of arid water systems.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{development}} of waterlogging in the cultivated and arable areas within typical dryland closed drainage basins (e. g. the Farafra and Baharia Oases), which {{are located in the}} Western Desert of Egypt. Multi-temporal remote sensing data of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) were collected and processed to detect the land cover changes; cultivations, and the extent of water ponds and seepage channels. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) has been processed to delineate the catchment morphometrical parameters (i. e. drainage networks, <b>catchment</b> <b>divides</b> and surface areas of different basins) and to examine the spatial distribution of cultivated fields and their relation to the extracted drainage networks. The soil of these closed drainage basins is mainly shallow and lithic with high calcium carbonate content; therefore, the downward percolation of excess irrigation water is limited by {{the development of}} subsurface hardpan, which also saturates the upper layer of soil with water. The subsurface seepage from the newly cultivated areas in the Farafra Oasis has revealed the pattern of buried alluvial channels, which are waterlogged and outlined by the growth of diagnostic saline shrubs. Furthermore, the courses of these waterlogged channels are coinciding with their counterparts of the SRTM DEM, and the recent satellite images show that the surface playas in the downstream of these channels are partially occupied by water ponds. On the other hand, a large water pond has occupied the main playa and submerged the surrounding fields, as a large area has been cultivated within a relatively small closed drainage basin in the Baharia Oasis. The geomorphology of closed drainage basins has to be considered when planning for a new cultivation in dryland catchments to better control waterlogging hazards. The "dry-drainage" concept can be implemented as the drainage and seepage water can be conveyed through the inactive alluvial channels into certain abandoned playas for evaporation...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 125 - 140). Freshwater ecosystems underpin {{the fabric}} of society and the environment, providing essential ecosystem services such as water and food, upon which all human beings depend. In order to secure these vital services requires the sustainable management of freshwater ecosystems. At present however, freshwater biodiversity is under severe threat from anthropogenic disturbances, and the situation is expected to worsen due to population growth and global change. Coupled with the threats to freshwater biota are the limited resources available to secure their protection. There {{is a need to}} therefore prioritise freshwater ecosystems in a comprehensive, adequate and representative manner to maximise the outcomes of conservation effort. The concept of systematic conservation planning was developed to address this challenge. It offers a suitable framework for achieving conservation goals in the face of other competing land uses. The principles of systematic conservation planning are being widely applied in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, but their application in freshwater ecosystems is still relatively limited. Freshwater ecosystems provide challenges to conservation planning that are unique from those of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, such as the longitudinal nature of river systems and the associated connectivity, and <b>catchment</b> <b>divides</b> that constrain some obligate species. As a result freshwater ecosystems require conservation planning tools and approaches that are specifically geared towards addressing these unique challenges. Progress has recently been achieved in addressing some of these challenges, but there are still other outstanding issues that have not been comprehensively addressed. The aim of this thesis was to develop new frameworks, and test approaches for the application of systematic conservation planning principles in the conservation of freshwater ecosystems in South Africa. The thesis addressed a range of issues along the systematic conservation planning continuum from biodiversity assessment to implementation. I first carried out a focused review of systematic conservation literature between 1987 - 2006, to gauge the extent to which freshwater ecosystems have being integrated in conservation assessments. Most of the focus was found to be on terrestrial ecosystems with minimal incorporation of freshwater biodiversity. Wetlands for example, were in most cases incorporated into conservation assessments without taking their diversity into account. This was partly attributed to the difficulty of classifying wetlands. I therefore developed and tested a hierarchical GIS framework for automating wetland classification as a strategy for incorporating wetland biodiversity, functions and benefits into broad scale conservation planning...|$|R

The city is located in a very arid catchment. Flooding of the city is influenced by the presence of three major tributaries that join the main channel in and around the heavily urbanized area. The Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (IMERG) rainfall product was used due to lack of detailed ground observations. To overcome the heavy computational demand, the <b>catchment</b> was <b>divided</b> into three sub-catchments with a variable model grid resolution. The model was run on three subcatchments separately, without losing hydrologic connectivity among the sub-catchments. Uncalibrated and calibrated satellite products were used producing different estimates of the predicted runoff. The runoff simulations demonstrated that 85 % of the flooding was generated in the urbanized portion of the catchments for the simulated flood. Additional model simulations were performed to understand the roles of the unique channel network in the city flooding. The simulations provided insights into the best options for flood mitigation efforts. The variable model grid size approach allowed using physically-based, distributed models—such as the Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) model used in this study—on large basins that include urban centers that need to be modeled at very high resolutions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Recent studies {{carried out}} in Lake Victoria Basin have {{identified}} major sources of Non-Point Source (NPS) of pollution in the Simiyu catchment of Lake Victoria using land-uses of 1975 and 2006 and compared the relative impact of land-use change on sediment and nutrient load (P and N) into the Lake. The main {{aim of this study}} was to identify and develop Best Management Practices to control NPS pollution in the Simiyu Catchment. The SWAT model was used to stimulate and assess the Best Management Practices Scenario for the catchment. The <b>catchment</b> was <b>divided</b> into seven (7) sub-basins. The results show that there was no intensive use of artifical fertilisers in the catchment and manure is the major type of fertiliser in use. Simulation was done for the period 2000 to 2005. High nutrient concentration was observed in Sub-basin 6; 0. 558 - 0. 779 kgN/ha/yr than in Sub-basin 7; 0. 018 - 0. 115 kgN/ha/yr, despite the larger area of coverage by the latter. This is also irrespective of the fact that Sub-basin 7 covers a larger area, 3, 426. 52 km 2 compared to Sub-basin 6 (72. 97 km 2) and Sub-basin 4 (618. 16 km 2). Relatively, considering their size, Sub-basin 6 produces higher pollution than Sub-basin 7. It was also observed that the sediment yield from the whole catchment reduced from 81, 222 ton/yr t...|$|R
40|$|The Saunders Creek is a {{tributary}} catchment for the River Murray which generates ephemeral {{flows in}} very wet years. Concerns have been expressed at {{the construction of}} large dams in {{the headwaters of the}} catchment, and their impacts on streamflow, and consequently recharge to aquifers. The <b>catchment</b> can be <b>divided</b> into two distinct groundwater regions: the Hills Zone and the Plains Zone. The Hills Zone comprises the consolidated basement rocks of the Mount Lofty Ranges, which form fractured rock aquifers. Borehole yields are generally low and salinities vary, apart from the western portion of the catchment where better quality water is drawn. The Plains Zone is underlain by unconsolidated sediments of the Murray Basin. The main aquifer is the Murray Group Limestone, which is utilised for domestic and stock purposes and is recharged mainly by infiltration of streamflow...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{forests and}} scrublands of the Taramakau <b>catchment</b> can be <b>divided</b> into six sub-climax {{associations}} and two seral associations. The sub-climax associations are st:. balpine scrub, bushline, rata-totara, red beech, silver beech and mountain beech forest. Except (or silver beech forest and mountain beech forest, which are largely {{restricted to the}} Otehake tributary, site differentiation between these associations is generally altitudinal. These sub-climax associations appear to be regenerating satisfactorily except. perhaps, for red beech forest {{where there is a}} slight regeneration gap. The two seral associations, kamahi forest and short scrub-hardwood forest, generally occur on unstable soils. Both show marked regeneration gaps which can be related to the presence of terrestrial browsing mammals. These two associations comprise over half the forest in the upper Taramakau and lower north Taramakau. and consequently the cc. ndition of these two areas must be regarded as critical...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{national}} and regional policy guidance on climate change adaptation relies on robust scientific evidence. This two-part series of papers develops and implements a novel scenario-neutral framework enabling {{an assessment of the}} vulnerability of flood flows in British catchments to climatic change, to underpin the development of guidance for the flood management community. In this first part, the sensitivity of the 20 -year return period flood peak (RP 20) to changes in precipitation (P), temperature (T) and potential evapotranspiration (PE) is systematically assessed for 154 catchments. A sensitivity domain of 4, 200 scenarios is applied combining 525 and 8 sets of P and T/PE mean monthly changes, respectively, with seasonality incorporated using a single-phase harmonic function. Using the change factor method, the percentage change in RP 20 associated with each scenario of the sensitivity domain is calculated, giving flood response surfaces for each catchment. Using a clustering procedure on the response surfaces, the 154 <b>catchments</b> are <b>divided</b> into nine groups: flood sensitivity types. These sensitivity types show that some catchments are (very) sensitive to changes in P but others buffer the response, while the location of catchments of the same type does not show any strong geographical pattern. These results reflect the range of hydrological processes found in Britain, and demonstrate the potential importance of catchment properties (physical and climatic) in the propagation of change in climate to change in floods, and so in characterising the sensitivity types (covered in the companion paper) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{preservation}} of water bodies from eutrophication implies accurate estimation of phosphorusand nitrogen loads {{and the control}} of nutrient production on a catchment scale. In this paper, a simple tool forthe modelling of annual nutrient loads is presented. It is implemented in ARC/INFO GIS using Arc MacroLanguage (AML). The use of a GIS is justified as the spatial characteristics of the catchment area (land use,industrial wastewater location) dictate water quality. The annual nutrient loads are worked out on thecatchment scale, using existing GIS routines together with specific routines developed in AML forhydrological and water quality modelling purposes. The <b>catchment</b> area is <b>divided</b> into hydrologicalsubcatchments with relatively homogeneous spatial characteristics. Each subcatchment is linked to aspecific nutrient export potential. These nutrient loads, calculated on a subcatchment-by-subcatchmentbasis, are conveyed to the outlet of the catchment and allow annual nutrient load estimation. A comparisonwith a water monitoring study is conducted to verify the adequation of modelling results for phosphorus andnitrogen loads...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for {{the determination of}} a dynamic hillslope instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) in concert with a variable saturation excess runoff production model using a grid-based digital elevation model (DEM). The total channel network responsible for routing the runoff produced on the <b>catchment</b> is <b>divided</b> into two parts: the main channel network and the hillslope channel network. The hillslope IUH, which routes water from the hillslopes to the main channel network, is essentially {{the solution of the}} linear advection-dispersion routing model weighted by the hillslope travel distance distribution of saturated pixels to the main channel network. The shape of the hillslope travel distance is found to consist of an initial spike, representing saturated pixels on the main channel network, and an exponential decay function for those pixels on the hillslope. However, the proportion of saturated pixels on the main channel network varies with total saturated pixels, causing an inverse change of scale of the spike and the exponential decay part. As the number of saturated pixels changes during a storm event, the hillslope IUH is dynamic. The main channel network IUH is also modelled by the linear advection-dispersion model weighted by the normalized width function of the main channel network. Convolution of the hillslope and main channel network IUHs gives the catchment IUH, which is also dynamically changing with the degree of saturation. It is demonstrated that the direct runoff hydrograph is sensitive to the variation of the degree of saturation within and between storm events...|$|R
