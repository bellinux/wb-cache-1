2500|$|Neuropsychological tests {{exist to}} measure deficits in {{cognitive}} functioning {{that can result}} from PCS. The Stroop <b>Color</b> <b>Test</b> and the 2&7 Processing Speed Test (which both detect deficits in speed of mental processing) can predict the development of cognitive problems from PCS. A test called the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire, a set of questions that measure the severity of 16 different post-concussion symptoms, can be self-administered or administered by an interviewer. [...] Other tests that can predict the development of PCS include the Hopkins Verbal Learning A test (HVLA) and the Digit Span Forward examination. [...] The HVLA tests verbal learning and memory by presenting a series of words and assigning points {{based on the number}} recalled, and digit span measures attention efficiency by asking the examinee to repeat back digits spoken by the tester in the same order as they are presented. [...] In addition, neuropsychological tests may be performed to detect malingering (exaggerating or making up symptoms) [...]|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the acute effects of physical exercise on specific cognitive functions immediately following an increase in cardiovascular activity. Stair-climbing exercise is used to increase the cardiovascular output of human subjects. The color-naming Stroop Test was used {{to identify}} the cognitive improvements in executive function with respect to processing speed and error rate. The study compared the Stroop results before and immediately after exercise and before and after nonexercise, as a control. The results {{show that there is}} a significant increase in processing speed and a reduction in errors immediately after less than 30 [*]min of aerobic exercise. The improvements are greater for the incongruent than for the congruent <b>color</b> <b>tests.</b> This suggests that physical exercise induces a better performance in a task that requires resolving conflict (or interference) than a task that does not. There is no significant improvement for the nonexercise control trials. This demonstrates that an increase in cardiovascular activity has significant acute effects on improving the executive function that requires conflict resolution (for the incongruent <b>color</b> <b>tests)</b> immediately following aerobic exercise more than similar executive functions that do not require conflict resolution or involve the attention-inhibition process (for the congruent <b>color</b> <b>tests)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a computerized <b>color</b> vision <b>testing</b> (Arden <b>color</b> contrast <b>test)</b> as a screening test for detection of diabetic macular edema (DME). Materials and Methods: A consecutive, prospective case series of 83 eyes of 42 diabetic patients with and without macular edema was enrolled. Macular edema was assessed clinically by stereoscopic grading and by central retinal thickness measurement with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, a computerized chromatest for the protan- and tritan-axis was performed. Analysis of test characteristics included receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated sensitivity and specificity. Results: Sixty-one eyes had clinically significant macular edema (CSME). OCT yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0. 92. <b>Color</b> vision <b>testing</b> yielded an AUC of 0. 82 for the tritan- and 0. 80 for the protan-axis. Using a cut off of 199 microns OCT resulted in a 100 % sensitivity at 39 % specificity. With a cut-off of 4. 85, <b>color</b> <b>testing</b> yielded a sensitivity of 100 % at a specificity of 8 % on the tritan-axis, respectively. Considering OCT instead of clinical examination as a reference standard resulted in a comparable high sensitivity, but low specificity for <b>color</b> vision <b>testing.</b> Disturbance of the tritan axis was more pronounced than for the protan axis in present macular edema and also better correlated (r = 0. 46) with retinal thickness measured with OCT. Conclusions: Computerized, quantitative <b>color</b> <b>testing</b> using the chromatest allows detection of diabetic maculopathy with high sensitivity. However, only a low specificity exists for retinal macular edema, as in diabetic retinopathy (DR) frequently abnormalities of the tritan axis exist before any retinal thickening occurs...|$|R
