40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>cooperative</b> <b>consultation</b> system on a restricted domain. The system builds hypotheses on the user's plan and avoids misunderstandings (with consequent repair dialogues) through clarification dialogues {{in case of}} ambiguity. The role played by constraints in the generation of the answer is characterized in order to limit the cases of ambiguities requiring a clarification dialogue. The answers of the system are generated {{at different levels of}} detail, according to file user's competence in the domain...|$|E

50|$|Unlike a {{commercial}} laundromat (laundrette), users {{do not pay}} per use. Maintenance and upgrade of the facilities is financed from the cooperative's funds, which mostly come from the general monthly fee paid by the households. Decisions on such expenditure are made by the <b>cooperative's</b> management. <b>Consultation</b> with the households (apartment owners) is only likely for larger investments. Some residents choose to install their own washing machine in their apartment instead of using the communal facilities. They will, however, continue {{to contribute to the}} financing of the communal facilities via the monthly fee.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{recent years}} out-of-hours primary {{care in the}} Netherlands has changed from practice-based to {{large-scale}} cooperatives. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine patient satisfaction with current out-of-hours care organised in general practitioner (GP) cooperatives, and gain insight in factors associated with this satisfaction. Methods From March to June 2003, 2805 questionnaires were sent to patients within three weeks after they had contacted the GP cooperative in their region. The study was conducted in the province of Limburg in the South of the Netherlands. One-third of these questionnaires was sent to patients who had only received telephone advice, one-third to patients who attended the GP <b>cooperative</b> for <b>consultation,</b> and one-third to patients who received a home visit. Four weeks after the first reminder, a non-respondents telephone interview was performed among a random sample of 100 patients. Analyses were performed with respect to the type of consultation. Results The total response was 42. 4 % (1160 / 2733). Sixty-seven percent of patients who received telephone advice only reported to be satisfied with out-of-hours care. About 80 % of patients who went to the GP <b>cooperative</b> for <b>consultation</b> or those receiving a home visit, reported to be satisfied. Factors that were strongly associated with overall satisfaction included, the doctor's assistant's attitude on the phone, opinion on GP's treatment, and waiting time. Conclusion Patients seem generally satisfied with out-of-hours primary care as organised in GP cooperatives. However, patients who received telephone advice only are less satisfied compared to those who attended the GP cooperative or those who received a home visit. </p...|$|R
40|$|Third party policing' {{describes}} police {{efforts to}} persuade or coerce third parties, such as landlords, parents, {{local governments and}} other regulators, and business owners, to take some responsibility for preventing crime or reducing crime problems. In third party policing, the police create crime control guardians in locations or situations where crime control guardianship was previously absent. Sometimes this results from <b>cooperative</b> <b>consultation</b> with community members. At other times, the police use coercive threats, {{with the backing of}} a range of civil and regulatory laws, to engage third parties into taking some crime control responsibility. Our paper describes the dimensions of third party policing and identifies its prospects and challenges, including its implications for regulators.

40|$|Since 1993, the Administration has {{negotiated}} and Congress {{has approved}} 13 free trade agreements (FTAs) with labor provisions, and is considering additional FTAs. Based on similarity of language, these FTAs can be sorted into four groups, or “models,” which {{have evolved to}} contain successively greater levels of enforceability. This report first identifies the enforceable labor provisions in each model. Second, it identifies two types of labor enforcement issues: (1) those {{that relate to the}} FTA provisions themselves, including their definitions and their enforceability, and (2) those that relate to executive branch responsibilities, such as resource availability and determining dispute settlement case priorities.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Research {{and reform}} in special {{education}} {{has focused on the}} inclusion of students with disabilities in general education settings. Collaboration and consultation strategies, including cooperative teaching and <b>cooperative</b> <b>consultation,</b> are among the strategies being used to facilitate integration. Site-based management and shared decision-making are now being used widely in the general education community to bring about school improvement. An opportunity exists for aligning reform efforts {{in special education}} and general education. In this paper we review the philosophical, political, policy challenges encountered in the institution of collaborative teaching for serving students with disabilities in public schools engaged in substantive general education reform. Strategies for confronting and overcoming these challenges are also presented, as well as research methods for collecting evaluative data. ESOURCE ROOM pull-out programs remain the ost frequently used service delivery system for serving students with mild disabili...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to introduce, based on own practical experiences, an approach to agricultural policy research that is based on intensive interaction with groups of farmers, and to discuss to which extent participation is realised in this process. This approach consists of panels of farmers, scientists and agricultural advisors. In group meetings development strategies of typical organic farms and the farms reaction to changes in the policy environment are discussed on a regular base. Farmers are consulted on their opinion and define potential farm development strategies in a cooperative manner, whereas the scientist analyses data. The potentials of this <b>cooperative</b> approach of <b>consultation</b> are discussed in the light of research objectives and the benefits and input requirements of participants...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{high-speed}} internet bandwidth consuming video conferencing applications will rapidly become attractive to e-patients seeking real-time video consultations from e-doctors. In a conventional system patients connect to a known server in a medical center of his choice. If the server (i. e. a server via which a medical consultant communicates with a patient) is busy, the patient must wait before the server becomes free. Such a system is not efficient as many patients in medical centers with busy servers may either have to wait long, or are simply turned away. Patients may also leave when they become impatient. Not only the patients suffer due to server unavailability, medical service providers also incur revenue losses due to lost patients. To counter these problems, we propose a distributed <b>cooperative</b> Video <b>Consultation</b> on Demand (VCoD) system where servers are located in many different medical centers in different neighbourhoods close to patient concentrations. In such a cooperative system if patients find their nearby servers under heavy load they are automatically directed to servers that are least loaded by using efficient server selection method (also called anycasting). Simple numerical analysis shows that this not only maximizes revenues for medical service providers by reducing number of lost patients, but also improves average response time for e-patients...|$|R
40|$|Paranasal {{sinusitis}} {{is widespread}} {{and can lead}} to orbital complications, blindness, and death. However, the correlation between ophthalmological findings and disease staging remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the staging, acute ophthalmological manifestations, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of orbital complications of paranasal sinusitis during a 27 -year period. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients with orbital complications of paranasal sinusitis hospitalized at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital, a medical center in Taiwan during 1988 - 2015. Sex, age, symptoms, history, ophthalmological findings, laboratory and imaging findings, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed by staging. Eighty-three patients aged 9 days to 80 years had stage I (preseptal cellulitis, n = 39 patients), II (postseptal orbital cellulitis, n = 8), III (subperiosteal abscess, n = 16), IV (orbital abscess, n = 8), or V (intracranial involvement, n = 12) complications. Peak incidences occurred in patients aged 0 - 19 and 60 - 69 years. Chronic sinusitis and diabetes mellitus were common preexisting diseases. Extraocular movement limitation and proptosis predicted postseptal (stage II or more) involvement. The likelihood of elevated intraocular pressure increased with stage. Reduced visual acuity and presence of relative afferent pupillary defect indicated consideration of magnetic resonance imaging to investigate possible intracranial extension. Ipsilateral maxillary (81. 7 %) and ethmoidal (75. 6 %) sinuses were the most common sources of infection, and the most frequently implicated pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (25. 3 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (20. 5 %). All patients received intravenous antimicrobial therapy (multi-drug therapy in 88. 0 %), and 55. 4 % underwent surgery, most commonly endoscopic sinus surgery. One (1. 2 %) diabetic man with stage V complications died of fungal sinusitis with intracranial invasion. Five (6. 0 %) patients, all stage V, lost vision despite intensive treatment. The average length of hospital stay was 13. 8 days (range 2 - 72 days), and significantly longer stays were associated with stages II-V as compared to stage I. Orbital infection originating from paranasal sinusitis can cause vision loss and death due to intracranial extension. Acute ophthalmological findings predict staging and prognosis. <b>Cooperative</b> <b>consultation</b> between ophthalmologists, otorhinolaryngologists, and neurologists is essential. Urgent diagnostic studies and aggressive antimicrobial therapy are indicated, and surgery should be considered...|$|E
