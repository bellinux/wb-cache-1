We show that structure learning is successful when the <b>causal</b> <b>systems</b> in question are consistent with people’s expectations that causal relationships are deterministic and that each pattern of observations has a single underlying cause.

40|$|The {{invariance}} under interventions –account of causal explanation {{imposes a}} modularity constraint on causal systems: a local intervention on {{a part of}} the system should not change other causal relations in that system. This constraint has generated criticism against the account, since many ordinary <b>causal</b> <b>systems</b> seem to break this condition. This paper answers to this criticism by noting that explanatory models are always models of specific causal structures, not <b>causal</b> <b>systems</b> as a whole, and that models of causal structures can have different modularity properties which determine what can and what cannot be explained with the model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{deals with}} {{structural}} properties {{of a class}} of strictly <b>causal</b> <b>systems.</b> It is shown that a special physically correct internal structure of a given system representation caled dissipation normal form can be derived as a natural consequence of strict causality, dissipativity, minimality and asymptotic stability requirements. A generalization of classic Tellegen’s theorem together with bi-orthonormal basis of the state velocity space expressing the signal energy conservation law for abstract system state space representations have been used. It is demonstrated by examples that the resulting structure represents a unifying tool for analysis and synthesis of a relatively general class of linear as well as nonlinear <b>causal</b> <b>systems.</b> Key-Words:- energy-metric function, bi-orthonormal basis, dissipation normal form, Tellegen’s principle, non-linear phenomena, instability, chaotic behavior...|$|R
