40|$|The gut {{microbiome}} is {{a highly}} complex microbial community that strongly impacts human health and disease. The two dominant phyla in healthy humans are Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, with minor phyla such as Proteobacteria having elevated abundances in various disease states. While the gut microbiome has been widely studied, relatively {{little is known about}} the role of interspecies interactions in promoting microbiome stability and function. We developed a biofilm metabolic model of a very simple gut microbiome community consisting of a representative bacteroidete (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron), firmicute (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and proteobacterium (Escherichia coli) to investigate the putative role of metabolic byproduct <b>cross</b> <b>feeding</b> between species on community stability, robustness and flexibility. The model predicted coexistence of the three species only if four essential cross-feeding relationships were present. We found that <b>cross</b> <b>feeding</b> allowed coexistence to be robustly maintained for large variations in biofilm thickness and nutrient levels. However, the model predicted that community composition and short chain fatty acid levels could be strongly affected only over small ranges of byproduct uptake rates, indicating a possible lack of flexibility in our cross-feeding mechanism. Our model predictions provide new insights into the impact of byproduct <b>cross</b> <b>feeding</b> and yield experimentally testable hypotheses about gut microbiome community stability...|$|R

Towards the end of the trial, a higher concentration of salt (up to 24  %) was used with daily dosing for a period of 2  min.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report in a study {{examining}} the impact of launch vehicles for various boost propulsion design options. These options included: differing boost phase engines using different combinations of fuels and coolants to include RP- 1, methane, propane (subcooled and normal boiling point), and hydrogen; variable and high mixture ratio hydrogen engines; translating nozzles on boost phase engines; and <b>cross</b> <b>feeding</b> propellants from the booster to second stage. Vehicles examined included a fully reusable two stage cargo vehicle and a single stage to orbit vehicle. The use of subcooled propane as a fuel generated vehicles with the lowest total vehicle dry mass. Engines with hydrogen cooling generated only slight mass reductions from the reference, all-hydrogen vehicle. <b>Cross</b> <b>feeding</b> propellants generated the most significant mass reductions from the reference two stage vehicle. The use of high mixture ratio or variable mixture ratio hydrogen engines in the boost phase of flight resulted in vehicles with total dry mass 20 percent greater than the reference hydrogen vehicle. Translating nozzles for boost phase engines generated a heavier vehicle. Also examined were the design impacts on the vehicle and ground support subsystems when subcooled propane {{is used as a}} fuel. The most significant cost difference between facilities to handle normal boiling point versus subcooled propane is 5 million dollars. Vehicle cost differences were negligible.

40|$|Many {{continuous}} {{industrial processes}} {{can be controlled}} using programmable automation controllers for digital implementation of classical PID control. For this type of applications, a PID control block has been developed {{for use in the}} programming environment PCWorkx. In the lecture two types of PID control of tank level are discussed: single point control and cascade control. The single point control uses a single PID controller to regulate tank level using a single measurement for feedback being tank level itself. The PID controller output determines the state of the <b>feed</b> <b>valve.</b> The system has limitations in reacting to variations in output flow, which is to be regarded as a system disturbance. The cascade control uses two PID controllers for a better performance of the level control. The master controller is the level controller using the level setpoint and measurement to determine the setpoint for the slave controller driving the input flow valve. Measurements of input and output flow are taken into account, enabling the system to faster respond to ouput flow disturbances. Both types of control can be implemented using the PID control block in PCWorkx for programming a Phoenix Contact ILC. status: publishe...|$|R
