25|$|Late on 10 August, the 3rd Guards Tank {{was ordered}} to be {{withdrawn}} from the front and concentrated {{in the area of}} Kalinov, Maslovo, and Apalkovo for reorganization and replenishment. On the night of 10–11 August, the army handed over its positions to the 13th Army's infantry units and moved to the rear in the specified concentration areas. Early on 12 August, the army was placed under the overall command of the 13th Army's commander, Nikolay Pukhov, who ordered it to form a <b>combined</b> <b>tank</b> brigade in each tank corps, intending to continue the assault on 13 August in the sector of 13th Army's 15th Rifle Corps. However, this was changed and on 13 August the 3rd Guards Tank was instead withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK), ending the army and the corps' fighting in Operation Kutuzov. By 17 August, it had been concentrated in the area of Maslovo, Zhuravlino, Nikolayevka, Panin, Petrik, and Tsvetovo, south of Kursk, receiving replacement personnel and equipment.|$|E

The fort was not occupied long for lack of troops and equipment but demolition parties visited each night to destroy Italian ammunition and vehicles. For the rest of June, the British patrolled to the north, south and west and began the Siege of Giarabub. The Italian 10th Army concentrated in the area from Bardia to Tobruk and brought forward the Maletti Group, a <b>combined</b> <b>tank,</b> infantry and artillery force, equipped with a company of Fiat M11/39 medium tanks, superior to the older L3/33 tankettes.|$|E
2500|$|On higher ground, the Germans {{continued}} to inflict many losses on the British divisions beyond Langemarck but on 19 August, after two fine dry days, XVIII Corps conducted a novel infantry, tank, aircraft and artillery operation and captured German strongpoints and pillboxes along the St Julien–Poelcappelle {{road in front}} of the Wilhelm Stellung. On 22 August, more ground was gained by XIX and XVIII corps but they remained overlooked by the Germans. A II Corps attack on the Gheluvelt Plateau from 22 to 24 August, to capture Nonne Bosschen, Glencorse Wood and Inverness Copse, failed and was costly to both sides. Gough laid down a new infantry formation of skirmish lines to be followed by [...] "worms" [...] on 24 August and Cavan noted that pillboxes should be attacked on a broad front, to engage them simultaneously. Another general offensive intended for 25 August, was delayed by the failure of the preliminary attacks and then postponed due to more bad weather.

50|$|The five-month-long {{war between}} the Soviet Union and the Japanese 6th Army at Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) in 1939 brought home some lessons. In this conflict, the Soviets fielded over two {{thousand}} tanks, to the around 73 cannon armed tanks deployed by the Japanese, the major difference being that Japanese armour were equipped with diesel engines {{as opposed to the}} Russian tanks equipped with petrol engines. After General Georgy Zhukov inflicted a defeat on the Japanese 6th Army with his massed <b>combined</b> <b>tank</b> and air attack, the Soviets learned a lesson on the use of gasoline engines, and quickly incorporated those newly found experiences into their new T-34 medium tank during World War II.|$|E

50|$|After {{the heights}} near Tskhinvali were secured, Georgian {{military}} and police moved into the city. Their assault was supported by artillery and tanks. Georgia says that the entry to Tskhinvali took place at 06:00 AM. The Russian peacekeepers' southern compound, manned by about 250 soldiers, laid in immediate vicinity of {{the entrance to the}} town. After Georgian troops approached the compound, an exchange of fire with Russian peacekeepers broke out. Georgian Cobra vehicles opened fire at the base with heavy machine guns. In response the Russians positioned three BMP-1 vehicles at the perimeter of the base. The Georgians then called in tank support and shortly after three T-72s from the Independent <b>Combined</b> <b>Tank</b> Battalion arrived. At 6:30, the tanks opened fire. The first shell destroyed an observation post {{on the roof of the}} compound, killing a Russian peacekeeper and a South Ossetian observer who were directing mortar fire against the advancing Georgian infantry. The tanks also shelled the three Russian BMP-1 vehicles stationed in front of the base, killing five of their crews and destroying the IFVs in the process. Among those dead were soldiers from the Russian 135th Motorized Infantry Regiment. During the engagement, one of the Georgian tanks, which was damaged by an RPG-7 rocket, became trapped in an irrigation ditch near the compound and was abandoned by its crew. The other two tanks pulled back and continued shelling the compound from a distance, and were soon joined by artillery and mortars. One Russian T-72B3 got abandoned and destroyed as a result of shelling next to the Peacekeepers barracks. By 08:00 AM on 8 August, Georgian infantry and tanks had entered Tskhinvali and engaged in a fierce battle with Ossetian militia and the Russian peacekeeping battalion stationed in the city. 1,500 Georgian ground troops had reached the centre of Tskhinvali by 10 AM on 8 August.|$|E

50|$|France, {{as well as}} Japan, used overly simplistic {{assumptions}} and calculations in assessing the 1939 situation with Germany. Army manpower and equipment were roughly equal, with a slight advantage to France. French tanks, individually, were superior in weapons and protection to their German equivalent. German air power, however, was nearly double that of France. At its highest governmental levels, France {{did not understand the}} way in which Germany would <b>combine</b> <b>tanks</b> and aircraft, closely coordinated, and drive quickly into the rear, with German infantry securing the breaches. Ironically, a fairly junior officer, named Charles de Gaulle, had described just such tactics as Heinz Guderian conceived in Blitzkrieg.|$|R

40|$|The {{generation}} of power-clocks in adiabatic integrated circuits is investigated. Specifically, we consider stepwise charging strategies (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 -step) based on tank-capacitor circuits, comparing {{them in terms}} of their energy recovery properties and complexity. We show that energy recovery achievable depends on the tank-capacitor size. We also show that tank-capacitor sizes can be reduced as their number increases concluding that <b>combined</b> <b>tank</b> capacitance (CTT) versus load capacitance (CL) ratio is the significant parameter. We propose that using a CTT/CL ratio of 10 and using a 4 -step charging power-clock constitute appropriate trade-offs in practical circuits...|$|E
50|$|A <b>combined</b> storage <b>tank</b> <b>combines</b> {{hot water}} storage both for heating support and {{drinking}} water heating in a larger tank. As a result, warm water, typically from solar thermal energy, is stored temporarily for both purposes for later consumption. Breaks in sunshine can thus be bridged without any additional heating, depending on the heating requirement and storage size. This generally takes up less space than two individual buffer tanks and thermal losses are thereby reduced. These storage tanks are mostly insulated {{on the outside and}} designed for the lowest possible heat losses. Usually, it is a tank-in-tank system, that is, a two-compartment system arranged one inside the other. It is thus a <b>combined</b> buffer storage <b>tank</b> with a heat exchange plate in between. Above is a smaller interior tank for drinking water, i.e. water for showers, washing etc. and around it on the outside is a much larger storage volume for heating water for room heating.|$|R

2500|$|The tankini is a {{swimsuit}} <b>combining</b> a <b>tank</b> top, mostly made of spandex-and-cotton or Lycra-and-nylon, and {{a bikini}} bottom {{introduced in the}} late 1990s. According to author William Safire, [...] "The most recent evolution of the -kini family is the tankini, a cropped tank top supported by spaghetti-like strings." [...] The tankini is distinguished from the classic bikini by the difference in tops, {{the top of the}} tankini essentially being a tank top. The tankini top extends downward to somewhere between just above the navel and the top of the hips. The word is a neologism <b>combining</b> the <b>tank</b> of tank top {{with the end of the}} word bikini. This go-between nature of tankini has rendered its name to things ranging from a lemonade-based martini (Tankini Martini) to server architecture (Tankini HipThread). This type of swimwear is considered by some to provide modesty closer to that of a one piece suit but with the convenience of a two piece suit, such as not needing to remove the entire suit in order to use a lavatory.|$|R
