40|$|National audienceThe {{structures}} {{discussed here}} have been excavated on the site called “Portes de Provence” at Montélimar. They {{are part of the}} <b>Chassean</b> great site called the “Gournier”. This contribution focuses on two adjacent pits who are very isolated on the site. One of them contains a burial, wich offers all the caracteristics of the burials deposed in “domestic” pits within the <b>Chassean</b> Culture. The other one contained within its filling an anthropomorphic and notched pebble included in an original composition. We argue that the components of these two pits are part of a scenography understandable at the scale of the whole site, as it is still been proposed for sites of the middle-Rhône valley (Beeching 2003). In this particular case, we propose to associate the notched pebble and the burial, because of its morphological particularity (which evokes the lemanic “statues-menhirs”), its integration within a performance with other elements, its proximity with the dead (although it is deposed in a special place), and the isolation of both structures, sign of their spatial link. All these elements echoes the funeral and symbolic manifestations known in the cultures of the Middle and recent Neolithic in the Rhône basin. At least, although the strict transposition of the symbolic meanings known in ethographic contexts is impossible, we can ask if this small “statue‑menhir” could not embody the dead himself, or recall its ascendants, its sacrifice or its reception in a beyond. It is not unconceivable that this device was itself a kind of burial, i. e. a cenotaph. Les structures qui font l’objet de cet article ont été fouillées sur le site dit des « Portes de Provence » à Montélimar et se rattachent au vaste ensemble chasséen du Gournier. Elles concernent plus précisément deux fosses qui sont contiguës et visiblement très isolées dans le site. L’une d’entre elles contient une sépulture, dont les différentes composantes intègrent bien les manifestations des sépultures en fosses « domestiques » du Chasséen. L’autre a livré, dans son comblement, un galet encoché anthropomorphe, inclus dans une composition originale à travers plusieurs évocations de l’univers funéraire et symbolique du Néolithique moyen et récent rhodanien, nous proposons une complémentarité entre les deux structures, voire une relation étroite, peut-être pas tout à fait étrangère aux manifestations mégalithiques péri-alpines...|$|E
40|$|The site of Mount Bego {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} rock art concentrations in Europe for recent Prehistory. After a study conducted for more than 45 years by Henry de Lumley, the majority of the 4, 000 engraved rocks have been positioned and the near 36, 000 engravings have been drawn. The engravings were firstly attributed to Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age, on the basis of a comparison between the engraved weapons and real weapons that have been discovered in an archaeological context. During his PhD (2012), the author carried out the first systematic geostatistical analysis of the entire corpus, bringing out a series of effects (iconographic and geographic seriation, preferential location, etc.) in the engravings distribution. Thanks to the study of superimpositions, these quantitative results allow to consider a periodization of the main families of engravings. While weapon representations appear to be the most recent layer of engravings, reticulated figures and schematic horned figures seem to be the most ancient ones. Therefore, dating on the basis of weapon representations can no longer be considered valid for the entire corpus of engravings. Besides, Mount Bego site shows early occupations, as documented by archaeological artefacts (Cardial ceramics, <b>Chassean</b> flints, Recent Bell Beaker ceramics, etc.) and indices of human activities (certain since ca. 2400 - 1800 BC). This article presents the geostatistical predicates, methods (unimodality of realization periods of engraved themes, correlations, seriation, toposeriation, etc.) and principal results on which a first periodization frame has been built...|$|E
40|$|National audienceThe {{grouping}} {{of the dead}} in the Manduel well grave seems to correspond to an unusual episode of mortality However, the operation {{was carried out in}} a rather conventional way compared to the known disposal of the dead in the domestic sphee of the southern domain during the Middle Neolithic. In fact, since a grave well cannot be compared symbolically with a cereal storage structure, it is nevertheless possible that, in this case, because of some unexpected event, the disposal could have been of a pressing nature. In concrete terms, a little more place than usual would all the same be needed to deposit these eight bodies within a very short time. In view {{of the nature of the}} small amount of sedimentation in the lower layers, this well had either been abandoned shortly before, or directly diverted from its primary function for the burial. The first intentional filling probably corresponds to a preparation, to protect the first deposit from water or to raise the ground level for the burying work, i. e. showing an attention or technical concern related to the emplacement of the bodies. However, this does not mean that this preparation was an efficient act from a sanitary point of view in the medium term, since the decomposition of corpses would have an effect on the ground water that would prevent use of the site for a long period; this fact could not have been ignored by the group carrying out the burial. 2 The first body deposited is that of an adult, while the last corresponds to a large child, but there appears to be no particular order of arrival between the adults and the children. The deposits were carried out over a very short time (loss of general volume, overlap of the bones, etc.). The osteological reconstructions and analyses do not leave any doubt about the fact that the bodies, and particularly the adults, were oriented and arranged. Indeed, the adults are oriented according to a South-North axis, with their heads towards the south. Two of the adults are on their back, even though the first to be placed in the grave was dorsoventrally arranged. The lower limbs are bent, with the body lying on the right or left side. The positions of the children are more difficult to restore because of difficulties arising from osteological determinations. To a certain extent, the young individuals could have been laid out at random, but the craniums are all rather regularly spaced and thus seem to be arranged as a crown against the wall. The two oldest children are lying on their right side and have their lower limbs bent, like those of the adults. All the individuals showing a clearly identifiable position were thus the subject of a codified arrangement, which could have posed a challenge due to the small size (0. 95 m) and depth (> 2. 50 m) of the structure, as well as the concomitant nature of the deposits. 3 The abundance of macro-tools is inseparably linked to burial practices associated with the domestic well of the <b>Chassean</b> culture. Moreover, as in the case of the Manduel grave well, it is far from exceptional to find broken and heated goods in close relation with the corpses, although the significance of these deposits remains obscure. Here, complete grinding stones are almost entirely absent (a single occurrence out of a MNI composed of thirty-nine items), so it is impossible to say whether they are fragments of residual objects collected in an opportunist way or whole elements that were subsequently damaged for the mortuary deposit. 4 In conclusion, while the rapid succession in time of the deposits clearly reflects an atypical episode of mortality concerning adults and children from a more extensive group, the handling of the burial is expressed through a common semantics in the cultural sphere. This structure corresponds rather well to what we call a burial, because it relates to a broad category of funerary practice in domestic pits from habitation sites located on plains. The care taken with the treatment of the corpses is in line with this hypothesis, since the bodies were laid out and oriented in spite of the severe constraints, which bears witness to an evident respect for the dead.
