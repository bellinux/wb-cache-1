2500|$|Photoluminescent fire {{extinguisher}} signs {{are made with}} nontoxic photoluminescent phosphor that absorbs ambient light and releases it slowly in dark conditions—the sign [...] "glows in the dark". Such signs are independent of an external power supply, and so offer a low-cost, reliable means of indicating the position of emergency equipment in dark or smoky conditions. The luminance performance for life safety appliance location signs should {{meet the requirements of}} International Standard ISO 17398 so that the sign is not only excited at very low ambient light levels (25 lux), but also has effective luminance intensity and longevity, making the life-safety message conspicuous in the event of power failure, or if smoke obscures emergency <b>ceiling</b> <b>lights.</b> The Photoluminescent Safety Products Association (PSPA) has guidance classifications for luminance performance to help users with applications under [...] "International Maritime Organization Emergency Equipment and Life-saving Appliance Location Requirements," [...] and worldwide industrial fire-safety management requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Lakeside Hall was {{converted}} into a new ballroom which could seat 4,000 people. Service space between the Great Hall and Lakeside Hall {{was converted}} into a new lobby, with staircase access to the surface above. The contemporarily-styled lobby had an illuminated ceiling the mimicked a skylight. The steel columns in the space were plastered, and one bare concrete wall covered with a new decoration of sculpted glass block and stone. A corner kiosk in the lobby doubled as a registration desk and a bar. A new monumental staircase, echoing {{the look of the}} staircase in Public Auditorium, was built to connect the lobby with the new banquet hall. Rather than the traditional plush look, the ballroom space was designed with an industrial feel that helped unite it visually with the Great Hall. Industrial <b>ceiling</b> <b>lights,</b> covered in Teflon fabric and perforated metal wall sconces helped to light the space. The walls remained raw concrete. To help eliminate the underground feel of the space, the north wall with its three-door railroad loading dock was removed, and a new glass curtain wall installed. [...] To improve the view of Lake Erie beyond, a retaining wall outside the facility was lowered. Service space in Lakeside Hall was {{converted into a}} large catering kitchen to serve the ballroom.|$|E

50|$|The {{power control}} in a C-Bus system {{lies in a}} “Dimmer” or “Relay” which is {{installed}} in the DB and replaces the traditional switch used in conventional wiring. This Dimmer (or Relay) has a 120/220V Line interconnection directly to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>light</b> and a neutral connection back from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>light</b> to the Dimmer. The Dimmer will control the light directly and will receive its commands from another device on the C-Bus network (for example, a wall mounted light switch/keypad). This wall mounted light switch would not be connected to any load whatsoever; it would be directly connected with the Dimmer {{by means of a}} control/signaling cable. The Dimmers normally come as 4-, 8- or 12-channel DIN-rail mounted devices.|$|R
