40|$|INTRODUCTION 2. When <b>cell</b> <b>suppression</b> {{is used as}} a Statistical Disclosure Control Technique, table {{cells are}} suppressed, if the data disseminator {{considers}} them revealing too much. To prevent these so-called "primary suppressions", or "sensitive" cells from exact disclosure or a too narrow estimation from the additive relationship between the cells of the table, additional cells must be suppressed. 3. The "Secondary <b>Cell</b> <b>Suppression</b> Problem" is to apply these complementary suppressions to the set of sensitive cells, {{in such a way as}} to ensure that the complementary suppressions:. create the required uncertainty about the true values of the sensitive cells while still. preserving as much information in the table as possible.

Rhesus macaque CMV homologues, denoted Rh-vICA and Rh-vMIA, {{were identified}} and found to suppress apoptosis. One of these functions was conserved in MCMV, encoded by the M 36 gene and denoted M-vICA. Conserved regions were compared to domains important to vICA- and vMIA-mediated <b>cell</b> death <b>suppression.</b> The conserved sequences of primate CMV vMIA homologues overlapped with the two known functional domains, providing further evidence supporting a crucial role of vMIA in <b>cell</b> death <b>suppression.</b> RNA blot analyses revealed that expression of murine and rhesus macaque CMV UL 36 and UL 37 homologues started early and continued through late times of infection.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the problem of {{protecting}} large published statistical tables using <b>cell</b> <b>suppression.</b> Optimal <b>cell</b> <b>suppression</b> {{has been shown to}} be NP-Hard and can therefore only be applied to small tables. Using heuristic techniques to protect large tables tends to suppress far too many table cells lessening the utility of the table. Current state-of-the- art <b>cell</b> <b>suppression</b> algorithms can protect statistical tables with up to forty thousand cells. In this thesis a new model is derived that can fully protect statistical tables with up to one million cells without excessive over-suppression. This has been achieved by creating a new mathematical model that can protect cells in groups rather than individually. A pre-processing step was also introduced to reduce the number of cells that actually need to be protected. Further improvements have been gained through the employment of a self-adaptive Genetic Algorithm to optimise the order in which the groups of cells are protected and the employment of a surrogate fitness function to reduce execution time.

40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>suppression</b> {{has been}} a {{commonly}} used method at the Census Bureau and at other agencies for protecting sensitive cells in statistical tables whose cells contain magnitude data. In this method, the sensitivity of each cell depends {{on the distribution of}} the respondent values which are summed to form the cell value. Those cells determined to be sensitive are suppressed and then a <b>cell</b> <b>suppression</b> program is run to determine which additional cells (called secondary suppressions) need to be suppressed {{in order to protect the}} sensitive ones. In this study, we compare two ways of protecting sensitive cells and their effects on the suppression patterns, i. e., the set of secondary ones. These ways are (1) fixed interval protection and (2) sliding protection. In studies done over a decade ago by researchers at the University of Maryland, it was shown that sliding protection often leads to fewer secondary suppressions than fixed interval protection.
