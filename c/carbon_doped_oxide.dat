40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{suitability}} of manganese silicate (MnSiO 3) as a possible copper interconnect diffusion barrier layer on both a 5. 4 nm thick thermally grown SiO 2 and a low dielectric constant <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> <b>oxide</b> (CDO), with the focus of understanding the barrier formation process. The self forming nature of this diffusion barrier layer resulting from the chemical interaction of deposited Mn with the insulating substrate has potential application in future generations of copper interconnect technologies as they are significantly thinner than the conventional deposited barrier layers. The principle technique used to study the interface chemistry resulting from the interaction of deposited manganese with the insulating substrates to form a MnSiO 3 layer was x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements provided information {{on the structure of}} the barrier layers which could be correlated with the XPS results. Significant differences in the extent of the interface interaction which resulted {{in the formation of the}} MnSiO 3 barrier layer were found to depend on whether the deposited Mn was partially oxidised. The studies performed on the 5. 4 nm thermally grown SiO 2 confirmed that the growth of the MnSiO 3 resulted in a corresponding reduction in the SiO 2 layer thickness. Interactions between residual metallic Mn and subsequently deposited copper layers were also investigated and showed that in order to reduce the width of the barrier layer, it was preferable that all the deposited Mn was fully incorporated into the silicate. TEM measurements were also used to investigate thicker thermally deposited Mn/Cu heterostructures on SiO 2 which were subsequently annealed in order to study the diffusion interactions between copper and manganese.

40|$|We {{report a}} simple {{process for the}} {{selective}} deposition of copper films on RuO 2, while no Cu nucleation occurs on thermal SiO 2 or porous <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> <b>oxide</b> (CDO). Using the precursor Cu(hfac) VTMS, selectivity is attained by adding a co-flow of excess VTMS {{to act as a}} growth inhibitor. With precursor alone, 52 nm of Cu grows on RuO 2; on CDO or on thermal SiO 2, nucleation is delayed such that 41 or 1. 3 nm are deposited, respectively. Repeating the experiment with the co-flow of VTMS affords a 12 nm thick Cu film on RuO 2 with roughness of 1. 8 nm. But on CDO or thermal SiO 2, the Cu deposition is only 0. 10 or ∼ 0. 04 nm, respectively. AFM scans of the CDO and SiO 2 surfaces are identical to the bare substrates. The small quantity of Cu that is deposited must be finely distributed, presumably on defect sites; it can be etched to below the RBS detection limit using a co-flow of Hhfac and VTMS for few minutes {{at the end of the}} growth. The process window is wide: selective growth occurs for a range of VTMS pressures (0. 5 – 2. 0 mTorr), growth times (up to 90 min), and growth temperatures (up to 180 ◦C) ...|$|E

40|$|Fluoride based {{chemical}} systems {{are widely used}} at various stages in microelectronic processing, particularly for wet cleaning and etching applications. Some examples {{include the use of}} semi aqueous fluoride (SAF) solutions in back end of line cleaning, the use of dilute HF solutions as etchants for SiO 2 and HF-HNO 3 or HF-H 2 O 2 solutions as isotropic etchants for silicon. In this work, the use of fluoride based solutions for two applications relevant to semiconductor processing are considered. In {{the first part of the}} study, cleaning of post plasma etch residues generated during fabrication of copper damascene structures was investigated in semi aqueous fluoride (SAF) formulations based on dimethyl sulfoxide and ammonium fluoride. Formulations designed for residue removal should be able to remove the residue effectively, without causing critical dimension loss during the process cycle. A systematic evaluation of solution variables (solvent content and pH) was conducted and the extent of removal of model copper oxide films and selectivity over copper and <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> <b>oxide</b> (CDO) films were used as metrics to evaluate the formulations. Results of the study indicate that the presence of solvent is necessary to achieve reasonable etch selectivity over dielectric films. Additionally, a removal end point detection technique based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was developed, which could potentially help in the optimization of cleaning time with minimal dielectric loss. This method was applied to monitor the removal of copper oxide films as well as residue from patterned test structures. In the second part of the study, electrochemical formation of porous silicon films in hydrofluoric acid (HF) solutions was investigated, for potential applications in advanced packaging. Specifically, porous silicon formation in solution mixtures containing HF, acetic acid and peroxide, was studied. The effect of variables including current density, substrate resistivity, HF, acetic acid and peroxide concentration, on key porous film characteristics such as growth rate, porosity and microstructure, was explored. Addition of peroxide was found to significantly increase the porosity and growth rate of the film, as a result of enhanced chemical dissolution and films with porosities as high as 95 % were obtained. Additionally, in solutions containing peroxide, a variety of microstructural features, such as nanopores, micron sized pores, truncated pyramidal structures and silicon needles were observed, under various fabrication conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{shift to}} the Cu/low-k {{interconnect}} scheme requires the development of diffusion barrier/adhesion promoter materials that provide excellent performance in preventing the diffusion and intermixing of Cu into the adjacent dielectrics. The integration of Cu with low-k materials may decrease RC delays in signal propagation but pose additional problems because such materials are often porous and contain significant amounts of carbon. Therefore barrier metal diffusion into the dielectric {{and the formation of}} interfacial carbides and oxides are of significant concern. The objective of the present research is to investigate the fundamental surface interactions between diffusion barriers and various low-k dielectric materials. Two major diffusion barriers¾ tatalum (Ta) and titanium nitride (TiN) are prepared by DC magnetron sputtering and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), respectively. Surface analytical techniques, such as X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) are employed. Ta sputter-deposited onto a Si-O-C low dielectric constant substrate forms a reaction layer composed of Ta oxide and TaC. The composition of the reaction layer varies with deposition rate (1 Å-min- 1 vs. 2 Å-sec- 1), but in both cases, the thickness of the TaC layer is found to be at least 30 Å on the basis of XPS spectra, which is corroborated with cross-sectional TEM data. Sputter-deposited Cu will not wet the TaC layer and displays facile agglomeration, even at 400 K. Deposition for longer time at 2 Å-sec- 1 results in formation of a metallic Ta layer. Sputter deposited Cu wets (grows conformally) on the metallic Ta surface at 300 K, and resists significant agglomeration at up to ~ 600 K. Cu diffusion into the substrate is not observed up to 800 K in the UHV environment. Tetrakis(diethylamido) titanium (TDEAT) interactions with SiO 2, Cu and a variety of low-k samples in the presence (~ 10 - 7 Torr or co-adsorbed) and absence of NH 3 result in different products. TDEAT interactions with SiO 2 are dominated by Ti interactions with substrate oxygen sites, and that Ti oxide/sub-oxide bond formation can proceed with relatively low activation energy. No Ti carbide or Si carbide formation is observed. Co-adsorption of TDEAT and NH 3 on SiO 2 at 120 K followed by annealing to higher temperature results in enhanced Ti-N bond formation, which is stable against oxidation up to 900 K in UHV. Similarly, continuous exposures of TDEAT on SiO 2 at 500 K in the presence of NH 3 exhibit a relatively enhanced Ti-N spectral component. Co-adsorption of NH 3 and TDEAT on Cu (poly) surface at 120 K, followed by annealing to 500 K, results in complete desorption of Ti, N or C-containing species from the Cu substrate. Reaction of TDEAT with a Cu surface at 500 K yields a Ti-alkyl species via a b-hydride elimination pathway. TDEAT/Cu interactions are not observably affected by overpressures of NH 3 of 10 - 7 Torr. TDEAT interaction with a porous <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> <b>oxide</b> low-k substrate at 700 K demonstrates undissociated or partly dissociated Ti-NR species trapped in the dielectrics matrix due to its high porosity. In addition, carbide formation is observed from C(1 s) XPS spectra. For a hydrocarbon low-k film, the majority sites (carbon) are highly unreactive towards TDEAT even at higher temperature {{due to a lack of}} functional groups to initiate the TDEAT/low-k surface chemistry...|$|E
40|$|In copper {{chemical}} mechanical planarization (CMP), in situ {{detection of}} barrier to dielectric layer transition is typically done using an optical reflectance technique. The introduction of <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> <b>oxides</b> (CDOs) as low-dielectric constant (k) materials for dielectric layers has opened up {{the possibility of using}} spectroscopic techniques for detecting such transitions more efficiently. The vibrational frequencies of the bonds between C, H, O, and Si in these low-k materials may be readily detected by spectroscopic techniques such as Raman and infrared (IR) spectroscopies. Since CMP is carried out in aqueous media, IR spectroscopy is not very desirable due to strong absorption of water in the same region as C-H vibrations (2800 cm⁻¹ to 3300 cm⁻¹). In contrast, Raman spectroscopy shows minimal water interference and can be used to efficiently monitor the signal from CDO films even in aqueous environments that prevail under CMP conditions. The research reported in this dissertation concerns the use of Raman spectroscopy in detecting the transition from tantalum (Ta) barrier layer to CDO dielectric layer, insitu. Intensities of Raman peaks characteristic of Si-Si vibrations from silicon substrates and C-H vibrations from low-k materials were used for monitoring CDO thickness and detecting removal of Ta layer. An abrasion cell was integrated with a Raman spectrometer to demonstrate the feasibility of Raman monitoring in-situ. Additionally, an alternative method was investigated for monitoring transitions in highly fluorescent low-k materials where Raman can not be used. The fluorescence intensity was used to effectively monitor Ta to low-k transitions. As a secondary objective, the Raman technique was used to monitor the composition of polishing slurries, which in the case of copper CMP, have a rich chemistry, which may change during the course of polishing due to consumption and decomposition of certain constituents. Various aspects, such as small layer thickness (< 50 μm), continuous flow of the slurry, and dynamics of the film removal process pose a great challenge to the monitoring of slurry components between the pad and the wafer. The slurry constituents such as oxidants and corrosion inhibitors have unique signatures that can be detected using spectroscopic techniques. In this study Raman spectroscopy was used to detect and quantify chemical species such as hydroxylamine, benzotriazole and hydrogen peroxide in-situ. A more detailed study pertaining to the protonation of hydroxylamine with respect to the pH was also performed. Finally, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was also investigated to improve the detection of pyridine and benzotriazole at low concentrations (< 100 ppm) ...|$|R

A small cylindrical crystal of Al 2 O 3 :C (diameter 0. 48 mm and length 2 mm) was coupled {{to the end of}} a 1 mm diameter optical fibre cable. Owing to their small size and characteristic shape, these probes can be placed on the body surface in the field of view during the examination, without compromising the reading of the mammogram. Our new technique was tested with a mammography unit (Siemens Mammomat 3000) and screen-film technique over a range of clinically relevant X-ray energies. The results were compared with those obtained from an ionization chamber usually used for the determination of absorbed dose in mammography. The reproducibility of measurements was around 3 % (1 standard deviation) at 4. 5 mGy for both RL and OSL data. The dose response was found to be linear between 4. 5 mGy and 30 mGy. The energy dependence of the system is around 18 % between 23 kV and 35 kV. In vivo measurements were performed during three patient examinations. It was shown that entrance and exit doses could be measured. The presence of the small probes did not significantly interfere with the diagnostic quality of the images.

40|$|As multistep, {{multilayer}} processing in {{semiconductor industry}} becomes more complex, {{the role of}} cleaning solutions and etching chemistries are becoming important in enhancing yield and in reducing defects. This thesis demonstrates successful formulations that exhibit copper and tungsten compatibility, and are capable of Inter Layer Dielectric (ILD) cleaning and selective Ti etching. The corrosion behavior of electrochemically deposited copper thin films in deareated and non-dearated cleaning solution containing hydrofluoric acid (HF) has been investigated. Potentiodynamic polarization experiments were carried out to determine active, active-passive, passive, and transpassive regions. Corrosion rates were calculated from tafel slopes. ICP-MS and potentiodynamic methods yielded comparable Cu dissolution rates. Interestingly, the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the cleaning solution led to more than {{an order of magnitude}} suppression of copper dissolution rate. We ascribe this phenomenon to the formation of interfacial CuO which dissolves at slower rate in dilute HF. A kinetic scheme involving cathodic reduction of oxygen and anodic oxidation of Cu 0 and Cu+ 1 is proposed. It was determined that the reaction order kinetics is first order with respect to both HF and oxygen concentrations. The learnings from copper corrosion studies were leveraged to develop a wet etch/clean formulation for selective titanium etching. The introduction of titanium hard-mask (HM) for dual damascene patterning of copper interconnects created a unique application in selective wet etch chemistry. A formulation that addresses the selectivity requirements was not available and was developed {{during the course of this}} dissertation.

P-type <b>carbon</b> <b>doping</b> in the InGaAs base {{has been achieved}} by gas-source molecular beam epitaxy (GSMBE) using carbon tetrachloride (CCI,) as the dopant source. The resulting hole concentration in the base was 1 x c ~ n- ~. HBT’s fabricated using material from this growth method display good I- V characteristics with dc current gain above 500. This verifies {{the ability to use}} <b>carbon</b> <b>doping</b> to make a heavily p-type InGaAs base of an N-p-n HBT. BT technology has received much attention for use in H high-speed digital circuits and high-efficiency mi-crowave devices. The InP/InGaAs HBT has advantages over HBT’s in other material systems: high electron mobility, low turn-on voltage u b e, low surface recombination velocity as compared to GaAs, and use of the same substrates as source...|$|R

40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{properties of}} arsenic in Si and SiO 2 for arsenic-doped oxides {{have been studied}} previously (1) by varying the arsenic concentration i the arsenic-doped glass. Ghezzo and Brown (1) found that, after the diffusion in argon, the sheet resistance of diffusions from arsenic-doped oxide sources decreased with in-creasing arsenic oncentration i the <b>doped</b> <b>oxide</b> glass, {{up to a certain}} concentration. Above this concentra-tion of the arsenic-doped oxide, the sheet resistance increased with increasing arsenic concentration i the <b>doped</b> <b>oxide.</b> However, this deviation from the mono-tonic dependence of the sheet resistance on the arsenic concentration, after arsenic-doped oxide diffusion in argon, has not been explained.

30|$|Many <b>carbon</b> <b>doping</b> schemes {{involve a}} {{solid-state}} step resulting in carbon-doped bulk ZnO (usually powder) [15 – 17]. However, this {{approach can be}} problematic when creating ZnO nanostructures, because it involves applying an additional reactant in the process which may interfere {{with the formation of}} nanostructures. In an earlier paper, we reported room-temperature ferromagnetism in ZnO nanorods manufactured using a chemical bath deposition method and subsequently thermally treated using acetylene gas [18]. Using this method, the fabrication of nanorods and <b>carbon</b> <b>doping</b> are separated into two different processes, increasing the versatility of the ZnO nanostructure synthesis process.|$|R

40|$|Undoped and <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> {{magnesium}} diboride (MgB 2) cables have been assembled by braiding six Nb/Monel and Nb/Cu/stainless steel (SS) sheathed mono- and multifilament strands {{with a central}} copper stabilizer for improving the operational environment. This paper presents the fabrication and characterization of two types of in situ powder-in-tube processed mono (pure) and multifilament (<b>carbon</b> <b>doped)</b> MgB 2 cables with different twist pitch lengths; thereby making them possible candidates for industrial AC applications. Critical current is not influenced by the cabling that results in various twist lengths. The total critical current of the braided cables is obtained by multiplying the critical current of six single wires without any dissipation. The critical current density (Jc) of pure (mono) and <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> (18 -filament) six stranded cable reached 10000 A/cm 2 at 5. 5 and 10 T, respectively; without any observable deleterious effect caused by varying the twist pitch. The engineering current density (Je) of both cables reached the same value of 10000 A/cm 2 at 3. 5 and 6. 5 T, respectively. Compared to the literature, this work reports {{some of the highest}} Jc and Je values for <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> multifilament cables that remain unaffected upon varying the twist pitch. The present results are promising in terms of scaling up these cables to industrial lengths for transformers, fault-current limiters-based applications and paves the way for the development of optimal protocols for practical functionality...|$|R

But in many countries (China, Chile, Malaysia, Taiwan, etc.) arsenic content in natural waters is much higher than this level. Four adsorbents were used to determine the influence of preparation conditions on As(V) sorption efficiency applying activated <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> by iron oxyhydroxide: birch activated carbon (Sorbent 1); birch activated <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> by iron oxyhydroxide (Sorbent 2); birch activated cabon additionally activated by H[2]O[2] and doped by iron oxyhydroxide (Sorbent 3) and birch activated carbon additionally activated by KMnO[4] and doped by iron oxyhydroxide (Sorbent 4). Dopping by iron oxyhydroxide dramatically increased treating efficiency of birch activated carbon. But H[2]O[2] and KMnO[4] are expensive and KMnO[4] is limited to sale due to its presence in precursor list of many countries, including Ukraine. So, additional activation by H[2]O[2] or KMnO[4] dramatically increases adsorbent cost with insignificant increasing of effectiveness. Thus, birch activated <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> by iron oxyhydroxide without additional activation and pre-oxidation is the most perspective among these adsorbents...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of C-doped GaN buffers on the dynamic {{performance}} and reliability of InAlN/GaN high electron mobility transistors. The analysis carried out on two different families of devices with different doping levels shows that carbon induces negligible differences in DC characteristics, which can be mainly ascribed to process variability. However, <b>carbon</b> <b>doping</b> is {{found to have a}} strong impact on the trapping characteristics: pulsed evaluation shows a significant current collapse, as well as dynamical shift in threshold voltage and transconductance drop. Drain current transient investigation reveals two main traps with apparent activation energy of 0. 89 eV (T- 2) and 1. 05 eV (T- 1), whose amplitudes are found to be correlated with <b>carbon</b> <b>doping.</b> A more detailed analysis suggests that trap T- 2 is located in the buffer layer. And that traps behave as a line defect. Finally, the reliability tests demonstrate that the use of high <b>carbon</b> <b>doping</b> does not significantly influence the robustness of the devices with respect to DC OFF-state stress.

In this study, hot-pressing of 100 MPa resulted in {{the improvement of the}} mass density, the critical current density, and the grain connectivity of the wires. However, this also caused additional critical current density anisotropy, which is associated with the texture of a- and b-axes oriented grains. In particular, the anisotropy factors of critical current density for the un-doped and the <b>carbon</b> <b>doped</b> conductors were estimated to be 2. 6 and 1. 7, respectively, under an external magnetic field of 14 T...|$|R
40|$|With sugar as an addition, {{the active}} carbon {{released}} from sugar {{can lead to}} the effective <b>carbon</b> <b>doping</b> in MgB 2 superconductors only under the condition of high temperature sintering. However, this kind of <b>carbon</b> <b>doping</b> cannot occur at low temperature sintering condition. The reason is that the carbon released from the decomposition reaction of the sugar added in MgB 2 has very low chemical activity during low temperature sintering process, which is similar with the results of elemental <b>carbon</b> or graphite <b>doping</b> directly. Thus, only the sintering temperature reaches a certain temperature or more (generally greater than 700 °C), the carbon can possess sufficiently high chemical activity and go into the lattice of MgB 2 to replace the B.
