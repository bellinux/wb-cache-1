40|$|The {{first part}} of this study {{provides}} an overview on Sicilian olive systems. Subsequently, the study describes the different typologies of cultivated agroforestry systems present in South-Eastern Sicily employing olive trees in association with other Mediterranean tree species, in particular for the production of firewood, coal and animal food (downy or pubescent oak, holm oak, cork oak), but also in association with forage or grazing species (oat, barley, vetch, etc.) or cereals. The study shows that Sicilian agroforestry systems are much more diversified than it was known so far. In the second part, the study describes the spontaneous colonization processes by plants, observed in abandoned olive agroforestry systems and leading to the formation of more complex ecosystems (renaturation). Most of the previously described agroforestry systems are at present subject to abandonment. Our analysis of secondary succession dynamics shows how woody species, and above all those species which are part of the <b>cultivated</b> <b>system,</b> rapidly colonize abandoned areas, so that a maquis-wood is formed within few decades...|$|E

There {{is a need for}} better information on the area and distribution of cropland using in different cropping rotation systems, but {{it is not easy to}} get it in traditional census ways. This paper focuses on the methodology of crop rotations detection in China using multitemporal satellites images. Two agricultural regions located in the middle of China were chosen as the study areas. The dataset used here includes 10 days composites NDVI (36 periods) obtained from the NASA Pathfinder AVHRR Land dataset, land-cover dataset derived from TM images, and the ground based agricultural monitoring data. The discrete Fourier transform was applied to the NDVI data set on a per pixel basis for the whole cropland of the study areas and then the additive and the first four harmonics (amplitude and phase) were classified using ISOLATE unsupervised classification algorithm for both regions respectively. Crop information derived from local stations and the Chinese <b>cultivated</b> <b>system</b> regionalization map were used to assess the accuracy of the result.

The carotenoids, total polyphenols and the antioxidant activity from skins of some wine and table grapes cultivated in organic and conventional agriculture were studied. Results The main carotenoids identified using high performance liquid chromatography were lutein and ß-carotene. Muscat Ottonel variety has the highest ß-carotene concentration 504. 9 [*]μg/kg for organic and 593. 2 [*]μg/kg for conventional grapes. For the organic farming, the total polyphenols content were {{in the range of}} 163. 23 – 1341. 37 [*]mg GAE/kg fresh weight (FW) and 148. 47 – 1231. 38 [*]mg GAE/kg FW for the conventional grapes. The highest ORAC values were obtained for blue-black variety Napoca in both farming system (43. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 95 [*]μmol TE/g organic; 40. 4 [*]±[*] 0. 5 [*]μmol TE/g conventional) and lowest for Aromat de Iaşi (16. 8 [*]±[*] 0. 6 [*]μmol TE/g organic; 14. 7 [*]±[*] 1. 6 [*]μmol TE/g conventional).

However, functional {{consequences of such}} changes have mainly been studied considering few taxa, and less is known {{on the effects of}} biota differentiation in complex, un-manipulated communities. To evaluate the role of litters diverging qualities on soil fauna assemblages and functions during decomposition, we incorporated into the soil two litters of different qualities (high: pea or low: barley) in a long-term experimental research station studying the impacts of different cultural practices in Northern France. We measured initially and after 7 and 11 months the abundance and composition of main functional groups of soil fauna: bacterial-feeders, fungal-feeders, meso- and macro-detritivores. In parallel, we followed litter mass loss and quality, enzymatic activities (hydrolytic and oxidative), soil mineral N content, microbial and fungal biomass. Pea and barley litter qualities gradually diverged across time due to the faster depletion of cellulose in pea (− 38 %) than in barley (− 18 %), leading to contrasting enzymatic activities despite similar mass loss for both litters. Microbial-feeders exhibited more changes between the sampling dates rather than between the different litters. Contrastingly, detritivores (meso- and macro-) mirrored divergence in quality of pea and barley litters across time with increasing composition dissimilarities after 0, 7 and 11 months. As a consequence, enzymatic activities were better explained by detritivores rather than by microbial-feeders composition. These relationships suggested a direct link between the identity of the taxa stimulated {{and the nature of the}} top-down regulation during litter decomposition...|$|E
40|$|Land-use {{change and}} {{management}} practices are normally enacted to manipulate environments {{to improve conditions}} that relate to production, remediation, and accommodation. However, their effect on the soil microbial community and their subsequent influence on soil function is still difficult to quantify. Recent applications of molecular techniques to soil biology, especially the use of 16 S rRNA, are helping to bridge this gap. In this study, the influence of three land-use systems within a demonstration farm were evaluated {{with a view to}} further understand how these practices may impact observed soil bacterial communities. Replicate soil samples collected from the three land-use systems (grazed pine forest, cultivated crop, and grazed pasture) on a single soil type. High throughput 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing was used to generate sequence datasets. The different land use systems showed distinction in the structure of their bacterial communities with respect to the differences detected in cluster analysis as well as diversity indices. Specific taxa, particularly Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and classes of Proteobacteria, showed significant shifts across the land-use strata. Families belonging to these taxa broke with notions of copio- and oligotrphy at the class level, as many of the less abundant groups of families of Actinobacteria showed a propensity for soil environments with reduced carbon/nutrient availability. Orders Actinomycetales and Solirubrobacterales showed their highest abundance in the heavily disturbed <b>cultivated</b> <b>system</b> despite the lowest soil organic carbon (SOC) values across the site. Selected soil properties ([SOC], total nitrogen [TN], soil texture, phosphodiesterase [PD], alkaline phosphatase [APA], acid phosphatase [ACP] activity, and pH) also differed significantly across land-use regimes, with SOM, PD, and pH showing variation consistent with shifts in community structure and composition.

Vegetation productivity was characterized with the proxy metric "Enhanced Vegetation Index" (EVI) (2000 to 2012 period), on 6186 natural and cultivated sampling points on five continents, and combined with a global climatology database by means of additive models for quantile regressions. Globally and regionally, cultivation amplified the seasonal and inter-annual variability of EVI without affecting its magnitude. Natural and <b>cultivated</b> <b>systems</b> maintained a similar and continuous increase of EVI with increasing water availability, yet achieved through contrasting ways. In natural systems, the productivity peak and the growing season length displayed concurrent steady increases with water availability, while in <b>cultivated</b> <b>systems</b> the productivity peak increased from semiarid to dry-subhumid conditions, and stabilized thereafter giving place to an increase in the growing season length towards wetter conditions.

40|$|The study {{objects of}} the present PhD Thesis are organic and {{conventional}} agro-ecosystems, where soil biodiversity is investigated by studying nematode and coleopteran biocommunities (in general also macro-arthropod communities). As agro-ecosystems, crop production <b>systems</b> (<b>cultivated</b> fields) as well as formations of natural vegetation (hedgerows) are taken into consideration. The following general points in question are investigated in the present PhD Thesis: > Which are the differences between conventional and organic management systems? > Do the organic cultivation systems differ from the more ‘natural’ agroecosystems of hedgerows? > Is the management history of biological and chemical disturbances and the duration of organic management reflected in the soil of the <b>cultivated</b> <b>systems?</b> > Are the impacts of long term disturbances due to the management regime, different from the short term ones due to seasonal agricultural practices? > Do cultivation systems with a different management history (different history in biological and chemical disturbances) respond differently to a similar disturbance mainly of mechanical nature? The investigation of the points in question is accomplished in four chapters, whose content is summarized in the following paragraphs. It is noted that the agroecosystems under investigation (cultivated fields and hedgerows) are from the region Krya Brysi, Giannitsa and were under similar microclimatic conditions and of similar soil properties. The <b>cultivated</b> <b>systems,</b> organic (under conversion and certified) and conventional, where of the same perennial crop, namely Asparagus officinalis, and differed regarding fertilization and weed control. ## In the first chapter biocommunities of nematodes are studied in terms of trophic and generic structure, life strategy and diversity, in soils under asparagus cultivation managed conventionally and organically. Natural hedgerows bordering both types of cultivations are also studied as reference systems. The decomposer feeding group (bacterivores and fungivores), accounts for 80 % of the total nematode abundance under organic cultivation, while under conventional for 45 %. The dominant trophic group under the latter is that of phytoparasites, {{which is responsible for}} the higher Plant Parasitic Index (PPI). The low generic diversity and the strong dominance pattern under conventional cultivation indicate a stressed soil environment. In the organically managed system, diversity is almost as high as in natural hedgerows, with nematode numbers evenly distributed among genera. However, in hedgerows intermediate abundances of bacterial, fungal and plant feeders are recorded, and the Maturity Index (MI) and Plant Parasitic Index (PPI) are higher than those of the organically managed system, indicating that organic farming results to a more vigorous, pre-mature and probably more productive soil rather than to a more ‘natural’ one. ...|$|R

During a field experiment, repeated over 2  years, we measured the effect of increasing plant functional diversity on community structure of arthropod visitors, the abundance of multiple pests and induced crop damage, and fruit production in two varieties of tomato. Plant resources (floral and extra-floral nectar and pollen) were included within experimental plots in four levels, with each level increasing the plant functional group richness, based on floral morphology and availability of resources, in a replacement series. The presence of sown flower mixtures in experimental plots was associated with increased abundance and diversity of natural enemy functional groups and an enhanced abundance of bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes). However, we only detected relatively small variability in arthropod visitors among types of mixtures, and increased abundance of natural enemies did not translate into stronger pest suppression or reduced crop damage. Lepidoptera pest damage was significantly higher in plots adjacent to wildflower strips, an ecosystem disservice, but a significantly higher crop productivity was recorded from these plots.

As demands mount for greater efficiency in the use of resources to achieve this goal, so the focus on roots and rootstocks and their role in acquiring water and nutrients, and overcoming pests and pathogens, is increasing. The purpose of this review is to explore some {{of the ways in which}} understanding root systems and their interactions with soils could contribute to the development of more sustainable systems of intensive production. Physical interactions with soil particles limit root growth if soils are dense, but root–soil contact is essential for optimal growth and uptake of water and nutrients. X-ray microtomography demonstrated that maize roots elongated more rapidly with increasing root–soil contact, as long as mechanical impedance was not limiting root elongation, while lupin was less sensitive to changes in root–soil contact. In addition to selecting for root architecture and rhizosphere properties, the growth of many plants in <b>cultivated</b> <b>systems</b> is profoundly affected by selection of an appropriate rootstock. Several mechanisms for scion control by rootstocks have been suggested, but the causal signals are still uncertain and may differ between crop species. Linkage map locations for quantitative trait loci for disease resistance and other traits of interest in rootstock breeding are becoming available. Designing root systems and rootstocks for specific environments is becoming a feasible target...|$|R
40|$|The Asiatic {{fruit fly}} Drosophila suzukii has {{recently}} invaded Europe and North and South America, causing severe damage to fruit production systems. Although agronomic host plants of that fly are now well documented, {{little is known}} about the suitability of wild and ornamental hosts in its exotic area. In order to study the potential trophic niche of D. suzukii with relation to fruit characteristics, fleshy fruits from 67 plant species were sampled in natural and anthropic ecosystems (forests, hedgerows, grasslands, coastal areas, gardens and urban areas) of the north of France and submitted to experimental infestations. A set of fruit traits (structure, colour, shape, skin texture, diameter and weight, phenology) potentially interacting with oviposition choices and development success of D. suzukii was measured. Almost half of the tested plant species belonging to 17 plant families allowed the full development of D. suzukii. This suggests that the extreme polyphagy of the fly and the very large reservoir of hosts producing fruits all year round ensure temporal continuity in resource availability and contribute to the persistence and the exceptional invasion success of D. suzukii in natural habitats and neighbouring <b>cultivated</b> <b>systems.</b> Nevertheless, this very plastic trophic niche is not systematically beneficial to the fly. Some of the tested plants attractive to D. suzukii gravid females stimulate oviposition but do not allow full larval development. Planted near sensitive crops, these "trap plants" may attract and lure D. suzukii, therefore contributing to the control of the invasive fly...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT – In Fall 2007, a {{coalition}} of four universities was awarded an NSF CCLI grant to support {{the development of a}} curriculum with the goal of <b>cultivating</b> <b>systems</b> thinking in students. Systems thinking, as defined in this project, is the ability to envision architectures of complexengineered systems and the principles that underlie them. The effort, deemed MUSE – Multi-University Systems Education – has developed a unique course to instill such systems skills. This undergraduate course, Wireless Sensor Network Design, not only introduces students to a timely technology but utilizes this topic to bring together material from a variety of subject matters that students had heretofore studied in isolation. To develop the course, faculty at each institution contributed online modules in topics of their expertise but with the material refocused to emphasize relevance to sensor networks and interaction with other electrical engineering subdisciplines. These modules were created utilizing Tablet PCs and Camtasia Studio screen recording software. In Fall 2008, the course was piloted at Northern Arizona University. A hybrid lecturing approach was employed where students interacted with online content the equivalent one lecture per week and then discussed the material in-class, once a week. In this paper, assessment results of the initial course offering are reported in three areas. First, students evaluated the content delivery method along with the course content quality and engagement. Second, students were evaluated pre- and post-course with a systems-oriented task to evaluate whether holistic skills were being developed. Finally, the course developers were evaluated on the collaborative aspects of the project along with the approach for creating content...|$|R
40|$|Models {{developed}} in continuous-time {{have been used}} to study the epidemiology and population dynamics of plant hosts, usually in <b>cultivated</b> <b>systems.</b> Here discrete-time SIR–type models are developed which contain parameters representing characteristics of an uncultivated, biennial host plant – systemic, castrating pathogen system. This thesis presents 4 epidemiological model forms representing a generic SIR model, a constant pathogen-induced mortality model, a variable pathogen-induced mortality model, and a model which has an additional phase representing a seedbank. Using a range of parameter values it is possible to produce simulation outcomes with population crashes, cycles and steady-state populations. For each of the models a pathogen epidemic criterion is derived as is a term describing population steady-state values. For the pathogen-induced mortality models, the invasion criteria include a pathogenicity term indicating that the pathogen in part regulates the host population dynamics. The biennial host plant Tragopogon pratensis has been recorded in the Park Grass Experiment and has been described as an outbreak species regulated by the autoecious, demicyclic rust fungus, Puccinia hysterium (Silvertown et al., 2006). The rust is shown to castrate the host plant by reducing the numbers of seed set and the viability of seeds produced by infected individuals. Further characteristics of this host – pathogen system are identified by using the developed models. This is justified as the recurrencerelationships derived from the models fit the observed data, and that the accuracy of the fit is increased with larger values of pathogen-induced mortality. These models produce simulation outcomes that are similar to the host population dynamics. The models also show that the system is governed by density-dependent factors.
