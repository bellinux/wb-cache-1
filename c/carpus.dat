5|$|Early in {{this section}} Heilmann embarks on a {{thorough}} description of the Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to specific aspects of modern birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a modern pigeon, Heilmann states that he disagrees with the scientific consensus {{of the time that}} the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian features of the skull are much more pronounced, citing features of the teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un-birdlike. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryxs anatomy, in fact, was decidedly reptilian and generally opposed to that of modern birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os sacrum from modern birds, as well as the <b>carpus,</b> which Heilmann wrote exhibited the same phenomena found in the wrists of modern reptiles. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Up {{to three}} {{thoracic}} segments may be fused {{with the head}} to form a cephalothorax; the associated appendages turn forward and are modified as maxillipeds (accessory mouthparts). A carapace may be absent, present or secondarily lost, and may cover the head, part {{or all of the}} thorax and some of the abdomen. It is variable in form and may be fused dorsally with some of the thoracic segments or occasionally be in two parts, hinged dorsally. Typically, each of the thoracic appendages is biramous and the endopods are the better developed of the branches, being used for crawling or grasping. Each endopod consist of seven articulating segments; the coxa, basis, ischium, merus, <b>carpus,</b> propodus and dactylus. In decapods, the claw is formed by the articulation of the dactylus against an outgrowth of the propodus. In some taxa, the exopods are lost and the appendages are uniramous.|$|E
5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), <b>carpus</b> (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Each tentacular club {{is divided}} into three regions – the <b>carpus</b> ("wrist"), manus ("hand") and dactylus ("finger"). The <b>carpus</b> has a dense cluster of cups, in six or seven irregular, {{transverse}} rows. The manus is broader, closer {{to the end of the}} club, and has enlarged suckers in two medial rows. The dactylus is the tip. The bases of all the arms and tentacles are arranged in a circle surrounding the animal's single, parrot-like beak, as in other cephalopods.|$|E
25|$|The pisiform bone {{is a small}} bone {{found in}} the {{proximal}} row of the wrist (<b>carpus).</b> It is situated where the ulna joins the wrist, within the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle.|$|E
25|$|The {{skeleton}} of the thumb {{consists of the}} first metacarpal bone which articulates proximally with the <b>carpus</b> at the carpometacarpal joint and distally with the proximal phalanx at the metacarpophalangeal joint. This latter bone articulates with the distal phalanx at the interphalangeal joint. Additionally, there are two sesamoid bones at the metacarpophalangeal joint.|$|E
25|$|All Atyidae {{family members}} can be {{distinguished}} from other shrimp by their overall length {{as well as the}} extent length of their pincer-like claws and manifestation of terminal bristles (setae) at the tips of the first and second chelae. A short spine above the eye and the angled articulation of the second chelae with the <b>carpus</b> differentiate the California freshwater shrimp from other shrimp that occur California. A carapace length (reckoned from eye socket to tail-tip) of slightly more than five centimeters can be attained.|$|E
25|$|The entire arm is {{referred}} to as the brachium and brachial, the front of the elbow as the antecubitis and antecubital, the back of the elbow as the olecranon or olecranal, the forearm as the antebrachium and antebrachial, the wrist as the <b>carpus</b> and carpal area, the hand as the manus and manual, the palm as the palma and palmar, the thumb as the pollex, and the fingers as the digits, phalanges, and phalangeal. The buttocks are the gluteus or gluteal region and the pubic area is the pubis.|$|E
25|$|Euclid {{defines a}} plane angle as the {{inclination}} to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to Proclus an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by Eudemus, who regarded an angle as a deviation from a straight line; the second by <b>Carpus</b> of Antioch, who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative.|$|E
25|$|The manus and <b>carpus</b> {{are among}} the few areas of the Protoavis {{material}} which are well preserved, and they are astonishingly non-avian. The distal carpals, while long, are in no way similar to those observed in the urvogel or other archaic birds. There is no semilunate element, {{and the structure of}} the radiale and ulnare would have limited the flexibility of the wrist joint. The manus is not tridactyl, and metacarpal V is present. In even the most basal avialian, Archaeopteryx, there is no vestige of the fifth metacarpal and its presence in Protoavis seems incongruous with the claim that it is a bird, let alone one more derived than Archaeopteryx.|$|E
500|$|The {{front and}} back legs of a giraffe {{are about the same}} length. The radius and ulna of the front legs are {{articulated}} by the <b>carpus,</b> which, while structurally equivalent to the human wrist, functions as a knee. It appears that a suspensory ligament allows the lanky legs to support the animal's great weight. The foot of the giraffe reaches a diameter of , and the hoof is [...] high in males and [...] in females. The rear of each hoof is low and the fetlock is close to the ground, allowing the foot to provide additional support to the animal's weight. Giraffes lack dewclaws and interdigital glands. The giraffe's pelvis, though relatively short, has an ilium that is outspread at the upper ends.|$|E
500|$|The {{pterosaur}} wrist {{consists of}} two inner (proximal) and four outer (distal) carpals (wrist bones), excluding the pteroid bone, which may itself be a modified distal carpal. The proximal carpals are fused together into a [...] "syncarpal" [...] in mature specimens, while three of the distal carpals fuse to form a distal syncarpal. The remaining distal carpal, referred to here as the medial carpal, but which has also been termed the distal lateral, or pre-axial carpal, articulates on a vertically elongate biconvex facet on the anterior surface of the distal syncarpal. The medial carpal bears a deep concave fovea that opens anteriorly, ventrally and somewhat medially, within which the pteroid articulates. In derived pterodactyloids like pteranodontians and azhdarchoids, metacarpals I-III are small and do not connect to the <b>carpus,</b> instead hanging {{in contact with the}} fourth metacarpal; in nyctosaurids the forelimb digits besides the wingfinger have been lost altogether.|$|E
500|$|The {{anatomy of}} the forelegs begin at the scapula. This is the {{shoulder}} in which provides the ease of movement as it is connected to various bones surrounding it such as the cervical vertebra (a section of the spine). The next bone is the humerus which leads onto the radius below. The radius is then connected to {{the bones of the}} knee. The <b>carpus</b> is located at front of the knee and the pisiform is the back of the knee. Below the knee is the cannon bone which is also known as the 3rd metacarpal. 55 million years ago when the Eohippus existed, the cannon bone used to be the 3rd toe of the foot. It's fusion took place in order to increase height and power of the limb. Behind the cannon bone are the splint bones. The splint bones are also known as the 2nd and 4th metacarpal and fused 25 - 35 million years ago {{during the time of the}} Miohippus. They provide extra strength and support of the cannon bone and used to be the 2nd and 4th toes of the foot. Below the cannon bone is the fetlock joint in which lays a structure if many bones. Firstly are the sesamoid bones that act as part of the system that allows the leg to drop as pressure is applied and spring back up as pressure is released. Below this is the proximal phalanx also known as the long pastern which is followed by the middle phalanx (short pastern). Below these bones are the navicular bone and the distal phalanx. the distal phalanx can be known as the coffin bone or the pedal bone. Below the navicular bone is the navicular bursa.|$|E
2500|$|The {{synovial}} membranes of {{the wrist}} and <b>carpus</b> are thus seen to be five in number: ...|$|E
2500|$|Knee: the <b>carpus</b> of {{the horse}} (equivalent to the human wrist), the large joint in the front legs, above the cannon bone ...|$|E
2500|$|Concussion {{is another}} cause of splints. Concussive forces {{run from the}} <b>carpus</b> or tarsus into the splint bones. [...] Working a horse on hard {{surfaces}} increases the concussion received by the interosseous ligament, which causes tearing. Splints caused by concussion are usually found on both front legs, most commonly {{on the inside of}} the leg a few inches below the knee.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} the scapula (shoulder blade), coracoid, and humerus (upper arm). The humerus joins the radius and ulna (forearm) to form the elbow. The <b>carpus</b> and metacarpus form the [...] "wrist" [...] and [...] "hand" [...] of the bird, and the digits are fused together. The bones in the wing are extremely light so that the bird can fly more easily.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scaphoid}} can be slow to heal {{because of}} the limited circulation to the bone. Fractures of the scaphoid must be recognized and treated quickly, as prompt treatment by immobilization or surgical fixation {{increases the likelihood of}} the bone healing in anatomic alignment, thus avoiding mal-union or non-union. Delays may compromise healing. Failure of the fracture to heal ("non-union") will lead to post-traumatic [...] osteoarthritis of the <b>carpus.</b> One reason for this is {{because of the}} [...] "tenuous" [...] blood supply to the proximal segment. Even rapidly immobilized fractures may require surgical treatment, including use of a headless compression screw such as the Herbert screw to bind the two halves together.|$|E
2500|$|Daeodon shoshonensis is {{the largest}} known entelodont; known adult {{individuals}} had skulls about [...] long and were around [...] tall at the shoulders. It's differentiated from other entelodonts by a suite of unique dental characters, the shape and relatively small size of the cheekbone flanges of its skull compared to those of Archaeotherium, {{the small size of}} its chin tubercle, as well as features of its <b>carpus</b> and tarsus and the fusion of the bones of the lower leg. Like other entelodonts, its limbs were long and slender with the bones of the foreleg fused together and with only two toes on each foot. It also had a relatively lightly constructed neck for the size of its head, whose weight was mostly supported by muscles and tendons attached to the tall spines of the thoracic vertebrae, similar to those of modern-day bison and white rhinoceros.|$|E
2500|$|Callinectes sapidus is a decapod crab of the {{swimming}} crab family Portunidae. The genus Callinectes is distinguished from other portunid crabs {{by the lack}} of an internal spine on the <b>carpus</b> (the middle segment of the claw), {{as well as by the}} T-shape of the male abdomen. Blue crabs may grow to a carapace width of [...] C.sapidus individuals exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males and females are easily distinguished by the shape of the abdomen (known as the [...] "apron") and by color differences in the chelipeds, or claws. The abdomen is long and slender in males, but wide and rounded in mature females. A popular mnemonic is that the male's apron is shaped like the Washington Monument, while the mature female's resembles the dome of the United States Capitol. Claw color differences are more subtle than apron shape. The immovable, fixed finger of the claws in males is blue with red tips, while females have orange coloration with purple tips. A female's abdomen changes as it matures: an immature female has a triangular-shaped abdomen, whereas a mature female's is rounded.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{there is}} a {{fundamental}} difference {{in the structure of the}} foot and the hand, observable when the <b>carpus</b> and the tarsus are contrasted; and there are differences of degree noticeable when the proportions and the mobility of the metacarpals and metatarsals, with their respective digits, are compared together.|$|E

60|$|The thumb of the Orang differs {{more from}} that of the Gorilla than the thumb of the Gorilla differs {{from that of}} Man, not only by its shortness, but by the absence of any special long flexor muscle. The <b>carpus</b> of the Orang, like that of most lower apes, {{contains}} nine bones, while in the Gorilla, as in Man and the Chimpanzee, there are only eight.|$|E
60|$|But at the disinterring, a sad perplexity arose. For lo surpassing Saul and Jonathan, {{not even}} in decay were these fast friends divided. So mingled every relic,--ilium and ulna, <b>carpus</b> and metacarpus;--and so similar the {{corresponding}} parts, that like the literary remains of Beaumont and of Fletcher, which was which, no spectacles could tell. Therefore, they desisted; lest the towering monument they had reared, might commemorate an ape, and not a king.|$|E
60|$|The four {{bones of}} the second row of the <b>carpus</b> bear the four long bones which support the palm of the hand. The fifth bone of the same {{character}} is articulated {{in a much more}} free and moveable manner than the others, with its carpal bone, and forms the base of the thumb. These are called 'metacarpal' bones, and they carry the 'phalanges', or {{bones of the}} digits, of which there are two in the thumb, and three in each of the fingers.|$|E
60|$|The {{skeleton}} {{of the foot}} is very {{like that of the}} hand in some respects. Thus there are three phalanges in each of the lesser toes, and only two in the great toe, which answers to the thumb. There is a long bone, termed 'metatarsal', answering to the metacarpal, for each digit; and the 'tarsus', which corresponds with the <b>carpus,</b> presents four short polygonal bones in a row, which correspond very closely with the four carpal bones of the second row of the hand. In other respects the foot differs very widely from the hand. Thus the great toe is the longest digit but one; and its metatarsal is far less moveably articulated with the tarsus, than the metacarpal of the thumb with the <b>carpus.</b> But a far more important distinction lies in the fact that, instead of four more tarsal bones there are only three; and, that these three are not arranged side by side, or in one row. One of them, the 'os calcis' or heel bone ('ca'), lies externally, and sends back the large projecting heel; another, the 'astragalus' ('as'), rests on this by one face, and by another, forms, with the bones of the leg, the ankle joint; while a third face, directed forwards, is separated from the three inner tarsal bones of the row next the metatarsus by a bone called the 'scaphoid' ('sc').|$|E

60|$|Section 14. The fore-limb (Figure 6, Sheet 12) {{consists}} of an upper segment of one bone, the humerus, as in the rabbit; a middle section, the radius and ulna, fused here into one bone, and not, as in the mammalian type, separable; of a <b>carpus,</b> and of five digits, of which the fourth is the longest. The shoulder girdle is more important and complete {{than that of the}} higher type. There is a scapula (sc.) with an unossified cartilaginous supra-scapula (s.sc.); the anterior border of the scapula answers to the acromion. On the ventral side a cartilaginous rod, embraced by the clavicle (cl.) (a membrane bone in this type), runs to the sternum, and answers to the clavicle of the rabbit. In the place of the rabbit's coracoid process, is a coracoid bone (co.), which reaches from the glenoid cavity to the sternum; it is hidden {{on the right side of}} Figure 6, which is a dorsal view of the shoulder girdle. There is a pre-omosternum (o.st.) and a post-omosternum, sometimes termed a xiphisternum (x.).|$|E
6000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{as much of}} reality, as much of {{objective}} truth, as the Scriptures communicate to the subjective experiences of the believer, so much of present life, of living and effective import, do these experiences give to the letter of these Scriptures. In the one THE SPIRIT ITSELF BEARETH WITNESS WITH OUR SPIRIT, that we have received the SPIRIT OF ADOPTION; in the other our spirit bears witness {{to the power of}} the Word, that it is indeed the Spirit that proceedeth from God. If in the holy men thus actuated all imperfection of knowledge, all participation in the mistakes and limits of their several ages had been excluded, how could these writings be or become the history and example, the echo and more lustrous image of the work and warfare of the sanctifying principle in us? If after all this, and in spite of all this, some captious litigator should lay hold of a text here or there--St. Paul's CLOAK LEFT AT TROAS WITH <b>CARPUS,</b> or a verse from the Canticles, and ask, [...] "Of what spiritual use is this?"--the answer is ready:- It proves to us that nothing can be so trifling, as not to supply an evil heart with a pretext for unbelief.|$|E
6000|$|Section 82. The fore-limb (pectoral limb) {{consists}} of an upper arm bone, the humerus (hum.) the distal end of which is deeply excavated by the olecranon fossa (o.f.) {{as indicated by the}} dotted lines; of two bones, the ulna (u.) and radius (r.) which are firmly bound by ligament in the position of the figure (i.e., with the palm of the hand downward, [...] "prone"); of a number of small bones (carpalia), the <b>carpus</b> (c.); of a series of metacarpals (mc.); and of three digits (= fingers) each, except the first, or pollex, of three small bones-- the phalanges, only the proximal of which appear in the figure. The ulna has a hook-like head, the olecranon (o.) which distinguishes it easily from the distally thickened radius. The limb is attached to the body through the intermediation of the shoulder-blade (scapula, sc.) a flattened bone with a median external ridge with a hook-like termination, the acromion (acr.). There is also a process overhanging the glenoid cavity (g.) wherein the humerus articulates, which process is called coracoid (co.); it is ossified from two separate centres, and represents a very considerable bone in the bird, reptile, and frog. Along the dorsal edge of the scapula of the rabbit is unossified cartilage, which is called the supra-scapula (s.sc.). In man there runs from the acromion to the manubrium of the sternum a bone, the collar-bone or clavicle. This is represented by a very imperfectly ossified rudiment in the rabbit. The scapula and clavicle, the bones of the body connected with the fore-limb, are frequently styled the pectoral girdle, or shoulder-girdle; this name of girdle will appear less of a misnomer when lower vertebrate types are studied.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Carpus</b> of Antioch (Κάρπος) was {{an ancient}} Greek mathematician. It {{is not certain}} when he lived; he may have lived any time between the 2nd century BC and the 2nd century AD. He wrote on mechanics, astronomy, and geometry. Proclus quotes from an Astronomical Treatise by <b>Carpus</b> {{concerning}} whether problems should come before theorems, in which <b>Carpus</b> may (or may not) have been criticising Geminus. Proclus also quotes the view of <b>Carpus</b> that [...] "an angle is a quantity, namely a distance between the lines of surfaces containing it." [...] According to Pappus, <b>Carpus</b> made use of mathematics for practical applications. According to Iamblichus, <b>Carpus</b> also constructed a curve {{for the purpose of}} squaring the circle, which he calls a curve generated by a double motion.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his second}} Epistle to Timothy, Paul requests, [...] "The phelonion that I left at Troas with <b>Carpus,</b> when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books." [...] <b>Carpus</b> was bishop of Beroea (or Verria) in Macedonia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carpus</b> (wrist): Angulated.|$|E
50|$|It descends {{along the}} {{interosseous}} membrane, anterior to the extensor pollicis longus muscle, {{to the back}} of the <b>carpus,</b> where it presents a gangliform enlargement from which filaments are distributed to the ligaments and articulations of the <b>carpus.</b>|$|E
