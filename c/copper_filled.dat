In this paper, we present a method of fabricating aligned CNT/copper composites on the silicon substrates and in the silicon dioxide vias. Electrical measurement of the CNT/copper composite vias demonstrates much lower electrical resistance than that of vias with CNT only. Thermal characterization shows the thermal resistance decreased by increasing copper loading into the CNT films. The electroplated <b>copper</b> <b>fills</b> the voids between the neighboring nanotubes. The improvement of the electrical and thermal conductance is resulted from the decreased porosity of the asgrown CNTs.

Novel fabrication processes was developed that uses liquid crystal polymer (LCP) film with <b>copper</b> <b>filled</b> thermal vias and a micro-scale hybrid liquid wicking structure to construct a flat heat pipe suitable for thermal management of semiconductor devices.

In addition, a novel method for bonding woven metallic mesh to liquid flow channels has been developed. A 250 Å thick layer of atomic layer deposited (ALD) TiO 2 was coated on the hybrid wicking structure to enhance the evaporation and capillary force on the liquid in the device.
