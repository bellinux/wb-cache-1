40|$|This paper investigates a {{new type}} of {{carbon-based}} electrodes, which were equipped with graphite and activated carbon fiber composite, to improve the performance of electrosorption. The results indicated that the highest desalination efficiency achieved 55 % and the optimal condition was 1. 6 V voltage, 60 min retention time and 1. 0 cm electrode distance. Freundlich isotherms successfully fitted with the respective behavior of the composite electrode and provided theoretical evidence for the desalination performance improvement. Applied in real black liquor of refined cotton, the graphite and activated carbon fiber composite electrodes achieved high removal efficiency for conductivity (59 %) and CODCr (76 %). Similar removal performance was also observed in sodium <b>copper</b> <b>chlorophyll</b> wastewater, and removal efficiency was 37 % for conductivity and 14 % for CODCr. For the first time, this research demonstrated the biodegradability improvement in real industrial wastewater via electrosorption treatment, suggesting a potential pretreatment technique for high-salinity wastewater...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of trace metal ions in biological processes {{has been known}} for some time, but the role of chelating molecules in the human body is a comparatively new and interesting field of research Schubert, j., 1966, Scientific American, 214, no. 5, 40. Among the important complexes occuring in the body are haemoglobin, containing iron, and vitamin B- 12, containing cobalt, both essential to human health. Other well-known naturally occuring complexes include cytochrome oxidase, containing both iron and <b>copper,</b> and <b>chlorophyll,</b> containing magnesium. The transition metal ions of the First Transition Series are well-known for their ability to form complexes with suitable ligands, and in particular with chelate ligands which can seize the metal ion like a claw (chele means claw in Greek). Many of these complexes have been characterized experimentally, and their properties interpreted by theoretical calculations. However, the complexes arising from biological systems are much more difficult to study, partly because of their greater size and special properties...|$|R
40|$|Copper is an {{essential}} micronutrient for plant growth. It {{is an important component}} of proteins. In the present research the effect of <b>copper</b> toxicity on <b>chlorophyll,</b> sugar, protein content and antioxidant enzymes activity in both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal tomato plants were studied. The experiment was performed by using two treatments (mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal) and five concentrations of CuSo 4 solution added to Hogland nutrient solution. Copper toxicity caused reduction in growth in all treatment (non-AM). It may be due to accumulation of Cu in leaves. Total sugar content in both shoot and roots, the total chlorophyll content in leaves, Protein content in shoots and roots, antioxidant enzyme activity and root colonization were determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{seagrass}} Zostera marina was {{studied to}} assess effects of sequential exposure to UV-B radiation and <b>copper</b> on <b>chlorophyll</b> fluorescence and growth. A time period of 36 h exposure to UV-B and {{a concentration of}} copper (500 ug 1 "^ were established from two primary dose response experiments {{for use in the}} third and final experiment. An initial reduction in Fv:Fm was found after exposure to UV-B irradiation (55 % compared with initial untreated plants). There was some recovery after the UV-B period, however the plants did not return to pre-treatment values. Following the exposure to UV-B, the plants were exposed to copper for a 10 day treatment. Plants exposed to singularly Cu showed a decrease in optimal quantum yield of 28 % compared with pre-treatment plants, with a Fv:Fm value of 0. 592. In the treatment of sequential exposure to UV-B and Cu, a decrease in optimal yield of 41 % was seen, with a final Fv:Fm value of 0. 490. A significant interaction between UV-B and copper was found (3 factorial ANOVA, P 0. 05) using Fv values. All treatment groups seemed to show no significant recovery. Significant reduction in growth rate (p< 0. 05) only occurred with a copperAJV-B treatment. It was shown that the effects of sequential exposure to both stressors produced greater effects in Z. marina compared to a single exposure. It is concern that with additional stressors, such as UV-B, there is the potential that such lower concentrations of heavy metals that {{are more likely to be}} found in an ecosystem will have much more harmful consequences.

40|$|The present work proposes an {{analytical}} method {{able to detect}} in an adulterated olive oil sample {{the addition of the}} <b>copper</b> complexes of <b>chlorophylls</b> (E 141 i). The method consists of a pigment extraction in liquid phase and subsequent analysis by HPLC-DAD. The profile of chlorophyll pigments of an olive oil is determined essentially by its content in pheophytins (a and b), but in no case any copper derivative. Different samples of colorant E 141 i have been analyzed, the natural coloring additives used to adulterate vegetable oils. The 99. 59 ± 0. 52 % of the chlorophyll pigments present in the different samples of E 141 i colorant are not those of an olive oil (more than 75 % are cuproderivatives). Thus, the simple detection of one of the compounds in an olive oil indicates adulteration. The major chlorophyll derivative in all the E 141 i colorants samples is Cu-pyropheophytin a and its limit of detection (LOD) defined at a signal-to-noise ratio of about 3 was 6. 58 ng/g. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

40|$|Phytoremediation is an {{emerging}} technology for cleaning industrial and urban contamination (Peuke and Rennenberg, 2005). Many factors including germination rate, biomass changes, biochemical changes, and nutrient changes must be determined {{in order to}} utilize a plant for phytoremediation. Our results showed that Prosopis pubescens (Screw bean mesquite) is a hyperaccumulator of copper from copper sulfate and a feasible option to remediate fields with up to 200 ppm of copper sulfate. ^ Screw bean mesquite seeds are viable even after 30 years of storage. Both copper sulfate and copper nitrate decreased the germination rate of screw bean mesquite seeds. In soil grown screw bean mesquite plants, germination rates were not affected by either copper sulfate or copper nitrate. Physiological studies showed biomass decreased with copper exposure. Root cell area increased with increasing copper exposure. Only after <b>copper</b> nitrate exposure, <b>chlorophyll</b> levels decreased; unmasking the yellow/orange pigments from carotene and xanthophyll and causing chlorosis. ^ We measured copper and nutrient concentrations within seedlings. Petri dish grown seedlings accumulated 47, 000 ppm (27, 500 ppm) in roots, 23, 000 ppm (21, 000 ppm) in stems, and 9, 000 ppm (16, 000 ppm of copper) in cotyledons from copper sulfate (copper nitrate). Control seedlings grown in soil accumulated 31, 000 ppm in roots, 17, 000 ppm in stems, 11, 000 ppm in cotyledons, and 20 ppm of copper from copper sulfate in true leaves. Copper did not change calcium, iron, manganese and zinc concentrations. Magnesium, potassium, phosphorus decreased while sulfur increased in Petri dish grown seedlings exposed to copper sulfate and copper nitrate. ^ We identified various ultrastructural changes of cotyledons and true leaves due to copper toxicity including separation of the cell membranes from cell walls, denser cytoplasm with dark aggregates in epidermis, parenchyma, and developing phloem as well as increased vacuolization, swelling of chloroplasts and disarray of thylakoid membranes. Plasmolysis was evident beginning with 100 ppm of both copper sulfate and copper nitrate. Elemental analysis confirmed the presence of copper in experimental samples. ...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this project}} were to {{investigate}} the cellular stress response (CSR) in Enteromorpha spp. and assess {{the potential of the}} Stress- 70 protein (an indicator of the CSR) as a biomarker of pollutant exposure and acquired tolerance in Enteromorpha spp., compared with conventional physiological endpoints of toxicity. Cross-reactivity of a commercial Stress- 70 antibody with E. intestinalis proteins was determined and used to develop an assay for Stress- 70. Using this assay E. intestinalis was found to exhibit a typical heat shock response. Stress- 70 proved to be a relatively insensitive biomarker of copper exposure and {{did not appear to be}} involved in copper tolerance, the genetic basis of which was investigated by growing E. intestinalis using a novel culturing technique. Although growth was variable, it provided a simple, consistent and sensitive measure of <b>copper</b> toxicity. The <b>chlorophyll</b> fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm was insensitive to copper exposure. Nutrient limitation enhanced copper toxicity and significantly impaired growth, Fv/Fm and Stress- 70 production in E. intestinalis. In both copper ‘sensitive’ and ‘tolerant’ E. intestinalis, copper exposure did not affect the ability to raise a heat shock response. In ‘sensitive’ algae, copper and heat shock were additive stressors, with heat shock acting as a stronger inducer of Stress- 70. Only heat shock affected 'tolerant' algae. Zinc was less toxic than copper but in contrast to copper studies, Stress- 70 was a relatively sensitive indicator of zinc exposure, compared to Fv/Fm and growth. Studies of triazine herbicides revealed that on a molarity basis, Irgarol 1051 was more toxic to E. intestinalis than atrazine. Fv/Fm and growth were strongly affected by Irgarol exposure, but Stress- 70 levels were unaltered by exposure to the herbicide. Fv/Fm and Stress- 70 were poor in situ biomarkers of pollution, but another chlorophyll fluorescence parameter - complementary area - appeared to correlate with levels of organic pollution. Overall, Stress- 70 was found not to be a useful biomarker of exposure to copper or triazines in E. intestinalis, or in situ pollution. However, the Stress- 70 assay developed has a number of alternative applications and Enteromorpha spp. were deemed to be potentially useful in pollution monitoring with the selection of suitable biomarker responses...|$|R
