5000|$|Summer tea {{equipment}} {{consisted of}} [...] "katade" [...] bowls that were 5 cm tall and 12 cm wide. The dimensions exposed a maximum surface area {{to aid in}} cooling boiled water. Hot water would be poured into the bowls, allowed to cool a bit, then poured into a teapot. The water was cooled because pouring boiling hot water over tea leaves extracts {{too much of the}} bitter taste and results in a bitter tea. With two hands, the tea would be poured into smaller matching cups with covers, placed on a rough wood or lacquer table. The tea was drunk by lifting the <b>cup</b> <b>cover</b> while drinking so as not to show the open mouth. Tea would be taken cool.|$|E
