50|$|The {{pontoons}} are catamarans with rectangular shaped twin flat-bottomed hulls. The twin hulls {{are connected}} by trusses of round pipes with a steel deck covering the transverse beams. Each hull {{is divided into}} eight watertight compartments. The pontoons have hydro-pneumatic fenders on both sides to facilitate high energy absorption and low reaction loads. Two vertical roller fenders are located at the forward and aft corners, on the side, for <b>corner</b> <b>protection.</b> They are intended for berthing vessels having displacement up to 40,000 tons on a jetty by serving as spacers between the jetty and the ship.|$|E
40|$|A {{reinforced}} outer concrete containment tank exposed for liquefied {{natural gas}} {{was the basis for}} this study. The containment tank was analysed both linearly and non-linearly by use of two different finite element programs; Abaqus and Sestra/ShellDesign. The main goal for {{this study was to examine}} whether a given concrete containment tank would fulfil the formal rules and regulations regarding, the residual compressive zone and the crack width limitation, without a thermal <b>corner</b> <b>protection.</b> Non-linear analyses were carried out by use of temperature dependent material properties. The results showed an acceptable residual compressive zone for both the wall and the slab, but the required limit crack width was exceeded by 100 % (0. 5 mm). The residual compressive zone will ensure impermeability and the outer containment tank will withstand a major leak event. Abaqus proved itself to be a good tool for non-linear analysis due to a cryogenic condition. The results from Abaqus were compared to a similar model created and analysed with Sestra/ShellDesign. Some unfavourable peak values was found at the edges of the thermal load. The non-linear reinforcement stresses were however reliable for the tests ran without any concrete tensile capacity, and should be considered a solid basis for further studies for Sestra/ ShellDesign due to a cryogenic liquid spill condition. </p...|$|E
50|$|The 1987 {{race was}} {{restarted}} twice due to accidents {{on the narrow}} pit-straight grid; and this track was also deemed too dangerous by FIA standards, because {{of the amount of}} high-speed <b>corners,</b> lack of <b>protection</b> from trees and embankments and accidents at the start of many races on the narrow and confined pit straight. Increasing speeds were also a growing problem at the Österreichring, polesitter Nelson Piquet averaged 159.457 mph (255.756 km/h) in his 1,100 hp Honda-powered Williams. Piquet finished second to his teammate, Briton Nigel Mansell. Attempts to bring the race back were unsuccessful, and the event disappeared for a decade.|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{performed}} in cooperation between Chalmers University of Technology and Supply Chain and Packaging Concepts at IKEA in Sweden, focusing {{on the development of}} a load carrying product called Load Protection Panel. The work dealt with dimensions and choice of material, which are restricted by the compatibility with various equipments and prevailing environmental condition within the supply chain of IKEA. The study was based on two methodologies from Industrial Design Engineering and Advanced Engineering Materials, combining a methodology for assessing requirements and performing the development process with understanding materials character and assessing material properties. The first task was to study the complex supply chain by conducting field observations in combination with semi-structural interviews with users of this product. The results combined with a functional and cause analysis provided a basis for a detailed requirement specification, expressing the identified needs. The specification was extended by including critical material properties. The material study indicated recycled PET and virgin PP as the two interesting alternative materials. Recycled PET was mechanically characterized in order to investigate the difference between the recycled material and the virgin one. Measured properties were used in a finite element analysis (FEA) of the mechanical behavior of the conceptual design, mainly simulations of the critical stresses for LPP made of both PP and recycled PET. Two new concepts were then generated based on feedback from IKEA with some new requirements and changes of the importance levels of some existing requirements. The most important improvement needed was an increase of the load carrying capacity if using both recycled PET and PP as. Consequently, a parametric redesign resulted in a new design, used for further encouraging finite element method simulation. An improvement in the load capacity was simulated, which resulted in new concepts combining both new design and using PP and recycled PET. The final concepts were evaluated by means of their expected ability to meet the adjusted requirement specification. The new design with reduced overall thickness is recommended for the HM, with a reservation for the processability that needs to be verified by a mold designer. For the final material choice between virgin PP and recycled PET, it is pointed out that PET provides relatively good mechanical property but with a more challenging processability compared to PP, and that PP provides important benefits such as a lower density and the integration of <b>corner</b> <b>protections</b> when secured with plastic straps. For final selection of material, it still remains to evaluate prototypes, particularly regarding the creep resistance and the possibility to reuse...|$|R
40|$|Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) has {{developed}} the world’s largest above-ground full containment LNG storage tank with a gross capacity of 200, 000 m 3. The main {{objective of the}} development of the large capacity LNG storage tank is to reduce the construction cost and the boil-off gas and use the tank building site more effectively. The large tank was designed for the KOGAS ’ Tongyoung and Pyeongtaek LNG Receiving Terminals. The design work was done through numerous structural, thermal and seismic analyses. The tank consists of 9 % nickel steel inner tank, pre-stressed concrete outer tank, suspended ceiling deck, secondary bottom and <b>corner</b> <b>protection</b> system, and bottom heating system. The design boil-off rate (BOR) used in the design is 0. 05 % in volume per day. The inner tank has a diameter of 84 m and the thickness of shell insulation is 1200 mm. The 9 % nickel steel plates with a thickness of 32. 9 mm were used for the first course of inner shell. The design was used for the construction of new tanks in the Tongyoung and Pyeongtaek LNG Receiving Terminals. This paper introduces the basic design concept and features of the large capacity 9 % nicke...|$|E
