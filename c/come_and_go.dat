5|$|Some traditions {{also hold}} that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner; {{after the first}} {{invitation}} they can <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> as they please. Though folkloric vampires {{were believed to be}} more active at night, they were not generally considered vulnerable to sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Once out of politics, Rutherford {{returned}} to his law practice. His partnership with Jamieson saw partners <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go.</b> Rutherford divided his time between the original Strathcona office and the Edmonton office he opened in 1910; his practice focussed on contracts, real estate, wills and estates, and incorporations. In 1923, Rutherford's son Cecil joined the firm along with Stanley Harwood McCuaig, who in 1919 would marry Rutherford's daughter Hazel. In 1925, Jamieson left the partnership to establish his own firm. In 1939, McCuaig did the same. Cecil's partnership with his father continued until the latter's death.|$|E
50|$|This {{is still}} {{the right of the}} real chief of Niuatoputapu. He will send out two of his matāpule (official chiefly spokesmen) to throw kava roots in the sea. That will attract two suckerfish, who are the matāpule of Seketoa. They will <b>come</b> <b>and</b> then <b>go.</b> Then a small shark <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes.</b> <b>And</b> a medium shark <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes.</b> <b>And</b> finally a big shark comes. That is Seketoa, and Māatu will speak to him.|$|R

5|$|The {{school has}} a closed campus. When {{students}} were free to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> as they pleased, many would not return after leaving for lunch. Now students must arrive by 8 a.m. and remain until noon, or arrive by 1 p.m. and stay until 5 p.m. Exceptions are granted for students in job programs, or who must {{take care of their}} family. To meet student needs the school has social workers, counselors, special education teachers, educational assistants, and on-the-job training.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers of {{the time}} {{reported}} that the society promoted free love, but the society promoted free love only {{in the sense that}} consenting adults had a right to change partners and even to have more than one partner at a time. Rather than promiscuousness, though, the society promoted tolerance, including tolerance of homosexuality. The Spirit Fruit Society, unlike most other communitarian groups of that time, did not seek to convert or recruit others to the group. Members were permitted to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> as they pleased. The goal of the commune was not to convert or to expand membership in the society—it was simply to live as the adherents wished to live.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{remained}} in Germany {{in support of}} V Corps for almost 25 years, seeing no deployments. It underwent a shuffling of units as several of its battalions were reassigned elsewhere {{following the end of}} the Cold War in 1990, and it gained new battalions from units deactivating elsewhere. Though three of the brigade's subordinate battalions deployed to support Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, the brigade headquarters itself {{remained in}} Germany {{along with the rest of}} V Corps. The operations were conducted by VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps, which had significant engineer assets of their own. Throughout the early 1990s, the brigade would continue to see units <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> from its command as they were transferred from the restructuring 18th Engineer Brigade and the deactivating 7th Engineer Brigade.|$|E

5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E
5|$|At Ostend, Vindictive did prevent larger {{warships}} {{passing through}} the channel, although smaller craft could still <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> at will. The larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918. The blockages at Ostend and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921. On a strategic scale {{the effects of the}} raids at Ostend and Zeebrugge on the battle of the Atlantic were negligible. Despite this, in Britain the Ostend Raid was feted as a success. Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it as a fine example of daring and careful planning from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at {{one of the most critical}} moments of the war.|$|E
5|$|At that point, a {{group of}} aristocrats persuaded the Despot Andronikos to seek the {{assistance}} of the Republic of Venice, an initiative probably taken without consulting Constantinople. In spring 1423, via the Venetian colony of Negroponte, he informed the Venetians of his intention. The only conditions Andronikos attached to his offer were that the property, customs and privileges of the city's inhabitants, their right to trade and <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> freely, and the position of the city's Orthodox Church, were respected, and that Venice would pledge to defend the city against the Ottomans. Pseudo-Sphrantzes claims that Andronikos sold the city for 50,000 ducats, and this statement was often accepted by more recent scholars until the mid-20th century. However, this is not mentioned by any other source, nor is it found in the original documents pertaining to the affair, as shown by the scholars Konstantinos Mertzios and Paul Lemerle. On the other hand, the Venetian envoys appointed to oversee the handover were authorised to provide a sum of between 20,000 and 40,000 aspers from the revenue of the city as a yearly subsidy to Andronikos, should he request it.|$|E

5|$|Each {{state was}} allowed to cast a single vote either for or against a {{proposal}} during the debates {{in accordance with the}} majority opinion of the state's delegates. Throughout the Convention, delegates would regularly <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> with only 30–40 being present on a typical day. Consequently, if a state's delegates were equally divided in their views on a given proposal, or if too few of the state's delegates were in attendance to establish a quorum for the delegation when votes were being cast on a particular proposal, that state's delegation had essentially no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposal. Thus, for example, after two of New York's three delegates abandoned the Convention in mid July with no intention of returning, New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the Convention, although Hamilton would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during the debates.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 Pedro de Alvarado sent a {{small company}} to conquer Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo), {{the capital of the}} Poqomam. At the Spanish approach, the {{inhabitants}} remained enclosed in the fortified city. The Spanish attempted an approach from the west through a narrow pass but were forced back with heavy losses. Alvarado himself launched the second assault with 200 Tlaxcalan allies but was also beaten back. The Poqomam then received reinforcements, possibly from Chinautla, and the two armies clashed on open ground outside of the city. The battle was chaotic and lasted {{for most of the day}} but was finally decided by the Spanish cavalry, forcing the Poqomam reinforcements to withdraw. The leaders of the reinforcements surrendered to the Spanish three days after their retreat and revealed that the city had a secret entrance in the form of a cave leading up from a nearby river, allowing the inhabitants to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
5|$|The farmer, or {{specifically}} the small landowner-cultivator, was ranked just below scholars and {{officials in the}} social hierarchy. Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as tenants, wage laborers, and in rare cases slaves. Artisans and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants. State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and {{more powerful than the}} vast majority of government officials. Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers could <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> from their master's home as they pleased. Medical physicians, pig breeders, and butchers had a fairly high social status, while occultist diviners, runners, and messengers had low status.|$|E

25|$|The Shahnameh {{provides}} a poetic {{account of the}} prehistory and history of Iran, beginning {{with the creation of}} the world and the introduction of the arts of civilization (fire, cooking, metallurgy, law), and ending with the Islamic Conquest of Persia. The work is not precisely chronological, but there is a general movement through time. Some of the characters live for hundreds of years but most have normal life spans. There are many shāhs who <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> as well as heroes and villains, who also <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go.</b> The only lasting images are those of Greater Persia itself, and of a succession of sunrises and sunsets, no two ever exactly alike, yet illustrative of the passage of time.|$|E
25|$|Hernias {{are caused}} by a {{disruption}} or opening in the fascia, or fibrous tissue, which forms the abdominal wall. It is possible for the bulge associated with a hernia to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> but the defect in the tissue will persist.|$|E
