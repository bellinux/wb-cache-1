We examine {{a number of possible}} implication of <b>capital</b> flows and <b>turnover</b> on <b>capital</b> returns testing for evidence of a price pressure effect, ‘return chasing’ behaviour and information revelation. The main tool of analysis is a panel vector autoregressive (VAR) regression model in which institutional <b>capital</b> flows, <b>turnover</b> and returns are specified as endogenous variables in a two equation system in which we also control for macro-economic variables. Data on flows, turnover and returns are obtained for the 10 market segments covering the main UK commercial real estate sectors. Our results do not support the widely-held belief among practitioners that capital flows have a ‘price pressure’ effect. Although there is some evidence of return chasing behaviour, the short timescales involved suggest this finding may be due to delayed recording of flows relative to returns given the difficulties of market entry. We find a significant positive relationship between lagged <b>turnover</b> and contemporaneous <b>capital</b> returns, suggesting that asset turnover provides pricing information. ...|$|R

The long-term economic potential of future options is highly uncertain, and utilities are likely to respond to this by maintaining flexibility in fuel choices and avoid large investments that lock them into a specific compliance method before more efficient and cleaner technologies have crystallized.

Time series data from 1978 - 2008 were employed.
