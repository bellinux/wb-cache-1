It {{was the last}} of several attempts to depart on his mission; previous efforts had to be called off due to mechanical problems or poor weather. Wearing a leather flying suit bearing the rank of captain, he brought along a supply of money and toiletries, a torch, a camera, maps and charts, and a collection of 28 different medicines, as well as dextrose tablets to help ward off fatigue and an assortment of homeopathic remedies.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} {{the age of}} the Universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a <b>check</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of {{the age of the}} Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E
5|$|They {{awake in}} Dr. Noah's lair at the {{pinnacle}} of Mount Everest. Noah (Sisko) enters and gives a monologue about how he will destroy the world, and shows a big red button he will push to do it. He has Bashir and Garak taken below ground, where they are handcuffed to a laser. As the time ticks down before the laser is activated, Bare performs a final <b>check</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laser. Bashir flirts for her, and she slips him a key and hurries out. Bashir unlocks himself and Garak, who protests that it is too dangerous to continue as the safeties are turned off in the program which could result in their deaths. Garak is about to close the program and kill the other crew members when Bashir shoots him, grazing him with a bullet. Garak is shocked, but impressed and agrees to continue the programme. Bashir is concerned as he knows the program will end with either the death of Professor Bare or Colonel Komananov following the defeat of Noah.|$|E

25|$|Since the 2003 reforms {{subsidies}} {{have been}} linked to the size of farms, so farmers get the same for a hectare of land regardless of how much land they own. So while subsidies allow small farms to exist, large farms tend to get the larger share of the subsidies. With the 2008 Health <b>Check</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CAP, a first step was taken towards limiting CAP payments to very large landowners.|$|E

25|$|People with OCD can use rationalizations {{to explain}} their {{behavior}}; however, these rationalizations {{do not apply to}} the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more <b>check</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is still not sure and deems it is still better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{the lower}} {{extremities}} begins with a visual inspection. Color, presence of hair, visible veins, size and any sores or ulcerations are noted. Lack of hair may indicate an arterial circulation problem. Given swelling, the calf circumference is measured for reference as time continues. Elevating the legs may reduce or eliminate the swelling. Palpation of the ankle can determine the degree of swelling. Assessment includes a <b>check</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popliteal, femoral, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses. The inguinal nodes may be enlarged. Enlargement of the nodes lasting {{more than three weeks}} may indicate infection or some other disease process requiring further medical attention.|$|E
25|$|Intervention {{mechanisms}} {{have diminished}} significantly, for instance the Commission only intervenes on: common wheat, butter, and skimmed milk powder. The Health <b>Check</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CAP agreed in November 2008 has added {{on a number}} of measures to help the farmers to respond better to signals from the markets and to face new challenges. Among a range of measures, the agreement abolishes arable set-aside, increases milk quotas gradually leading up to their abolition in 2015, and converts market intervention into a genuine safety net. Ministers also agreed to increase modulation, whereby direct payments to farmers are reduced and the money transferred to the Rural Development Fund.|$|E

25|$|A <b>check</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pet's gums {{and skin}} can {{indicate}} dehydration; gums become tacky and dry and skin does not snap back quickly when pinched if dehydration is present. When the skin {{at the back}} is lifted, a dehydrated animal's does not fall back into place quickly. Serious dehydration (loss of 10ndash&12% of body fluids) means the pulled up skin stays there and does not go back into place. At this point, the animal may go into shock; dehydration of 12% or more is an immediate medical emergency. Hypovolemic shock is a life-threatening medical condition in which the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to the body, due to loss of fluids.|$|E
25|$|Pre-facelift vs Facelift. In {{respect of}} FTO ownership, {{there is some}} {{division}} in preference for the styling of the front bumper - either Pre-facelift, or Facelift. Interchanging these units is a relatively simple matter and, as the latter version models have become write-offs over the years, there are many pre-facelift models now {{on the road that}} are sporting newer facelift bumpers. Future purchasers of an FTO should be aware of this. A simple <b>check</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VIN Plate details, or the period of manufacture to be found on the seat-belt tags, should resolve any uncertainty as to the origin of the model-build. Apart from body styling, there are other less apparent differences in the Facelift models, such as uprated ECU and also distinct variations to the drive shaft units across the range. Such as 25 or 27-spline shafts and CV cup variants, as well as fitment for ABS or non-ABS shafts and bearings for same.|$|E

In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich. The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John A. Szyc. In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set. She added that investigators had informed her the month following his disappearance that her son had apparently sold his Plymouth Satellite to a John Gacy. Investigators noted that one of Gacy's employees, Michael Rossi, drove a similar car to Szyc's: A <b>check</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VIN confirmed the car driven by Rossi had belonged to Szyc.|$|E
