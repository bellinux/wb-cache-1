5|$|Studies {{propagating}} TSE infectivity in <b>cell-free</b> {{reactions and}} in purified component chemical reactions {{is thought to}} strongly suggest against TSE viral nature. However, some viruses, such as Poliovirus, {{have the ability to}} replicate in <b>cell-free</b> reactions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cell-free</b> fetal DNA {{is found}} in the blood of the mother, and can be sequenced to {{determine}} {{a great deal of information}} about the developing fetus.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: <b>cell-free</b> spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the <b>cell-free</b> spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
5|$|They used a <b>cell-free</b> {{system to}} {{translate}} a poly-uracil RNA sequence (i.e., UUUUU...) {{and discovered that}} the polypeptide that they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine. They thereby deduced that the codon UUU specified the amino acid phenylalanine.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{prenatal}} {{tests for}} chromosomal abnormalities such as Down Syndrome rely on analysing {{the number and}} appearance of the chromosomesthe karyotype. Molecular diagnostics tests such as microarray comparative genomic hybridisation test a sample of DNA instead, and because of <b>cell-free</b> DNA in plasma, could be less invasive, but as of 2013 it is still an adjunct to the conventional tests.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: <b>cell-free</b> spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the <b>cell-free</b> spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than <b>cell-free</b> virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
5|$|In addition, in at-risk pregnancies {{due to an}} {{affected}} male partner, non-invasive {{prenatal diagnosis}} can be performed by analyzing <b>cell-free</b> fetal DNA in a blood sample taken from the mother (via venipuncture) between six and twelve weeks of pregnancy. It has no procedure-related risk of miscarriage (excepting via needle contamination).|$|E
5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because <b>cell-free</b> nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on nucleic acids detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} {{has several}} limitations: {{the concentration of}} all <b>cell-free</b> DNA in maternal blood is low, {{the total amount of}} <b>cell-free</b> DNA varies between individuals, cell free fetal DNA molecules are out-numbered by maternal <b>cell-free</b> DNA molecules, the fetus inherits half the genome from the mother. However, there are ways around these limitations.|$|E
25|$|Protocols for {{isolation}} of plasma from maternal blood include centrifugation, followed by isolation and purification of <b>cell-free</b> DNA. A standardized protocol by Legler et al. {{was created in}} 2007 from evaluation of previous primary literature. The highest yield for extraction of <b>cell-free</b> DNA was obtained with QIAamp DSP Virus Kit.|$|E
25|$|In another semiquantitative {{technique}} {{cells are}} overlaid the test substance {{and changes in}} opalescence of the originally <b>cell-free</b> compartment is recorded during the incubation time.|$|E
25|$|As {{a method}} of {{prenatal}} diagnosis, <b>cell-free</b> fetal DNA techniques share the same ethical and practical issues, such as the possibility of prenatal sex discernment and sex selection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cell-free</b> fetal DNA (cffDNA) is fetal DNA {{circulating}} {{freely in}} the maternal blood stream. It can be sampled by venipuncture on the mother. Analysis of cffDNA provides {{a method of}} non-invasive prenatal diagnosis and testing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cell-free</b> fetal DNA can be {{used for}} whole genome sequencing, thus {{determining}} the complete DNA sequence of every gene of the baby. This will be more clinically useful in the future, as large numbers of scientific studies continue to be published detailing clear associations between specific genetic variants and disease.|$|E
25|$|CAncer Personalized Profiling by deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq) is a {{sensitive}} method used to quantify DNA in cancer. It measures <b>Cell-free</b> tumor DNA which is released from dead tumor cells into the blood. This method can be generalized for any cancer type {{that is known}} to have recurrent mutations. CAPP-Seq can detect one molecule of mutant DNA in 10,000 molecules of healthy DNA.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} blood {{substitutes}} have been explored (and still are), but thus far they all suffer from many challenges. Most {{attempts to find}} a suitable alternative to blood thus far have concentrated on <b>cell-free</b> hemoglobin solutions. Blood substitutes could make transfusions more readily available in emergency medicine and in pre-hospital EMS care. If successful, such a blood substitute could save many lives, particularly in trauma where massive blood loss results. Hemopure, a hemoglobin-based therapy, is approved for use in South Africa.|$|E
25|$|HxA3 was {{converted}} through a Michael addition catalyzed by glutathione transferase to its glutathione conjugate, HxA3-C, i.e., 11-glutathionyl-HxA3, in a <b>cell-free</b> system or in homogenates of rat brain hippocampus tissue; HxA3-C {{proved to be}} a potent stimulator of membrane hyperpolarization in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. This formation of hepoxilin A3-C appears analogous to the formation of leukotriene C4 by the conjugation of glutathione to leukotriene A4. Glutathione conjugates of 14,15-HxA3 and 14,15-HxB3 have also been detected the human Hodgkin disease Reed–Sternberg cell line, L1236.|$|E
25|$|Addition of {{formaldehyde}} to maternal {{blood samples}} increases {{the percentage of}} free fetal DNA. The purpose of formaldehyde is to stabilize intact cells, and inhibit further release of maternal DNA. The mean percentage of free fetal DNA in maternal blood ranges from 0.32% to 40%, with a mean percentage of 7.7 without formaldehyde-treatment. The mean percentage of free fetal DNA with formaldehyde treatment was 20.2%. However, Benachi et al. in 2005 and Chinnapapagari et al. 2005 have highlighted the range of results from 5% to 96%. Another way to increase the fetal DNA is based on physical length of DNA fragments. Fetal DNA is smaller in size, and can comprise up to 70% of total <b>cell-free</b> DNA.|$|E
25|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} {{cell proliferation}} {{may arise from}} miR-21 interaction with MAP2K3, a tumor repressor gene. Optimal treatment for cancer involves accurately identifying patients for risk-stratified therapy. Those with a rapid response to initial treatment may benefit from truncated treatment regimens, showing the value of accurate disease response measures. <b>Cell-free</b> miRNA are highly stable in blood, are overexpressed in cancer and are quantifiable within the diagnostic laboratory. In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, plasma miR-21, miR-494, and miR-1973 are promising disease response biomarkers. Circulating miRNAs {{have the potential to}} assist clinical decision making and aid interpretation of positron emission tomography combined with computerized tomography. They can be performed at each consultation to assess disease response and detect relapse.|$|E
25|$|Glycosyltransferases {{have been}} widely used in the both {{targeted}} synthesis of specific glycoconjugates as well as the synthesis of differentially glycosylated libraries of drugs, biological probes or natural products in the context of drug discovery and drug development (a process known as glycorandomization). Suitable enzymes can be isolated from natural sources or produced recombinantly. As an alternative, whole cell-based systems using either endogenous glycosyl donors or cell-based systems containing cloned and expressed systems for synthesis of glycosyl donors have been developed. In <b>cell-free</b> approaches, the large-scale application of glycosyltransferases for glycoconjugate synthesis has required access to large quantities of the glycosyl donors. On the flip-side, nucleotide recycling systems that allow the resynthesis of glycosyl donors from the released nucleotide have been developed. The nucleotide recycling approach has a further benefit of reducing the amount of nucleotide formed as a by-product, thereby reducing the amount of inhibition caused to the glycosyltransferase of interest – a commonly observed feature of the nucleotide byproduct.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities in the {{maternal}} {{immune system and}} insufficiency of gestational immune tolerance seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward Th1 responses {{and the production of}} IFN-γ. The origin of IFN-γ is not clearly identified and could be the natural killer cells of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of T helper cells, alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of regulatory T cells in pregnancy. Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers. It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal erythroblasts as well as <b>cell-free</b> fetal DNA are increased in {{the maternal}} circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia. These findings have given rise to the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is a disease process by which a placental lesion such as hypoxia allows increased fetal material into the maternal circulation, that in turn leads to an immune response and endothelial damage, and that ultimately results in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.|$|E
25|$|In 1945 Leloir {{ended his}} exile and {{returned}} to Argentina to work under Houssay at the Instituto de Investigaciones Bioquímicas de la Fundación Campomar, which Leloir would direct from its creation in 1947 by businessman and patron Jaime Campomar. Initially, the institute was composed of five rooms, a bathroom, central hall, patio, kitchen, and changing room. During {{the final years of}} the 1940s, although lacking financial resources and operating with very low-cost teams, Leloir's successful experiments would reveal the chemical origins of sugar synthesis in yeast as well as the oxidation of fatty acids in the liver; together with J. M. Munoz, he produced an active <b>cell-free</b> system, a first in scientific research. It had initially been assumed that in order to study a cell, scientists could not separate it from its host organism, as oxidation could only occur in intact cells. Along the way, Muñoz and Leloir, unable to procure the costly centrifuge needed to separate cell contents, improvised by spinning a tire stuffed with salt and ice.|$|E
25|$|Aneuploidy, {{which refers}} to {{abnormal}} number of chromosomes, can also be detected using non-invasive prenatal tests. Research previous shown an increase in quantity of cffDNA in maternal plasma for fetal trisomy 13 and trisomy 21, {{and it is not}} elevated in fetal trisomy 18. A number of fetal nucleic acid molecules derived from aneuploid chromosomes can be detected including SERPINEB2 mRNA, clad B, hypomethylated SERPINB5 from chromosome 18, placenta-specific 4 (PLAC4), hypermethylated holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) and c21orf105 mRNA from chromosome 12. With complete trisomy, the mRNA alleles in maternal plasma isn't the normal 1:1 ratio, but is in fact 2:1. Allelic ratios determined by epigenetic markers {{can also be used to}} detect the complete trisomies. Massive parallel sequencing and digital PCR for fetal aneuploidy detection can be used without restriction to fetal-specific nucleic acid molecules. Several <b>cell-free</b> fetal DNA and RNA technologies are under development to test a pregnancy for aneuploidy, mostly focusing on Down syndrome testing. Sampling of cffDNA from maternal blood for analysis by massively parallel sequencing (MPSS) is estimated to have a sensitivity of between 96 and 100%, and a specificity between 94 and 100% for detecting Down syndrome. It can be performed at 10 weeks of gestational age. One study in the United States estimated a false positive rate of 0.3% and a positive predictive value of 80% when using cffDNA to detect Down syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Mixing {{of fetal}} cells {{carrying}} paternal RhD antigens into maternal blood {{may result in}} the sensitization of an RhD-negative mother. Rhesus blood group (D antigen) is {{used to determine the}} risk of hemolytic disease in the fetus. In hemolytic disease, the maternal antibodies destroy RhD-positive fetal red blood cells. This leads to lethality for the fetus. A significant amount of blood can be exchanged between mother and infant during birth, CVS, amniocentesis and accidents. 50 defined antigens on the surface of red blood cells indicate Rhesus blood group and E antigens {{are one of the most}} important. RHD gene determines the Rhesus D status. Chinen et al. 2010 shows that 15% of Caucasian females, 3-5% of black African females and <3% of Asian females are RhD-negative. In the United Kingdom and other countries, cffDNA tests are now routinely being offered to RhD-negative patients at increased risk of isoimmunization. Anti-RhD immune globulin, a blood derivative, is only offered in the event of a RhD-positive fetus for these women (21, 48, 54). In United States, prophylactic treatment is recommended for all RhD-negative pregnant women to prevent isoimmunization in case of RhD incompatibility. In the United States, amniocentesis still serves as the gold standard diagnostic tool for those women who require antenatal fetal blood genotyping, but it has been suggested that technology using <b>cell-free</b> fetal DNA may ultimately replace this invasive procedure.|$|E
500|$|Direct {{translation}} from DNA to protein {{has been}} demonstrated in a <b>cell-free</b> system (i.e. in a test tube), using extracts from E. coli that contained ribosomes, but not intact cells. [...] These cell fragments could synthesize proteins from single-stranded DNA templates isolated from other organisms (e,g., mouse or toad), and neomycin was found to enhance this effect. However, {{it was unclear whether}} this mechanism of translation corresponded specifically to the genetic code.|$|E
500|$|Eduard Buchner {{submitted}} {{his first}} {{paper on the}} study of yeast extracts in 1897. In a series of experiments at the University of Berlin, he found that sugar was fermented by yeast extracts even when there were no living yeast cells in the mixture. He named the enzyme that brought about the fermentation of sucrose [...] "zymase". In 1907, he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for [...] "his discovery of <b>cell-free</b> fermentation". Following Buchner's example, enzymes are usually named according to the reaction they carry out: the suffix -ase is combined with the name of the substrate (e.g., lactase is the enzyme that cleaves lactose) or to the type of reaction (e.g., DNA polymerase forms DNA polymers).|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>cell-free</b> DNA in the maternal plasma has {{allowed for the}} non-invasive determination of the fetal RHD genotype. [...] In May 2017, the Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology of Canada is now recommending that the optimal management of the D-negative pregnant woman {{is based on the}} prediction of the fetal D-blood group by <b>cell-free</b> DNA in maternal plasma with targeted antenatal anti-D prophylaxis. [...] This provides the optimal care for D-negative pregnant women and has been adopted as the standard approach in a growing number of countries around the world. [...] It is no longer considered appropriate to treat all D-negative pregnant women with human plasma derivatives when there are no benefits to her or to the fetus in a substantial percentage of cases.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cell-free</b> fetal DNA (cffDNA) {{testing is}} a {{non-invasive}} (for the fetus) test.

2500|$|In the mid-1900s, Hestrin et al. {{proved the}} {{necessity}} of glucose and oxygen in the synthesis of bacterial cellulose. Soon after, Colvin detected cellulose synthesis in samples containing <b>cell-free</b> extract of A. xylinum, glucose and ATP. In 1949, the microfibrillar structure of bacterial cellulose was characterized by Muhlethaler. [...] Further bacterial cellulose studies have led to new uses and applications for the material.|$|E
2500|$|Bone - {{being one}} of the most {{resistant}} materials to the process of fossilisation - often preserves internal detail, which allows the histology and growth of the scales to be studied in detail. The scales consist of a non-growing [...] "crown" [...] composed of dentine, with a sometimes-ornamented enameloid upper surface and an aspidine (acellular bony tissue) base. Its growing base is made of <b>cell-free</b> bone, which sometimes developed anchorage structures to fix it {{in the side of the}} fish. Beyond that, there appear to be five types of bone-growth, which may represent five natural groupings within the thelodonts - or a spectrum ranging between the end members, meta- (or ortho-) dentine and mesodentine tissues. Interestingly, each of the five scale morphs appears to resemble the scales of more derived groupings of fish, suggesting that thelodont groups may have been stem groups to succeeding clades of fish.|$|E
2500|$|... cffDNA {{originates}} {{from the}} trophoblasts {{making up the}} placenta. An average of 11%-13.4% of <b>cell-free</b> DNA in maternal blood is of fetal origin, although this varies widely amongst patients. The fetal DNA is fragmented and makes {{its way into the}} maternal bloodstream via shedding of the placental microparticles into the maternal bloodstream (figure 1). Studies have shown that cffDNA can first be observed as early as 7 weeks gestation, and the amount of cffDNA increases as the pregnancy progresses. cffDNA diminishes quickly after the birth of the baby, so that it is no longer detectable in the maternal blood approximately 2 hours after birth. cffDNA fragments are significantly smaller than the maternal DNA fragments in the bloodstream, with cffDNA fragments being approximately 200bp (base pairs) in size. Many protocols to extract the fetal DNA from the maternal plasma use its size to distinguish it from the maternal DNA.|$|E
2500|$|At its {{broadest}} definition, biochemistry {{can be seen}} as a {{study of}} the components, and composition of living things and how they come together to become life, and the history of biochemistry may therefore go back as far as the ancient Greeks. However, biochemistry as a specific scientific discipline has its beginning sometime in the 19th century, or a little earlier, depending on which aspect of biochemistry is being focused on. Some argued that the beginning of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first enzyme, diastase (today called amylase), in 1833 by Anselme Payen, while others considered Eduard Buchner's first demonstration of a complex biochemical process alcoholic fermentation in <b>cell-free</b> extracts in 1897 to be the birth of biochemistry. [...] Some might also point as its beginning to the influential 1842 work by Justus von Liebig, Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology, which presented a chemical theory of metabolism, or even earlier to the 18th century studies on fermentation and respiration by Antoine Lavoisier. Many other pioneers in the field who helped to uncover the layers of complexity of biochemistry have been proclaimed founders of modern biochemistry, for example Emil Fischer for his work on the chemistry of proteins, and F. Gowland Hopkins on enzymes and the dynamic nature of biochemistry.|$|E

50|$|These {{initially}} confusing {{results can}} be explained by the concept of a plasma <b>cell-free</b> layer, a thin layer adjacent to the capillary wall that is depleted of red blood cells. Because the <b>cell-free</b> layer is red cell-poor, its effective viscosity is lower than that of whole blood. This layer therefore acts to reduce flow resistance within the capillary, with the net effect that the effective viscosity is less than that for whole blood. Because the <b>cell-free</b> layer is very thin (approximately 3 μm) this effect is insignificant in capillaries whose diameter is large.This explanation, while accurate, is ultimately unsatisfying, since it fails to answer the fundamental question of why a plasma <b>cell-free</b> layer exists. There are actually two factors which promote <b>cell-free</b> layer formation.|$|E
