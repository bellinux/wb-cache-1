25|$|The {{progressive}} improvement in canning stimulated the 1855 {{invention of the}} <b>can</b> <b>opener.</b> Robert Yeates, a cutlery and surgical instrument maker of Trafalgar Place West, Hackney Road, Middlesex, UK, devised a claw-ended <b>can</b> <b>opener</b> with a hand-operated tool that haggled its way {{around the top of}} metal cans. In 1858, another lever-type opener of a more complex shape was patented in the United States by Ezra Warner of Waterbury, Connecticut.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea for}} HSN {{had its roots}} in a radio station managed by Paxson. Due to an advertiser's {{liquidity}} problem in 1977, the company was paid in <b>can</b> <b>openers.</b> Left with having to raise the funds, on-air personality Bob Circosta went {{on the radio and}} sold the <b>can</b> <b>openers</b> for $9.95 each. The <b>can</b> <b>openers</b> sold out, and an industry was born. Circosta later became the new network's first ever home shopping host and would eventually sell 75,000 different products in over 20,000 hours of live television.|$|R

The cans were maintained a constant temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65Â°C).

The School of Literature, Drama, and Creative Writing would later go on to produce successful authors including Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, Rose Tremain, John Boyne and Andrew Miller. In the same decade UEA:TV, {{under the name of}} Nexus, was formed and created student-made television. It operated for two hours a day over lunchtime. Concrete, the student newspaper was first officially launched in 1973, replacing Mandate which launched in 1965.

25|$|Appert's {{method was}} so simple and {{workable}} that {{it quickly became}} widespread. In 1810, British inventor and merchant Peter Durand, also of French origin, patented his own method, but this time in a tin can, so creating the modern-day process of canning foods. In 1812, Englishmen Bryan Donkin and John Hall purchased both patents and began producing preserves. Just a decade later, Appert's method of canning had {{made its way to}} America. Tin can production was not common until the beginning of the 20th century, partly because a hammer and chisel were needed to open cans until the invention of a <b>can</b> <b>opener</b> by an inventor named Yates in 1855.|$|E
500|$|Warhol {{followed}} {{the success of}} his original series with several related works incorporating the same theme of Campbell's Soup cans subjects. These subsequent works along with the original are collectively referred to as the Campbell's Soup cans series and often simply as the Campbell's Soup cans. The subsequent Campbell's Soup can works were very diverse. The heights ranged from [...] to [...] Generally, the cans were portrayed as if they were freshly produced cans without flaws. Occasionally, he chose to depict cans with torn labels, peeling labels, crushed bodies, or opened lids like those in the images in this section. Sometimes he added related items like a bowl of soup or a <b>can</b> <b>opener,</b> such as the one in the image on the right. Sometimes he produced images of related items without any soup cans such as Campbell's Tomato Juice Box (above right), which are not strictly a part of the series although a part of the theme. Many of these works were produced at his famous studio [...] "The Factory." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>can</b> <b>opener</b> is {{a device}} used to open metal cans. Most non-electrical can openers today use the hand-cranked rotary version {{consisting}} of a wheel with serrated edges in order to pierce and cut the top of tin cans. The first rotary <b>can</b> <b>opener</b> with a cutting wheel was invented in 1870 by William W. Lyman, of Meriden, Connecticut, who received a U.S. Patent 105,346 on July 12, 1870. In 1925 the Star <b>Can</b> <b>Opener</b> Company of San Francisco improved on Lyman's wheel blade by adding a second, serrated or toothed wheel, called a [...] "feed wheel" [...] or [...] "turning gear" [...] to ride below {{the rim of the}} can and rotate the can against the cutting wheel.|$|E
5000|$|When the station's {{talk radio}} host, Bob Circosta, {{was on a}} newsbreak, Paxson asked Circosta to sell these <b>can</b> <b>openers</b> to his audience. Circosta {{initially}} objected, but soon complied with his Paxson's wishes. [...] "I looked at him like he had three heads," [...] Circosta said, recalling the moment. [...] "I {{thought it would be}} unethical because I was trying to be a serious host." [...] When Circosta returned to the airwaves, he began describing the <b>can</b> <b>openers</b> and asking listeners to buy them.|$|R

2500|$|The P-38, {{developed}} in 1942, {{is a small}} <b>can</b> <b>opener</b> that was issued in the canned field rations of the United States Armed Forces from World War II to the 1980s. [...] Originally designed for and distributed in the K-ration, it was later included in the C-ration. As of 2017, it is still in production and sold on a worldwide market.|$|E
2500|$|The P-38 {{is known}} as a [...] "John Wayne" [...] by the United States Marine Corps, either because of its {{toughness}} and dependability, or because of an unsubstantiated story that the actor had been shown in an as-yet-unidentified training film opening a can of K-Rations. The <b>can</b> <b>opener</b> is pocket-sized, approximately [...] long, and consists of a short metal blade that serves as a handle, with a small, hinged metal tooth that folds out to pierce the can lid. A notch just under the hinge point keeps the opener hooked around the rim of the can as the device is [...] "walked" [...] around to cut the lid out. A larger version called the P-51 is somewhat easier to operate. The handle portion can also double as a makeshift flat-blade screwdriver, with limited ability because of the rather soft sheet metal used. The P-51 is not an official Army <b>can</b> <b>opener</b> although it is often marketed as such.|$|E
2500|$|Official {{military}} designations for the P-38 include [...] "US ARMY POCKET CAN OPENER" [...] and [...] "OPENER, CAN, HAND, FOLDING, TYPE I". As {{with some}} other military terms, e.g., [...] "jeep", {{the origin of the}} term is not known with certainty; the P-38 opener coincidentally shares a designation with the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter plane, which could allude to its fast performance, additionally the P-51 <b>can</b> <b>opener</b> also has an aircraft namesake in the North American P-51 Mustang. One technical explanation for the origin of the name is that the P-38 is approximately 38 millimetres long. This explanation also holds for the P-51, which measures approximately [...] in length. [...] However, use of the metric system in the US was not widespread at this point, and United States Army sources indicate that the origin of the name is rooted in the 38 punctures around the circumference of a C-ration can required for opening.|$|E

2500|$|Vincent Canby {{praised the}} look of the film in his review for The New York Times, writing, [...] "the movie, which looks {{as if it had been}} made on an A-picture budget, has a lot of the zest one {{associates}} with special-effects-filled B-pictures". Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "This movie takes a lot of delight in being more psychologically complex than it has to be. It contains fights and shootouts and big chase scenes, but they're all firmly centered on who the characters are and what they mean to one another". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Jay Scott wrote, [...] "F/X is simply out to give a good time, which it does superbly". Paul Attanasio in his review for the Washington Post praised Brian Dennehy's performance: [...] "Dennehy brings magic to the role - he's large, and he enlarges it. With his sly eyes and little <b>can</b> <b>opener</b> of a nose, his shoulders a yard wide, his hair massing in gray curls behind his ears, he dances through the movie like a mastodon in toe shoes". In his review for The Sunday Times, George Perry praised the film's premise as a [...] "nice idea, but the effects themselves are merely ingenious when they might have been spectacular". Sheila Benson wrote in her review for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Where F/X floats above the crowd are in its performances; in the perfection of Miroslav Ondricek's photography, Mel Bourne's production design, John Stears' effects and Terry Rawlings' crisp, succinct editing; in the virtually unpredictable twists and turns of its plot, and in the sheer joy of watching a hero use his skill and his wits to solve a problem".|$|E
