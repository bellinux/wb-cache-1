2500|$|The {{proof of}} the theorem is thus {{a variant of the}} method of {{infinite}} descent and relies on the repeated application of Euclidean divisions on E: let P ∈ E(Q) be a rational point on the curve, writing P as the sum 2P1 + Q1 where Q1 is a fixed representant of P in E(Q)/2E(Q), the height of P1 is about [...] of the one of P (more generally, replacing 2 by any m > 1, and [...] by [...] ). Redoing the same with P1, that is to say P1 = 2P2 + Q2, then P2 = 2P3 + Q3, etc. finally expresses P as an integral linear <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> Qi and of points whose height is bounded by a fixed constant chosen in advance: by the weak Mordell–Weil theorem and the second property of the height function P is thus expressed as an integral linear combination of a finite number of fixed points.|$|E

To improve the accuracy and robustness, we exploit the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>point</b> and line features to aid navigation. The mathematical framework is based on trifocal geometry among image triplets, which is simple and unified for point and line features. For the fusion algorithm design, we employ the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for error state prediction and covariance propagation, and the Sigma Point Kalman Filter (SPKF) for robust measurement updating {{in the presence of}} high nonlinearities.

Paper brings few {{ideas about}} a concept <b>of</b> Minkowski <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>point</b> sets, {{which can be}} defined as {{generalisation}} of Minkowski set operations in the Euclidean space En. Minkowski sum and product <b>of</b> two <b>point</b> sets are used for definition of Minkowski set operators as special mappings in En, which can be used for modelling of manifolds in this space. Three distinguished types of Minkowski operators are introduced based on different <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> Minkowski sum and product <b>of</b> <b>point</b> sets...|$|R
40|$|Finite {{collections}} <b>of</b> <b>point</b> masses {{contained in}} some bounded domain produce a unique {{field in the}} exterior domain, {{which means that the}} associated basis functions (often called "fundamental solutions") are independent. A new proof of this result is given in this paper that can be generalized to other finite <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>point</b> source distributions. For example, this paper shows in R^ 3 that a finite <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>point</b> dipoles produces a unique field. The strategy employed in the paper is to develop results for analytic functions in the complex plane and then carry them over to harmonic functions in the real plane, and from there to harmonic functions in R^ 3. More results are shown for R^ 2 and for C than are shown for more general settings. For example, in the complex plane, the paper shows that a finite <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> higher order poles of any order in the interior of a unit disk always corresponds to a unique analytic function in the exterior of a unit disk.
