The microseparators are made in PDMS and are constituted of an array of microchannels 20 μm wide with three types of structure: straight microchannels, connected microchannels (or aligned square pillars) and staggered square pillars in order to mimic merely the complexity of the flow encountered in filters or membranes (tortuosity, connectivity between pores). Direct observation with video microscopy of filtrations of 5 μm latex particles has been performed to examine the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles.</b> The results show a piling up <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> within the porous media leading to a clogging.

At the same time, numerical simulations of filtration in parallel with microchannels have been performed in the same flow conditions with GeoDict software. The different kind of experimental deposit structure can be simulated, but there is still inaccuracy in the description of the accumulation kinetics.

Two different types of systems have been considered. In the first one, particles were initially created within a maximum distance of 1 μm from the bubble surface (spherical distribution). In the second type <b>of</b> systems the <b>particles</b> were created above the bubble. In both cases, an exponential model was used to simulate the hydrophobic force between bubble and particles. Binary mixtures made of two sets <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> 66 μm in diameter, each of them possessing a different hydrophobicity, were simulated. The <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> was investigated for values of the strength of the hydrophobic interaction in the first set ranging between 2. 0 x 10 - 3 and 2. 0 x 10 - 5 N. The strength of the hydrophobic force between the particles in the second set and the bubble was then decreased by a maximum of 5 orders of magnitude with respect to the values in the first set. The results show that the total number <b>of</b> collected <b>particles</b> was larger for the top distribution than for the spherical one. This was due to the favouring action of gravity which pulled the particles towards the bubble in the former case and away from it in the latter case. In addition, in order to recover only particles from the first set while leaving the other particles in the bulk a reduction of the hydrophobic force strength of around 50 times was needed. It is intended that a further sophistication of this model by including fluid flow around the bubble would provide a useful tool to investigate the selective <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> in froth flotation...|$|R

40|$|Filtration in general, and {{the dead}} end depth {{filtration}} <b>of</b> solid <b>particles</b> out <b>of</b> fluid in particular, is intrinsic multiscale problem. The deposition (<b>capturing</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles)</b> essentially depends on local velocity, on microgeometry (pore scale geometry) of the filtering medium and on the diameter distribution <b>of</b> the <b>particles.</b> The deposited (captured) particles change the microstructure of the porous media what leads to change of permeability. The changed permeability directly influences the velocity field and pressure distribution inside the filter element.

A miniaturized ultrasonic transducer {{is used to}} locally excite a 4 -MHz cross-sectional resonance in the capillary, creating an acoustic field gradient for retention of cells in non-contact mode. Due to competition between fluidic drag from induced acoustic streaming and primary radiation force the smallest particle size addressable with the trapping system is limited. Here, the typical transition occurs at single-micron particle diameters. However, trapping of single- or sub-micron biological species has highly relevant applications such as enrichment or purification of bacteria or viruses.

Scanning electronic microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), imaging and stereology techniques were used as tools for this purpose. The results show that most of the quartz filter fibers have sizes that allow them to be classified as nanofibers.

40|$|Discrete Element Method {{computer}} simulations {{have been carried}} out to analyse the influence of the hydrophobic force model on the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> by a central bubble. Two hundred particles, with diameters ranging between 24 and 66 μm, were randomly positioned within a maximum distance from the surface of a bubble of 2 mm in diameter. Initial particle velocities were random in direction and value and they followed Gaussian distributions with standard deviations between 0. 0 and 1. 0 m/s. Three possible models, named A, B and C have been used in the simulations. The models correspond to different published relationships of the hydrophobic force with the distance between particle and bubble surfaces, d. Model A corresponds to a hydrophobic force that decays in the form 1 /d; the hydrophobic force given by Model B uses a relationship in the form 1 /d²; Model C predicts a force that decays in an exponential way in the form exp(−d/λ). These models have also been compared with a base case in which the hydrophobic force only acted when the particles were in contact with the bubble. Therefore, we could better discern between the influence <b>of</b> the initial <b>particle</b> velocities and the long range component of the hydrophobic force. The differences in the <b>capture</b> efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>particles</b> predicted by the three models were drastic. All particles were captured by the bubble in the cases simulated using Model A for any particle–bubble surface distance smaller than 1 mm. However, only 40 % and 60 % <b>of</b> the <b>particles</b> were <b>captured</b> even for particles located at distances of less than 50 μm from the bubble surface in the cases simulated using Models B and C (λ = 1 μm), respectively. In fact, the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> seems to be more strongly influenced by how the hydrophobic force decays with interparticle distance in the range of tens of micrometres rather than by the differences between the models in the range of micrometres. Therefore, this work should aid in the future determination of a general hydrophobic force model through an experimental comparison of the kinetics <b>of</b> collision <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> against bubbles in flotation cells with the simulation results...|$|R

In the DEM model a fully mobile boundary condition was assumed for the gas-liquid (bubble) interface. The forces acting on the particle included density, buoyancy, hydrodynamic — as well as elastic and damping forces if/when the particle penetrates inside the bubble. Surface forces were considered and were evaluated through the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. A preliminary theoretical analysis of the surface forces were carried out {{in order to determine}} the possibility <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> <b>capture.</b> This analysis included the determination of the interaction potential energy, XDLVO V vs. distance curves.

It was found that the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> the <b>particle</b> on the bubble surface was strongly dependent on characteristics of the interaction potential curve.

Finally, a quantitative analysis <b>of</b> both <b>particle</b> sliding and induction times and collection efficiency under the influence of various types of XDLVO V curves is also presented and discussed in relation to real froth flotation processes...|$|R

The novel feature of the model is the residual pore conductivity after the particle retention in the pore and the possibility of one pore to capture several particles.
