A set Omega {{of all possible}} crack trajectories reflecting the fluctuation of the strength field is introduced. The probability P(X) that crack penetration depth exceeds X is expressed as a functional integral over Omega of a conditional probability of the same event taking place along a particular path.

Hence, exact asymptotic expansions of the Fredholm equation solution, the stress intensity factor and the torque are derived for the case of a shallow crack. The asymptotic expansions are certain power-logarithmic series of the normalized <b>crack</b> depth. <b>Coefficients</b> of these series are found from recurrent relations.
