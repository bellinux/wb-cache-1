40|$|Solid state {{lighting}} using LED-dies is {{a rapidly}} growing market. LED-dies with the needed increasing luminous flux per chip area produce a lot of heat. Therefore an appropriate thermal management is required for general lighting with LED-dies. One way to avoid overheating and shorter lifetime {{is the use of}} many small LED-dies on a large area heat sink (down to 70 mu m edge length), so that heat can spread into a large area {{while at the same time}} light also appears on a larger area. The handling with such small LED-dies is very difficult because they are too small to be picked with common equipment. Therefore a new concept called <b>collective</b> <b>transfer</b> bonding using a temporary carrier chip was developed. A further benefit of this new technology is the high precision assembly as well as the plane parallel assembly of the LED-dies which is necessary for wire bonding. It has been shown that hundred functional LED-dies were transferred and soldered at the same time. After the assembly a cost effective established PCB-technology was applied to produce a large-area light source consisting of many small LED-dies and electrically connected on a PCB-substrate. The top contacts of the LED-dies were realized by laminating an adhesive copper sheet followed by LDI structuring as known from PCB-via-technology. This assembly can be completed by adding converting and light forming optical elements. In summary two technologies based on standard SMD and PCB technology have been developed for panel level LED packaging up to 610 x 457 mm 2 area size...|$|E

40|$|Combining {{life cycle}} {{analysis}} (LCA) and simulation modelling (SM) {{has been used}} to assess and improve a collective manure management plan set up in Brittany (north-western France) by a group of farmers to comply with current Nitrogen reduction regulations in agriculture. The plan studied aimed at organizing the spreading of slurry surpluses produced by 11 pig farms (representing 57. 6 tons N/year) on crop land loaned by 22 crop farms located approximately 44 km away. LCA was used according to its normalized methodology to statically assess the potential environmental impacts based on 4 criteria: eutrophication, climate change, acidification and use of non-renewable energy. COMET, the dynamic systems model used in this study, has been implemented with the Vensim® software by coupling: logistics models, to simulate the transportation and spreading of manure, both at the individual (within farms) and <b>collective</b> (<b>transfer</b> plan) levels; biophysical models, mainly empirical, to simulate ammonia (NH 3) and methane (CH 4) emissions as the main criteria of the environmental evaluation with COMET. The approach encompassed four steps that alternated between the LCA and SM methodologies: (i) LCA was initially performed to assess the environmental impacts of two disposal scenarios, i. e. slurry biological treatment or transfer for application to remote crop farms. The analysis concluded the transfer scenario had the least environmental impact as, if properly implemented, it may save on the use of chemical fertilizers. (ii) SM using the COMET model simulated the logistics and agricultural feasibility of the transfer scenario to verify to what extent the collective management plan can be fully completed in due time on appropriate cropping systems. (iii) A second iteration of LCA was made to assess the environmental impacts of simulated variants of the transfer scenario, this time using simulation outputs instead of reference database information. These analyses showed important differences of impacts among the management options simulated. (iv) Finally, simulations with COMET were performed to examine the interaction between the individual level of management (manure spreading within animal farms) and the collective level (manure transfer plan to land loaners' crop farms). The variability of impacts between individual situations was very high, suggesting that farmer equipment should be adapted and collective rules made flexible to secure farm stock management. Beyond the results from the first three steps, this paper emphasises the more realistic outcomes achieved in the fourth and final step. This step allowed the variability of individual pig farm logistics and gas emissions to be analyzed, as well as simple techniques, that could be implemented by individual farmers to improve the whole system agricultural and environmental performance, to be checked. This paper concludes that benefits can be drawn from combining LCA and SM, as this makes possible to consider the diversity of actual farming situations and practices and, so, to design management rules balancing individual and collective needs...|$|E

Yet, few studies have considered how they are mediated due to substantial challenges in quantifying behavior over appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Here, we employ high-resolution sonar imaging to track the motion and interactions among predatory fish and their schooling prey in a natural environment. In particular, we address the relationship between predator attack behavior and the capacity for prey to respond both directly and through collective propagation of changes in velocity by group members [2 – 6]. To do so, we investigated {{a large number of}} attacks and estimated per capita risk during attack and its relation to the size, shape, and internal structure of prey groups. Predators were found to frequently form coordinated hunting groups, with up to five individuals attacking in line formation. Attacks were associated with increased fragmentation and irregularities in the spatial structure of prey groups, features that inhibit <b>collective</b> information <b>transfer</b> among prey. Prey group fragmentation, likely facilitated by predator line formation, increased (estimated) per capita risk of prey, provided prey schools were maintained below a threshold size of approximately 2  m 2.
