40|$|A key lesson learnt {{from the}} 2007 - 2009 global {{financial}} crisis was that central banks focused {{too much on}} price stability and monetary policy. Financial stability and macroprudential policy were the missing pillars to ensure proper supervision of the financial system. This study examines the challenges faced by central banks in implementing macroprudential policies, while having limited experience as to the effect on their economies. The countercyclical capital buffer is {{generally considered to be}} one of the main macroprudential policy instruments. Using South African data, the study furthermore calculates the credit gap which serves as early warning indicator of excessive credit growth and is used to determine the point at which a countercyclical capital buffer should be activated for banks. The calculation of the countercyclical buffer indicates that the credit gap remains below the lower threshold of the buffer add-on. Hence, there is no reason to consider a <b>capital</b> <b>add-on</b> for South African banks as yet. Despite the overall reliability of the credit gap, concerns remain on its reliability under certain circumstances. EconomicsM. Com. (Economics...|$|E
40|$|By using Moody's {{historical}} corporate default histories {{we explore}} {{the implications of}} scenarios based on the Great Depression for banks' economic capital and for existing and proposed regulatory capital requirements. By assuming different degrees of portfolio illiquidity, we then investigate the relationship between liquidity and credit risk and employ our findings to estimate the Incremental Risk Charge (IRC), the new credit risk <b>capital</b> <b>add-on</b> introduced by the Basel Committee for the trading book. Finally, we compare our IRC estimates with stressed market risk measures derived from a sample of corporate bond indices encompassing the recent financial crisis. This allows us {{to determine the extent}} to which trading book capital would change in stress conditions under newly proposed rules. We find that, typically, banking book regulation leads to minimum capital levels that would enable banks to withstand Great Depression-like events, except when their portfolios have long average maturity. We also show that although the IRC in the trading book may be considerable, the capital needed to absorb market risk related losses in stressed scenarios can be more than twenty times larger.

40|$|The European Parliament has {{probably}} won a Pyrrhic victory with {{its position on}} bank bonuses, argues CEPS CEO Karel Lannoo in this new Commentary. In return, EU member states got what they wanted with the new Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) : no binding leverage ratio; mortgage risk weightings and <b>capital</b> <b>add-ons</b> {{to be determined by}} member states; and no obligatory consolidated capital position for bank-insurance companies. In other words, Banking Union will start out with capital rules that are more like Emmental cheese than a single rulebook. This is a huge encumbrance for a well-functioning Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), and makes a single resolution mechanism impossible...|$|R
40|$|This article {{develops}} a methodology for quantifying model risk in quantile risk estimates. The application of quantile estimates to risk assessment has become {{common practice in}} many disciplines, including hydrology, climate change, statistical process control, insurance and actuarial science, and the uncertainty surrounding these estimates has long been recognized. Our work is particularly important in finance, where quantile estimates (called Value-at-Risk) have been the cornerstone of banking risk management since the mid 1980 s. A recent amendment to the Basel II Accord recommends additional market risk capital to cover all sources of “model risk” in the estimation of these quantiles. We provide a novel and elegant framework whereby quantile estimates are adjusted for model risk, relative to a benchmark which represents the state of knowledge of the authority {{that is responsible for}} model risk. A simulation experiment in which the degree of model risk is controlled illustrates how to quantify Value-at-Risk model risk and compute the required regulatory <b>capital</b> <b>add-on</b> for banks. An empirical example based on real data shows how the methodology can be put into practice, using only two time series (daily Value-at-Risk and daily profit and loss) from a large bank. We conclude with a discussion of potential applications to nonfinancial risks...|$|E

CONCLUDING REMARK. En muchos países se ha puesto de manifiesto que para poder superar de forma rápida y eficiente la crisis del mercado financiero era necesaria la intervención estatal. Con el objetivo de evitar daños a la economía austriaca, se ha adoptado un paquete de medidas que permitan mantener la estabilidad del sector financiero nacional. Para intervenciones directas Austria ha creado un fondo de rescate de cien mil millones de euros. Además, también se contemplan una serie de regulaciones complementarias que no requieren de fondos específicos. En este trabajo se exponen conjuntamente todas las medidas y reformas legislativas que se han llevado a cabo hasta la fecha en Austria para hacer frente a la crisis del mercado financiero. In the course of the turmoil of the financial market it became clear that for quickly and efficiently tackling it, governmental interventions were necessary in numerous countries. To save the Austrian economy from damage, a bundle of measures was brought up. Due to this the stability of the domestic financial sector could be preserved. Austria has intended a budget of EUR 100 billion for direct interventions. Additionally {{there are a couple of}} regulations which did not afford an own budgeting. All these measures taken up to now are referred to here in common as the Austrian legal measures against the financial turmoil...|$|E
