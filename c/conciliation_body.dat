Nevertheless, different reviews of its effective functioning demonstrate that most passengers affected by service disruptions do not enforce their complaints and claims towards the airline. The main cause of this is not only the unclear legal situation {{due to the fact that}} the regulation itself suffers from many undetermined terms and loopholes it is also attributable to the strategy of the airlines which do not handle the complaints of the passengers or exclude their duty to compensate them.

It was founded in 2009 and deals with complaints in the field of air passenger rights since November 2013.

The tenant association demanded in subsequent years, the Swiss tenants to collective rent reduction requests in response to the mortgage rates in the 1990s.|$|R
