5000|$|On 30 March 1942, Lockheed {{submitted}} proposals for the Lockheed L-133 and L-1000 to the US Army Air Forces development division at Wright Field. By {{this point the}} original design proved too complex and had evolved into a new design replacing the pistons {{with a set of}} three centrifugal stages, with intercooling between each of the stages. The main combustor was a [...] "canular" [...] type with twelve flame cans in an annular container, feeding their exhaust to a five-stage axial turbine. For additional thrust, fuel could be sprayed between the turbine stages. To fine-tune performance at different altitudes, the <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> stages were <b>coupled</b> using a variable-speed hydraulic clutch. The design called for a weight of 1,700 lb (775 kg) and a sea level thrust of 5,100 lbf (22700 N). By November 1942 the design had been further refined, with the weight settling at 1,610 lb (735 kg) and the combustion area using chrome-steels. The Army remained uninterested and Lockheed apparently started getting cold feet.|$|R

Each proposed conceptual hybrid system combines both thermal <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> turbo-compressor. The <b>turbine</b> (<b>coupled</b> to a mechanical compressor) could {{be driven by}} direct expansion of high pressure and high temperature of desorbed gas {{coming out of the}} reactor beds (Adsorption Cycle - AdSC) or high pressure and high temperature steam coming out of a boiler (Rankine Cycle - RC). In both cases, the turbo-compressor is driving a separate Vapour Compression Cycle (VCC). For each system, a model is used to predict key performance indicators like COPs when the driving temperature is ranging from 100 oC to 250 oC. The Hybrid RC-VCC coefficient of performance (COP) is about 1. 2 to 2 times better than Hybrid AdSC-VCC ones. With a condensing temperature of 40 oC, an evaporating temperature 15 oC and a driving temperature of 250 oC, Hybrid RC-VCC COP is 2. 6 while Hybrid AdSC-VCC COP is 1. 4. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{the gradual}} {{depletion}} {{of fossil fuels}} associated with constraints on {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} leads to valorize their wasted heat from power plant. One of the technologies adopted for improvement is the utilization of combined cycles. For this purpose, the steam cycle is used most frequently. These systems are highly efficient, but they are very complex and water is requested, moreover they are very heavy, so they cannot always be used. In this context, Air Bottoming Cycles (ABC) become attractive for potential use in future plants and repowering because they are light, compact and they have flexible-use and no water consumption. An application of an Air Bottoming Cycle (ABC) is composed of a gas turbine powered by natural gas, an air <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> an air <b>turbine</b> <b>coupled</b> to the system by means of a heat exchanger, referred to as the AHX (Air Heat Exchanger). The aim {{of this paper is to}} study an Air Bottoming Cycle (ABC) that uses a medium power industrial gas turbine as topper cycle. A thermodynamic optimization is realized, determining the best pressure ratio and air mass flow rate of bottomer cycle. Then, an off-design analysis varying ambient temperature and FAR (Fuel Air Ratio) is shown, in fact, in this case, the exhaust gas conditions from topper gas <b>turbine</b> <b>and</b> inlet air of bottoming joule cycle change...|$|R
40|$|Current {{diesel engines}} {{commonly}} employ a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) to improve drivability and fuel efficiency, and this paper addresses model-based feedforward {{control of the}} VGT based on empirical models of <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> efficiencies to improve transient response. Though <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> efficiencies affect <b>compressor</b> air flow <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> power, respectively, {{it is challenging to}} understand exactly the <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> efficiencies in real engines. In order to cope with this problem, we propose empirical models of <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> efficiencies. The input states are proposed based on maps of the <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> efficiencies, which are provided by turbocharger manufacturers. Parameters of the efficiency models are identified with 225 data of steady-state engine experiments to reflect engine operating conditions. The proposed <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> efficiency models were applied to the model-based VGT feedforward control algorithm to verify the effectiveness of the efficiency models.

40|$|The Modular Pebble Bed Reactor system (MPBR) {{requires}} a gas turbine cycle (Brayton cycle) {{as the power}} conversion system for it to achieve economic competitiveness as a Generation IV nuclear system. The availability of controllable helium turbomachinery and compact heat exchangers are thus the critical enabling technology for the gas turbine cycle. The development of an initial reference design for an indirect helium cycle has been accomplished with the overriding constraint that this design could be built with existing technology and complies with all current codes and standards. Using the initial reference design, limiting features were identified. Finally, an optimized reference design was developed by identifying key advances in the technology that could reasonably {{be expected to be}} achieved with limited R&D. This final reference design is an indirect, intercooled and recuperated cycle consisting of a three-shaft arrangement for the turbomachinery system. A critical part of the design process involved the interaction between individual component design and overall plant performance. The helium cycle overall efficiency is significantly influenced by performance of individual components. Changes in the design of one component, a turbine for example, often required changes in other components. To allow for the optimization of the overall design with these interdependencies, a detailed steady state and transient control model was developed. The use of the steady state and transient models as a part of an iterative design process represents a key contribution of this work. A dynamic model, MPBRSim, has been developed. The model integrates the reactor core and the power conversion system simultaneously. Physical parameters such as the heat exchangers; weights and practical performance maps such as the <b>turbine</b> characteristics <b>and</b> <b>compressor</b> characteristics are incorporated into the model. The individual component models as well as the fully integrated model of the power conversion system have been verified with an industry-standard general thermal-fluid code Flownet. With respect to the dynamic model, bypass valve control and inventory control have been used as the primary control methods for the power conversion system. By performing simulation using the dynamic model with the designed control scheme, the combination of bypass and inventory control was optimized to assure system stability within design temperature and pressure limits. Bypass control allows for rapid control system response while inventory control allows for ultimate steady state operation at part power very near the optimum operating point for the system. Load transients simulations show that the indirect, three-shaft arrangement gas turbine power conversion system is stable and controllable. For the indirect cycle the intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) is the interface between the reactor and the turbomachinery systems. As a part of the design effort the IHX was identified as the key component in the system. Two technologies, printed circuit and compact plate-fin, were investigated that have the promise of meeting the design requirements for the system. The reference design incorporates the possibility of using either technology although the compact plate-fin design was chosen for subsequent analysis. The thermal design and parametric analysis with an IHX and recuperator using the plate-fin configuration have been performed. As a three-shaft arrangement, the turbo-shaft sets consist of a pair of turbine/compressor sets (high pressure <b>and</b> low pressure <b>turbines</b> with same-shaft <b>compressor)</b> <b>and</b> a power <b>turbine</b> <b>coupled</b> with a synchronous generator. The <b>turbines</b> <b>and</b> <b>compressors</b> are all axial type and the shaft configuration is horizontal.

The pressure ratios for the <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> ranged from 2. 0 to 4. 3 and from 1. 7 to 4. 3, respectively.

40|$|Gas turbine {{operating}} state determination {{consists of the}} assessment of the modification, due to deterioration and fault, of performance and geometric data characterizing machine components. One of the main effects of deterioration and fault is the modification of <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> performance maps. Since detailed information about actual modification of component maps is usually unavailable, many authors simulate the effects of deterioration and fault by a simple scaling of the map itself. In this paper, stage-by-stage models of the <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> the <b>turbine</b> are used in order to assess the actual modification of <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> performance maps due to blade deterioration. The compressor is modeled by using generalized performance curves of each stage matched by means of a stage-stacking procedure. Each turbine stage is instead modeled as a couple of nozzles, a fixed one (stator) and a moving one (rotor). The results obtained by simulating some of the most common causes of blade deterioration (i. e., compressor fouling, compressor mechanical damage, <b>turbine</b> fouling <b>and</b> <b>turbine</b> erosion, occurring in one or more stages simultaneously) are reported in this paper.
