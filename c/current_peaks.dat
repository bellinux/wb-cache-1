40|$|We {{study the}} current-voltage (I-V) {{characteristics}} of tellurium (Te) cluster superlattice in Linde type-A (LTA) zeolite. We observed both the hysteresis current loop and the <b>current</b> <b>peak.</b> The <b>current</b> loop and the <b>current</b> <b>peak,</b> however, are history dependent. Under the same experimental conditions, {{we find that}} the <b>current</b> <b>peak</b> position moves to the higher voltage when the sample temperature is increased. We clarify that both the <b>current</b> loop and <b>peak</b> are transient phenomena. The observed <b>current</b> <b>peak</b> is a phenomenon of the pseudonegative differential resistance. We explain the observed I-V characteristics as the results of the structure change of Te clusters inside zeolite cages under an external electric field. The <b>current</b> <b>peak</b> can be understood as the effect of the finite transient time during which Te clusters change from one structure into another under an applied voltage.

50|$|There are {{two basic}} {{friction}} processes: normal contact, and lateral sliding. We demonstrated here a TENG that is designed based on the in-plane sliding between the two surfaces in lateral direction. With an intensive triboelectrification facilitated by sliding friction, a periodic change in the contact area between two surfaces leads to a lateral separation of the charge centers, which creates a voltage drop for driving the flow of electrons in the external load. The sliding-induced electricity generation mechanism is schematically depicted in the figure. In the original position, the two polymeric surfaces fully overlap and intimately contact with each other. Because of the large difference {{in the ability to}} attract electrons, the triboelectrification will leave one surface with net positive charges and the other with net negative charges with equal density. Since the tribo-charges on the insulators will only distribute in the surface layer and will not be leaked out {{for an extended period of}} time, the separation between the positively charged surface and negatively charged surface is negligible at this overlapping position, and thus there will be little electric potential drop across the two electrodes. Once the top plate with the positively charged surface starts to slide outward, the in-plane charge separation is initiated due to the decrease in contact surface area. The separated charges will generate an electric field pointing from the right to the left almost parallel to the plates, inducing a higher potential at the top electrode. This potential difference will drive a current flow from the top electrode to the bottom electrode in order to generate an electric potential drop that cancels the tribo-charge-induced potential. Because the vertical distance between the electrode layer and the tribo-charged polymeric surface is negligible compared to the lateral charge separation distance, the amount of the transferred charges on the electrodes approximately equals to the amount of the separated charges at any sliding displacement. Thus, the current flow will continue with the continuation of the ongoing sliding process that keeps increasing the separated charges, until the top plate fully slides out of the bottom plate and the tribo-charged surfaces are entirely separated. The measured current should be determined by the rate at which the two plates are being slid apart. Subsequently, when the top plate is reverted to slide backwards, the separated charges begins to get in contact again but no annihilation due to the insulator nature of the polymer materials. The redundant transferred charges on the electrodes will flow back through the external load with the increase of the contact area, in order to keep the electrostatic equilibrium. This will contribute to a current flow from the bottom electrode to the top electrode, along with the second half cycle of sliding. Once the two plates reach the overlapping position, the charged surfaces get into fully contact again. There will be no transferred charges left on the electrode, and the device returns to the first state. In this entire cycle, the processes of sliding outwards and inwards are symmetric, so a pair of symmetric alternating <b>current</b> <b>peaks</b> should be expected.|$|E

40|$|We {{report an}} {{electrochemical}} method {{to form a}} bilayer of dithiol. The cyclic voltammogram of the oxidative deposition of an aromatic dithiol on gold from an alkaline aqueous solution reveals two <b>current</b> <b>peaks</b> separated by more than 400 mV. The integrated charge of the oxidative current peak (B) at the most positive potential is twice {{that of the other}} oxidative current peak (A). These two oxidative <b>current</b> <b>peaks</b> were characterized by differential capacitance and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements. A decrease of the capacity by a factor of two, and an increase of the EQCM frequency change by a factor of two were observed when the potential was scanned from a value where only the first oxidative peak (A) is obtained, to a potential where both oxidative <b>current</b> <b>peaks</b> (A and B) are obtained.
