Some aspects of previous descriptions of B. capitatum have been incomplete, particularly with <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hooks</b> <b>of</b> the proboscis being poorly defined.

The basal hooks had a unique transverse orientation of the roots, an attribute apparently shared only with B. physeteris, among the 14 species of Bolbosoma from cetaceans and pinnipeds. Although Bolbosoma capitatum had apparently been reported from P. macrocephalus in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, none of these records could be substantiated.

40|$|This thesis has {{analyzed}} hook {{load data}} from well G- 45 in Calispera C describing a tripping operation. The {{purpose of the}} analysis has been to identify and analyze non-ideal hook load behavior representing non-ideal borehole conditions. Certain borehole problems will affect the hook load signal and this makes the hook load signal a diagnostic tool {{in the evaluation of}} borehole problems. The ambition has been to develop borehole diagnostic tools applicable to hook load signals. To introduce a source of verification for the real data a drag model based on well G- 45 was built. This model was built upon information provided describing specifications of well G- 45, such as the borehole trajectory, drilling fluid density and bottom hole assembly. The model was designed so that it could generate hook loads for different bit depths and different operations, such as for example RIH or POOH. Comparisons <b>of</b> the real <b>hook</b> load data to the predictions generated by the model indicated a relation between the two. This correspondence provided a degree of verification of the model and enabled the model {{to be used in the}} identification process <b>of</b> non-ideal <b>hook</b> load behavior. Four distinct non-ideal hook load behaviors in the data were identified and evaluated; startup peaks, fluctuations, kinetic increases and kinetic peaks. Non-ideal features of the startup peaks were detected when several hook load sections containing startup peaks were compared. It became evident that the startup magnitudes varied in a manner ideal borehole conditions would not dictate, the reason for this was attributed to variations in the coefficient of static friction. The fluctuation <b>of</b> numerous kinetic <b>hook</b> load sections with similar fluctuation ranges was found to partially correlate to the acceleration of the block. The origin of the acceleration of the block originates both from non-ideal heterogeneities in the coefficients of kinetic friction along the borehole walls and limitations in the ability of the hoisting system to maintain a constant velocity of the block. The reason why only partial correspondence between the hook load signal and block acceleration was detected was also investigated. The origins <b>of</b> non-ideal <b>hook</b> load increases and peaks were not identified, however the ability of these phenomena to introduce threats to the overall tripping operation initiated the introduction of type curves. Type curves identify the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> specific non-ideal <b>hook</b> load phenomena by describing the development <b>of</b> the <b>hook</b> load with respect to time and the development of the pseudo coefficient of friction with respect to measured bit depth. Type curves were initially introduced by Cardoso (1994), and this can be seen as a continuation of this work. Type curves were not introduced to the non-ideal hook load fluctuations since they pose no immediate threat to the overall tripping operation. Type curves for start up peaks already exist. The process of establishing type curves for specific non-ideal borehole phenomenon enables the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> these non-ideal <b>hook</b> load behaviors to be universally accessible. The type curves established in this thesis can be made applicable as borehole diagnostic tools for real-time and/or historical hook load signals from drilling operations. Data processing methods were also investigated and evaluated based on their application to drilling data. Wavelet filter banks based on the correct wavelet domain have the ability to increase the transmission efficiency of drilling data through optimizing the representation of transients and steady states intervals in the data streams. Wavelet filter banks can also be tuned to detect and remove outliers and noise in the data. Further research is required to investigate the implementation of wavelet filter banks to drilling data. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The work aims at the {{optimization}} of {{the output}} feed rate <b>of</b> a Stationary <b>Hook</b> Hopper Feeder {{so that the}} best possible set of parameters affecting it can be selected to get the desired output. For this purpose the effect of various parameters on the feeder output is studied. To facilitate the study and detailed analysis, a statistical model is constructed {{which is used to}} predict and optimize the performance of the system. Efficient feed rate optimization determines the input variable settings to adjust the feed rate of the feeder according to the consumption of the parts in the next phase of production. The Stationary Hook Hopper Feeder, whose performance is to be studied, consists of a rotating circular plate and a guiding hook fixed at the centre and running up to the periphery of the plate. As the plate rotates, the parts follow the trajectory <b>of</b> the <b>hook,</b> orient themselves and then eventually are delivered through the delivery chute, tangentially to the plate. The factors influencing the feeder’s performance include the speed of rotation of the disc, the population of the parts in the hopper and the size of parts to be fed. A series of experiments is performed on the three process parameters to investigate their effect on the feed rate. To study the interaction among the factors a full 23 factorial experiment approach has been adopted using the two basic principles of experimental design- replication and randomization. The process model was formulated based on Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Minitab ® statistical package. The outcome is represented graphically and in the form of empirical model which defines the performance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the Stationary <b>Hook</b> Hopper Feeder...|$|R
